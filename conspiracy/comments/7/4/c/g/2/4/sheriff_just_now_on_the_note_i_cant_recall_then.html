       Don't know the guys name but was just watching the live broadcast. Those are both real quotes, thought I'd share that.

       <strong>
        EDIT 1:
       </strong>
       I've honestly been on the side of "this isn't any kind of conspiracy" over this event. But hearing him say that made me gasp. It does seem sketchy that he would claim to not know/remember about it, but after being asked if it was a suicide note he's able to confirm that it's not one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT 2:
       </strong>
       His name is Sheriff Joe Lombardo, thank you

       <strong>
        EDIT 3:
       </strong>
       I was seriously considering not posting this, but now I'm glad I did. Thanks for the support everyone, good to know I'm not the only one who found it suspicious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if anyone has a video clip of the 10 or so seconds where he says this stuff, it would be amazing if you could link us to it, I'd gladly put it in the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        EDIT 4:
       </strong>
       I noticed the post was 99% upvoted and decided to document this over time and see how it's changing. I suppose all of these images could be doctored/faked but maybe at least those who trust me will find any change in dynamic interesting.

       Chances are it's one of the most important pieces of evidence on scene. He left the tape on it so it didn't blow away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever it is, it's widely talked about and the Sheriff should have expected the question, raising the question why ask "what note?"

       The simplest explanation is the notepad is such nothing that it's not for most on his mind.  If your expecting them to release every scrap it may be a while.

       To play devil's advocate, if you were unaware of any note, and someone asked you about a note, wouldn't you say "what note?" and then you'd realize what they meant, clarify what it was, and say you don't know?

       He said "yellow paper", which indicates he was aware of its existence.  He would know whether it was or was not a note. unless he was kept in the dark. Which could be likely based on his appearance.  But I think that was caused by sleep deprivation and the gravity of the situation.

       It's good that there are reporters asking these questions though. I know people think that the MSM are 'in on it' but I genuinely think most journalists are not in on anything and just don't do investigative journalism anymore and are trained more to report official statements rather than question or investigate them. So hopefully the fact reporters are asking these questions means some of them are getting it, that their job involves finding out what actually happened on behalf of the public, and not just parroting at the public on the behalf of the authorities.

       Oh sure. I mean there is a lot more reporting going on than just the Q&amp;A, at one point the sheriff makes a joke about how it was amazing he knew the one reporters name and he jokes and is like "ya we had lunch and I found out she is from Australia"... That's the perspective I think most conspiracy people lack, everyone in that room is a real person with human limitations and agendas. It is not some Monolythic "Main Stream Media"... Sometimes human-ness seeps into a human drama, it does not mean the curtain is being pulled back and you are seeing some deep truth... It means you need to get out more.

       Agreed and it's weird that we're in this place playing telephone through the press more or less.  One of the authorities who spoke after the Sheriff and FBI Agent berated the press for asking the same speculative question repeatedly.  There are legitimate investigative questions to answer about the worst shooting in American History™ and it's unfortunate social media, aka the hivemind, isn't more valued publicly at this point in the investigation, especially when the entire press-conference kicks off with a public plea to upload photos/video to FBI.

       As others have said, could be a menu, or a listing of TV channels, or a recipt, or any of a million things that are in hotel rooms. There is no real implication at this point that it is important except pure overblown speculation.

       Do people not understand that even if it was a note, they shouldn't fucking release it to the public if it could be detrimental to the case?? We're not as entitled as we think when there is serious shit on the line. If they can't say shit about any note, or any evidence because it could hinder the investigation, then why on Earth would they release it to the public?? D

       Seriously. What if it said "fuck antifa" or "fuck trump"? It would be detrimental to release that to the public so people could politicize a crazy person's views. It could inspire others to do terrible things to get their political views to the public.

       Maybe, maybe not. That’s not really the point. Saying that ppl only care about vindicating their own political views is just wrong. Some ppl dont give a shit about politics, they still have an interest in knowing what really happened. Especially the families of the victims.

       Well I don't believe that he will ever be satisfied because that's the nature of conspiracy theories. Even if they did tell us the truth we would never accept it and keep demanding another answer until it fits whatever predetermined conclusion all the individuals here have made. In this case the government always lies, therefore no matter what they tell us it's a lie. So even if they told the truth it wouldn't matter because if people feel like it's a lie then that's what it is. It's a fun cycle.

       That's the joy of conspiracy, it doesn't matter what it says. Anything is possible when you have disbelief on your side. It could be the passcode to the back door of Area 51 or a penis doodle or the note itself could be a planted distraction. What it the real message was in the roll of tape on top of the paper and it was neatly unraveled and the truth was hidden in the layers of tape then carefully re-rolled. I demand to know the truth and I won't be satisfied until I personally dissect a crime scene by myself after it has been hermetically sealed so no one has access until me and my team of reddit sleuths can find the truth. They should encase it in plastic and seal it tight, maybe using some sort of tape. Oh fuck...the tape was in on it he whole time.

       I'm going with he has an extremely detailed plan, and this detail would have definitely been in it. They say he very much planned to escape, so trying to blow up the fuel tanks and leaving in the chaos sounds good on paper.

       In retrospect, those rounds at that distance would not have had the inertia to ignite jet fuel.  Even a 7.62 round would have lost enough velocity by that point to fail to ignite.

       Yes, it is a long shot, and yes, the rounds obviously reached that far and were capable of killing humans.

       More guns = less reloading, and more options if something jams. The guy was rich, he could afford all the guns he wanted. I'm surprised he stopped at 15.

       Honestly, what worries me - and I'm kinda worried putting this out there, there are hotel rooms at the Disneyland Hotel that look right over Downtown Disney. There are hotel rooms at the Grand Californian that look right into California Adventure Park. (The hotel has its own entrance into the theme park). As a former disney employee... it really frightens me to think of what could happen in those hotel rooms.

       Makes me feel sick too and it's because I am starting to believe (or getting the feeling) that this attack on Sunday was supposed to be ISIS' (offshoot of the CIA, I believe) first attack against Americans on American soil, but the fuel tanks didn't blow up, so in essence, it was considered foiled in the mind of ISIS. Then the next day in Tennessee a guy is pulled over and arrested with an arsenal of guns and ammo in his car. Some of the guns have devices on them that make the gun into an automatic. Who is that guy? Jesus. It's a 25-26 drive from Las Vegas to Tennessee, but maybe someone had bought the guns from Paddock earlier on Sunday and they were transported to the guy who ends up arrested in Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p>
       A guy a few years ago in Texas sold his company truck at auction and the next thing he knows (a few months later) he sees his truck in a picture with ISIS members in it overseas! It appears ISIS members are coming here to buy guns, ammo, and vehicles and are shipping them overseas. I bet Paddock never was a shooter on Sunday. He was selling guns on the black market for extra money and didn't realize he was dealing with ISIS members. They used his room to attack Americans and then killed him before they escaped. I bet more attacks are coming by ISIS and they're going to be big.

       The problem is almost all major news sources are talking as if it's an open and shut case, all over the world. Making people think that it's not gonna change like every single other time, and people are tired of being kept it the dark and lied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are pessimistic and are seeing signs of the case being 100% solved. News are treating it as fact instead of saying the investigation is still on-going. We don't want this shit to be like it always is, a bunch of weird lies and omissions and never getting proper answers.
      </p>
      <p>
       News a few hours after incident: "This is how it went and this is who did it"
      </p>
      <p>
       People: "Seems fucking fishy, don't pull this same shit again"

       One theory that has stuck with me...Paddock had ties to the FBI and was in Vegas for some illegal arms dealing which went South (possibly ISIS?) 
If this theory is true, the Vegas LE know but the FBI doesn't want this info getting out...could explain the sheriff's press actions 🤷🏻‍♀️

       While it would be fascinating to believe that ISIS had something to do with this, I highly doubt our FBI would have allowed something like this to go down.  Typically, when the FBI does stings like this, they either use fake ammo, bomb supplies, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, the theory has been floated about him being a "patsy".  But again, we're saying that the FBI/Deep State/whoever wanted to off their "rogue agent" and tried to cover it up by allowing a mass murder spree like this to unfold?  I'm just not buying it.

       Well, first of all, he knows nothing, just what he's being told. They do this on purpose so he doesn't accidentally say too much.

       But, if he knows there was no suicide note, and then he's asked about a specific piece of paper, he can say "it's not a suicide note" but still not know what it was.

       Yeah, I really wish someone would explain to me how or why an arms deal gone bad resulted in what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the deal went bad, the actual perpetrators killed Paddock right then and there, and then said, "Okay, there's a Jason Aldean concert going on outside. Let's open fire on it."
      </p>

       This is exactly what I got out that questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was asked: "In the leaked photos, there was a yellow...what appears to be, a yellow note. Can you tell us anything about that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       At that point he's trying to recall what exactly is in the leaked photos. Also to note the paper appears (to me) to be pink/purple, not yellow.
      </p>
      <p>
       He "can't recall."
      </p>

      <p>

       He's dropping bread crumbs. The sheriff knows more than he's allowed to say, but we're picking up on the clues he's dropping. This and the comments about when he purchased the firearms in 2016 and how many.

       It's 40 minutes of nothing burger, with the exception of one tired sheriff being restricted on what he want to say, by a FBI officer that got testy and may have just committed career suicide.  Very little substance, and pleas to give us "5 days" to tell us the number of bright shiny objects (casings) they recovered.

       I think the FBI agent was sketchy too. "This our community. It's our community too". Pretty odd opening statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the sheriff's "answers" regarding the security guard were the sketchiest though: "he happened upon that doorway because it was ajar"? Why would the door be open and why is he alone?

       That one might be normal. I used to work alongside cops, and one fella got in a pistol fight one night while I had a police radio. Neighter of them got hit by a bullet. We later found out over 200 shots were fired and they hit everything but each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nerves, low experience, bump stock gun, coupled with shooting through a door and it's not too hard to imagine just one hit. Thankfully just in the leg.

       The gun goes off, the guard jumps out of the way, or falls on the ground. The shooter dumps two 100 round mags through the door. It's just that simple.

       With all the 100rd mags I saw on the floor in the pic. With the bump stock I saw on the AR on the floor. Knowing the bump stock is a pray and spray proposition. Yes, this part of the story is pretty simple.

       i bet the shot went through the wall/door as a result of blind fire. also the odds of any one shot hitting any part of the guys body are very low, especially since they likely couldnt see each other

       I mean I doubt the guard just stood still while he shot all 200 rounds. He probably ducked into the recession outside of most doors and got low.

       Seeing as he was shot in the leg, low prolly wasn't the best place to avoid fire. And I doubt there's any blood splatter in the hallway because the bullet is still in his leg, so all we have is the "official story, which is not much, and speculation.

       If the shot came at an upward trajectory he might have gotten prone because the shooter was prone and shooting up or maybe he got prone because the shooter was just praying and spraying through the door. Some aspects of this there's dozens of possibilities for, and when you add them all it this whole thing stinksm

       Granted these guys weren't top of the crop. They were in security roles with the only thing differentiating from mall cops was they were actual police officers. Old guys, fat guys, a preacher/cop. Second rate, plus I used the same guns they used and they were poorly kept. It rained a lot, so lots of rust after a rainy shift. Had one jam on me during training.

       Nope we just used their guns. They had people at the armory that cleaned and maintained them. The police and our group would just arm up at shift start and arm down at shift end. Instead of being cryptic, it was simply security for a DoD installation. I wasn't police but my group helped out since we were undermanned. Same job but they could arrest while we couldn't. Got to use their guns though.

       It definitely happens, but this guy was using rifles at extremely close range. Rifle rounds penetrate way more than pistol rounds and keep going. Maybe the sheriff is hinting at something.

       There's a difference between hitting a moving single target behind a door you can't see through and spraying into a 22,000 crowd from elevation.  Mainly the target is huge and you don't need to aim. I'm guessing he did just that, not aim and just spray fire down the hallway.

       No during the briefing the sheriff says that the security guard found the correct room because he noticed a door was ajar, and he thought it was odd, implying that the door was ajar before Paddock started shooting at him.

       On the police scanner audio, an officer is on the 31st floor stairwell asking dispatch to get a maintenance guy to him with an elevator key. Then he says to let him know who is coming because he doesn't want a 'blue on blue' problem, meaning, an officer shooting an officer. I THINK THE POLICE SHOT THE MAINTENANCE/SECURITY OFFICER. There are NOT 200 bullet holes in the door to that room. It appears the SWAT team shot their way into the room though.

       I find it odd that door would be ajar while he committed mass murder. Just seems like something you would make sure was closed. Plus, don't high end hotel doors usually close by themselves. I mean, he could have had a funky door, I guess.

       There is that theory floating around. Someone reported having seen security guards seemingly chasing after another security guard. But I wonder why it would be seen like that and not one security guard leading the others.

       The initial scanner recordings covered this as well.  It is really hard to say.  Security doing security things or the perfect cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd imagine there are cameras in most hallways there and I'd doubt the guard that took a bullet to the leg is self inflicted. I'm sure there has to be interesting interactions the shooter had, him talking to anyone for any benign reason would be of interest to them.

       Although it would explain why the cab driver's video has it sounding like the gun fire came from further away and was muffled one time (wasn't an echo either, the echo had already happened earlier after the louder burst of shots and had a different rate of fire). Maybe that was the exact moment he took shots away from the window.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(Extremely loud and close) BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM (few seconds later it echoes back)... a minute or two goes by... (more muffled shots with different rate) BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM (a few more minutes go by - then extremely loud again) BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM"

       Door is open but SWAT had to blow it up to get in. I'm pretty sure close the door would be high on the mass murder plan checklist. Also, don't almost all hotel doors have automatic closers on them?

       As someone who goes to casinos a decent amount I've never seen a security guard wandering the hallways of the hotels. they are usually just down by the elevators and you have to show your room key to the security guard before getting on the elevator.
      </p>
      <p>
       i thought the security guard thing was weird - how did he know to go up there? i thought maybe he had a walkie talkie that someone said "go up to room XYZ right now", that would maybe make sense. but to just "happen upon the doorway" is odd.

       And how many Las Vegas Casino's have you stayed in long enough to see all that goes on in the hallways?  Last couple times I've been in Vegas I've been in the hallway to my room about .001% of the time I've been there.  Not exactly long enough for me to form an opinion of exactly who walks down it on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the point the other guy was making was that security practices vary depending on the hotel.  Have you stayed at Mandalay Bay long enough to watch their halls for extended periods?

       It has been reported that the security guard made contact with the shooter roughly 10 minutes after the shots began.  Upon realizing the security guard's presence, he unloaded the 200 rounds through the door.  After that barage, the shooting stopped.  It is believed to be at that point the shooter offed himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure the security guard followed the sounds of gunfire, plus reports coming in on the location, he was the first to be able to get up there and check it out.  I'm sure his initial reaction was "Alright!  Something besides shoveling some drunk back in his room..."

       Wait... casinos are noisy as hell. if the security guard was downstairs in the casino he would not have heard shots fired from an individual hotel room on the, what was it, 32nd floor??? this is just my opinion of course. That was my point - a security guard would only go up to the hotel room floors for a REASON, and it would have to be a reason communicated to him because i don't think a security guard on the casino floor would hear anything from up above.
      </p>
      <p>
       not only is it noisy in the casino with slot machines, people talking, etc, etc but most casinos involve a seriously long walk to get to your hotel room. this goes for vegas as well as small casinos like in atlantic city. it's always a pain walking to/from rooms because it's such a far walk and sometimes you walk through restaurants and what not.

       I dont believe he was the one that pinpointed the exact location on his own, but these security guards have earpieces and I would imagine there would be lots of chatter, and continued development on an exact location as he made his way up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listening to the police scanner, you can hear them start narrowing it down to Mandalay Bay withing minutes of the initial shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once he got closer though, I would also imagine shots could be heard which also helped him narrow down the location.

       see my response above to another poster - i find it hard to believe a security guard on the ground floor heard that from a high floor with all the noise a casino makes as well as the distance between the casino floor and the individual hotel room.

       It should be noted that neighbors saw Danley apparently moving out of Paddock's home, "stuffing her car with all her belongings"
       <em>
        two-weeks ago
       </em>
       (
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4949402/Stephen-Paddock-huge-gun-room-says-friend.html">
        source article
       </a>
       ). So the real question is why would somebody who just moved out of their significant other's house not think they were breaking up until she received $100k while out of the country?
      </p>
      <p>
       *Side note in regards to the source article I posted: Remember when Paddock's brother claimed the shooter "wasn't a gun guy at all"? Strange that his brother knew nothing about his gun room or any of the big safes he had in plain view in the garages of his homes.

       Isn't being "in custody" a legal term? So she might be co-operating with the FBI, answering questions, even staying with them... but as long as it's of her own free will then she is not technically "in custody" ...?

       Well. The fact that absolutely NOTHING, ZERO, NADDA, ZILCH has been released the support the idea that this was anything except for a single deranged madman with money hellbent on killing people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence supporting it not being some bullshit undercover deal is the fact that they now report he had rented rooms overlooking other musical events in recent months in Chicago.
      </p>

       So no.  You're wrong.  Until something actually comes out to support your BS theory maybe just stick to facts.

      <p>
       There is a difference between speculating and doing what you're doing.  Speculating would be "I wonder if his motive was that he really hated Jason Aldeen?  I wonder if he wanted to emotionally scare Jason Aldeen for life?"
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are doing is creating BS narratives not rooted in any facts.  The whole
       <em>
        undercover deal
       </em>
       has absolutely zero tangible facts to support it beyond far right wing assholes floating the idea that it was a deal where ISIS was trying to buy weapons and it was an FBI sting or some stupid bullshit.  So to even continue floating the idea that is was an undercover operation is to ignore the fact that the initial claim was BS to begin with.  So then you said "I could be wrong" in reference to it.  I simply said "You are."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you asked for evidence why it was NOT an undercover deal and I provided some, told you your theory was BS and you should stick to facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you fly off the rail because I provided you with the facts you asked for.  Told you why your theory was bullshit and said you should rely on facts rather than weak ass theories based on nothing.

        </strong>
        but that is because you are nothing more than a shill trying to push the official narrative, which you clearly believe is right, even though NO ONE FUCKING KNOWS.

       I never accused you of anything.  I affirmed something that YOU said was a possibility.  Big difference.  But language is hard so I will forgive you.

       I agree with you, I remember seeing something SOMEWHERE about this. I think I was at the gym. I'm confused though....

       When this happened in LV, I was abroad in Belgium at the time. So I was JUST waking up to this as it was breaking.

      <p>
       A young girl said that said woman was running around warning everyone she was going to die, but fled...?? By time they found her she was out of the country????... how could she get out of the country so quickly. And why would the first thing they do is return her to the US and then let her go? Her involvement seems sketchy to me.

       The 21 year old girl that reported the Hispanic woman saying “you’re all going to die” was not Marilou Danley. She was already out of the country when the shooting took place to my knowledge. That was a different woman.

       He had cameras set up, and I think I recall reading he may have been recording himself during. If he was planning on living and something made him decide to suicide unexpectedly or someone else killed him, maybe the police saw it on video. If his death wasn't premeditated, I expect the video would show that.

       There were LVPD reports from police scanners that there were multiple shooters. Two of those were reported entering two different hotels while the "suspect" Stephen Paddock was already reported dead. If it wasn't a setup, and Paddock wasn't used as a  Guinea pig, he had help... or at the very least there's more to this story that we aren't being told.

       Even if it did "hurt like hell"  which I don't believe because I have shot hundreds if not thousands of rounds in a short period of time out of actual assault rifles and machine guns, why would he care that it hurt?  Even if he felt it through all the adrenaline.

       Video from within the crowd shows little to no trampling, there was plenty of room. Just playing devils advocate. If it was an arena, they'd have been sardines in a can, but a better analogy would be more like ducks in a pond.

       He didn't shoot anywhere near 1,000 rounds. Even if he did, he would've had an accuracy rate of hitting 1 out of every two shots fired, with an automatic weapon, from over 1,100 yards away.... yeah I'd say those are Rambo stats any day of the week. Not even the best special ops in the world could legitimately meet those numbers given all the variables. Not to mention, he probably shot 500-600 rounds meaning almost every bullet hit a target. And they call it common sense  Get the fuck out of here...

       Firstly I didnt say he shot 1000 rounds, i said it would be easy to shoot that amount in a short period of time with that many weapons and modding the guns to almost automatic fire
      </p>
      <p>
       Youre telling me no one in the world could hit 1 out of every 2 shots from 400 yards away consistently? Bc thats nothing to a trained military sharpshooter
      </p>
      <p>
       Also why are you assuming every single bullet hit? We already know they didnt bc theres video with sounds of bullets richocheting(which they wouldnt if impacted with flesh) and hitting other things,most of the injuries probably came from the rush of people running towards the exits

       No, it would not be easy to shoot 1,000 rounds in under 9 minutes. It would be very difficult, actually. Also, do you have any idea how difficult it is to hit a target 400 yards away with a rifle, much less a FULLY AUTOMATIC weapon? These variables mixed with the number of deaths and injuries (allowing us to assume at least a general success rate of shots landed) are virtually impossible, hence the Rambo reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       And most of the injuries came from the rush of people lying on the ground / standing around? Well that's more likely than the msm narrative of Rambo Paddock, the 64 yr old retired accountant, single handily mowing down a small army of civilians given the aforementioned variables. I can't believe we're even discussing this.

       Dude you might be legitimately retarded....the guns he was using were 500-600rpms, do you know what RPM stand for? Its rounds per minute, sooooo theoretically he could shoot 1000 rounds in 2 minutes with no reloads, but as we know he reloaded and moved between windows so again I say he didnt shoot 1000 rounds off that night but its possible to shoot 1000 rounds in a 10 minute time frame
      </p>
      <p>
       You seriously have no idea about shooting and weapons at all, he has elevation and a literal sea of people grouped within a tight area, he would barely even need to aim to hit anybody, just get his range and start sweeping back and forth
      </p>
      <p>
       And why are you so intent to believe all the injuries are from bullets? They arent he killed 58 people thats a fact but in total he probably only hit about 150 people and the rest were injured by richochets(which he has no control over), shrapnel and the sea of bodies around them

       Post a video. Go shoot 100's of rounds in 9 minutes and set up targets 400 yards away. I'd love to see you hit one. show us all how easy it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you don't seem to understand the difference between capability and execution. The gun is capable of shooting 100's of rounds in X amount of time. No shit... 
do you understand how automatic weapons work? It's not a rifle where you dial in, take your time, achieve absolute steadiness, and pull the trigger. It's automatic. Your hands are shaking and jolting. There is no dialing in, no steadiness, yet you think it's just point shoot and hit. Simple as that. Maybe at distances of 15-30 yards away, yeah. 400 yards away? Are you kidding me?
      </p>
      <p>
       And To quote you
"
       <strong>
        And why are you so intent to believe all the injuries are from bullets

       ? They arent he killed 58 people thats a fact but in total he probably only hit about 150 people and
       <strong>
        the rest were injured by richochets(which he has no control over), shrapnel and the sea of bodies around them
       </strong>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest were injured by ricochets... do you know what a ricochet is? It's still a bullet dumbass. And shrapnel? What, are the bullets now mini bombs exploding and affecting people in an area of effect? And again with the Sea of bodies? Wtf is that? They were all lying down / standing around. How is this causing injuries in great number? There was no stampede.
      </p>
      <p>
       And btw, this is your logic: A nascar is capable of reaching 200 mph. Therefore, because the instrument is able to reach 200 mph, I should be able to jump in a car and drive at that rate of speed for 1.5 - 4 hrs easily. I'm immediately granted an incredibly high level of skill through osmosis because of what the instrument is capable of doing.

       Absolutely there was mass confusion, I was in the casinos at the Mirage during the shooting and the entire casino floor went into a panic that their was a shooter in our hotel. Everyone stayed running  and security had everyone get under the tables. Turns out no one was there. Also just from people gossiping the following was happening....a shooter at Ceasers, a shooter at NYNY, three guys with guns not one. Point is during a panic people just start making shit up because they're scared. Someone hears a noise or sees something and it only takes one person running to freak everyone the fuck out.

       Own an AR15 and the rail definitely gets too hot for non gloved hands when doing mag dumps. Using a BCM KMR on my rifle. Not all ARs have heat shields. A lot like the Daniel Defense rifles he was using are just free float pic rails and those suckers get hot.

       Depends on the grip but yeah you make some if not full contact with the rail. Clamp grip is what is taught most these days. Travis Hailey has a few good videos explaining it among others.

       Most people who shoot will also tell you that they would wear form fitting gloves, many with open fingers on the trigger hand.  These gloves look like gardening gloves.  I imagine they would make it

       not easier to operate these weapons.

       Right, but if the official narrative is to be believed, none of those weapons would have gotten hot enough to do any damage if he was cycling through the 20+ rifles he had.

       I'm sure he didn't stop after the first few volleys and say "Shit that's hot!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Chances are he was wearing them from the outset as a precaution to burning his hands.

       Plus you only see one glove in the leaked photos, could very well have had fingers cutout on his right hand to grab the trigger with.  Assuming he shoots right handed.

       From the looks of it, he was using each weapon until it hit empty, then tossed it and grabbed a new weapon so that he didn't have to reload at all.  Next, it seems to be that all those rifles were using the 100 round surefire magazines.  Lastly, going by the cell phone footage, he didn't sit there and sustain fire for all 100 rounds until empty.  He was firing in bursts (decently longs bursts, but still bursts).
      </p>
      <p>
       From those three bits of info,  i can safely guess that none of those rifles got so hot that you would have needed gloves to pick them up at any point.  That is the point of the hand guards running along the barrel; to stop your hands from grabbing the actual barrel and burning yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have also heard the argument that the shooter didn't want sweaty hands to mess up his aim.  I really doubt that is the case too, because during the time i was in the military, I was a range coach for a decent period and
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       saw anyone fumble with a rifle due to "sweaty hands."  I am not saying that no one ever used gloves while in a training exercise, but for those who didn't wear them, they didn't come across that issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all that said, we all have no idea why exactly the shooter was wearing gloves.  All of this is pure speculation.  I am hoping that with my comment, we can make better educated guesses.  I particularly favor the "masking his own fingerprints" motive, but i am sure that theory is going to get blown out in the not too distant future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, i am back-and-forth between believing he had accomplices who off'ed him when they saw that security knew their location (and bailed, obviously, using him as the lone fall guy), or that this bastard was at the wrong place at the wrong time,  and was set up by an outside agency to be used in a false flag event as the only major suspect.  I am willing to change my stances as new information comes out, which is at least better than many of the people here who are set in their way of thinking only.

       The video footage, to me, makes it seem like he WAS reloading. There are long pauses in between burts of fire,  longer than it would take to discard a gun and pick up a new, pre-loaded gun.
      </p>
      <p>
       With twenty-three modded and preloaded weapons, he could have easily done way more damage had they been in close proximity to him and exhausted fluently. Interesting that they're scattered around the room like he was setting up a showcase, huh? And all those loose mags sitting on the floor? You can't convince me, if we're going to believe that his intent was to do as much damage as possible, that those guns would've been laid out like that. It doesn't make any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if the motive and/or the reality of the situation is deeper than just "lone gunman kill kill kill," it raises a slew of questions that need to be answered and throws a huge wrench in the media's efforts to stabilize the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or this could all be CIA and we'll never get thorough and coherent answers, it won't be exposed, and the majority of people won't realize until it becomes obvious through its effects. Sound familiar? 9/11. Nine to eleven minutes.

       They said he has 23 weapons in the room, not necessarily was using all of them for his attack.  He could have had various hand guns or other slower fire rifles with him that were never used.  He obviously used a revolver to kill himself.
      </p>

       ALso, there are photos of a stack of maybe a dozen or so magazines near the window, so he was either reloading or at least prepared to reload if needed.

       This is true.  However, I wonder why those rifles were scattered all around the room like they were.   He was tidy enough to stack mags, but not the weapons?  Seems like he was tossing them.  It reeks of suspicion, doesn't it?

       I personally believe that the gloves were put on his hands after he was killed by the other shooter(s) in the room. Paddock is seen on the floor with his left arm at his side with a glove on that hand and there's blood on his abdomen area along with a large pool of blood underneath his head. He was shot in the abdomen first and then shot in the head as he laid on the floor? Dunno. The police said they used explosives to breach the hallway door. I don't see any evidence of that happening in the picture leaked to the public showing the front doors with police tape on it. Looks like 11 bullet holes in the door (can't see any other bullet holes but they may be hidden on the end of the door that is behind the door still in the door frame). Police said it was Paddock who fired off 200 shots at the police and one of those bullets hit the security guard. Doesn't appear to be any bullets in the good door that is in the door frame. The bullets appear to have been shot at the door handle on the left side door and that makes me think the police shot out the lock to get inside, you know, it was the other way around....it was the police who shot up the door and not Paddock (who most likely had been dead for quite some time). Did the police hit Paddock in the abdomen first and then his head? Or did Paddock kill himself or was he killed by the other shooter(s) who left through another door from these two conjoined hotel rooms (that could be why the bedroom door was locked on the inside)? Dunno, but feels like the police are lying. On the police scanner, an officer is asking for a maintenance person to come give him an elevator key. HE also says he doesn't want a "blue on blue" problem (cop shooting another cop). I think the police mistakenly shot the maintenance/security guy (they're making him out to be a hero awfully hard! And he was really, but still) because that is when LV Police stepped back and waited for the Zebras (SWAT team....they're referred to as Zebras on the police scanner audio).

       He can't tell you because Paddock was most likely an undercover FBI agent. Hence the cameras and wire transfer. The story is that Paddock was discovered and subsequently murdered, then the attack occurred by the people that murdered him. They escaped.

       Do you honestly think the FBI is going to 1. Incriminate itself and/or 2. Admit its incompetence?

       No, never will either of those two things happen.

       Sherriff said that they have evidence that Paddock was going to try to escape . That means he thought he'd live through it . Right after wiring money to the Phillipines . Why would he think he would escape ? Because he thought he had someone helping him ......Airport is within walking distance ...Note was probably a manifesto of some kind . They'll never release it because in this political climate it would incite more violence . Sheriff was extremely sketchy when asked twice about the paper on the table

       Maybe a reaction to the reality of the evil he was committing. He shot hundreds of rounds into a crowd of innocents and he was taking like 1-2 minute breaks on between some of the bursts of fire. My guess is he was beginning to struggle with it and was fighting himself to carry on. He probably just started to feel glimpses of humanity and blew his head off. That or he saw the 2 cops in the hallway and just went for suicide.

       Uh huh. A guy who just shot hundreds real quickly got an attack of conscious. To call that a stretch would be an understatement.

      <p>
       He did not see 2 Cops in the hallway. He killed himself 2 minutes before police reached the floor.

       You do realize the Texas shooter had waves of his conscious come to him.  He was really broken up about it, but his brain kept pushing him towards aggression.  So your first statement is a 100% contrived bullshit you THINK and was never mentioned in a press conference.  You don't even have a clue of what the guys motives were to do this, as do I or anyone else at this moment.  They never confirmed either that he killed himself before the police got there, but rather that the shooting had stopped.  So wrong again.  We don't have a time of death yet.  So 100% of your post was complete and utter bullshit.

       You are quite the clown. The exact minute of his death is not even part of the discussion. What is important is when he shot himself. You are spreading disinfo and obfuscating the actual discussion. You should be ashamed of yourself.

       You should be ashamed of yourself for claiming an opinion not even based in fact, and wrong information you made up about the shooters death.  It wasn't discussion.  You were stating it as fact and chastising another redditor at the same time.  And to try and put it back on me? lol.  Someone has a guilty conscience and can't handle someone calling them out on their bullshit.

       Well he fired on a security guard so he already knew the jig was up. His position was known to hotel security. He wasn't getting out at that point, unless his plan was to battle his way out of the hotel without any body armor.
      </p>

       Also, plenty of mass shooters end up killing themselves earlier than they planned to, even before the police arrive sometimes.

       It is possible he was neutralized by a counter-sniper from the police department. If this occurred at 10:15 it would explain why the first officers arrived to the room at 10:17. Also, if they knew he was dead inside the room they would have had the luxury of taking their time breaching the door. If the shooter was still actively firing when the first responding officers reached the door, this extreme situation would have called for an immediate attempt to breach the door.

       i haven't seen any evidence for this this. what we're being shown indicates that he shot himself in the mouth, and the last shots were fired at 10:15.

       this sentiment was echo'd by the sheriff. because the shooting stopped at 10:15, the first two officers didn't do much until the next cadre arrived, on the other end of the hallway, several minutes later.

      <p>
       perhaps, but that would be officer's discretion. every PD will have their own training and guidelines, but typically, active shooter scenarios call for a clearing approach. truth be told, 60 minutes to clear a hotel hallway seems pretty quick, but i've never been to that hotel, so i don't really know.

       It makes a LOT of sense when you look at it from the perspective of Stephen Paddock being a false identity.

       All of the “no online presence” stuff makes a lot more sense in that context as well.

       Yes good point, my thinking is that he knew he would be indentified but by the time they identified him he would have been on the flight out of the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       He may have been attempting to create a huge distraction to get eyes off the casino. According to some information that I read today (sorry no source) he had planned to blow up a gas supply/container yard that was about 1100' from the hotel.

        The reporter prompted him previously saying (I'm paraphraseing) "Was the yellow paper a suicide note?" and he didn't know what the reporter was talking about then was like, oh ya that, yes certainly not. later question asked again he referred to it as the "yellow note". Clearly he knew no significant note/manifesto was recovered but we all have been going nuts about a blurry picture that they have already dismissed as nothing... it was a natural way for an exhausted person to reply to reporters grasping at straws....

       Seriously, hotel rooms come with note pads in them... I'm guessing there are like a million more important things he has had to survey at that scene and all the other carnage. He can't remember every detail.

       It's idiot investigators. They saw the cameras and assumed he had a plan to escape and needed to make sure his route of departure was clean. This is typical police nonsense. They never think outside of the box.

       Personally I don't think it does because the concert he was originally going to shoot up was one the Lorde and Chance the Rapper. He settled for the country concert. So I don't think he cared about who he was killing just for whatever reason wanted to kill as many people as possible.

       The same way that you don't know he was going to shoot up another concert. Speculation. He had booked another hotel room during the Life Is Beautiful concert, where Chance and Lorde were performing and I believe attempted to book a hotel for Lollapalooza too?

       That was probably the backup plan and he could have written the note in advance in case he had no way out.

       This video CLEARLY shows shots being fired from two different barrels. "Shot A" has a distinct cracking sound whereas "Shot B" is more bass-based

       The official version from the media/cops is that he checked in on the 28th. But some are saying that's false and he actually checked in on the 25th.

       One of the Marines at the concert doesn't think it was a 240B but rather some modded AR.

       Another thing to think about is the door. It was found ajar but SWAT still blew it open? Weird.

       Ajar could mean it was bolted so the door was basically still closed but you could just open it right up. Swat isn’t just going to push the door open when they don’t know what’s on the other side just because it’s unlocked. That’s not unusual in the slightest.

       Really good point. SWAT isn't military Special Forces so they were probably being overly cautious (hence why they also took 20-30min to even enter the room after arriving on the 32nd floor).
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, that's another angle to consider. Why was the door ajar in the first place?

       If you listen to the police video of the night they were trying to make an explosion to "get a reaction" from the shooter to see if he's still in the room or if he moved somewhere else.

       casinos have mass computers with all the data on rooms, including guests, room service, ect. if he was there for that long, and hadn't checked out, someone working there can pull up the room and reprint the receipt. since the guest is staying there and not a random person dining at say applebee's, it's fairly easy to do.

       As to your first point about the gunfire sounds, check out the following video. Being shot by someone at a decent range results in 2 sounds, the first being the bullet breaking the sound barrier, and the second being the sound of the gunshot itself.

       I understand how gunfire sounds. I don't need some book nerd (dude in the video you're referencing) to explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shots are very clearly coming from two different barrels. Sometimes they're firing at the same time. It's possible he was rambo'ing it but very unlikely. Some weird second shooter shit going on here

       Not really.. a SAW sounds way different in person than from the videos I've seen. Same for a 240B. A 240B will tear through the night and it's a scary fucking sound. Now let's talk about being shot at. Bullets don't pop. It's more like a "whizzing" or "bee" sound that it means as it goes over your head.
      </p>
      <p>
       Audio/mics don't capture the sound well. If you hear gunshots and whizz/bee noise around you then you're in deep shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's a conspiracy. I think the cops know more but are scared to release the info for fear of not capturing the guy or causing panic.

       Pooper seems suspicious. All the eyewitness videos I've seen clearly have several firearms going off (the echos/air pops are not consistent, they overlap/fade out at different times each volley).

       Yes I thought the same. The funny thing is that all the shills push the exact same narrative. "Supersonic/sound barrier" bs. I think it's plainfilly obvious that there was a second shooter. This Steven guy didn't have enough training to be firing two rifles at once. That's not even a thing.

       "Sometimes there is a buzzing whizz if the bullet passes close enough. If the bullet hits the ground nearby, there is a sharp splat of exploding dirt. And on occasion their is a sharp little crack, which, I learned today, is a tiny sonic boom as the bullet passes extremely close at a speed faster than sound. “When you hear the whizz, the bullet is in your area. When you hear the crack, the bullet has passed very close indeed.” "

       Ok, so what you are hearing with shot A is the actual rounds hitting first. Bullets crack when they hit a surface. Shot B is the actual sound from the muzzle of the gun at the hotel window itself. That is why you hear the cracks first and then the thuds, because .223 rounds travel faster than the speed of sound, and so do most calibers.

       If you hear a crack, it means somebody or something (dirt and ground included) near you was hit. Emphasis here is on being near it, close to where the fire happened..
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you aren't that close, it just sounds like regular gunfire. The sound of gunfire depends on the barrel. A 5.56 from a SAW sounds wayyy different than a 5.56 from a M4A1. Just an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying here is that two barrels were being fired at the same time.

        This video CLEARLY shows shots being fired from two different barrels. "Shot A" has a distinct cracking sound whereas "Shot B" is more bass-based

       One is the sound of the round impact/sonic boom which arrives before the sound of the round being fired. The other lower pitch sound is the sound of the round being fired. Basic physics/acoustics.

       Taxi driver video was either the same or echoes. Muffled shots with no echoes are shots being fired from a different window or into the hotel hallway.

       Yeah watched quite a few videos. First (main gun) seems like a M240, and has the fire rate and sound to match. There's at least one other gun that rings out, much different tone, ROF, and inconsistent (so can't be echo). Police scanners all called out multiple shooters, and victims all seem to be reporting numerous shooters.

       Out of curiosity, why do we automatically assume 100% that this pad of paper was a suicide note? We can't see dick from the photo. It's just a pad of paper, there are these in literally EVER SINGLE HOTEL ROOM you stay in... Just sayin.

       I would guess that because there's a roll of tape perfectly placed on just the edge to hold it in place. And to me it looks like there's writing on it. I think if there IS writing, history in suicide cases would show that the most common thing it could be is a suicide note.

       I see, Matthew Lombard previously represented Chicana Service Action Group during their fraud prosecution. From this same group came "Gloria Molina, national campaign co-chair of Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign". Might be worth looking into this lawyer more to see if he has a history of being involved in high profile cases or politically connected cases.

       This is the most disturbing fact that has come out. The regular room connecting to the suite (second bedroom) was locked, and they had to breach it. So, he either locked it and had to go through the hallway to get back to the suite after the shooting ended, or, it wasn't him who locked it.

       Killers and criminals have documented their work plenty of times in the past.  I can definitely see a psychopath wanting to document a killing spree especially if he thought he might make an escape somehow.

       I'm not disregarding the idea that he is streaming a video feed.

       You're not disregarding the idea he was streaming? Sure seemed like it. Sure seemed like you made an assertion that it was completely blatant he was recording and that if anyone didn't agree with you then they're a moron.

       Skepticism is exactly what I'm practicing. There's absolutely  no reason to discount the theory that he was recording. I haven't heard the authorities say he was using the cameras as surveillance. There's no reason to discount either theory.  But for them to just say "cameras weren't recording" with no more info? Ya they're treating us like morons

       You asserted the cameras were recording and to think otherwise would make you a moron. That's not skepticism.

       Haven't seen the video - so don't know exactly what he said - but isn't the explanation for this that if there was a suicide note or manifesto, this would be a noteworthy piece of information?  Whereas a blank notepad is not...
      </p>
      <p>
       In this context it makes perfect sense to barely remember such an unimportant detail (blank notepad) he wouldn't have deliberately committed to memory, while also being able to confidently say whatever he was being asked about wasn't a suicide note.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the spirit of this sub: sure, it could all be a conspiracy that he's covering up.  Point I'm making is, it doesn't have to be a conspiracy for his behavior here to make sense.  I could see myself saying something similar e.g. "What note?  I don't remember any note.  Oooohhhhhh right,
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       ...  Yeah, that wasn't a suicide note"

       Check 9.43 on the video of the Statement, the sheriff clearly says 'this is why there was some delay in reaching the suspects'. Not suspect,  SUSPECTS. Clear slip up made by an exhausted man who is struggling to keep a singular story line going. Oops

       Everything depends on the hotel surveillance footage.  It will show how the weapons were brought into the room and whether there was more than one shooter.  If they say the hall and elevator camera footage is not available, then it's a cover-up.  Words mean nothing.

         That FBI guy is literally staring at the sherriff as if he’s studying his every word and move. Almost like there’s tension between the two.

         The sherriff is nervous as fuck. Obviously exhausted. You can tell so much is being held back. The sherriff is a good man but a terrible liar IMO.

       So this may take some mental gymnastics but bear with me
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff has most likely been up the better part of 3 days, taking small cat naps in his office when afforded a few minutes of down time, now he knows there was no note or anything found at the scene, so when asked about the note he says "what note?" bc he needs more clarification of what they mean, so they clarify they mean the piece of paper from the leaked photos, so he says it isnt a suicide note because it wasnt and they paid literally no more attention to the paper after they noticed it wasnt a suicide note

       The ISIS explanation is far more believable than a millionaire suddenly snapping, bringing 23 guns up to his room, thousands of rounds of ammo, and planning to escape and create a bomb with the tannerite and ammonium nitrate in his van.

       Really? So lets break this down a little bit, so you believe a lone undercover FBI agent met with ISIS, something goes wrong and he gets killed and A.) No other FBI agents are around to break in and stop it? Or kill the guy who killed their agent?
      </p>
      <p>
       Moving on from that, the next step after they seemingly murder an FBI agent and get away with it would be to take the cache of illegal weapons they were coming to buy and hightailing it out of there right? Nope for some reason they decide to not only hang around the hotel room but use those weapons and then leave them all still in the hotel room and escape somehow without being seen
      </p>
      <p>
       Totally right thats more plausible than someone snapping, losing their minds and thinking "hey I got all these guns I never get to use" and planning something that will not onlt result in them dying but their name going down in infamy, how silly of me not to believe that

       I think "snapped" is the wrong term. The prevailing theory in my eyes is that he took a while to plan this out. I'd hardly say that this constitutes "snapping".

       John Washington Rogers jr. (friend of Obama) was an owner of the plane paddock flew. That plane is now owned by Volant LLC, a department of defense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally first thing on his wiki (active in Obama 2008 campaign). He led the inauguration committee. Volant LLC is a department of defense sector. So his plane has been under government control for 3+ years... even if the DOD portion has been ruled out there is still the obama connection.

       UPDATE:  FlightAware.com did finally respond to me via email.  Here’s their reply (Notice that they are laying this all on the FAA).
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hello Tim,
      </p>
      <p>
       It was my pleasure to speak with you earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have done some investigation and it would appear that it’s just the method of keeping records and how they are displayed that is causing the discrepancy between FlightAware and the FAA. Although to confirm our data is in fact sourced from an FAA data feed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FAA does not include the most recent registered owner. If the tail number changed and no one else registers that tail, the FAA will not show the most recent registered owner.

        http://registry.faa.gov/aircraftinquiry/NNum_Results.aspx?NNumbertxt=N5343M
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       FlightAware will show the registration for the most recent flight for that tail number and display the historical record of ownership.

       The plane was registered to John
       <strong>
        Warren
       </strong>
       Rogers.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        John Washington Rogers (Obama supporter/investor) NOT related to the plane in question.
       </li>
       <li>
        John Warren Rogers (Doctor) IS related to the plane in question.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       This is all a moot point though, since it's not the same plane. The tail numbers are interchangeable. The tail number chosen by Warren Rogers matches his Air Force ID. He chose it for sentimental reasons and it just happened to match the tail number of the plane (now inactive) previously owned by the shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent a total of about 4 hours looking into this yesterday and today. It's a dead end.

       I fucking love body language.  The tall sad looking FBI agent kept his hands out front and twiddled his thumbs the entire time up to the exact moment when the sheriff was asked about accomplices, where he then shot up straight and put his hands behind his back while the question was responded to.  Soon as it was over and next question came, he returned to twiddling thumbs.  This guy was uncomfortable with the accomplice question.  But that's small potatoes.  The juiciest part is the moment the yellow note is mentioned.  This makes both the sheriff and FBI agent visibly uncomfortable as they nearly simultaneously reached their hands up to rub their eyebrows, a classic self-comfort move.  These dudes fuckin know something wrong is going on with that note.

       Marilou Danley is an obvious suspect, that's why they refuse to answer any questions about her. When they said they don't have her in custody it's because they want to track her movements.

       I was the one who made the comment and then you replied to me and told me that doing that is a way to discredit people. You were talking about me. This is why I said your reading comprehension is poor. You're so arrogant at the same time stupid that it's painful. People like you are the worst. I'm not surprised you're in this subreddit (I don't usually go here) Go back and re-read the initial first comments. I'm not trying to be a dick but if someone is doing X, and you reply and say "anyone doing X is Y" then you're essentially saying that person is doing Y. It's not complicated.

       Then you replied to me saying "Take your own advice and get some better reading comprehension ". Yet, I didn't give advice. Therefore you have poor reading comprehension, because you thought my statement about his lack of skill was advice to improve that skill.

       Not at all. Those people died. My wife works for America Airlines Cargo and has been on the phone for hours at a time the past few days making sure bodies got where they need to be. It’s all the stuff surrounding this event that is fishy.

       Official Timeline according to
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSnu1HdXZ7k">
        Sherrif Lombardo's press conference (YT)
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       all times local (PDT)
      </p>
      <p>
       1005 pm - First shots fired by the suspect. This was seen on closed-circuit television from the concert venue.
       <br/>
       1012 pm - First two officers arrive on 31st floor and announce gunfire is coming from directly above them.
       <br/>
       1015 pm - Last shots are fired from the suspect per body worn camera.
       <br/>
       1017 pm - First two officers arrive on 32nd floor.
       <br/>
       1018 pm - Security officer tells Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officers he was shot and gives them exact location of suspect's room.
       <br/>
       1026-1030 pm - Eight additional officers arrive on 32nd floor and begin to move systematically down the hallway, clearing every room and looking for any injured people. They move this way because they no longer hear the gunfire of an active shooter situation.
       <br/>
       1055 pm - Eight officers arrive in stairwell at the opposite end of the hallway nearest to the suspect's room.
       <br/>
       1120 pm - The first breach was set off and officers entered the room. They observed the suspect down on the ground and also saw a second door that could not be accessed from their position.
       <br/>
       1127 pm - The second breach was set off, allowing officers to access the second room. Officers quickly realized there was no one else in the rooms and announced over the radio that the suspect was down.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       End of official timeline...
      </p>
      <p>
       So, he fired for ~10minutes.
       <br/>
       And stopped
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       any cops arrived on the 32nd floor.
       <br/>
       Cops arrived
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       security guard was at door, got fired at and wounded.

       So we just gonna ignore that the security guard/cops/swat didnt hear Paddocks LOUD revolver shot when he allegedly killed himself? Im sure anyone in the hallway would hear that bang. Could determine if he really did kill himself or if he was an already dead patsy.

       There aren't a few things that
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       strange about what happened, but this is not one of them. What the sheriff said simply means he remembers that it wasn't a suicide note, but doesn't remember exactly what it was about. Honestly it's probably just an "I love you" to his girlfriend or something insignificant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something that's actually strange is his room service receipt that listed him ordering two meals for two guests. Then, 45 minutes before the concert, a Hispanic woman was escorted out by security, because she was going up to people and telling them they were all going to die that night. Also, there's a video circling around from inside the casino before the shooting started, showing men in military combat uniforms walking through the lobby.

       right, but unless he said "i have a room service order for 2 people" where would that number come from? either the type of room or just a guess to put in the POS system. It wasn't like there were two entrees even.

       Is he gonna call room service every time he wants a new soda? He also got a liter of water. I just can't imagine room service soup is a meal, its probably one potato chunk in a thimble

       Oh yeah sure I think i put that in my original comment and deleted it. Point was for whatever reason, the staff put the 2 in there, unless he announced it, since it wasn't like he was at a table or something where they could see him. (or like, "i need two sets of silverware" since it wasn't 2 full meals)

       I work in a hotel and from my experience, usually the number of guests is based on how many people initially checked in and/or how many people the reservation was said to be for when it was created. It has nothing to do with what you tell them when you order. So, he may have just been eating alone, but he either checked in with someone or told them he was staying with someone when he reserved the room.
       <em>
        Possible
       </em>
       he could have said he was staying there with his girlfriend, but it should be looked into whether or not he checked in with someone.

       It makes me wonder if the sherif is not trying to stoke conspiracy theories to cover for some problems in the LAPD's response to this shooting and the investigation. I mean his department did leak a whole bunch of crime photos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be surprised if some scapegoat who has little to do with the crime gets dragged around the public square to make everyone forget about the loose ends.

       In the odd interview with his brother, he says something like this:

       If you want to get down to facts, lots of rounds were shot from a room where they found a dead guy. That in no way means he was the one doing it. Or that he was even alone.

       as long as you dont touch the barrel and the breach everything is fine. It'll obviously be warm to the touch, but still be fine to handle where it's supposed to be handled.

       If you hear a crack, it means somebody or something (dirt and ground included) near you was hit. Emphasis here is on being near it, close to where the fire happened..
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you aren't that close, it just sounds like regular gunfire. The sound of gunfire depends on the barrel. A 5.56 from a SAW sounds wayyy different than a 5.56 from a M4A1. Just an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I'm saying here is that two barrels were being fired at the same time.

       I agree with you, I remember seeing something SOMEWHERE about this. I think I was at the gym. I'm confused though....

       When this happened in LV, I was abroad in Belgium at the time. So I was JUST waking up to this as it was breaking.

       A young girl said that said woman was running around warning everyone she was going to die, but fled...?? By time they found her she was out of the country????... how could she get out of the country so quickly. And why would the first thing they do is return her to the US and then let her go? Her involvement seems sketchy to me.

       Well. The fact that absolutely NOTHING, ZERO, NADDA, ZILCH has been released the support the idea that this was anything except for a single deranged madman with money hellbent on killing people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence supporting it not being some bullshit undercover deal is the fact that they now report he had rented rooms overlooking other musical events in recent months in Chicago.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no.  You're wrong.  Until something actually comes out to support your BS theory maybe just stick to facts.

       You asserted the cameras were recording and to think otherwise would make you a moron. That's not skepticism.

       They aren't treating us like morons, they're treating us like the PUBLIC in an ongoing criminal investigation.

       They're talking about the cameras he set up in the room.  It is believed that these "cameras" were actually baby monitors, which do not record, only live stream to the monitor screen.

       The proper buffer or response to this is "I'm not at liberty to answer that question at this time, as the investigation is ongoing." Saying "I may say I don't know! But I really do, maybe!" is bizarre.

       Makes me feel sick too and it's because I am starting to believe (or getting the feeling) that this attack on Sunday was supposed to be ISIS' (offshoot of the CIA, I believe) first attack against Americans on American soil, but the fuel tanks didn't blow up, so in essence, it was considered foiled in the mind of ISIS. Then the next day in Tennessee a guy is pulled over and arrested with an arsenal of guns and ammo in his car. Some of the guns have devices on them that make the gun into an automatic. Who is that guy? Jesus. It's a 25-26 drive from Las Vegas to Tennessee, but maybe someone had bought the guns from Paddock earlier on Sunday and they were transported to the guy who ends up arrested in Tennessee.
      </p>
      <p>
       A guy a few years ago in Texas sold his company truck at auction and the next thing he knows (a few months later) he sees his truck in a picture with ISIS members in it overseas! It appears ISIS members are coming here to buy guns, ammo, and vehicles and are shipping them overseas. I bet Paddock never was a shooter on Sunday. He was selling guns on the black market for extra money and didn't realize he was dealing with ISIS members. They used his room to attack Americans and then killed him before they escaped. I bet more attacks are coming by ISIS and they're going to be big.

       I'm not talking about JUST memory. I'm talking about comprehension, which INCLUDES memory.
      </p>
      <p>
       I realize it's ironic to try to explain reading comprehension to someone with poor reading comprehension. But you've got to at least try. I'm genuinely trying to educate you, and you're just throwing insults like a child.
