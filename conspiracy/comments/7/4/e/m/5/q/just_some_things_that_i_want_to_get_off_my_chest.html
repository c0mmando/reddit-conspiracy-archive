        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys,</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m not a massive poster here but I do lurk every day and no I&#39;m not a shill.</p>

<p>Just a few things, well maybe one major thing that&#39;s been playing on my mind.</p>

<p>Firstly the whole ISIS aspect of this situation makes zero fucking sense to me.  Why would ISIS commit this and not take credit, why wouldn&#39;t they stay there and fight?  Why would they run?  If he&#39;s an arms dealer, which I honestly believe he was because why the fuck would he have 23 guns for this?  We might not think this was rationale but if he planned this, then he was thinking logically in mind.  Back to the ISIS aspect, why wouldn&#39;t they stay and fight against SWAT or the Vegas PD?  There is no logic there.</p>

<p>Thinking about it and after reading Operation Fast and Furious, why has no one looked at the cartel aspect of this?  We all know the Mexican cartels are horrible and have committed crazy shit in the past and have zero respect for human lives.  Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense than ISIS?  </p>

<p>My final point is in around what he had in his house.  Now if you were going to commit an atrocious act like this, you would have some idea that you weren&#39;t going to escape so wouldn&#39;t your Plan B be booby-trapping the absolute fuck out of your room, the casino, cars and your house?  I&#39;m struggling to comprehend as to why he wouldn&#39;t do something like that.  It makes more sense he was trying to sell this stuff off.</p>

<p>Sorry for the shitty grammar, writing this fast and getting frustrated at the whole situation, I just want to know what the fuck happened. </p>

<p>He got there first supposedly and the shooting stopped right after he got there. As if the killer is scared of 1 security guard that he would go and kill himself after he already landed a bullet. Wrong. The security guard was the killer and shot Paddock, then shot himself. and went to play victim to police</p>
