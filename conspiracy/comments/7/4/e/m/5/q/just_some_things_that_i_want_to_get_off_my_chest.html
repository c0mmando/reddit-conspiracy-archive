       Hey guys,
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I'm not a massive poster here but I do lurk every day and no I'm not a shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a few things, well maybe one major thing that's been playing on my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly the whole ISIS aspect of this situation makes zero fucking sense to me.  Why would ISIS commit this and not take credit, why wouldn't they stay there and fight?  Why would they run?  If he's an arms dealer, which I honestly believe he was because why the fuck would he have 23 guns for this?  We might not think this was rationale but if he planned this, then he was thinking logically in mind.  Back to the ISIS aspect, why wouldn't they stay and fight against SWAT or the Vegas PD?  There is no logic there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thinking about it and after reading Operation Fast and Furious, why has no one looked at the cartel aspect of this?  We all know the Mexican cartels are horrible and have committed crazy shit in the past and have zero respect for human lives.  Wouldn't it make more sense than ISIS?
      </p>
      <p>
       My final point is in around what he had in his house.  Now if you were going to commit an atrocious act like this, you would have some idea that you weren't going to escape so wouldn't your Plan B be booby-trapping the absolute fuck out of your room, the casino, cars and your house?  I'm struggling to comprehend as to why he wouldn't do something like that.  It makes more sense he was trying to sell this stuff off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the shitty grammar, writing this fast and getting frustrated at the whole situation, I just want to know what the fuck happened.

       He got there first supposedly and the shooting stopped right after he got there. As if the killer is scared of 1 security guard that he would go and kill himself after he already landed a bullet. Wrong. The security guard was the killer and shot Paddock, then shot himself. and went to play victim to police

       ISIS is the CIA and Mossad and they're over in Iraq and Syria. Agreed there is no logic there, but there never was with ISIS.

       But there is logic if you think about them staying and fighting, wouldn't a cartel make more sense?  Or another faction of Islamic terrorism that we don't know about?

       The ISIS aspect makes sense if/when you consider ISIS is an artificial construct, a force created by the Mossad and the CIA.  So they would actually be telling the truth by blaming ISIS since they are ISIS.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the way the piece of intel was spread, I don't think it was ever meant to be believed.  It was just a bone to throw to the mainline-right, to keep their prejudices up to par and to ensure they continue to believe Muslim terrorists are the masterminds behind everything.

       Then if it was ISIS, or they wanted us to believe it was ISIS, why not stay and fight and declare this as an ISIS attack?  This is where i start to get frustrated because ISIS would stay and fight, I know I'm repeating myself but there's no logic to that theory

       They don't care if we believe it's "ISIS."  They just wanted to offer that to the people who believe the conspiracy ends at Mohammedanism.  As I said, a bone for the mainline right to chew on.  It stops them from investigating and applying further critical thought towards the matter.
