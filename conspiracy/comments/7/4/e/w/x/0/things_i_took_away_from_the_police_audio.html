        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t know if anyone will find this useful. But these are my thoughts after listening to the police audio a second time. Maybe help someones research or just someone who doesn&#39;t speak cop who wants to know what the hell they&#39;re saying. 
Sorry if this has already been covered or discussed, I am new to reddit and am not exactly sure how it works fully. Enjoy: </p>

<h2>Audio in reference: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpMrm1xUJ40">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpMrm1xUJ40</a></h2>

<p>:58. Active shooter, inside the fairgrounds. Its not really until 2:25 that the dispatcher even mentions &#39;shooting&#39;. Why isn&#39;t she trying to get any and all info from the officer screaming &quot;Active shooter, inside the fairgrounds&quot;. </p>

<p>All I can think is, and i&#39;ve been out of police scanning for awhile now so Im not too up on the trunk systems and digital encryption, etc. So I think maybe the down time in the transmission, could be encrypted comms. I also understand that this can be comms from 2 different freq. I know online scanners sometimes have the right speaker 1 freq and the left another.</p>

<p>3:44 Shots are coming from Gate 7. Never addressed from dispatch. Maybe they meant from above gate 7?</p>

<p>15:12 Reports from victims of maybe 3 shooters. 15:30 I believe its a different officer saying the same thing from witnesses.</p>

<p>18:05 Building maintenance reporting smoke alarms on floor 29 and 32</p>

<p>19:20 Request to split the channel. So some radio comms may have switched frequencies. </p>

<p>19:38 Sending 2nd team to 29th floor as it is confirmed there are 2 shooters with fully auto weapons. </p>

<p>19:59 Request for entry to be made to the camera room and to focus on the 29 and 32nd floors.</p>

<p>20:40 Reports of people trying to take shotguns from officers cars.lol .(Maybe first aid kits as I heard someone suggest)</p>

<p>24:10 Report of an officer with a gunshot wound to the head. or did he say neck? Dispatch asks what the officers ID is? Never hear a response or follow up.</p>

<p>24:26 Multiple people running across the run ways.(Nice secure airport ya got there LV)</p>

<p>27:24 I feel like I&#39;ve heard this &#39;clip&#39; before earlier in the video. I think its just late and I&#39;ve smoked too much</p>

<p>31:10 Sniper in position requesting a partner</p>

<p>33:20 Swat team on 30th floor. Must be going up from the 29th</p>

<p>33:55 Request for a unit with surveillance equipment. 34:15 confirmation of unit with camera</p>

<p>34:20 Helicopter reports roof as clear with employees on it, in break area</p>

<p>34:58 Unit with camera on the 32nd floor clearing(recording I assume) left wing</p>

<p>35:48 Reports of a white male in military dress carrying a bag going into a motor-home at the motel 6 near Tropicana coming from direction of shooting. 36:40 units arrive. 36:44 moving in?maybe</p>

<p>36:59 Someone steals patrol car</p>

<p>37:10 Swat unit moving up from 30 to 31</p>

<p>37:48 more reports of people trying to gank cop cars</p>

<p>39:30 Aiming shotgun at RV where dude went into</p>

<p>40:20 someone on the radio in a broken in police car?</p>

<p>40:17 Swat team coming up to the 32nd floor. Warning other team of crossfire</p>

<p>42:43 Another unit shows up to scene of RV and is &#39;setup&#39;. 42:17 Another car shows up to the scene</p>

<p>There is a couple comms between these points where they may have said they cleared the RV with no one inside. It&#39;s hard to tell. </p>

<p>47:17 Confirmation of the 2 shooting locations. Asking if there is a 3rd?</p>

<p>47:26 Snipers setup on roof or in &#39;house of blues&#39;??? </p>

<p>48:12 team 31 and team 32 talking about merging together on the 32nd floor. Warns of boobie-traps. advised to wait for escort from SWAT officer. 49:38 SWAT officer takes team back down to 31st floor to setup in room below shooters room? maybe. 51:50 Moved to stairs going up to 32. 54:54 team still waiting in stairwell</p>

<p>56:35 no more transmissions...</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> 
Now Im all fucked up. Because this audio continues after 56min. maybe tomorrow... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xAcTKNpDeY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xAcTKNpDeY</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>great stuff here. how long did it take the sniper to get in position ? I am asking because that might explain why the shooter stopped so early and left the ammo unused. If he continued to shoot then the sniper would have catch-upped his brains out. </p>
