       I don't know if anyone will find this useful. But these are my thoughts after listening to the police audio a second time. Maybe help someones research or just someone who doesn't speak cop who wants to know what the hell they're saying. 
Sorry if this has already been covered or discussed, I am new to reddit and am not exactly sure how it works fully. Enjoy:

       :58. Active shooter, inside the fairgrounds. Its not really until 2:25 that the dispatcher even mentions 'shooting'. Why isn't she trying to get any and all info from the officer screaming "Active shooter, inside the fairgrounds".
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can think is, and i've been out of police scanning for awhile now so Im not too up on the trunk systems and digital encryption, etc. So I think maybe the down time in the transmission, could be encrypted comms. I also understand that this can be comms from 2 different freq. I know online scanners sometimes have the right speaker 1 freq and the left another.
      </p>
      <p>
       3:44 Shots are coming from Gate 7. Never addressed from dispatch. Maybe they meant from above gate 7?
      </p>
      <p>
       15:12 Reports from victims of maybe 3 shooters. 15:30 I believe its a different officer saying the same thing from witnesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       18:05 Building maintenance reporting smoke alarms on floor 29 and 32
      </p>
      <p>
       19:20 Request to split the channel. So some radio comms may have switched frequencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       19:38 Sending 2nd team to 29th floor as it is confirmed there are 2 shooters with fully auto weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       19:59 Request for entry to be made to the camera room and to focus on the 29 and 32nd floors.
      </p>
      <p>
       20:40 Reports of people trying to take shotguns from officers cars.lol .(Maybe first aid kits as I heard someone suggest)
      </p>
      <p>
       24:10 Report of an officer with a gunshot wound to the head. or did he say neck? Dispatch asks what the officers ID is? Never hear a response or follow up.
      </p>
      <p>
       24:26 Multiple people running across the run ways.(Nice secure airport ya got there LV)
      </p>
      <p>
       27:24 I feel like I've heard this 'clip' before earlier in the video. I think its just late and I've smoked too much
      </p>
      <p>
       31:10 Sniper in position requesting a partner
      </p>
      <p>
       33:20 Swat team on 30th floor. Must be going up from the 29th
      </p>
      <p>
       33:55 Request for a unit with surveillance equipment. 34:15 confirmation of unit with camera
      </p>
      <p>
       34:20 Helicopter reports roof as clear with employees on it, in break area
      </p>
      <p>
       34:58 Unit with camera on the 32nd floor clearing(recording I assume) left wing
      </p>
      <p>
       35:48 Reports of a white male in military dress carrying a bag going into a motor-home at the motel 6 near Tropicana coming from direction of shooting. 36:40 units arrive. 36:44 moving in?maybe
      </p>
      <p>
       36:59 Someone steals patrol car
      </p>
      <p>
       37:10 Swat unit moving up from 30 to 31
      </p>
      <p>
       37:48 more reports of people trying to gank cop cars
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       There is a couple comms between these points where they may have said they cleared the RV with no one inside. It's hard to tell.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       48:12 team 31 and team 32 talking about merging together on the 32nd floor. Warns of boobie-traps. advised to wait for escort from SWAT officer. 49:38 SWAT officer takes team back down to 31st floor to setup in room below shooters room? maybe. 51:50 Moved to stairs going up to 32. 54:54 team still waiting in stairwell
      </p>
      <p>

       great stuff here. how long did it take the sniper to get in position ? I am asking because that might explain why the shooter stopped so early and left the ammo unused. If he continued to shoot then the sniper would have catch-upped his brains out.
