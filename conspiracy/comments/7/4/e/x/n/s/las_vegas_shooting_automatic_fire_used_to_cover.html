        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">96</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Longtimelurker859.html">Longtimelurker859</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let me start by saying that I DO NOT believe that the Las Vegas Shooting on 10/1/2017 was a hoax. I think there is ample evidence to believe beyond a reasonable doubt that shots were fired and that people were injured and or killed as a result.             </p>

<p>With that being said, I am very skeptical about what weapons were actually used and how many shooters there actually were, and quite frankly, whether or not Steve Paddok was actually involved, but I wont go into that last bit here.       </p>

<p>What I want to focus on is the automatic and or bump automatic fire that we have all heard in the numerous cell phone videos released after the shooting. As far as I can tell, there is no evidence besides the audio that a rapid fire weapon or weapons were actually used.          </p>

<p>I have seen no footage at all of clustered bullet impacts. None into people, none into the ground and none into objects. This has really been bothering me. From the audio we have heard we should expect to see these things in mass. There is video after video where we can HEAR rapid fire but can not see the rapid fire or the results of rapid fire. But why?          </p>

<p>I think its possible that the rapid fire was either an audio recording, possibly played through the speaker system at the concert venue, or that those rapid fire shots were blanks, used to cover sniper fire.          </p>

<p>AS A SIDE NOTE, PLEASE DOWNLOAD THE VIDEOS I AM ABOUT TO LINK USING <a href="http://en.savefrom.net/1-how-to-download-youtube-video/">THIS SITE</a> OR SOMETHING SIMILAR AS I HAVE ALREADY HAD ONE VIDEO REMOVED FROM YOUTUBE FOR &quot;HARASSMENT AND BULLYING&quot;.        </p>

<p>This first link is a cell phone recording of a man at the concert who can be heard saying that <a href="https://youtu.be/SEW9FQI5eMw">&quot;its the sound system...there&#39;s no hits...nowhere....it&#39;s the sound system&quot;</a>       </p>

<p>This establishes that even people at the concert were unconvinced by the amount of fire being rained down on the crowd. This particular man probably didn&#39;t think he was in danger at all. For the record, there is at least one more video where someone is heard saying that &quot;it&#39;s not real gunfire&quot; and or &quot;its just firecrackers&quot;. I didnt take the time to include those videos here, but they are some of the most common on youtube.       </p>

<p>This next video will show a <a href="https://youtu.be/GRDY4mq6_PU">single bullet ricocheting off the ground, hit a cup, narrowly missing a running concert attendee.</a>        </p>

<p>With what we hear in that video, I would expect to see multiple ricochets, and or multiple people being hit...or the very least, multiple bullet impacts somewhere in the frame...but there is only the one.            </p>

<p>This next one will be another single ricochet amidst audio of rapid fire, and more importantly, I believe from what we see in the video, it may be possible and even likely that the shot originated from the vicinity of the LUXOR and NOT the Mandalay bay. A bullet can be seen hitting a cup and bouncing into that small group of people who are just standing there casually. You can see it impact between them and also see them physically react to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7QWOz4HWyxI">It kind of makes me wonder if a shooter was aiming for the cup, possibly to get those people moving.</a>       </p>

<p>This next one is one of the most important videos out there imo, and that might possibly be the reason why TIME claimed the rights to it. Let me start by saying that this is not the &quot;shots from the fourth floor&quot; theory. Though I do believe that it could be part of the attack. In <a href="https://youtu.be/KWseSudA0R4">this video</a> we can see the shooting side of the Mandalay Bay and a few other things.       </p>

<p>We see the fast flashing light, which some people believe is the muzzle flash of a rapid fire weapon. I DO NOT believe that to be true. I think that light is a strobe light of some kind, possibly a light from a fire alarm in the hotel. I doubt it is a muzzle flash because we can see it continue to flash long after the audio of gunfire stops.        </p>

<p>What I really want to draw attention to is another flash that can be seen about 7 stories or so above that strobe, but in the same &quot;column&quot;...or to say its also between the gold strips of light, but slightly to the left...maybe 1 or 2 windows over from the lower window where we see the strobe. This light is clearly visable AND it clearly syncs up with audio of gunfire that is quieter and separate from the rapid fire we hear.         </p>

<p>That video/audio establishes that<br/>
1. Shots from multiple sources can be heard at the same time<br/>
2. That one of those sources was NOT rapid fire.<br/>
3. That one (possibly all) of those sources was NOT room 32135 of the Mandalay bay.<br/>
With some video enhancement, perhaps a negative exposure filter, It might even establish that room 32135 still had intact windows at the time rapid fire was heard. Which could very well help to prove that Paddok is a patsy.      </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/DzeoV19S7Lk">The last video</a> is pretty important as well. It is cell phone footage of the concert grounds during the shootings, taken from an elevated vantage point of the Mandalay bay. I am pretty confident that it is taken from a patio area of Mandalay Bays <a href="http://www.theworldandthensome.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/DSC00549-001.JPG_effected.jpg">The Foundation Room</a>. What I want you to focus on in this video is what you DO NOT see and hear. You dont see bullets flying or impacting, you dont see shooting coming from 32135, which you should be able to pan left and down slightly to see, and you don&#39;t even really see people react to the gunfire heard. The rapid fire is supposedly really close to the cameraman of this video, but no real reaction from him when the gunfire starts up.         </p>

<p>So, in conclusion...  TLDR       </p>

<p>I think all or at least some of the rapid fire shots we heard was either blanks or recorded audio to cover sniper fire.<br/>
That there were snipers set up in multiple locations around the area shooting live ammo at civilians.<br/>
And that Steve was a patsy...either not involved at all in the shooting or at least not the ONLY shooter.     </p>

<p>I wont go into detail about possible motives or perpetrators, but I do think its more than likely that one government agency or another, or one terrorist organisation or another was involved in the attack and that one government agency or another is involved in covering up the true details about it. Especially when you consider the amount of surveillance Las Vegas has.        </p>

<p>EDIT: grammar, spelling, formatting        </p>

<p>EDIT 2: <a href="http://archive.is/wN9WH">archived post</a>      </p>

<p>EDIT 3: The most frequent complaint about this theory is that critics don&#39;t think there should be visual grouping of bullet impacts in the videos I have shown, due to the distance and elevation. I realize that we aren&#39;t going to see tight grouping, but I do believe we should be seeing grouping of a dozen feet or so, which is well within the field of view of all the videos i&#39;ve used. Especially the one from the foundation room. I have been looking for video footage that could serve as a fair comparison, but I am having issues finding one with the three factors that I think should be included. Range, type of weapon/rate of fire used (give or take) and a camera angle that shows downrange. Im able to find videos of 1 or 2, but not all three and I want to be fair as possible...(it is infuriating how many shooters film themselves shooting from a side view so we cant see down range.) I got to sleep cuz I&#39;ve been up for a while, but I will continue to look some more later. That being said...if anyone reading this has the means and know how to simulate the shooting, I would love for them to do so. If you had an ar15 with a bump stock, a range of about 300 yards and an earth backstop, that should adequately simulate the conditions of Sunday night.<br/>
I sleep now...            </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IDK man, i just don&#39;t see any tracers. And honestly, I would find it odd for the shooters to use tracer rounds when A. They are trying to stay hidden, and B. When the target area is so conveniently  lit up by stage spotlights.       </p>

<p>But if you wish, do some more work on the theory with stills and whatnot so I can better see what you are seeing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cups just don&#39;t bounce around on their own.       </p>

<p>In the darker video where the cameraman is facing the Mandalay, you can see a puff of white right before the projectile hits the cup...most likely from the bullet shattering on the ground, shattering the asphalt, and or it hitting a wet spot.       </p>

<p>On the brighter video facing the stage, you can see the projectile hit the cup and ALSO hit the ground in-between that group of people standing there...and see their reaction to it.      </p>

<p>And in both, you can hear gunfire audio that syncs with the visual impacts.         </p>

<p>I mean, I&#39;m not saying that the &quot;tracer&quot; footage isn&#39;t legit, I&#39;m just saying i don&#39;t see it. And with as much light and action in that video, i think its probable that its not a bullet....but maybe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im not saying the cup moved on its own its obvious it was hit but youre claiming thats proof there wasnt automatic fire and it isnt, over that distance and elevation any change to muzzle direction is going to cause the next bullet fired to be a distance away</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well obviously its not going to be right on top of the shot we saw, but the field of view we have is large enough in both videos to account for any movement of the muzzle at that rate of fire. I showed an example here in another comment thread.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one has said strafing, he can be standing still and sweeping the barrel from left to right and arcing back to the left and bullets will be feet apart, just bc you can see a wide area doesnt mean you should automatically see every bullet hit, maybe it hit a tree before the concert ground,or off a railing or whatever</p>

    <div class="md"><p>another &quot;expert&quot; was saying how he didnt believe the claims of some people getting hit 2 and 3 times because from that distance he would not expect grouping of bullets. youre saying you would expect grouping.</p>

<p>theres is a video that shows someone who was hit in the arm and ribcage.</p>

<p>theres a video where you can hear a whole bunch of ricochets near the cameraman. i think at some point in that video he was saying it wasnt real shooting until that happened, he was also commenting on the sound, that some of the shooting sounded distant, some close.</p>

<p>the area being targetted was big, its possible the videos youve seen just werent near the where the bullets were hitting.</p>

<p>he tried to blow up some fuel tanks, so a few of those long bursts of shooting would not have been even close to the people.</p>

<p>where is the footage from the events cameras? arent all concerts filmed these days? its a big popular festival? a well known artist performing? they always film these events these days, dont they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, with that rate of fire, I would expect some grouping, even at that distance and if the shooter was strafing. Picture<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy9VPTWyLh0">this</a> for example. Granted, there wasn&#39;t an F/A-18 shooting a 20mm during a flyby in Vegas, but the principle is the same. I&#39;m sure you can find a better video than this one to get the idea, I just grabbed the first one i saw that demonstrated the concept. And remember the videos I posted of single ricochets. There was plenty of frame for multiple bullet impacts to be seen, but we only saw 1 at a time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>theres a video that shows a kind of airel shot, maybe from a high window nearby, it shows a big group of what looks bodies/people near the front of the stage and the rest of the ground mostly clear of people. its possible the videos that are showing the odd ricochet are literally just that because they are the odd stray bullet from where he was actually shooting at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>maybe. Again, this is a theory based off what i have seen and heard. But considering the amount of rapid gunfire that there was, I would expect to see A LOT more evidence of it...especially in terms of body count. There were like 20k+ people clumped together in that venue iirc, and only 59 dead? seems really low if you ask me.        </p>

<p>Also, we have numerous reports of people using themselves as human shields, to cover the dead and injured, without they themselves being killed or injured during the rapid fire. One would think the densest groups would be a better target, especially for inaccurate rapid fire from a distance.      </p>

<p>If you have a link to the video you are referring to, I would be happy to take a look.</p>

<p>And the <a href="https://streamable.com/ud7tv">third link</a> is the promary reason why i believe this shooting was not a hoax.          </p>

<p>But I think all three of those illustrate perfectly my point. With rapid gunfire at that range and with that much target density, we should have seen A LOT more injuries and deaths. I mean a lot more. THey were literally fish in a barrel, and we heard A LOT of gunfire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly man, even if &quot;he&quot; only shot at that area, considering how many people were cramped into that space, pretty much everyone would have got a bullet or multiple bullets, and likely a lethal one/multiple.      </p>

<p>I think its much more plausible that the cause of the gunshots were sniper fire from a semi auto and or bolt action rifle....at most, maybe small burst fire from an automatic/bumpautomatic weapon.          </p>

<p>But Bottom line is that I don&#39;t think the rapid and extended fire we hear correlates with the damage that we see.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/02/us/vegas-guns.html">500ish rounds a min is a pretty fair estimate of the rate of fire we hear</a> in the videos...give or take, but using 500rpm,  depending on how many minutes he actually spent shooting it would be roughly...       </p>

<p>500ish for 1 min<br/>
1000ish for 2 mins<br/>
1500ish for 3 mins<br/>
2000ish for 4 mins<br/>
2500ish for 5 mins....<br/>
up to 5000ish for 10 mins         </p>

<p>so 59 dead seem anywhere close to how much damage he should have done to people?       </p>

<p>As a side note...Las Vegas is one of, if not the most surveillanced cities in the world. The authorities should be able to determine pretty much exactly how many rounds were fired...among other things. Not to mention that if thier story is legit, they should have been able to simply count the shell casing in the room. And from what we saw in those possibly legit photos of the room, i&#39;d say they were a few shell casings short....but those photos are a whole other discussion, so i wont get into that any more than that.          </p>

<p>watching that, i watched up to the 8 minute mark. shooting starts at 4 minutes. i counted 5 bursts and possibly the ocassional single shot.</p>

<p>i dont have time right now to watch the rest, but at that rate were talking about 1200 rounds fired and we dont know how many were used trying to blow up the fuel tanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took a quick look at it but already ahve forgot most of it...ive been up all night ;) WIll look again later.       </p>

<p>That being said, If we are talking only 1200 rounds fired, I think 59 is still and extremely low percentage (~5%) of killshots. And your estimate of 550ish people hit is unconfirmed afaik right now... remember that the injury number did not necessarily mean the injured person was hit by a bullet. Im not sure we have any numbers from TPTB on how many people were actually shot....or if the 59 deaths were caused by gunfire for that matter.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the mortality rate of gunshot victims is 25%. you have to assume that the vast majority of those are at close quarters and were aimed at the torso. so 10 or 15% mortality rate when shot randomly at a distance of 1000 meters is probably about right.</p>

<p>That actually makes it seem more reasonable to me, because I was wondering the same as you initially...59 seems low for fish in a barrel. But 40-50% of the shots making contact from a quarter mile away from a rapidly firing AR-15 actually kinda seems high. But I have never fired an AR-15, a bump stock, or probably even anything quite that far either.</p>

<p>As for the injuries from bullets vs. trampling, I didn&#39;t see much evidence of that from the videos. Seemed like most people were hunkering at first, then got out in waves in a fairly orderly fashion. But it would be nice to see those stats of where all the injuries came from. </p>

<p>Again...where is the physical evidence that that many shots were actually fired?

    <div class="md"><p>That video is showing 20mm rounds fired anywhere from 2000 to 6000 rounds per minute on a computer stabilized  aircraft. The rounds hitting the ground in that video were easily 20 feet apart. The Vegas shooter was shooting maybe 5.56mm rounds (based on the picture of the hotel room, just speculation on my part there) at maybe 200 rounds per minute 400 feet in the air at a group of people over 200 yards away, making the straight line distance at the very least 700 feet. Those bullets would have lost a lot of velocity over that distance. Recoil moves the weapon with every shot fired. Changing the angle of the shot by an inch would move where the bullet landed exponentially the farther it travels. Hitting the festival grounds at all would be considered grouping at that distance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I would think that it would be muffled to some degree, but not by that much. It does sound louder in the taxi driver video, which is surprising, because from what I have seen, the people in this video were actually closer to where the gunfire was supposedly coming from. Though the taxi driver has the ground, which sound will echo off of. I think the most important thing to notice in that video is the lack of bullet impacts. There is really no better video that i have seen that shows the target area. And the target area is largely lit up too...which is another point that I didn&#39;t get into in this post.</p>

<p>No, blanks don&#39;t actually fire a projectile. They are basically just the gunpowder igniting inside the casing. Though at close range they can be deadly due to the pressure wave that they cause.           </p>

<p>What I am suggesting is that there was wither...<br/>
no actual rapid gunfire, that it was just an audio recording....<br/>
or that the rapid fire was blanks beign shot...<br/>
or that maybe there was real rapid gunfire, but that it was not being directed at the concert area.        </p>

<p>Maybe the vantage point of this video would have caused such a sound variation, but that still doesn&#39;t explain why were are seeing bullet impacts anywhere if the shooter is shooting a rapid fire weapon from the Mandalay at that crowd..or even in their general direction.</p>

<p>I looked back at some other mass shootings - the last one in Florida saw a comparable number of deaths (49), and only 44 injured. I&#39;ve also watched a lot of eye witness footage, and a lot of people claim to have been shot in the legs - which again, feels weird, as I&#39;d expect if you were shooting randomly from an elevated position, you&#39;d be hitting people in the torso? </p>

Or, how about just using a sniper rifle and start offing people in the crowd and plant a sniper rifle as opposed to 20+ guns? It seems like a lot more trouble to go through. </p>

<p>I feel like there are multiple videos of people where you can clearly hear ricochets on the ground. And the taxi driver video kind of proves that shooting was very loud around the hotel, not coming from the PA systems used by the concert. And I highly doubt the speakers outside of the hotel that just play generic music are powerful enough to be that loud. </p>

<p>Well, one theory would be to control the actual amount of people killed and injured...I mean 59 is bad enough...could you imagine the shitstorm if it was hundreds or thousands of people killed? Vegas is a tourist town after all...        </p>

<p>How do you explain the ricochet sounds in cell phone videos then? There are even people with ricochet wounds. There are reports of people even hearing the ricocheting bullets downrange. Was there a second sniper, shooting aimlessly into the ground purposely to create a ricocheting effect? </p>

<p>Remember that we arent talking about hollowpoints...bullets that are made for stopping power...we are talking about rounds designed to penetrate...a single bullet could create multiple wounds  on different parts of the body, and even to multiple people...especially considering any shots from elevation. For example, Someone has said they heard about someone getting shot in the arm and the ribcage...that could have very possibly been done with the same bullet. And I did entertain the idea of a burst fire weapon being used.        </p>

<p>Again, this is a theory based off of what I have heard and seen, and there has been very little information released to the public...most importantly, ballistic and autopsy reports. But honestly, how much can the public trust those if in fact this was a conspiracy/false flag? All I can really trust is what i can hear and see, and I hear a lot more than I can see in this scenario...which makes very little sense to me considering all video that has been released by the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not say that there isn&#39;t ricochet/impact...Im saying we arent seeing enough of it considering the amount of gunfire we hear. I mean hell...we got some video with some pretty large range of view, and nothing but 1 shot at a time...and then people say, oh well he was strafing or shooting off at the fuel tanks a half mile away...but its like, why if you are trying to kill people are you strafing like a mad man and how are you not blowing out more windows by doing so.... or why if he was shooting all these rounds at the tanks do we only  see 2 bullet holes on the tanks and dont hear a lot more bullets whizzing over the ne corner of the concert venue? It just doesn&#39;t make sense man.     </p>

<p>Im working to find some footage that would be a fair comparison...but so many people record themselves shooting from a side view so you cant see down range ....its really infuriating...I might have to make a video myself...lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If this guy was an arms dealer like the theories are saying, he gets killed in a sting because he was going to rat out the FBI for pulling a fast and furious 2.0. They make up the scene by slapping some slide fires onto AR15s.  Security guard &quot;shot&quot; is in on it. Pipe in auto gun fire noises (got sloppy thanks to a distinct 240B sound) to distract crowd while someone else is shooting at them from another location. Takes out 58 people as opposed to the hundreds that could have possibly done with that fire power. The real shooter slips away to the airport close by and in another state/country before the story breaks across the nation. Gun reform is a coming. Black state big wigs get to put in security scanners absolutely everywhere and profit millions if not billions of dollars. Stephen paddock looks like another ordinary guy that snapped instead of the patsy he is. Las vegas pushes to get this investigation done with and swept under the rug so that tourism doesnt take to much of a hit. </p>

I found one video but it&#39;s from a helicopter and has some of the Vegas lights reflecting off of it so it&#39;s difficult to see much. I&#39;m just curious if there are other videos of the Tower at night that show the same blinking lights. The video I looked at didn&#39;t appear to have those blinking lights, although the video is from 2013 so they could have put in new devices since then. The official narrative is that you&#39;re seeing a strobe from a fire light or exit light, something similar. Maybe those are going off because of the smoke detector triggering a fire alarm? I&#39;m just wondering if there are any other videos showing those strobes, unless of course it is because of the fire alarm - than that makes sense.</p>

<p>TO be as simple as possible, I believe the rapid fire was there simply to distract people from the real shooting of single target/small burst fire. ANd An ar15 could be used for this purpose at the ranges we are talking about.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, with that rate of fire, I would expect some grouping, even at that distance and if the shooter was strafing. Picture<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iy9VPTWyLh0">this</a> for example. Granted, there wasn&#39;t an F/A-18 shooting a 20mm during a flyby in Vegas, but the principle is the same. I&#39;m sure you can find a better video than this one to get the idea, I just grabbed the first one i saw that demonstrated the concept. And remember the videos I posted of single ricochets. There was plenty of frame for multiple bullet impacts to be seen, but we only saw 1 at a time.</p>

<p>The expert is right. You would have to be American Sniper on steroids to group a 600 round per minute shot from that distance.  </p>
