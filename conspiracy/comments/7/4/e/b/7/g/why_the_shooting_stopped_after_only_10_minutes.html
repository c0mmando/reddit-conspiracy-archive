       I am not believing the story that he stopped shooting within 10 minutes after shooting the security guard then killing himself an hour before metro entered the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Major Las Vegas casinos have on duty tactical response teams on site at all times. These guys are all former special forces and off duty swat guys. They sit in a backroom waiting for robberies or situations like this to happen when they are called to action.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the floors have cameras and listening devices on them so it would not be difficult for security to isolate the floor and send their own tactical response team to the floor and put a stop to the threat. These guys are highly trained former SF and PMCs on their home turf.
      </p>
      <p>
       This team when up freight elevator, made entry to the room where one of their guys took a hit coming through the door and the next guy in put a bullet in the back of the shooters head.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police could not respond in this amount of time. Some regular security guard is not knocking on the door to see what's happening by himself. From the limited photos we have all seen there was still lots of ammo loaded ready to cause more havoc. So it doesn't make sense that he would stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only answer for a 10 minute response is a highly trained tactical team to be on site with advanced knowledge of the room layout and how to breach the room.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR Mandalay has an on site private tactical team they went up within 10 minutes of the first shot and took out the shooter. The "security guard" shot was part of the private tactical team and was hit on the way in the room.

       I don't know about that. It would be a detterent if it was public, and it would make people feel safer if they knew a 24/7 special forces team was protecting the hotel.

       On the other hand it allows people who what to do harm advanced knowledge of what the response will be and give them the ability to prepare. This guy was planning on swat taking an hour or more to make a response. These guys were there in less than 10 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though I would agree that a tac team would be a pretty big deterrent if it was known.

       Everyone has less explaining to do if he shot himself and metro found him. Also mandalay /mgm probably doesn't want to disclose that they have essentially a private Special Forces team at their disposal.

       Also, if the put a round through the back of his head there wouldn’t have been a face in the photographs, it would explain the potential chest wound though.

       It's not something they advertise. A person I know built the room these guys sit in and spoke with the guys about how they needed it outfitted.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as shot placement I couldn't really say but these guys are incredibly proficient shooters. I would need to see a lot more photos of the gunman and the area around him. Then probably take a forensic gunshot class to make a non-conspiracy theory judgment on it.
      </p>

       I'm just not buying that with rounds still loaded up and swat an hour away that he would have stopped and shot himself.

       “This is the first time I’ve ever revealed this publicly … there’s a division in the Marine Corps of special people that are specially trained to guard the embassies. That’s a whole division with separate base, separate training. There are almost 40 of them at every opening of my building, plain clothes, armed, on the look-out, changing shift and being relieved every two hours so they don’t get bored.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Wynn also said he implemented new covert security measures that became operational last summer. "We have another group of a half a dozen seals team six guys and CIA guys who are a counterterrorism unit that ... relate on a daily basis to Homeland Security, the FBI and Metro," he said. "My company has metal detectors and devices at every entrance of the building for employees and guests that are non-visible to the public. We have done extraordinary things to make that sure we protect our employees and our guests at the hotel."

       That reads like he’s just thrown a heap of buzzwords in and is talking out his ass.

       I don’t doubt these casinos have some of the best private security in the world but they’re not a band of Blackwateresque mercenaries.

       Nah not blackwater. Just SEALs, CIA and the Marines who guard embassies. Green Berets do more covert work training and supplying rebels rather than being a direct action force though they do direct action as well I don't believe it is their primary roll.

       Ok then why’d you say Special Forces? Green Berets and Special Forces are the same thing. The 3 you’ve listed aren’t Special Forces. SEALs are Special Warfare, CIA is an OGA and Marines are Marines, the embassy guards aren’t a Special Operations Force.

       I was using the term special forces very broadly. I would consider SEALs, Green Berets, Delta, and whatever other elite groups special forces.  I would also guess most CIA officers that do direct action counterterrorism stuff probably started in some type of special forces.

       Yeah fair call, I used Blackwater the same way. I still have a hard time believing that a PMC would carry out that type of work for a private company on US soil. The amount of way that could become a legal and public nightmare

       This is why they are keeping it quite and metro will never say anything. If it went bad metro would be throwing them under the bus. Instead one of the security guys got shot and all metro saw was the shooter dead and they knew no metro officer pulled the trigger so he must have killed himself.

       To touch on why the guys would do it is that they are paid HUGE money to sit around playing cards most of the time and they don't have to be overseas in much more danger than is typical at mandalay bay.

       Possible he took other rounds and was going down or was going for cover when shot. I don't necessarily know he was shot in the back of the head just appears he was beading from there. I am certainly not a gunshot wound expert.

       theres 2 layers of blood. the thicker top layer looks like it came from his nose and mouth. that would have been pumped out from the wound to his chest as he coughed and spluttered trying to breath.

       You're wrong about almost everything in this post so I can't take your theory seriously. I've worked in Atlantic city and Vegas my whole career. There's no fucking tactical squads and there's no listening devices in the hotel lol. There's also usually not even cameras on the hotel floors just the entire casino and elevators.

       Every casino and resort I've worked at has certainly not had anything like that, and I have never heard of anything of the sort. I didn't work at Mandalay so I guess I can't really say with 100% certainty that they don't but it just sounds so ridiculous and anyone who's worked in the casino industry could vouch for that

       “This is the first time I’ve ever revealed this publicly … there’s a division in the Marine Corps of special people that are specially trained to guard the embassies. That’s a whole division with separate base, separate training. There are almost 40 of them at every opening of my building, plain clothes, armed, on the look-out, changing shift and being relieved every two hours so they don’t get bored.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Wynn also said he implemented new covert security measures that became operational last summer. "We have another group of a half a dozen seals team six guys and CIA guys who are a counterterrorism unit that ... relate on a daily basis to Homeland Security, the FBI and Metro," he said. "My company has metal detectors and devices at every entrance of the building for employees and guests that are non-visible to the public. We have done extraordinary things to make that sure we protect our employees and our guests at the hotel."

       That's one hotel. I'm not saying you're completely wrong I'm just saying in my experience, I've never heard of that. I don't know if Mandalay has it. But you were acting like it was standard and it isn't, and I'm someone who's worked in the industry at multiple properties over the years. Just giving my perspective.

       It's probably only at the larger casinos but these teams do exist and have at least since mandalay opened because that is when I first heard about it.

       “This is the first time I’ve ever revealed this publicly … there’s a division in the Marine Corps of special people that are specially trained to guard the embassies. That’s a whole division with separate base, separate training. There are almost 40 of them at every opening of my building, plain clothes, armed, on the look-out, changing shift and being relieved every two hours so they don’t get bored.”

       Wynn also said he implemented new covert security measures that became operational last summer. "We have another group of a half a dozen seals team six guys and CIA guys who are a counterterrorism unit that ... relate on a daily basis to Homeland Security, the FBI and Metro," he said. "My company has metal detectors and devices at every entrance of the building for employees and guests that are non-visible to the public. We have done extraordinary things to make that sure we protect our employees and our guests at the hotel."

       I would think the casino would want this made public. It makes it seem safer to be in Las Vegas if the casinos have special forces that can take a bad guy out that quick instead of the official story where they sat around for an hour doing nothing, and the shooter quit shooting on his own.

       Sorry if that came across strange. I meant 10 minutes from first shot to when the shooter was down. The security guard was shot at some point during the initial 10 minutes.

       I guess I am still curious what this lone security guard was doing there within ten minutes and what he did to take fire through the door then make the guy who seemed to want to do more damage and have a standoff kill himself.

       Possible harmless explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       remember, the windows were broken, the fire alarm went off, i bet some neighbouring rooms complained about the noise.
       <br/>
       knocks door, gets strafed by fire, runs.
      </p>
      <p>
       all in all, a reasonably good explanation.

      <p>
       possible non-harmless explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       "security guard" killed paddock, shot his leg a little, and went limping to the incoming police to be a hero...
       <br/>
       leaving behind the fall guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       all in all, a reasonably far-out explanation befitting this sub.

       Not a terrible theory. It will be interesting if we ever hear any background on the security guard. I would bet almost anything he was in the military or a police officer prior.

       So is this implying the security guard was a second shooter?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be wrong about this, but wasn't the door barricaded? Making it impossible for someone to leave the room?
      </p>
      <p>
       All the following is keeping in mind there were police on the floor 3 minutes after the final shots (which videos seem to prove was 2 pistol shots, 11 seconds apart, about 40 seconds after automatic fire that people are suggesting was the fire through the door that hit the security guard).
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything I'm about to say I admittedly really don't know much about and am assuming, if you can prove me wrong please do.
      </p>
      <p>
       A shot in the leg would leave some sort of blood splatter- meaning the security guard would have had to shoot himself in the hallway to follow his story (and also to not leave a trail of blood from inside the room to the hallway). However, no gun was found on him or outside the room, and I find it very unlikely he could have disposed of it within that three minutes (is it confirmed the first police officers on the floor made contact with him?). The only possible way could be throwing it into the room, but without leaving a blood trail or other forensic evidence. Also, his story is he was shot with a rifle round. The videos show the last shots being pistol rounds, so he would have had to shoot himself, then later use the pistol and go into the hallway.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this while going pretty much immediately into police/medical care. So he would have had to emotionally cover up the shooting, as well as any evidence of it (i.e. Gunfire residue/smell). And leave no forensic evidence in the room. Plus any video/witness of the door or hallway would make this impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I think it is suspicious an unarmed normal security guard would go to the door (and stay on the floor after shooting). The same for the reported "200 shots" at the door for a single guard, when Paddock had the security cameras of the hall. The cameras and all the guns make it seem like Paddock wanted/was prepared for a standoff, so idk why he'd kill himself after the guard came and not keep shooting. Honestly I think the casino security team theory fits what happened better, but I too doubt their existence, ability to kill Paddock and leave no trace or witnesses, and if that did happen I can't see the casino not taking credit.

       This is an interesting, plausible theory. These casinos are cities within cities worth billions of dollars. Would they put their full trust in the hands of individual security and the police?
      </p>

       They certainly wouldn't want other criminals knowing they have these guys in a room ready to strike.

       Deterrence.  It usually works well.  And if it's discreet it reassures the customers.  Sometimes police departments park empty vehicles along roads or in mall parking lots.  You also need unmarked. Gives you a mix of high visibility presence and concealed capabilities.
