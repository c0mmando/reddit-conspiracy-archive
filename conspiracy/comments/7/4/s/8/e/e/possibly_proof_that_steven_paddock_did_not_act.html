        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey everyone I am new to the sub. Like most people the LV shooting brought me here because stuff is just not adding up. </p>

<p>I want to focus on the stage lighting for a second. The most chilling aspect of this entire shooting for me, is the fact that just after Jason ran off the stage, all of the stage lights turned off and then the bright white LED bar turned on. </p>

<p>This to me is irrefutable proof that someone was helping him out. Someone lit up the shooting gallery for him. I can say this as someone who has worked with sound crews and stage lighting before. Those lights don’t just turn on like that. They are programmed. You would expect that when Jason ran off stage the lights would be left as is, as the stage crew and Jason’s band abandoned ship. Instead, it would seem that someone within the concert made some changes to the programming and/or flipped the switch themselves. I haven’t looked into it yet but it would be interesting to know who the production crew is that helped run the festival.</p>

<p>The next part about all of this is that after the shooting stopped the lights suddenly cut off. You can see this happen in the following live leaks video:</p>

<p><a href="https://m.liveleak.com/view?i=7ba_1507073391">https://m.liveleak.com/view?i=7ba_1507073391</a></p>

<p>It’s funny to me that just when people start to tend to the wounded and move everyone to safety the lights go dark. Insult to injury.</p>

<p>Before anyone can beat me to it, I do understand that the lights could possibly default to a blinding white light if someone isn’t in control of them and then auto shut off after a time (maybe 10 min?) but to me that’s all really hard to believe to be merely coincidence.</p>

<p>What do y’all think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But is that common in the midst of guns going off? I mean let’s say this is just the light crew turning on the house lights...they just made it 10 times easier for everyone to be shot. It would make more sense to kill the main power. That takes less time and is done easier. Thanks for the encouragement tho! I will def keep looking into it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Best guess is the engineer thought he was helping by hitting the lights so people wouldn&#39;t trample and get hurt on the way out. Later, while medical moved in they killed the lights to give cover and reduce casualties. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whether or not there were multiple shooters doesn’t change the body count. So to me it’s not the most important thing to focus on. What would absolutely prove the current narrative to be false would be any evidence that he had help. In reference to my post, that help could possibly be someone turning on the lights for paddock to shoot at the crowd.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What they’re saying is ANY sign of help. Yeah, another shooter would prove it. Evidence they lit up the area to help with finding where his shots were landing is proof. Finding out if someone intentionally blocked exits is proof.  Finding out he had a spotter on the ground helping direct the fire is proof.   There’s a lot more to disproving the lone wolf narrative then just more shooters</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess is that it was actually someone thinking quickly and lighting up points of egress for escape.  A densely packed 22k audience doesn&#39;t need much lighting to hit.

    <div class="md"><p>I could definitely see that to be true, but you have to admit that at best it was a huge mistake on the stage crews part. If those lights didn’t come on I would dare to say that we wouldn’t have anywhere near the body count we currently have.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This has been discussed on here a ton. There reason for turning the house lights on is/was: </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Let the audience know that the event is over and it&#39;s time to go. </p></li>
<li><p>Make it easier for audience members to see the exits and avoid trampling each other. </p></li>
<li><p>Illuminate the shooter. Initial assumptions would be that the shooter was on the ground/among them in the crowd, so keeping the lights off in that scenario would help the shooter stay hidden. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Also, Paddock didn&#39;t need the lights on to assist him in mowing people down. He was shooting indiscriminately at fish in a barrel. He didn&#39;t need better lighting for that. </p>
