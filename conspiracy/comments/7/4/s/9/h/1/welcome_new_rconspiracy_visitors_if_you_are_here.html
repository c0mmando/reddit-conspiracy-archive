<p>Some even believe we (the Rockefeller family) are part of a secret cabal working against the best interests of the United States, characterizing my family and me as “internationalists” and of conspiring with others around the world to build a more integrated global political and economic structure – one world, if you will.

    <div class="md"><p>The primary difference between this event and the others you mention is the inability to hide the conspiracy by the perpetrators. There were too many people with cell phones.  There are too many cameras and we now have the internet that allows us all to connect and share information. Information that would not have been allowed to be known before.</p>

<p>Conspiracies have always existed and they have always depended on secrecy to pull them off.  Its much harder to keep secrets now.</p>

<p>I encourage you to consider that most, if not all, events that changed the course of history were planned.  This is a very deep rabbit hole and is prone to changing the entire way you see the world.</p>
