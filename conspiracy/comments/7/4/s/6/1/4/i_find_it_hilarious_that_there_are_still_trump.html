       Well, the deal went through, so what are you proposing is under the surface there? We've armed SA and are materially supporting them while they attack Yemen, yet pretend like no war is happening there. Not sure in what way he is not playing ball with the saudis.

       We only know what they want us to know. For all we know, let's just say... it was a deal for Saudi Arabia, but a badddd deal, if you catch my drift ;)

       Arms are a business and you'd be pissed if X person promised you A, while Y person

       They are the actual terrorists in the world, along with their bastard stepbrothers over in Tel Aviv. Saudis are the runts of the litter, though. But like with all brothers, you can get your older brother(s) to join in a fight. Especially if the target is a mutual enemy.

       The deal was on hold and Trump let it proceed. I think it has more to do with a concession to Boeing and Lockheed to secure his “great deals” earlier in the year to reduce prices on aircraft for the pentagon subsequently sending his base into a orgasmic frenzy. It was the back half of his great negotiation skills that’s all.

If we cut and run that 16 years of sacrifice will have been all in vain. Is that what you want, to tuck tail and retreat with our tails between our legs?

       The entire Afghanistan campaign is in vain.  Sacrifice IS the appropriate word, because we sent people over to die, not to advance democracy.  It's not "retreating in defeat", because the war can be continued ad infinitum with that logic...it's simply about ending, at some point, the longest war in U.S.

       Trump may appear to mere lesser minds to be an insufferable doughy old manchild who eats nothing but grey meat &amp; ketchup and never exercises, but actually, to the initiated, to those who possess the secret knowledge, he is a genius the likes of which the world has never seen.

       you do realize arms deals generally take years to formulate and breaking one that obama had scheduled to complete right after the election would have caused an relations shit storm right?
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean its almost like that was the whole intent of him putting off the signing of the deal until after he had left office.

       The arms deal wasn't what it
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/International/truth-president-trumps-110-billion-saudi-arms-deal/story?id=47874726">
        looked

       like, anyways. Trump cobbled together a bunch of proposed deals and added them together, whether or not the Saudis ever agreed to pay.

      <p>
       Unfair to blame Obama when Trump clearly wanted the biggest number he could scrape up.

       The deal was on hold and Trump let it proceed. I think it has more to do with a concession to Boeing and Lockheed to secure his “great deals” earlier in the year to reduce prices on aircraft for the pentagon subsequently sending his base into a orgasmic frenzy. It was the back half of his great negotiation skills that’s all.
