       AR15s with bump stocks/slide fire setups were not the primary weapons used in the attack. A disintegrating belt fed high caliber weapon fired the bulk of the shots.

       this sounds more like a working theory; is the biggest anomaly in your view the gunfire audio not matching the reported weapons used?

       Dude filed a tax return in 2015 with a $5 million gross.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why use semi's with slide fires? He'd qualify to possess a fully automatic weapon in Nevada as there's no application or permit required at the state level, so assuming all applicable ATF stamps were paid for he'd be much better equipped to accomplish this "well planned out" attack with fully automatic belt-fed weapons with barrels intended for sustained rates of fire.

       Official motive/narrative. I find most of the "theories" more plausible than the msm rhetoric given the buttload of information being withheld from us. You can't fart in Vegas without 15 cameras catching a whiff.

       Wouldn’t it be much more plausible (short of acknowledging that he was just evil/nuts, especially given recent news re: his night terrors &amp; anxiety disorder/anti-anxiety medication) that old boy held a grudge against LV casino-hotels after losing his 2012-2014 lawsuit against the Cosmopolitan, with prejudice?
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently he had only $270 in legal fees left to pay, as of the night of the incident. Maybe all this horrible violence was his scum bag version of a ‘parting gift’ to Las Vegas?

       Jesus going all Paul Blart, reaching the 32nd floor, seeing it was barricaded but still deciding to search on his own while unarmed. I'm all for "adrenaline makes people do heroic things" but wtf?!?! After hearing all those rounds being fired this guy decides to go looking for the shooter(s). I say shooters because even if there was only 1, at that point the official assumption was there were at least 2 gunmen. And surely Jesus thought there must have been 2, even Law Enforcement was operating under that assumption. So what exactly was he planning on doing?

       Which makes it even weirder considering the casino probably has hallway footage right? There’s no valid reason to NOT release the footage unless it disproves the official narrative.

       It's too obvious. It's like they want us to go off all over the Internet about this. There have been conspiracies from Operation Northwoods and 9/11, to Project Stargate and MK Ultra. A lot of people would never believe in conspiracies like these, and whenever I see posts on social media I often see them get shot down and dismissed, called crazy etc... however in this case I see a large majority of people believing that the mainstream narrative is a cover up for something much deeper than just 1 crazy man with guns.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this not only a push for gun control, but there's some other motive that has something to do with how people perceive conspiracies. I think there a lot of people who mightve never believed the media would cover up something like this, who might now think otherwise. Everything about this including the physical attributes of the shooter himself, his brothers statements, the sheriff behaviour, the crime scene photos, the footage from people in Vegas showing multiple shooters, it all screams conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just see the majority of people actually believing in the conspiracy theory for once and it's usually the other way around.

       Ok, how about in literally every video and photo you don't see any sign of a gunshot wound or anything being shot or bullet damage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, the burden of proof is on the original claim, which is that a mass shooting happened.

       Haven't seen this one. That had to be two different guns being shot at the same time. I still think the security guard is involved somehow. Especially since he hasn't been interviewed. You'd think people would be trying to talk to him. Seems like he is being told not to talk.

       Around the 3 minute mark I believe. Hear three "pops" and then about 10 seconds or so later you start seeing people rushing towards the exits. Then about 5-10 seconds later the 1st volley of shots starts. It's really strange.

       I don't think those are the same shots. The one I posted is before the shooting begins. But this is interesting also. But it's definitely after people we cleared out of the concert area. It's also closer to mandalay. The tarp moving could be wind. But very coincidental that it aligns with those gun shots.

       Those rounds are going faster than the speed of sound.  It's the round hitting the concrete and a split second later the sound from the barrel gets there, which is easily over a thousand feet away probably farther.  Those rounds hitting are very close to the person filming

       I feel like the security guard was an accomplice of some form    I feel the security guard was the main shooter while paddock was the lookout using the cameras. I think when they realized police and swat were inside Campos(security guard) put bullet in paddock unloaded 200 rounds down the hall shot himself and put a security uniform on.    You can't tell me Campos fucking Neo'd 199 bullets in a hall not much wider than 6' and only got hit by 1 bullet and with the cameras paddock only seeing him get shot once and shoot himself?

       Aside from public accounts of him being abusive with Danley and maybe being on anti-anxiety meds (not rare, BTW), there's nothing disturbing in this guy's past that we know about until he built an arsenal and did what he did. It seems very strange that someone does something like this and we have to investigate why it was done at all. While this opens the door to plenty of patsy-type speculation, that's undercut for me by just how banal this guy seems to have been, he makes a very poor patsy.

       Are there any videos to confirm the reports of shooters getting on the stage and shooting? This theory seems far fetched to me. But the 15 min. Video from the guy clear in the back with the three gun shots and then people sprinting out before the first volley of shots is really strange to me. It clearly shows a bunch of people running out before the shooting begins. Had to be shooters on the ground somewhere I think.

       My biggest suspicion is that we were MEANT to question it. That this was a huge distraction from something else that is happening right now. It’s a misdirection. It seems like it was set up to look like a big conspiracy/coverup. Meanwhile, something else deep-state affiliates is occurring. Something much larger than this. Something we will probably never find out about until it’s too late.
