       Okay, so, this might just all be in my head but I'm wondering why there are so many right-wingers in the conspiracy world. It doesn't make sense that any of us would support ANY political party or candidate. Honestly. And is it just me or was Alex Jones not always this right-wing? I remember him years ago being completely anti-government, though I've always had a suspicion he was a puppet anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has this crap always been lying beneath the surface and I never noticed? It seems like a lot of people who used to be anti-govt have now been tricked into thinking trump is an "outsider", etc.

       Maybe not to you. But if you were paying attention to what happened in the last 8 years you'd at least understand why this is happening. You may not agree but you'd understand. Benghazi, billions in unmarked bills sent to Iran in an unmarked plane, coordinated social revolution led by corporate America, the NSA, leaked emails etc. There's plenty to be upset about and a lot of it can be traced back to the same people.

       Lets not go and put the NSA overreach purely on Obama's shoulders.  I'm pretty sure Bush was guilty of that too.  The NSA thing goes beyond partisan politics.  Both parties are involved with that shit.

       yeah but we opposed bush when he did it and Obama too.  The Dems were silent for 8 years about Obamas massive illegal wiretapping, his drone strikes, the global assassination campaign, the continuation of gitmo, the escalation of the war on terror.   We protested that, yet the Dems did nothing.  They threw a fit when Bush did it and cheered when Assange exposed war crimes via Manning.  But when people talked about Obama droning innocent kids and spying on us all, and how he was allowing torture at gitmo, the dems said nothing.  In fact the media and the public were silent and gave obama a pass.  Hell Cobert and Rolling Stone and Jon Stewart viewed Obama as a rock star.  For doing the same things Bush did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bush was a monster and war criminal.  He should be in prison for what he did.  But Obama ran on the promise to end Bush's lies and become "the most transparent administration ever".
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama and Bush should be in prison.  Saying Obama is blameless is fucking ridiculous.  Obama shares a huge amount of blame for the economy and the recession.  He did absolutely nothing to fix it.  And bailed out bankers.  Those bankers should have been lined up and hung.  Instead obama gave them some money and bailed them out

       Additionally the same outlets the Dems are now saying to trust about how Trump is some puppet of Russia, were the same that lied to us about Iraq and wiretapping during Bush's reign and Obamas too.  The New York Times knew about what Bush and Obama were doing in terms of wiretapping.  Congress knew.  They admitted it.  They refused to tell the american people what was going on at the time.

       Sounds like you need to add a few more news organizations to your rotation there buddy. Benghazi? Money sent to Iran? you can't use

       right-wing news to stay informed and then pretend you're informed.

       Trump just sold $100 billion+ in weapons to the Saudis. nearly ever 9/11 hijacker was Saudi. but you don't give a shit enough to mention it. and while we're on 9/11, why aren't you mad enough about that to mention it instead of Benghazi? you're really more angry about two US compounds being attacked in Africa than you are 9/11, which was

       We export military machines. It's what we do. If the Saudis wanna use their military to intervene in Yemen that's not my business. The Saudis did not use military assets with hijackers. I'm a firm nationalist so that might help you understand my perspective. I only care about one nation and one people.

       Main stream media was protecting Obama for most of his terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a little recap about the Obama presidency:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Obama expanded the USA into seven(!) conflicts.
       </li>
       <li>
        Hunted more whistleblowers than all previous presidents combined.
       </li>
       <li>
        Protected big banks and big corporations from the fallout of the economy crash.
       </li>
       <li>
        Expanded and implemented wide-ranging illegal surveillance on US citizens and lied about the scope of the spying.
       </li>
       <li>
        Illegally spied on political opponents.
       </li>
       <li>
        Knew about Hillary Clinton's illegal email server that she used to hide her pay-for-play dealings and corruption.
       </li>
       <li>
        Knew about Hillary's illegal handling of classified intel material and did nothing about it.
       </li>
       <li>
        Conspired to cover up the matter of the illegal email server since Obama himself is implicated in the emails.
       </li>
       <li>
        Let laws be passed that enables the use of propaganda on US citizens through domestic propaganda programs.
       </li>
       <li>
        Citigroup picked Obama's candidates for government positions.
       </li>
       <li>
        Prosecuted no financial or corporate white collar criminals.
       </li>
       <li>
        The corporate main stream media acted as a arm of the Obama administration, covering for his crimes and scandals, excusing his betrayals of his voters, rationalizing his most rapacious acts.
       </li>
       <li>
        Set new precedents in murderous, extralegal power, droning even American citizens without due process who had committed no crimes.
       </li>
       <li>
        Was part of the gun running operation

        that put into the hands of criminals south of the US border some 2,000 weapons, which have been used to kill hundreds of Mexicans and at least one American, U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry.

       It's not because he disagrees with him.  It's because Alex makes up all of that shit, and passes it as fact.  He even admitted its a huge charade in his custody battle.  He's doing it to fool weak minded people into buying bogus products.  He is a terrible human being. Does he deserve to do?  No.  Does he deserve to be exposed as a sham and ruined professionally and socially, absolutely.

       In his custody battle he admitted to playing up his persona, not to simply making shit up, let's not be misleading.

       I dont get why people are so afraid of the guy. You can either listen or not, he continually encourages his audiencs to vet information for themselves. He's over the top, insanely self-promotional, and will sometimes throw things out there just to fill air time. It's up to you to sift through that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly most dislike of him coming from a place of envy at this point. It's crazy that his operation could survive so long. I guarantee you that you can credit his crazy "persona" to the fact that he's even still alive.

       well they sure seem to.
the people your linking are just far right wing, there is nothing alternative about them. racists, bigots and the Klan have always been the far right in the US, how can they be the alternative right when they were the establishment right?
      </p>
      <p>
       the people your talking about are the ones the media has tried to lump in and call alt-right to discredit the social liberals who identify as republicans for their economic policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       if all you can be bothered to do is 30 seconds of google searching and reading sensational headlines and click bait, then i don't think you can even jokingly consider yourself informed or competent on the issue.

       Dude, come on. My original contention was that members of the alt right use the word "degenerate." I provided you with examples of how the word has been used among alt righters and people discussing the alt right.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        You
       </em>
       keep bringing up Milo, as if somehow Milo's existence means that alt righters aren't using the word. I provided links to bolster the
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       claim I've made in this thread, which is that the alt right uses the word
       <em>
        degenerate,"
       </em>
       and they use it to disparage people who are not straight. Yes, I know Milo isn't straight. Milo isn't the entirely of the alt right.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw the word used quite a lot in the alt right sub before that sub was removed from Reddit. I was seeing it being used there as far back as November of last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really know why you're arguing so hard about this - you seem to think that I'm making claims I'm not making, and you keep inserting Milo into this as if his name magically wards off accusations of homophobia. I would continue this discussion but I don't think you're actually listening to anything I actually say and I get the feeling that you would prefer to feint with some perceived enemy, and I'm not going to play that role for you.

       no your linking a bunch of right wing nazis using the term and trying to paint them as if they are alt-right that is generally identified that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       the neo-nazis have always been the far established right, the ALTernative right or at least the people they started giving that label to were people like milo and conservatives who were left on social issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       its idiots like you who keep trying to claim these Nazi far right people are part of that movement so you can call every one who disagrees with you a nazi.

       you are doing exactly what i said was pissing me off coopting the term for your own stupid agenda.

       what argument? all i see is you rambling on about the use of "degenerate" on a bunch of  nazi blogs and troll posts on reddit, as some sort of idiotic challenge to me saying the term "Alt-right" is a made up pejorative used to discredit socially liberal/economic Conservatives and that idiots like you try to draw a circle around these people and neo-nazis and claim they are all one group so they can justify "punching nazi's" as a defence for attacking people the far left disagrees with

       what most people keep trying to call right wing, isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       its this whole Alt-Right psyop thats been going on for the last year.
most of the alt-right they keep going on about are actually left wingers who got pissed off that the democrats decided to go full neo-conservative and drag the party and the whole system further towards the right (ala Hilary and her wannabe republicanism.)
      </p>
      <p>
       there is no alt-right, its just another label like conspiracy theorist used to try and discredit people and make the same sheep avoid listening to what they have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       i mean how else do you shut down a gay Jewish man who loves black dick and espouses libertarian and socially left policies along with economic conservatism.
      </p>
      <p>
       call him an alt-right, Nazi, racist, homophobe.....
the sad part is i had hoped "people" would be smart enough to fall for it, but hey, here we are.....

       Hard to deny the hatred the Establishment politicians and intelligence community has for Trump.. That’s enough for me for now. Considering the alternatives... Although not ideal right now, I think our foreign policy is atleast on a better trajectory than it was under Obummer.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe I’m just too stupid to read people and realize nobody in this world could act this whole ‘play’ out the way some think we are being ‘tricked’ .. Sorry, not seeing it and I read a lot of these scum people. Trump isn’t one of them, even with all his flaws..

       They want you to focus on left and right, you are obsessing over it.  Good chance in most ways left and right are identical on anything that matters.

       In either case, little of what we write here holds any value at all.  There is an unseen oligarchy, the media and government are their puppets, actors.

       No, it happened before that.  Mostly because so many conspiracy theories about the Obama Admin turned into conspiracy facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       That alone wasn't enough, it was magnified by the fact that the media often went into coverup mode and was completely uninterested in investigating these stories.

       Weird that people dismiss all of the conspiracy facts from right wing administrations while admitting to the left wing administrative conspiratorial events. stockholm syndrome or something. or people still really want to hang on to hope that some form of government in america is actually just. desperately hanging on.

       From my experience, most "conspiracy theorists" are conservatives, but not like how the word has been warped (same with the "left"). The left right paradigm has been warped in the US, for the most part. I'm fiscally conservative, but more socially liberal, in the classic sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many CT's are the same way, imo. Pretty much, mind your damn business, and leave me the fuck alone to do as I please, as long as I'm not infringing on other's rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The compass is really up and down, not really left and right, as the MSM (and shadow government) wants you to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Small to no government with more freedom, vs. larger government and less freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the awakening period, the lines blur and people get confused. This is coming from someone who started as a staunch conservative Roman Catholic, who is now more of an anarcho-Capitalist or Voluntaryist. Leave me the fuck alone, and taxation is theft, fuckers' :)

        The earliest reference to an analog of "two cents" appears in the lesson of the widow's mite in both the Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of Luke. In the biblical episode, several wealthy temple patrons donate large sums of money, but an extremely poor widow places just two small coins, i.e. her two cents, into the offering. She finds greater favor with Jesus than do the wealthy patrons, seeing that the widow gave all of her money to the Temple in Jerusalem while the wealthy patrons made little investment, leaving much money for themselves

       Look at Webster Tarpley, that is what a left wing conspiracy theorist looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the right wing stuff is just the right wing tendency to think in talking points. Liberals tend to be resistant to repeating talking points, whereas conservatives would collapse into a puddle without their tribalistic talking points that signal they are part of the conservative tribe.

       The left wing has become the "mainstream" political force, the one that most media identifies with, and the one that is least open minded. It's done a complete 180 flip from what it used to be. Now the people that question and are open minded have tended to migrate rightward.

       It's the mainstream aspect. Like I said, it used to be completely opposite. You'd try to debate with a right winger and you'd just get shut down, they didn't accept anything but their world view, the mainstream world view. Now the mainstream is on the left again, they just shut you down. If anything, it shows how bullshit the left vs right thing is. It's more about the media. What they peddle is what people believe.

       I see where you're coming from. I can say that yes the left definitely does this but the right does as well. I just don't believe that in general people that lean left are more closed minded than people on the right. Both sides are extremely tribalistic. It all depends on your POV and which ideas you believe in

       A "government by the people," is the only protection against
"rule by the strongest/wealthiest/owners.

       De-centralized bottom-up structures are the only things that will work and if we ever want to see this in any form we must first wait for the fall of capitalism and maybe even "civilization" as we know it. Power to the people. And we can all take small strides to work locally to better our neighborhoods from town to town. Look into Murray Bookchin.

       Hrmmm, I don't see a lot of love for Trump in this sub often, but I think the trump crowd does have a lot of overlap with people who don't buy the mainstream bullshit... I mean if you think about it, super right wing guys have been the spear of the FEMA death camp thing forever, so I think there is just a lot of right wing conspiracy theory, and has been for a while.

       I think a big part of it is because a lot of rabid right wingers posts huge amounts of crap to this sub, which has nothing to do with 'conspiracy'. Then the whole thing turns into a pro-gun rally (eventhough we just saw what pro-gun can do in LV! ffs.) and Trump/Shillary political BS that also has nothing to do with this sub.

       most conspiracies since 9/11 have involved some shadowy cabal running the world, most of these shadowy people happened to be jewish, but they would be touted as 'reptilians' 'bloodlines' 'bohemian grove' etc.
at some point the conspiracy nuts flipped over, stopped believing the reptile stuff and just went full on racist instead.

       Conservatives, by nature, are always getting left behind. They perceive this as a threat to their identity and prosperity, so they see their political opponents as enemies more often than the average liberal (who has similar fears of being dragged backwards). This leads to obsessive analysis of 'left-wing tactics,' which only reinforces the narrative of the leftist boogeyman. Confirmation bias kicks in, so they then stop arguing rationally and go full partisan. At that point they'll swallow quite a bit of bullshit, which is how you end up with 'Michelle Obama is a man' as a serious line of discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR- the traits that make people conservative make them more likely to be conspiracy theorists, but not every conspiracy theory is red meat thrown to keep the right wing partisan and angry.

       It's not because he disagrees with him.  It's because Alex makes up all of that shit, and passes it as fact.  He even admitted its a huge charade in his custody battle.  He's doing it to fool weak minded people into buying bogus products.  He is a terrible human being. Does he deserve to do?  No.  Does he deserve to be exposed as a sham and ruined professionally and socially, absolutely.
