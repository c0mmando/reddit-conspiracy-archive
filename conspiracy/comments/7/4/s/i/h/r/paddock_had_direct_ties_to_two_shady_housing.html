        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">51</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-07 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Zenyx_.html">Zenyx_</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>As <a href="https://gyazo.com/198f1aed77b6320ed20661f4dc0c56f9">shown</a>, Stephen Paddock used to work for a &quot;N U P P M&quot; doing &quot;N/A&quot;. A google search for nuppm shows a USC housing arrangement company that uses some odd wording when describing its services. <a href="https://nuppm.com">This</a> is the website. <a href="https://gyazo.com/d2ee39c2983e8d08d221f017c4dea8d7">Here</a> is a screenshot of the services they provide. They use odd words to describe normal rental services, but then they also say there&#39;s a &quot;communications room&quot;. What the hell is that? <del>Also, the location shown on the website for NUPPM doesn&#39;t exist. Like, there&#39;s no NUPPM there. But a google search for them puts the company at this location. Funny how a housing service is run out of a 100 year old home?</del>The address for NUPPM shows <a href="https://gyazo.com/9484929d1adac2c37501423cf327d183">these</a> buildings, and I can only tell that one is even occupied. Now under normal circumstances I wouldn&#39;t really think this meant anything, except for the fact that Stephen Paddock conveniently sold his plane to a similar company when he was done with it. The company he sold his plane to was USH Inc, or the Universal Student Housing Inc. A google search for this company shows no website, only a Facebook page with shotty reviews. Also, it seems as if USH Inc. is hosted out of the address 424 Kelton Avenue, Los Angeles (<a href="https://gyazo.com/c1ee0989022dbdaf5264a65802a5e680">Here it shows the address</a>). Turns out, there is actually an apartment complex that works out of that building and address, entitled the <a href="https://www.apartments.com/westwood-executive-house-los-angeles-ca/yq6sn4s/">&quot;Westwood Executive House&quot;</a>. What&#39;s the deal here? Why are both of these companies running a similar shady business and why do they BOTH have connections to Paddock. What do you guys see here? I smell foul play all over Vegas.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
TL;DR: Paddock had direct ties to two different maybe fake companies offering shady housing services. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was poking down the USH theory earlier today, coupld weird things I notice about the whole ordeal being.</p>

<p>USH inc, is not listed in Californias business database, which strikes me as odd as cali is one of those states that would generally require a business even if it is a foreign entity to register with the state.</p>

<p>The main website has a private whois(and what legitimate company is hiding their legal name/address). I did find a second domain (not hard) which has a legit whois and was registered almost 20 years ago, but address is the same listed on USH&#39;s website. They seem to boast like they are a big outfit owning a plane and all, but they have no real reviews, like three people on yelp who&#39;ve written negative reviews, and not much to really go on. Shady at best.</p>
