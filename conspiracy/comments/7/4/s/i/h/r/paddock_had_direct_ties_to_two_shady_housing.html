        shown
       </a>
       , Stephen Paddock used to work for a "N U P P M" doing "N/A". A google search for nuppm shows a USC housing arrangement company that uses some odd wording when describing its services.
       <a href="https://nuppm.com">
        This
       </a>
       is the website.
       <a href="https://gyazo.com/d2ee39c2983e8d08d221f017c4dea8d7">
        Here
       </a>
       is a screenshot of the services they provide. They use odd words to describe normal rental services, but then they also say there's a "communications room". What the hell is that?
       <del>
        Also, the location shown on the website for NUPPM doesn't exist. Like, there's no NUPPM there. But a google search for them puts the company at this location. Funny how a housing service is run out of a 100 year old home?
       </del>
       The address for NUPPM shows
       <a href="https://gyazo.com/9484929d1adac2c37501423cf327d183">
        these
       </a>
       buildings, and I can only tell that one is even occupied. Now under normal circumstances I wouldn't really think this meant anything, except for the fact that Stephen Paddock conveniently sold his plane to a similar company when he was done with it. The company he sold his plane to was USH Inc, or the Universal Student Housing Inc. A google search for this company shows no website, only a Facebook page with shotty reviews. Also, it seems as if USH Inc. is hosted out of the address 424 Kelton Avenue, Los Angeles (
       <a href="https://gyazo.com/c1ee0989022dbdaf5264a65802a5e680">
        Here it shows the address
       </a>
       ). Turns out, there is actually an apartment complex that works out of that building and address, entitled the
       <a href="https://www.apartments.com/westwood-executive-house-los-angeles-ca/yq6sn4s/">
        "Westwood Executive House"
       </a>
       . What's the deal here? Why are both of these companies running a similar shady business and why do they BOTH have connections to Paddock. What do you guys see here? I smell foul play all over Vegas.
       <br/>
       &amp;nbsp;
       <br/>
       TL;DR: Paddock had direct ties to two different maybe fake companies offering shady housing services.

       I was poking down the USH theory earlier today, coupld weird things I notice about the whole ordeal being.
      </p>
      <p>
       USH inc, is not listed in Californias business database, which strikes me as odd as cali is one of those states that would generally require a business even if it is a foreign entity to register with the state.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main website has a private whois(and what legitimate company is hiding their legal name/address). I did find a second domain (not hard) which has a legit whois and was registered almost 20 years ago, but address is the same listed on USH's website. They seem to boast like they are a big outfit owning a plane and all, but they have no real reviews, like three people on yelp who've written negative reviews, and not much to really go on. Shady at best.

       I don't know if you bothered to look at the website but it's literally hollow. Their social media is non-existant and their Facebook is odd. How do they have 7000 likes but only 70 have used their service? And yes I concede the addresses were wrong, I'll fix that in the post. In the address you linked(the right one), I can't even tell than anyone lives there besides the owner. Can you?

       They have a nicer website than nuuppm. You can buy followers for social media presence. Here is a list of people that have supposedly lived there. Do you do any research to disprove the ideas in your head before typing them out and ask others?
