       He most likely had no hand in this and is the new Oswald/McVeigh/Holmes/Lanza/Tsarnaev/Field(s) of this whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       All this shit about his parking/valet habits, other people on his room service charge, etc., etc. don't matter. There have been interesting things about his connections, girlfriend &amp; wiring money â€“ evidence that he was on a state payroll. Great. He may have known about this event, but this sub is being fed a lot of distracting shit about him that makes no difference. He wasn't behind it and was probably dead before it started.

       You're right that he is just a character in this clumsy and outlandish hoax. Like Lanza he could simply be a made-up entity, but there already is a "Stephen Paddock spotted alive" video out there.

       Yeah me neither, I just saw the video like two minutes ago and honestly it's hard to even form a clear picture of what the guy actually is supposed to look like because all the pictures are so different and the two main ones have his eyes closed.

       I'm thinking that they're just that stupid and old tactics aren't working anymore â€“ and the only cards left involve bringing the whole thing down, which they're not ready to do because of money and the internet. Neither of those control elements are completely in their hands, and they rely on both.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were purposefully overt and sloppy, they wouldn't have the MSM focused on a single narrative, but introducing that doubt; they still rely on the networks to be the primary mouthpiece.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, IMHO.

       From a larp on 4chan, but an interesting theory nonetheless:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Stephen Paddock is a manufactured identity and the entire response has been managed through a crisis management firm. The reason Stephen Paddock is such a ghost is because Paddock is a constructed identity created solely for the operation. Eric Paddock is simply an actor hired to play the role of Stephen's brother. The massacre was real, but the response is not.

       I have been open to that from the start. One cell phone vid of victims has been completely scrubbed; can't find it. Other vids suggest real bullets and victims, but not completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       If real, then I believe real vids were taken off the net.

       If a hoax, then why would the perpetrators not actually kill people? Much more effective; same motives, and better results.

       There was one video that was posted late Monday night or Tuesday morning, wherein a male was going from body to body, checking for life and calling medics to anyone who was still breathing. He filmed them on the ground, close enough to see wounds/details and identify the people. I wanted to go back to it to try and find any indication that they were crisis actors â€“ but OF COURSE, I can't find it anymore and didn't download it. Do you remember seeing that one?

       Its just a flood of the same bullshit info reapeated endlessly, cycled through over and over. Endless differences of opinion and speculation accomplishes nothing. Everyone knows or can and will dispute any and all evidence. Weather he acted entirely alone or not over 50 people were killed for no reason at all and I cant presume it was caused by anything other than the evil inside this person.

       I'm thinking that they're just that stupid and old tactics aren't working anymore â€“ and the only cards left involve bringing the whole thing down, which they're not ready to do because of money and the internet. Neither of those control elements are completely in their hands, and they rely on both.

       If it were purposefully overt and sloppy, they wouldn't have the MSM focused on a single narrative, but introducing that doubt; they still rely on the networks to be the primary mouthpiece.

       Again, IMHO.

       That was a modest question, not an assertion that it totally exists.

       There was one video that was posted late Monday night or Tuesday morning, wherein a male was going from body to body, checking for life and calling medics to anyone who was still breathing. He filmed them on the ground, close enough to see wounds/details and identify the people. I wanted to go back to it to try and find any indication that they were crisis actors â€“ but OF COURSE, I can't find it anymore and didn't download it. Do you remember seeing that one?

       My jury is still out, but this doesn't look like a staged scene to me.
