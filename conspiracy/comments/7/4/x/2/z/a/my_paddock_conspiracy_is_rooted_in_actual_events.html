       I'm not a big conspiracy person but this is too fishy for me. I believe Paddock was possibly used by an agency for a Fast n Furious type situation in which we sell guns to ISIS and they are traced inward. Agency pays Paddock some dough and he launders it through the casino. ISIS affiliates tell Paddock to book a hotel at lolla then they realize there is secret service everywhere so no go, or to possibly test him out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually end up at Route 91 and things are good to go, they show up but already know what's going down with the weapon trace scheme, kill Paddock then open fire on the festival, security shows up and they shoot him then make their way back to their hotel room and act like scared patrons of the hotel, or hop up one flight to the Saudi owner four seasons, who we know helped orchestrate 9/11. The government agency knows they totally fucked up and can't let it get out so they still pin it on Paddock. It does not make sense that Paddock did this which is why I am so interested, it does make sense that ISIS did this because they have done it a shitload of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paddock was not clean, it is a statistical impossibility to make 5 mil profit in a year from video poker - you would go broke. He used video poker to launder his money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does this make sense to anyone else?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I hear the words Deep State in every comment - I DO NOT think that this is about some secret overarching gov't agency trying to influence American policy - I think they were trying to work against ISIS and got fucked over, kind of like a bay of pigs situation, hence the cover-up - they don't want people to know how badly they fucked up and that they are responsible for the largest mass shooting in the US.

       If there was any arms deal going down, I think they would be making a deal for the M240's being fired, not the 5.56 weapons supposedly being fired our paddocks window despite not video showing even a single muzzle blast from these windows.

       All that video proves is for that bust he maintained ~600 rounds per min. In the damn waveform you can see that one maintains a solid rate of fire and the other varies slightly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice the deception tacit of not showing the individual waveforms with the sound they go with and how the M240 video is played much louder then the other when combined to hide the inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video is a con trying to get views and I have given it more then I want to admit proving it a fake.

       I haven't seen a hammer yet so I'm not hung up on this. He could have used a spring loaded center punch instead which is about the size of a pen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I have issues w the gun running gone awry scenario as well. I do think he was likely a gun runner and a drug runner way back in the 80s even.  And that brings me to him being a spook especially w Lockheed Martin connections.

       Why not just tell him hey we're coming over meet you at 8:00PM, then walk over with the hammer and put the gun in his face, doesn't matter if he's suspicious of the hammer when he is about to be shot in the face.

       I'm going to copy and paste my response to another similair post, but the arms deal doesn't make a lot of sense for a lot of reasons (the hammer to break the windows from another comment in this thread, for example), but for one I can answer from research experience:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Him meeting with some ISIS buy team is such a ridiculous claim though. I study the SCW and MENA as a hobby and they certainly don't need to buy American weapons from arms dealers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regardless of what position you take on the subject of the war, the American supported players in ME get their weapons and training hand delivered and simply looking over a SCW/MENA small arms Twitter account shows how thriving the weapons market is over there. They have all the weapons they need, they don't need to clandestinely buy them from some white dude in a hotel (probably the worst place to a covert Arms deal)
       </p>

       I also study this a lot, have done a few white papers on it, and can think of one thing I think you're missing. They wouldn't need the guns for MENA - they would need them for use here in the US, especially if they are illegal or already being watched.

       Just a thought.

       Hey, would love to read some of your stuff sometime. I think that's a great point to make as well, and was brought up when I wrote the original comment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is I have no idea why ISIS, or any terror organization for that matter, would not jump on the publicity of killing an 'agent of the infidels' and the subsequent massacre. Seems like some great PR, especially since they're so desperate to push for any PR, especially the timeless counter-espionage propaganda they're so well versed in.

       This is what I'm trying to convey, they never needed the weapons for use abroad - they said, hey bud we're sick of these bullshit weapons we are using and want to get some good US stuff, how about we check some of your stuff out and we can do a lot of business in the future - never intending to actually do this, they just wanted to commit a terror act.

       This deep state nonsense is bullshit - during fast n furious ATF sold weapons to cartels to track them and lost track, there isn't some weird "deep state" (which I don't think any of you are in consensus on what that means) conspiracy. They are trying to take down ISIS and this is one way, just like how ATF was attempting to take down cartel.

       If that was the case that there was a arms deal to try and track down ISIS, why would they buy guns in the US... to bring back?  Are you saying track ISIS on US soil though?  Even if that was the case, I don't think ISIS is stupid enough to make a massive arms deal inside one of the most heavily monitored areas in the country (that surprisingly has no video footage of anything that happened)

       I'm not saying I believe the FBI/CIA/Etc is covering something up (I do have my doubts, though) .. but why do you just believe there were cameras setup?

       But if they’re really involved why wouldn’t they stick around and martyr themselves or at least try to inflict more damage instead of dipping out like that?

       So it's not that you're wondering why they haven't taken credit, it's that you don't believe them. Two different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why they'd dip out. That's easy. Another attack is planned. Why stick around for the mayhem if you can turn another peaceful event into chaos rather easily.

       Yes thank you for clarifying. I am wondering about a lot of things with the LV deal, but you’re correct I don’t believe it was tied to them. 
There way too many unanswered questions and obvious mistakes so to speak. In another thread I mentioned that TPTB are either getting lazy or bold. The more I read and “uncover” the more I begin to question whether their mistakes weren’t intentional. If that makes sense.

       OP I follow along with part of your theory but not all. See above.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree that there are enough known "conspiracy theory" type incidents to build from, even if many people STILL refuse to accept them despite incredible evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, and given the timing of other incidents, the Awan Contra Spy Ring needs to be reviewed for possible ties. I believe there was a Dumbo Drop incident at MB in 2014 so it's possible, especially given the length of tentacles on this damn Awan situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       These patterns repeat themselves so your reasoning is sound. It's the details that need hashing out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gov and deep State are putting out ted herrings and disinformation all over the place. That alone tells me there's massive fuckery at play.
