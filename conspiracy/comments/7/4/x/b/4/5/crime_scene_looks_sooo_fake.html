<p>This is only 1 of the few leaks circulating around. The crime scene looks extremely staged to me. Perhaps the weirdest thing about it to me is the way the guns are scattered around like it&#39;s a gallery. I won&#39;t get into the whole weapon deal gone bad theory here, that&#39;s for a later time.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t mean to praise shooters in any way but had Paddock planned and executed this is he would nothing short of a genius. Elevated position, large crowd, secluded with 1 way entry point, etc. That being said, if you had a plan to shoot into a large crowd for the purpose of killing wouldn&#39;t you have your fucking guns near the window? Why are they scattered out all over the room setup up so well. Everything looks too perfect. If you are focused on doing as much damage as possible you have your guns and ammo ready at your position. </p>

<p>This is only one part of the crime scene issue. I have many theories myself but let&#39;s just say this man couldn&#39;t have honestly thought he needed 18 weapons and those weapons weren&#39;t meant to be used in the shooting. Something more is going on here.</p>

I read they also had to blast the ajoining room door because it was locked why would that be locked if he is traveling between rooms to fire. That is just some of the issues with the room.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a leaked photo of his &quot;self inflicted&quot; wound which shows very little blood from a hitler style suicide. I failed to mention it in my post but look at the way his body is postioned. Is it common to shoot yourself in the head and fall PERFECTLY flat on your back, arms at your side? Where&#39;s the blood? Whether he was kneeling, standing, or laying down when I supposedly committed suicide his body should not be in that position. The scene looks very strange and staged.</p>
