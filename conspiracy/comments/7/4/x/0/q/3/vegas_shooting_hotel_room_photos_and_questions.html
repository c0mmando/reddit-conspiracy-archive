        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Someone please correct me if I&#39;m wrong as most of this is just pulled from my personal experience with firearms. Paddock supposedly set up a sniper nest inside the hotel room, meaning no rifle extended beyond the window, setting up a clear line of sight hidden from outside view. </p>

<p>If you&#39;ve ever shot a lot of rifle or pistol in an indoor range, there is a significant amount of smoke and gas expelled with every shot. More than you think. How could he see at all in an unventilated hotel room after firing hundreds, or thousands of rounds? </p>

<p>The hotel photos also show few casings around the room. If he was shooting, brass usually ejects in one direction, depending on the setup. Sometimes it can take chunks out of the wood surrounding shooting bays, let alone soft, painted drywall. I usually end up collecting brass at the range to reload ammo and 500-1000 casings of handgun brass absolutely litters the floor. </p>

<p>I saw barely any brass, interior damage or anything of the sort anywhere in those photos. If it was a true investigation, would they not be allowed to touch anything in the room until that investigation is complete? Why would they be remove brass from the scene before taking photographs? I do understand it was a large room, but he shot in one direction the entire time, meaning most of the brass likely ejected in one direction, to the right and behind him (if he was right handed). </p>

<p>Was the body far enough away from the window that the brass is excluded from view? Because there was some scattered brass in his own blood. Why was there just a few casings there? To further validate doctored photos?</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t he also have a rifle resting on his leg in the deceased photo? His sidearm fell above his head, making me think he was standing during the supposed suicide when he fell backwards. How does a rifle fall on your leg while offing yourself standing? </p>

<p>Edit: I retract an earlier statement about the directional ejection of a spent casing. Here is a video of the brass ejecting on an AR in slow motion. The brass likely didn&#39;t cause any interior room damage but would likely end up in a general area in the hotel room. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one thing that some people have said is he broke multiple windows to allow ventilation but only shoot from one window, he gains no difference in angle from the two windows. </p>

<p>I am with you that I have plenty of range experience and that is true with the smoke and gas. “Supposedly” there was a breathing apparatus in his room and you see a blue tube in one of the pictures that could be it, that would help during the thousands of rounds fired. </p>

<p>Firing 200 rounds into the hotel room door yet only hit “El Savior Campos” with 1 round is highly unlikely as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ever work with a draft before?  Even opening up one window would do virtually nothing for ventilation.  It took me a solid full year at college to realize opening up your window is useless unless their is a draw of fresh air.  Open up your window, crack your door into the hallway an inch, prop open one of the doors downstairs leading outside and as long as their is no barrier inbetween everything you will find yourself a draft.  Those hotels are completely airtight.  There&#39;s no way one window quite a distance away would do anything for ventilation in the short period of time that he was firing.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the downvote I should have been more clear.  You need some sort of airflow or pressure differences in order to create a draft....  Simply opening up 2 windows in the same room/area will do practically nothing.  Sure the smoke will go out slowly, but at an extremely low rate.  If there was wind or some sort that may be different but would still be extremely inefficient in his situation.  You  generally need a place with higher and lower pressure.  Generally a door or window on the other side/lower side of a building will work.  Opening up two windows in one hotel room will do practically nothing.  Opening up 2 windows in his hotel rooms would absolutely not work.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t downvote you, but if making petty comments in retaliation makes you feel better, do you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re wrong about the windows, btw. All there needs to be is a breeze up there and two windows, depending on placement, will have a draft. In this case the windows weren&#39;t on the same plane of the building, which would help a draft. I have opened windows like this, literally in Las Vegas, and only the crack they let you.. and there is a really decent amount of airflow. Why does this sub love completely baseless speculation so much?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are supposed to believe that he stood on those chairs that were pushed together.. holding his weapon.. firing a tight cluster 1400 ft away or the window..  done to hide the muzzle flashes.  All too convenient of explanations that don&#39;t hold up to logical scrutiny and reality imo.</p>

<p>My theory on suicide, if it was is that, he knew his brain was fried and wanted to preserve it for autopsy and to give family an explanation.. so he did the NFL suicide to the chest, but missed his heart, so then ate the gun 11 seconds later in an act to end the suffering. He&#39;d be in the ground after the chest shot, so somewhat explains the too clean of a fall and landing backwards.</p>
