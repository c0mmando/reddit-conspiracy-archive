       Now think about how many people must've been down on the strip during the chaos.  If there were hundreds of ppl getting gunned down anywhere on the strip, the entire downtown area would be on alert.  This involves a large portion of people whipping out their cell phone to record the situation!  It's obvious when you think about it!

        Here is a very clearly laid out reason why this raises a huge red flag.

       Guys, this is way too massive for them to cover up.  They are brigading this subreddit constantly, harder than ever before.  What they don't know yet, is they CANT WIN; sad to see them try so hard though...

       There were absolutely multiple shooters.  No doubt, ONE.HUNDRED.PERCENT.  Ignore Paddock, he is just a patsy that is taking the focus of this enormous charade that cost the lives of innocent civilians just like us.

       We are empowering our hive mind through cooperation which is a formula of N(squared) with N being the number of cooperaring participants. Cooperation is the opposite of divide and conquer. It’s what will kill the cabal if too many people cooperate at once.

       They are starting to. All this time they refused to cooperate on a massive scale because they felt that there no reward in it. Also, Hollywood uses brainwashing systems to trick us into thinking an every man for himself society is optimal. Capatalism does that to us to. However, the world has degenerated to such a horrible place that the people are being forced to team up to fix it or else continue with decades of massive suffering. The pain forced us into cooperating. We just upped our game in 2016 and all that effort will bear fruit as heavyweight cabal members fall apart and their entire empire crumbles leaving us a black slate to build upon. At that point, the people will truly realize the magic behind cooperation. Later, when we march into the golden age, cooperation will fully be understood and will become a respected social construct that is later taught to children in school. People will push cooperation to it  limits to better understand it. Once the rewards start rolling in, people will understand this. We will be sad that we didn’t think of this earlier and marvel at how we missed something so obviously beneficial.

       He is massively in debt. I'm not trying to say he doesn't have a lot of cash, just that he is a money junkie. He needs money coming in to pay on his debts. His behavior is sufficient evidence that he is not a billionaire. He's just the spokesman for a billion dollar company his father gave him.

       He's made billions in the hospitality industry. About the most public facing line of business you can get into. He may be cunning, and deft of ways to legally skirt the system, but you're the one who's been conned if you think he hasn't been fantastic at giving people what they want. What do they want right now? Someone not beholden to outside money as president. That's how he won. What's he get of it? Glory to his name, which he's always been obsessed with, and oh yeah his kids might just be able to live in an America that doesn't resemble Brazil where they might actually have an opportunity to enjoy the wealth he's spent a lifetime building.

       He's put so many honest contractors out of jobs. As a contractor that's been ripped off after putting my all into a job I can never applaud a man who hires small local businesses to do big jobs, has them put there own man hours and money into it with a small start up check from Trump to get going. Than says we'll u don't get more til ur done, they out in there money to finish, than he pays them a third of what the job was bid.. than says sue me and they are too broke too. He's done it to thousands of people and you are kidding yourself if you think he has good intentions for you.

       You might be a good contractor but you then especially know how many shitty ones there are and how often things are overbid,
       <em>
        especially
       </em>
       in New York. Besides that, if you're a shitty contractor that just tried to pull one over and got called out, you're going to be more inclined to run your mouth about it publicly if the guy is Donald Trump. Funny too we didn't hear about any of that really until election time.

       Photovoltaic solar cells are making great strides. In fact there was a university that made solar cells out of the junk in car batteries. Solar power is only limited by how clever our scientists working on it are. There will be a point where big energy companies will have to jump on the bandwagon or die.

       Capitalism generates wealth, it's not as if resources exist in one giant pie and capitalism is some devious way the elite have figured it how to take more of their pie.

       I don't know anything about sacred economics, but how does it reward those who take greater risk? Not everyone

       Too many have no clue we don't live in a capitalistic system and haven't for like 100 years at least. The mixed system we have right now allows the state a great scapegoat because they get people to blame "capitalism" when really what you're watching is gran scale regulatory capture.

       They are hiding so much of our resources and technology, that if the people found out, we would go in there and kill them with our bare hands. The reason they hide it is because holding onto it gives them more power. 2 examples:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They claim supply is low to jack up prices to points where everything is barely affordable for most. This is why people are hungry. They can’t afford to consume. Prices are artificially high.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         They only release technology when it’s a must. When they do, they create a company where they put a corporate stooge at the top selling very old tech the cabal has been hoarding from 50 years ago. They tell you they built this tech in a garage but that’s just a cover story.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Theres a lot to explain but sacred economics, if done properly with the proper laws and worldwide, would lead to an insanely wealthy planet where people share everything, there is more than enough to go around, and people work their passions.

       Who is doing that? Where and by what means do you think they have stole tax money to do so? No way to do that in a pure free market system.
      </p>
      <p>
       From an economist standpoint though my point stands, which is that wealth is generated. I agree that through illegal seizure and money printing our wealth has disappeared

      <p>
       The central problem is the insistence on victimhood.  The cabal are other people who have done evil things to us, but we only need to appoint the right governmental parent, and then they will only do good things for us, and change our nappies when we need it, and make sure that we have a warm bottle, that we can go back to mindlessly watching cat videos with the assurance that everything will be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to stop wanting to put another parental organisation into power so that they can go back to sleep, and instead take permanent responsibility for themselves.

       No thanks.  I've had enough Utopianism to last me for the rest of my life at this point.  I don't mind co-operating with people online, but I'm not going to delude myself that that by itself will create a better society.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Utopia hypothetically ever was going to exist, there would be literally no form of centralised government at all, and if the psychopathic minority tried to trick us into having one, the attempt would be recognised and rejected immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, co-operation is fine, but I don't want "unity."  All centralised political unity means is that the rest of us have psychopaths making our most important life decisions.  Co-operation needs to be able to start and stop whenever it is necessary, and people must likewise be entirely free to join new groups and leave old ones at any time.

       It’s not easy to lose all that power. It’s actually hellish for these dark entities to lose all of that. Even if they didn’t get jail time, the loss of power would be much more painful than we can imagine.

       I didn't draw the map but it is so something I would do.. I'm dying laughing. I love that map. Some guy just drawing with his finger on his phone is cracking me up. That red circle is the connecting "red string" of 2017.

       Of course, no I'm with you. Just the thought of someone finding a casing after any incident like this is sort of eerie....I don't know, man, I'm stoned out of my gourd and I've been balls deep in this sub all day because I started questioning the media reports. I saw one post that led to another, which eventually led me here....

       I agree with OP's optimism. I feel a surge in the collective to question the narrative and it seems the focus has shifted from fear to conquest. What I mean by that correlates with op. Our connectivity has become an advantage over the msm narrative here. We are viewing the event live through cameras that aren't theirs.

       where is this supposed pic of him being shot in the chest?  I mean, I saw the vid with the 2 single gunshots at the end of the shooting, but I've only seen the one pic where he is shot in the mouth.

       You see blood coming from his mouth. That doesn't mean he was shot in the mouth. Easy assumption to make though. After seeing the picture I thought the same thing. But it makes sense that he'll have massive internal bleeding from a shot in the chest too, which will come out of his mouth.

       Okay... But where is the photo that shows a chest wound?  Am I to believe that blood coming from his mouth as the result of putting a gun in his mouth and pulling the trigger is more far fetched than him being shot in the chest and he coughs up blood from his lungs... without any evidence being presented to show a chest wound?

       I'm not saying there's another picture that shows a chest wound. Just saying that the pic we do have (blood coming from mouth) is not inconsistent with a chest wound.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course it could be a shot in the mouth too. It's not far fetched to think that. Like I said, when I saw the picture for the first time I just assumed he put a gun in his mouth too.

       So basically people just made up the chest wound to fit a narrative of someone else in the room that killed him without any real evidence... Great. This really is r/conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose a chest wound would also be more likely to partially blow out his left eyeball than a bullet traveling through the back of his head?

       I'm fairly sure the sheriff or someone at one of the press conferences said he shot himself in the chest / stomach. I didn't hear about it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know people do commit suicide by shooting themselves in the chest sometimes, right? It doesn't have to mean someone else shot him.

       I did a quick search when I replied before. Couldn't find it. Maybe it wasn't him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I'm open to either possibility... shot himself in the mouth or chest. I'm not pushing a "second shooter in the room" story so it's not a huge deal either way.

       Just something I was thinking of. Thinking there was another in the other room. He has a clear shot at padd. Takes the shot and leaves locking the door on the way out. Just a thought I had. You can see on padds shirt it looks like blood. Like he was shot in chest and head. Again just something I'm thinking about

       Or simply mistakes from very scared people calling 911? I know people who were there on the scene. They said they had no idea where the fire was coming from at first because the sound echoed everywhere. Then you get idiots who start calling in with intentionally misleading information because they are idiots. I don't know what is wrong with those people.

       If you listen to the LV police net tapes all the reported shootings outside of Mandalay were quickly proven to be false. There were multiple teams sweeping all the reported incidents and in all cases the hotel staff and folks at those locations could not confirm shots fired.
      </p>
      <p>
       What should be more concerning from a conspiracy POV is why were there multiple false reports all at the same time swat arrived on the 29th floor and when they breached on the 32nd floor. Who was making these false reports? Why? Was it just confusion or deliberate.

       Could you explain how they were proven false? AFIK it hasn't been debunked yet other than you claiming it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However if it is debunked, the fact that false reports were circulating en mass is very concerning. At the same time a lot of these reports are form social media from people who were there. 
I understand confusion and fog of war to happen but there's too many reports of other shootings, one even apparently 30 mins after the official one.

       Of course there is little info to go on but the police tapes are good. In each case the operator broadcasts a report of a shooting and checks in the CP with a phone call confirmation with the hotel staff and in each case a team reports in with eyewitness interviews or by a clearing sweep. Now you can argue they were all acting but it all sounded like real comm traffic. We do not have any transcripts or audio from any of the secure swat or fbi lines only the police net and it sounded legit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do have military background and spent a lot of time on radios and the traffic on that net was very professional and good. It was chaotic early with confused reports of shooter location and number of suspects but as the event progressed they zeroed in on the 29th and 32nd floor. Put a team on 32 waited for swat. Swat started sweeping from 29 up while evacuating guests as they went. It was by the book. The team on 32 evacuated guests and waited for 29/30/31 to be cleared.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest issue in my opinion is the timing of the breach and all the sudden reports of gunfire at other locations. It seemed way to timed to create confusion with the police.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for other reports of shooting ... it could have been deliberate decoy (which the cops oddly stated many times - which is a factor of their training). Each time the reports were followed up and written off they became more concerned with deception.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people making reports were probably seeing walking wounded running around and making assumptions about where shooters were based on the hysteria. It’s easy to get confused in a mess as big as that one.

       When I hear about reports of gunfire at other locations, I imagine people running around outside in a sort of chaos screaming about someone shooting everyone. Then I imagine someone hearing that and running into the building to scream about someone right outside shooting people. Then I imagine everyone in the building hearing that someone was shooting people inside. Then I just imaging a bunch of very stunned and confused people.

       I tend to agree - throw in a few people with actual injuries running around and imaginations will run like crazy. The police audio is so crazy right at the time of the breach. The operator is taking multiple calls of gunfire even at places previous teams called all clear. It seemed very deliberate.

       People report gunshots all the time when in fact there weren’t any at all. There was all kinds of confusion and stress. Not saying it didn’t happen but what they heard could have been anything. Without actual audio or a body it is just hearsay.

       Shelter in Place is a very good strategy.  You control who is coming in and going, and (potentially) isolate people from danger and don't flood the area with potential victims/targets.  Short of a explosive device, there is really nothing that can penetrate the hotel, so like a bomb shelter of old, it's a safe place to ride out the storm.

       I get that. But the lady in the vid said that there was so much panic and surety of a shooter there that her husband dove on top of her. Like wtf is going on? Media whore perhaps?

       People react differently to danger.  I've known of shelter in place since I worked at an office that was in the path of Hurricanes, and they released a handbook on how to deal with natural disasters.

       Imagine one person around an officer hears "Shots fired" come across a radio or something similar.  All it takes is one person, or one couple to hear something like that and start running and yelling to set off an entire chain reaction.  Soon the 4th person down the line is telling people that they saw people running from a shooter.

       Is this a huge intentional fake news campaign, including confusion about how many guns and shooters, and location... Inexplicable strobe light or two in lower floors of MB... False report at other locations... All of the evidence can be easily explained away. Almost like it's meant to fester for a while, then all the evidence leaks that proves without a doubt it was a single shooter... Wait for the release of the video evidence of him loading suitcases into his room  day after day, just completely quashing that question.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also not ur about OP, who somehow notices that there IS no video evidence of shooters elsewhere, but concludes that there were still multiple shooters elsewhere...
      </p>
      <p>
       Just wait for expert audio analysis to without a doubt prove there was only one shooter... Watch.

       It sure does seem intentional. That strobe was discussed by the police once they focused on mandalay. One cop calls out half way up he saw windows broken and gunfire. Another calls out the strobe. Then someone asks if it could be a decoy. All real time. They all seemed really sensitive to deceptive tactics through the event. Maybe they were well trained and ready for those types of tactics.

       Because when people freak out they make mistakes or get paranoid and there are always false reports of multiple shooters and shooters at wrong locations. People hear echoes or hear distant gun fire and think it's close by because they are freaked out and never heard gun shots before. Most panicked people are terribly unreliable, poor communicators and this is amplified by crowds and social media. Also the gun fire was probably echoing across the strip.

       There's no cell phone video because you wouldn't be able to locate the direction of fire as easily from that distance. So nothing to video. Also you probably be in a bar or club, or otherwise not giving a Cingular fuck about anything in your immediate vicinity.

       please, guys.  its ridiculously obvious how many shills are trying to diverge the conversation in this thread.  they somehow don't find it strange that amongst thousands of people, nobody caught the action during these lockdowns, nobody up in their hotel room with a view over the strip recorded what was going on down there with all the ppl being forced inside?
      </p>
      <p>
       all that backed up with the ridiculous amount of witness statements.  the media won't even mention the possibility of multiple shooters elsewhere on the strip, but they will spam stories about conspiracy theories all being false.  wtf is going on???
      </p>
      <p>
       okay, seriously real talk from me to everyone shilling...  we're all human here, we all equally have no idea what our place in the universe is...we know that time will continue to go on, and your actions cannot be unwritten, and thats okay...its awesome actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       so think about the damage you are causing to millions of lives by supporting this evil...  get on the right side of history.  future humans will look back and be disgusted that this corruption was so wide spread, and wonder how we could be so blind to the massive propaganda net that manipulates a huge portion of us.  you guys are going to lose, the first one to stand up is the strongest, your coworkers will follow, trust me!  please...be that shill (lol)

       You want to be important so badly, don't you? "I'm right and everyone who disagrees with me is a shill!" There is no proof of multiple shooters, and proof that there was 1 shooter. Work with what you have, not with what you want to have.

       You can literally see spotlights/stagelights panning over the crowd twice before the gunshots started. The last one happened to sync up with the gunshots. On top of this, the light is solid the whole time as it pans over, not flashing in sync with said gunshots.

       You're an absolute embarrassment to your family kid holy shit kys. No one will miss you. Your family and friends will feel relieved and celebrate. that's how worthless your life is lmao. Literally no one cares about you. Any friends that you have are only social with you because they feel bad for you or are scared that they will end on your hit list when you eventually shoot up a public space. Your parents probably though you were going to grow up and be a scientist or an astronaut but look at you now LUL. so sad xd

       I dunno the more I see vids like this the more I believe the narrative. People were laughing and chatting in the BG. No one looked particularly scared. This woman seemed to be acting. She couldn't show us the Belagio broken lobby becasue it wasn't broken. Yes I believe it was on lock down but not becasue it was shot up as well. Surely someone would have taken pics of the lobby the next day or whatever. People are screaming for video of Paddock in Mandaly, rightly so, but we're gonna take this lady's word for it with no evidence whatsoever?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the way she talked to the lady guarding the casino floor, she intentionally was super duper vague and did not mention Belagio was shot. Gimmie more evidence, I don't believe this lady.

       I'm not a shill and I don't believe the official story. But if this is all fake how do you explain 22,000 people sticking to the lie? Even if they were all paid $100 million dollars to keep quiet eventually one of them would leak the truth.

       I'm not saying you're wrong, but if you're right, did you consider maybe it isn't a cover up and maybe they're keeping information about multiple accomplices being loose private to prevent public fear/allow the shooters to think they're free so they'll be easier to catch?

       Definitely fair enough, I'm just pointing out that in a subreddit dedicated to being skeptical of the world around us, we should also be skeptical of our own theories and not just go "multiple shooters = coverup" and consider other reasons there could've been multiple shooters.

       Evidently a massive cover up fail is when everyone that is paradoxically both apart of and not apart of the "cover up" is the source of all the information that "proves" it's fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fascinating that you will in one breath call the MSM apart of the conspiracy, and in the very next breath say "look at how everyone is realizing how fake this is! (because of all this information in the news).

       This.  It’s possible (likely) that the whole LV attack was totally unrelated, and something more significant happening elsewhere in the world while everyone’s eyes were on LV.

       I really hope that people keep digging, the updates and theories are improving. Even the retarded ones are useful somewhat. Keep in mind though that the paranoia of "this sub has 10,000 new people on it!!!" Has A LOT to do with this event being fresh and a lot of people having questions about what the media is saying. I'm one of those new lurkers as I've never really been active here before. Don't think of every new person on here as a sleeper agent for the globalists have a little bit more of an open mind that a lot of us are regular people from the front page of Reddit that are looking to you guys to shed some light on some stuff. Some of the posts have made me really think and some have made me roll my eyes. Either way, never settle for answers unless you've done your research.

       That is a good point. I will point out that this subs users shot up around 3k 24 hours before the shooting.  A few searches and you should find some threads pointing this out.  A botnet or something was connecting to this sub prior to the shooting.

That guy had a pretty good point about the casinos maybe wanting to keep it quiet for $$$ reasons. They have to keep that money flowing somehow. Casinos in Vegas are fucked anyhow.

       So it can be used as reason to get laws passed. Go to war. Take rights away. Etc, etc. I don't know what the motive is or if they're keeping secrets for other reasons. But they definitely have information they're not releasing.

       Sorry, but the conspiracy theorist in me thinks that it was supposed to "look" like a coverup gone wrong. To what end? To satisfy "most" conspiracy theorists, like this subreddit, and give them bones to chew on for a few weeks. TPTB have had decades of experience and planning to know how to implement these things without mistakes. They're probably laughing at us as we speak, seeing as how they got the desired effect.

       Oh, and have a look at
       <a href="https://imgur.com/jKoKtds">
        this photo
       </a>
       I saw here yesterday. The devil horns hand symbol is prominent on the left, by the concert where the people were. The concert event is also called "harvest" (do I have to explain that one?). See the sheer in-your-face mockery TPTB engage in. I doubt there would be room for trip ups and mistakes.

       Some of it seems so obviously covered up, even 'normal' people who believe MsM are questioning it this time. Also with the presence of social media etc they knew this would blow up, but I don't think the deep state care. I agree with you, the obvious symbolism is everywhere, which leads me to believe they want to us conspiracists to be thrown off.

       Ok guys. So, we're all being great investigators. Great keyboard warriors. Most people are very skeptical of their narrative and that's GOOD. Now what? I'll tell you what. Organization. PROTEST. Come on folks, if they could "occupy wall street" and then wear pussy hats after Trump's election, who is going to organize a protest? To demand answers regarding the murder of 58 citizens, and maiming of hundreds more? When and where do we begin? I will be there when it does.

       I guess it would have to start with the victims still alive, and the families of the deceased. Anyone else tries to protest this and it will just look bad. But all the interviews are standard hero this, good parent that, bla bla bla, loved to smile, everyone loved them. The shock is going to have to ware off, and hopefully they haven't been offered hush money from wherever. But these people are being interviewed by GMA and 20/20, and if they're complicit in this whole misdirection, anyone questioning it is on their own.

       If there was more shooters then there would be video of them. Also they have nothing to gain from hiding the existence of multiple shooters. It's just more reason to spend more on defense. Not to mention, the more active shooters there were the more likely they would be filming or live casting for their propaganda videos. and they definitely have no reason to let the police get away with such an easily disproven lie.

       As sad as this is to say on one hand, there was actually a beauty of how quickly people dug into this right away and not just blindly listening to the news and what we were told. The armies of internet slueths were on duty and it didn't take long at all to start finding the threads to pull and the holes too poke.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me that is a very good sign people are waking up. Before when I post things the shills would be all over it and how crazy I am. This event, I'm actually hearing crickets with the things I can sharing. Pretty hard to deny things when the pictures are right in your face.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish all those people could coordinate what happened to them and make a LOT of noise with their proof and demand the news do something about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder if anyone has considered talking to someone at the hospitals that would know how many deaths came in that night and start adding up those actual numbers. Clearly they didn't all happen at the concert, but it would be easy to mix them into that count.

       It really is strange, even IRL co-workers who used to deride me for not accepting the official story for JFK, 9/11, etc. are now mentioning to me how much of a false flag this Las Vegas event is. Its bizarre, these are people so misinformed they tried to suggest I was a loon because I believe the JFK magic bullet theory, until I informed them that the magic bullet is the government's theory. Now Charlottesville and this they are coming to me talking about how fake it is. Its strange how quickly it turned, I've been awake for at least a decade and never seen so many sheep off the internet starting to get it themselves. I wonder why the deep state is making these things so obvious, I think they could a much better job had they wanted to, its almost like they want everyone to know its them.

       Hi there are many types of false flags. Some like 911 involve real deaths and only a small amount of hoaxery. These we can pinpoint the who, the how etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there are false flags like Sandy Hook, which are almost entirely ficticious, which are designed to have a large number of red herrings designed to maximise time CT waste and infighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       This Los Angles false flag seems to fit into that category.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to VT, Google AI designs the scripts for the false flags and the roll out of the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Failure of these false flags to be believed may be due to AI not understanding humans properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe AI wants the population to know the Government is doing false flags to maximise chance of civil revolt and later martial law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is faking a mass shooting Legal? Does it just count as propaganda and not terrorism or fraud?

       Massive cover-ups have been happening for decades if not centuries. We are just more aware of it now because of the internet. Think about have JFK happened 54 years ago and the Federal Reserve was installed through lies and propaganda over 100 years ago. If you really want to dive down the rabbit hole then look up Admiral Byrd and "Operation High Jump" from 1947. What happened in Vegas was child's play compared to some of the larger coverups in history.

       REMINDER: People are rarely exposed to ideas outside their own palette while online. This is only becoming more true given the rise of modern reddit styled forums, youtubes algorithms, and the outright censorship.

       What we need is clear cut evidence that can fit into an infographic which can be shared online. Although it will take about 3 days until the countermeasure of money and influence kicks in. Jimmy Kimmel and Morgan Freeman pretend to cry on camera. Life goes on as normal.

       I'd be interested to see what the coverup is, though:
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, let's remember something:  The Deep State absolutely did want to prevent unrest when Obama was in office -- it's one of the reasons that the birthers were finally told by the FBI (or was it the CIA?) to quiet down to prevent riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, with White Power Trump in the Oval Office, have we gotten to the point that the Deep State actually wants a HOT Civil War in this country, because, if this thing is a coverup, that's probably what's going to happen here...

       Just as the top poster said, I don't normally lurk or post here, but I have been interested in the things said here about this event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are my thoughts though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe no one uploaded videos because there was nothing that interesting in those locations? Just an idea. Maybe all the action was localized to Mandalay. I'm not saying for sure there was one gut behind all this, but I'm also not certain there was more than one.
      </p>
      <p>
       And maybe they locked down other hotels because they weren't certain where the shooter was?

       LOL.  Because YouTube/LiveLeak is known for their respective LACK of shit video uploads.
      </p>
      <p>
       99% of the videos aren't worth watching and show NOTHING of actual events.  They're still uploaded.

       This shooting, just like Pulse in Orlando, IS 100% HOAX.

       Yeah, because there is no other way to share a video online besides YouTube and Liveleak. I'm sure no one would download it and then re-upload it. If someone has a video of events somewhere else in Vegas unfolding, we would see it. You cannot control people uploading videos, someone somewhere would've seen these videos by now.

       Can I just clarify. If I question or dispute this does that automatically make me a shill, or are we allowed to have a mature debate or discussion about view from more than one side of the argument? Do shills get paid more than a guy working in Tesco? If so I'm up for that.

       Dude, have you watch the videos that do exist. There were people IN THE HOTEL who didn't seem to realize anything was going on. You really think that people on the strip knew what was going on? Have you ever been to Vegas? There is so much noise, so many people, I'm sure that if you were a block away, you probably wouldn't even know what was happening. It's not like there were hundreds of people running down the Vegas strip to get away from the shooter. Most people hid close by in fear of getting mowed down if they ran.

       Sad part is, the people have become so apathetic that a "cover up" isn't even needed. Just watch, another week will go by, the media will just write this off as an unexplainable loan gunman event.

       Not to mention how Google and YouTube is banning peoples first hand accounts and personal videos of the event. This is some 1983 level suppression on a whole new level and reeks of coverup.

       Photovoltaic solar cells are making great strides. In fact there was a university that made solar cells out of the junk in car batteries. Solar power is only limited by how clever our scientists working on it are. There will be a point where big energy companies will have to jump on the bandwagon or die.

       Hmmm, lack of an answer and a downvote. Classic "Trump move". But seriously what this sub doesn't know yet is it can't win; cute to see it try so hard though.
