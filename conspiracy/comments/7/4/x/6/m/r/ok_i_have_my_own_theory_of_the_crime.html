       Paddock has met a new, younger woman who he's been having an affair with. What he doesn't know is she's a honey pot federal operative.  As their relationship grows, she asks him to take her to Vegas on his next big gambling trip. He agrees. In a coincidence that is anything but, Paddock gets an email from Mandalay Bay offering him the big high rollers suite for an entire week, (9/25-10/1).

       Reservations are also made in his name at hotels overlooking concerts around the country and in LV the week earlier.

       They check in and things go so well Paddock wires his girlfriend $100,000 to buy a house in the Philippines, a gesture she interprets as his way of breaking up with her.

       Paddock is seen around the casino with the honey pot agent.

       That same employee who set up the suite and is in on the plot, books the adjoining room under Paddock's name on the 28th, unbeknownst to Paddock.

       In that adjoining room, suitcases of guns stolen from Paddock's home are wheeled in over several days.

       Paddock has no idea and does not have a key to that room, nor does he have access through the inside door.  Also rolled in are belt-fed longer range weapons that are better able to hit concert goers from such a long distance and fire more rounds than anything stolen from Paddock's home ever could.

       Several of Paddock's rifles are modified with bump stocks to help explain the discrepancy.

       Sunday afternoon, the honey pot asks to borrow Paddock's SUV to go run an errand. He gives her the keys and his gfs valet card.  She takes the SUV to a warehouse to have it filled with various types of legal but lethal explosives.

       , but Paddock will never see her again. She, however, has forgotten her cell phone charger in the suite.
       <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/mystery-investigators-discover-charger-incompatible-vegas-gunmans-cellphones-hotel-suite/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sunday evening, the real shooter(s) is/are in position in the adjoining room ready to start the operation. He or another team have earlier entered Paddock's suite while he is at the video poker machines and began moving in Paddock's guns from the adjoining room and start generally setting up the crime scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is in place except one thing: Paddock isn't in his suite, he's still paying video poker.  He's had a good week, even if he's starting to wonder where the new love of his life has disappeared to.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't a problem. Paddock was to be lured away from the room and lured back at the right time by a few different scenarios.  They can't use the honey pot anymore because Paddock has to be alone in the suite, and he can't be seen to be with anyone this close to zero hour.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have Jesus Campos their security guard whose in on it (This is just a theory, if you're reading this Jesus) to approach Paddock at the video poker machine and ask him if he's in 32135. He says he is and Jesus tells him he just got a door alarm from his suite and after investigating he thinks there might have been a break in in his room. He asks Paddock to follow him up there and determine if anything's missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       They take the elevator up to 32nd floor. As they enter the suite Paddock is subdued and murdered and placed in position to make it look like suicide.  Gloves are put on his hands to avoid any lack of fingerprints on the weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooting begins from the adjoining room with the carefully setup heavy artillery.  Campos is in the adjoining room with the operators, monitoring the hallway via gopros on the room service cart. Anytime a guest pokes their head out, he tells them to get back inside, giving the impression the situation is being responded to. His ultimate job is to kill any would-be citizen hero who might take it upon themselves to try to stop the shooting. They know the SWAT team will take at least 10-15 minutes to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once SWAT is close to coming up on the elevator, which was shut off for safety and must be specially started again for SWAT, and the team in the stairwell is close to breaking through the obstruction placed on the 32nd floor stairwell door, Campos fakes a leg wound and the operaters spray the hallway through the suite doors. They then break a window in the suite, before they disappear into other rooms as guests.
      </p>
      <p>
       SWAT shows up and Campos directs them to 32135.  He tells them he was responding to the suite door alarm going off when he was sprayed with bullets. He claims to have been unaware of the massive shooting taking place from the widow.

       SWAT enters into a barricade mode.
       <a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-las-vegas-response/">
        13
       </a>
       This had been expected by the operators.  Campos insists on sticking around to help evacuate the floor.

       </a>
       Conveniently, he starts with the room the operators are in, now disguised as guests. After a while the SWAT incredulously asks him if he shouldn't be seeking medical attention, to which he agrees and and leaves.

        15
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually SWAT blow open the door but Paddock is dead. Before SWAT can relax, the adjoining room must be checked out, but the operators locked it from both sides before disappearing. SWAT blow out the connecting door

       </a>
       but inside they find only what appears to be a more thought out snipers nest than in the suite complete with better broken window, but no weapons, and no other people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of the crime scene photos from the suite are leaked to the press just to put a graphic bow on the Lone Shooter narrative in the public's mind.

       </a>
       However, the public just isn't buying it.

       Yea totally in the realm of possibility, minus any motive in this story, no reason they pick Paddock, no reason they shoot up a concert, just bc you choose to believe any crockpot theory out there doesnt mean people cant question it so acting like a dickhead doesnt make people see from your point of view

       Does a theory have to include every minute detail to satisfy you? Read his post title - 'OP has a theory of the crime' - The goddamn FBI hasn't released a motive, or very many details whatsoever, and you're going to defend some prick who told him to post his idea to a fan fiction sub, snarkily dubbing this garbage? fuck you too. I find OP's theory to be in the realm of possibility according to the research I have done. I didn't claim "DING DING DING we figured it the fuck on out boys!" I'm not asking for anyone to see my POV beyond trash talking OP's theory, which had 0 instances of proven impossibilities, is not something OP, nor this subs readers, should be subjected to. If you have evidence to refute the original theory, please provide it, so we can move on to the next step in discovery. That is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       how this works, once again.

       I mean a theory should include the who, what, when, where, why and how, i get its a theory and nothing is certain but youre speculating in everything else why not why they picked him? Or why they decided to shoot up a concert?

       I agree. With most of the theories I’ve heard, they seem plausible. The only thing that’s usually left out is that he went to LIB and Lolla. Why would he do that? Or did I miss that this ended up being something the media made up? Either way, great theory.

       I've read he did not go to Chicago. Haven't heard of verification about Life is Beautiful, however. And if they can place him there doing a trial run, he's more nefarious than this theory would suggest. However, he has yet to be placed there to my knowledge.

       I think he went to LIB to calculate his distance and shot. The note is claimed to have a cryptic numbers which the Law Enforcement said it was shot calculation and algebra. I call bullshit on that because who fucking does that? it was revealed that there were 3 singular shots fired prior to the barrage that executed people. I believe those were used to site in his shot, not fucking algebra.

       Theres so much ambiguity in this case. The gun shots could be a couple things. The purpose behind 19 guns, the note, the two windows, the placement of the dead body, nothing is solid.

       I wish I could share the video with you, but there’s a video out there that suggests there are also 3 singular shots, which is theorized someone was aiming for the fuel tanks on the other side of the event.

       You need algebra because he didn’t have that many test shots. he wanted mass casualty so he had to calculate and get it right the first time. Otherwise people would start dispersing once he started shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Numbers were probably his location height, distance to event, and bullet speed. He wanted to figure out which degree to aim his gun. The scene would have some kind of degree measuring device.

       The LMG stuff isn't necessary for your story. They weren't planning on using bump stocks until they found them in his gun safe. So they used them. He either had tennerite or didn't. Doesn't matter. He bought a missing gun on the way to the hotel, which sorta throws your theory off a little too.

       The usual reasons. Chertoff has a warehouse full of body scanners deemed unsafe for airports he needs to sell. Gun control. Police state. Surveillance. Larger police budgets. Larger FBI budgets. It's more motive than Paddock had.

       An organized plan by a government agency needs to have a definitive, rational reason. As much as people don't like to accept it, a lone gunman can have an irrational reason (which in this case could be why it's not discernable). If it is a government op, why not fake a suicide note? Why not fake some connection to a radicalized group?

       I'm not sure I buy this theory, but one explanation is that they
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       it to look like a false flag. It heightens the fear across the population. 'If they'll do this, what wouldn't they do?' There have been some obvious conspiracies over the last several years, so they've already demonstrated sufficient control of forums and media to suppress these kinds of stories. In other words, there's no reason they
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to make it look too tidy. Just tidy enough.

       Only weak spot IMO is Campos luring him to the room. If casino cameras catch Campos and Paddock interacting prior to the shooting, the whole thing falls apart.

       Great point.

       How about this spin on it...
Campos phones Paddock and impersonates hotel security. Uses some excuse like they have reason to suspect a break in to his room. Claims that he got Paddock's number from the hotel files, as the guest registered to the affected room.

       I'm assuming the open door alarm was recorded somewhere central. There has to be a log showing when the alarm went off and when/how/to whom it was dispatched. I'd love to JC's whereabouts before and during that alarm.

       So the story goes that Campos was just walking his "usual rounds"... I'm paraphrasing here.
i
Is that something hotel security would do? Because they have elite security teams, right? Hence there would be no need in a modern organization to have mindlessly wandering security personnel. They can quickly target any problem areas. This was a high roller floor he was on, so there would be no expectation of rowdy customers creating trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is not that Paddock was setup per se, but that they allowed him to do it. It's within the realm of their capability to manipulate people into violence, and it's
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       cleaner. But since hotel security is undoubtedly in constant contact with LEA, they could have had him watching over Paddock's room, because... I don't know why.

       Hotel security makes hourly rounds to all floors usually, at least I did and was a rule when I did hotel security, I honestly believe he was investigating the fire alarm and not a random patrol, but routine patrols are part of a security persons job description

       I Think the first two shots we hear before the rampage was them killing paddock when he got to the room, and then them getting straight to the task with the larger weapons. I also think there was at least one or two shooters nested around the concert ,hidden somewhere in the chaos.

       Campos fakes a leg wound and the operaters spray the hallway through the suite doors. They then break a window in the suite, before they disappear into other rooms as guests.
      </p>
      <p>
       You lost me here. Why did the operators spray the hallway through suite doors? Why did they break a window in the suite before they disappeared? How did the operators get into the other rooms?

       Ehh, I guess Campos was gonna be there when SWAT arrived anyway, and it made then ask him less questions. The spraying the hallway is an easier way for him to "take a bullet" rather than a direct confrontation. They break the window in the suite because he is dead in the suite. They kill him in the suite so harder to drag him to the adjoining room. The operators had a person who books rooms at Mandalay in on it

       oh ok gotcha. The bigger question is who is Jesus Campos? If he was a real employee then they would have info on him. If he was fake, they would at least have him on camera and the swat team could identify him. If you can find him, you can find the operators. You made the name up?

       He was seen with a mystery woman in the hotel in the days before the shooting. And his girlfriend was in the Philippines. I could have swore I read that witnesses said she appeared young and asian, but now I can't find the asian reference.  Maybe someone can find it.  And I'm seeing fresh reports she's been identified as a prostitute and has been questioned. So, that could be wrong.

       You don’t have to explain it. I simply disagree with that theory. If there are other military trained personnel in this thread that can confirm that no one is writing down on paper to drop shots. If you watch the video taken from the concert level, Aldean is singing and it’s not until after a few seconds into the verse he jumps off stage. The concert had people packed in like sardines so dropping a few rounds into a huge square is pretty easy to gauge without a sheet of paper. Keep in mind he had other guns to shoot with, unless they were all sighted in the same the note would be useless because each weapons scope would have to be sighted in for windage. So sure the not could have had height and distance written down, but he’s not using simple math to calculate bullet drop. Law enforcement releasing comments that he had calculations or variables written down is nonsense.

       It was +-400 yards. The range card is ridiculous. 
Shows even more that Paddock, luckily, was an amateur. People somehow think he was some kind of evil genius sharpshooter operative... if he had known what he was doing it would have been WAY worse.

       What stood out to me is that the officers stated Campos got separated from the rest of the team checking floors.  Why would a lone security guard separate himself from a police SWAT team to take on a shooter with automatic weapons?  Interesting also that they stated it's a miracle after 200 rounds he only got shot in the calf and stuck around to try to help  or"interfere" with the police response and guest evacuation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I understand correctly when the police located the suspects room and Campos, the shooting had stopped.  A lot of interesting questions here.

       Not bad conspiracy theory. All of which can be verified or dismissal with mandalay bay casino video. I'm waiting for the lawyers and private investigators to start digging..
