       Really interesting description from a friend regarding police scanners the night of the attack in Vegas:
      </p>
      <p>
       "So I really don't post these sort of things but I do have something to say about the recent tragedy in Las Vegas. On Sunday night my friend who lives in Vegas mentioned to me that there was an active shooter at Mandalay Bay. As soon as I heard that I decided to tune into the Las Vegas Metro Police scanner online.
      </p>
      <p>
       I connected with a VPN and was instantly brought into a calamity of communication about what was happening in real time. When I connected there were numerous officers talking about various active shooters in different hotel/casinos on the strip. There were at least three or four other confirmed shooters from police between New York New York, Tropicana, The Luxor, and Mandalay Bay. There were also mentions of explosives that were placed in various hotel stairwells and detailed descriptions of the the other active shooters and various vehicles used to escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       After listening for about 10 minutes the connection went silent. When I started listening to the scanner there were about 20k-25k people listening and when it refreshed the number refreshed to about 35 people. The signal was then silent for another 10 minutes or so then started back up again, yet there were very few calls being made at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listening to whole situation was incredibly intense and sad but I think that people should know that the media reporting that there was just one shooter i think is completely false. I think that theres a lot more to the story than some older white guy who had mental issues and decided to shoot up people at a country music festival/concert. I don't want everyone to think that this is just a conspiracy theory that I made up. I'm just letting everyone know what I heard. I'm not really sure how else to handle/process this information but it hurts to see that our news can't supply accurate information about the largest mass shooting in our history."

       Don't worry, I didn't downvote, but what do you mean by "confirmed shooters"?
      </p>
      <p>
       The released 1 hour+ police scanner has dispatch mentioning multiple calls of shooters in those locations, but officers on the ground at those locations at the time say it's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       At one point an hour after the shooting, an officer at the Tropicana confirms a GSW, but no other shooter, which could have been a non-critical injury from the initial shooting, since many people exited from the rear of the venue, which is towards the Tropicana.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least that's what I gathered from the released scanner recording.

       I'm guessing by "confirmed" he meant reported
