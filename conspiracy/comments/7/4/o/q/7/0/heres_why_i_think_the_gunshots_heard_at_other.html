       So I've been hearing a lot about other shooters along the strip, and people keep posting the same videos about it. I wanted to post this to add to that discussion, and present my experience of why I think there was shooting
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       at Mandalay Bay (not commenting on multiple shooters vs single shooter theory). Sorry if any of this has already been pointed out, it's kind of hard to keep track.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Sound travels far. One of the popular videos posted is
        <a href="https://youtu.be/G2MsViMpkfk">
         this one
        </a>
        from the Bellagio where the lady claims they were shot at. The Bellagio is a mere 1.25 miles from Mandalay Bay. My reasoning here (forgive me if the following is dumb/nonsensical) is think about how we gauge the distance of a lightning strike. We see the lightning, and start counting until we hear the thunder. That tells us how many miles away it is. Those of us who have tried this in a thunder storm know how loud thunder is when it's barely over a mile away. According to
        <a href="http://lightningsafety.com/nlsi_info/thunder2.html">
         this
        </a>
        article, thunder is 120dB at the source. An AR-15 is 167dB according to
        <a href="https://loadoutroom.com/thearmsguide/suppressing-ar-15/">
         this article
        </a>
        . So it's not surprising that the sound would carry all along the strip, echoing off the tall buildings and causing panic even over a mile away. Additionally, the lady in the above video says that they were drinking at the lobby bar. The lobby is very close to outside, and it's near the large glass conservatory, which could have had a weird effect involving the sound.
        <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/22eadad3edf7f0672c0a215f1413193e.png">
         Map of area she claimed to be at.
        </a>
        <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/1a5f8dc9edf2451da6e81923c5d810ee.jpg">
         Proof the lobby is right by the outside area.
        </a>
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        The obvious one: Where are the actual photos of the area, or videos of it happening? All we have is videos of people being put under lockdown. This just lends to the theory that the hysteria and echoing sound caused people to think there was a shooter at their location.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        I spoke with two different paramedics just hours after it happened and they both told me that there was only one incident, the one at Mandalay Bay. They said they were getting 911 calls from all over the strip from people and they initially thought the entire city was under attack and we were fucked. However it turned out that those were just panicked people and the only shooting was at MB. I don't know about you guys, but I believe these paramedics because they were on the scene all over the strip and on location. Also it was just hours later at the blood donation center- if the FBI or CIA or some shit told them to keep quiet about multiple shooters, then why were they calmly relaying this information to a random person they had never met before (me)?
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        On that note, I haven't met a single person who saw shooters elsewhere, knows a victim of one, or even thinks there were shooters elsewhere. I know this isn't reliable evidence, but after all the people I've met or the people I already know who were either there, or had family/friends die there, I would have heard something about it.
        <br/>
       </li>
       <li>
        Lastly, later in the evening Monday I had to drive right by the Bellagio and other casinos where it was claimed there were other shootings. That would have been around 18 hours later. All that was there was a single news van which was parked there on Tuesday and Wednesday as well. If there was actually a shooting, there would still be some visual indicator. Mandalay Bay is still shut down I believe. There's no way they cleaned up all the bullet holes and presumably victims(?) that quickly. Someone would have taken photos.
        <br/>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       So anyway those are my reasons that I believe there was only shooting at MB. I agree that it's very odd there have been so many stories from others claiming there were other shootings, but based on the travelling/echoing sound, and the panic of the people, it doesn't surprise me they got that impression.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know what you think or if you have questions, this whole thing is just insane and I'm just trying to figure this out.

       Referring to the broken glass doors? I would guess that they were broken when panicked people all tried to run out at the same time. I can't find where I originally heard this but IIRC those types of glass doors are designed to shatter under pressure (safety glass) like that so they don't block people trying to escape.

       conspiracy theorists are obsessed with multiple shooter theories ever since kennedy. it adds a whole new angle (literally) to their armchair investigations. the more shooters, the more complex, the better. so they will try and squeeze it into every shooting based on the flimsiest of evidence. in this case we have clear examples of echoes, and mass confusion and panic across vegas. cops investigated all the other hotels and none of them were legit last sunday night.

       i watched that video a few times now and all i see is a confused woman who heard gunshots. she mentions shots coming into the lobby once hesitantly, clearly she just heard that rumour from someone else. no evidence of broken glass or anything.

       That's how I felt about the video as well, and people keep posting it as "proof". She's just confused and scared, they heard gunshots and then were put on lockdown.

       People are interchanging the words "proof", "evidence", and "confirmed" right now. It's going take time to dig through all of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I for one had some anecdotal testimony from a local who was visiting my friend claiming none of the other locals are buying the single shooter narrative.

       I've seen a lot of blanket statements claiming "all locals think X" but the truth is we're all just as unsure as anyone else. I've talked with plenty of people who have wildly varying opinions.

       rubbish. the first "second shooter" is clearly an echo, exact same sound just after the loud shots. the second one there is no echo as she has moved to a different location. seriously why do people ignore echoes? it's physics.

       The first shots are echoes yes. But then at about 45s, there’s gunshots that sound the same as the echo, with no close shots. Defo two+ shooter.

       Well to say that others aren’t claiming more shooters is obviously not correct.  The internet is full of testimonials about other shooters, and those testimonials are being ignored and shut down. That’s worry enough for me.

       I never even said that, I said others that
       <em>
        I personally have spoken to
       </em>
       aren't claiming more shooters. I even prefaced that part with this:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I know this isn't reliable evidence,
       </p>

      <p>
       Anyway I don't think there's some grand plot to take down all the blurry videos and text message screenshots, considering you can easily find them on facebook.

       Did you watch the video? Most certainly was not an echo. An echo is a very clear distinct sound compared to what I am talking about. I can understand why that would be your first guess but it doesn't fit

       Echoes of previous shots fired before tape was started?  Also sound will sound different while echoing, you have heard  an echo, so won't  explain that.  Also Doppler effect can be part of it depending on location.  Like a train, really loud in front of the sound, very muted behind it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zero evidence of damage at other hotels, and lots of assumptions being made about gunfire echoing over large open area filled with hotels.  With the amount of focus on this, even if MSM is not reporting it, there would be video or pictures providing evidence of such. All there is, is a bunch of non professionals in terms of being in a battlefield, making assumptions about what they think they heard in a battlefield situation in real life, not a movie.  Maybe more than one person in the room, maybe.  As for other shooters around the city, not so much.

       Maybe but I work until really late, and I don't want to pay for parking and deal with the strip when in all likelihood if there
       <em>
        were
       </em>
       bullet holes and shit, plenty of people would have photographed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, I was looking at the snapchat map yesterday and there were like 50 identical videos of the MB broken windows people were taking. So I'm almost positive that attention seeking people would have taken a photo by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually just checked the snap map and that area is completely open to the public. We would have seen photos by now.
