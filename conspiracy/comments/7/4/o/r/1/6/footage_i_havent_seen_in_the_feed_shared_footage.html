       I havent seen it shared if it was sorry for resharing. Its shocking. The shots ringing through the air before all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fucking strobe light again in between the buildings then disappearing then reappearing WTF!!! Is that a helicopter strobe light or no??? The strobe light comes back and forth during the first few mins.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also from this angle as people pointed out that lower light flash was a strobe light and is flashing before the automatic rifle shooting. The fourth floor idea thing. You can see it from this angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: I repeat. im talking about the strobe light in between the buildings flying(left and right)!!
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: People should download the video just in case youtube deletes it
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit : I believe i have found the gun used in this shooting and look who is shooting it

       This proves my thesis in my previous post that there is a possibility a helicopter was in on this!! For the same gun to be shooting in different locations it has to move. You can see it based off how people are recording they hear it to the left than pan to the right then left. This explains why some resorts heard gun fire within

       I doubt a helicopter was involved. Helicopters literally fly all over Vegas, day and night.

       You can hear the helicopter faintly while the automatic gun fire is happening. In one of the videos a girl said thats a helicopter amidst the gun fire. I hear a faint helicopter. What would explain this same strobe light flying by that hotel back and forth for the first 3mins. Im not saying the helicopter from afar was the one above the crowd. Two separate ones.  What would explain multiple resorts hearing the same automatic gun fire. Mind you the automatic weapon we hear (which is a m240 or m249 saw X 2) is not the gun by the window in the crime scene photos. The amount of shells don't add up to hundreds of rounds. That rifle in the photos is probably the rifle we hear at the beginning .
      </p>
      <p>
       But i agree i think at least 2 vegas helicopters fly in the night. But why would it be there before the auto fire? They probably havent even been called yet to assess whats happening.

       Helicopter by night is a huge Vegas attraction. People literally fly over Vegas all the time. That said, it could also be a news chopper, personal chopper or business chopper. To shoot from a moving helicopter, using full auto fire, while staying on target is very hard to do. Also, if shots of that magnitude were coming from that chopper, you'd see muzzle flash.

       But the problem is no one saw any muzzle flash from either resorts. All that is is that they hear it but can find where its coming from. This is the most mind boggling part. Why the hell cant we see it. Only reason we cant see it is if a flash hider or silencer was used. A silencer and flash hider only remove/reduce flash and not sound as killary was claiming. "They wouldnt be able to hear it if a silencer was used bablabl nra is pushing it quote". Idk theres so many sketchy things such as the crime scene is staged(check my previous post about the crime scene) my main point is he did not commit suicide and was shot twice. the supposed pistol he used is in a position that defies physics, the real automatic weapon isnt disclosed(automatic one), they lied about the dates paddock was there etc.

       So much of it doesn't add up. It just makes the helicopter more eerie. You could easily use a helicopter as some sort of signal, perhaps? Who knows. Those cracks at the beginning are insane, tho. This video starts much earlier than the others, why did it take days to come out?
      </p>
      <p>
       It gives new perspective, as you can see people start to run out at soon as the first couple of shots

       Just want to point out, the fact that you're arguing for this helicopter is pretty sad.. what's more sad is that you didn't realize or point out that there were multiple silenced gunshots at 3:11 that are way earlier than anything we saw before yesterday.

       Didn't i say the shots before the automatic shooting??? Did you even understand why i was thinking a helicopter??? People from many resorts believed shots were coming from within. How does the same gun appear to fire from multiple locations hence the panning of the cameras? Its just a thought not a solid one but one that might explain why people from many resorts heard shots inside their resort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you not watch the video where a girl said "thats a helicopter" When the automatic fire was raining down???? Thats one other reason why i think a helicopter is involved.

       No, you said "..flashing before the automatic shooting". Nothing about shots before the automatic shooting. And I made a post last night where I've linked this video in the comments, that I found in a link someone else made in my comments.. so yes, multiple posts last night that link to this video.

       Again, the problem is that you're focused on this helicopter that multiple people have given reasonable explanations for, while you've repeatedly ignored how difficult, no, how nearly impossible it would be to pull off what you're proposing.

       All while the video actually shows that the shooting happened much earlier, which is an important fact.

       You got it all wrong. That flashing strobe light is the one on the 4th floor. I was saying that because people thought a shooter was on the fourth floor but was debunked a strobe light in the room. I was saying as i stated you can see the strobe light from this angle. I did bring two topics together so whoops.

       I agree with multiple shooters, but why use different weapons if the narrative is one shooter?

       Also, the fire sounds different when the camera turns. They face MB and it's more intense than when they face away. Right after security at the gate says "go, go!"

       Mysteriously all the guns certain people want to ban none the less... I still think this was to make a point that it was too easy for him to acquire the aresnal and explosives and not to cause mass casualties. (There were mass casualties, but not as many as there couldve been). The motive wasnt to kill, it was to push an antigun agenda and I think the LVPD is pissed that it was done in their city, thats why we are getting leaks to expose this bullshit. Americans dont need to die for someone to prove a political point. If this was the case, would we even be told?

       Probably because there weren't multiple shooters and this wasn't a conspiracy lol. "OMG yo the breathed after saying hello, clearly he was upset about lying so that was the breadcrumb." Do you ever read the stuff you're typing and think, wow maybe humans mess up their words, stumble and make mistakes instead of mass conspiracy and killing endless amounts of people? Which seems more likely to you chief?

       what are you going on about? If it was a false flag and their narrative was one shooter, why would they use more to throw suspicion on themselves? My thought goes against the conspiracy theory.

       That's just covering your bases. If you go in a room where there is a "suspected gunman" and you're not checking in every cabinet, behind every door, or under every bed, you're missing something. You're missing a second shooter, you're missing some key evidence, something.

       Or, 20 guns is what he planned on using, so why quit? If you lugged all that shit up there with intention to rain Hell down on people below, are you just giving up after 8 min and a few guns? Especially when a security guard knocks on the door? He had monitors, he knew what was outside in the hall, and where it was. Something stopped the shooting.

There is too much being withheld and I feel like releasing the crime scene photos and video footage of the casino/hotel would put alot of theories to rest. Or make more questions.

       No way. There's videos that show echo.  We get that but there are other videos that clearly show further fire with an echo report after and closer fire. There's also videos that show a burst of full auto and another one begin while the other is firing. Slide fire stocks require 2 hands to fire so there's no way he was firing 2 at a time

       echo is different than the supersonic crack.  You need to learn a bit more about ballistics my friend.  The report (explosion) is a thud, and that can echo seperately.  Then there is a very localized supersonic CRACK from the bullet as it passed by/near you.  It combines to sound like 2-3 shooters (thuds, echos, cracks) as he sweeps around the grounds.

       We can debate this all night. But this aside how do you explain videos of firing starting and after 10-15 rounds while that gun is still firing you hear another gun with a totally different ROF shooting.

       I have a friend that has one and only used it once. Fired pretty well for me but it was one single 30 round mag so I cant attest to 60 90 or 100 round surefire or drum mags. Or multiple mags heating the gun up. Im assuming that if you apply the correct pressure to the gun its just going to fire until you have a barrel or gas block issue but honestly im not sure.

       I agree. Im no expert but it did sound like two guns firing at the same time at a few points. What gets me is, why such long pauses between shootings? It doesnt take 2 min to change a mag

       What i still don't get is how that strobe light is so visible in all those videos where it looked like there was another shooter, yet we don't see any muzzle fire from either of the broken windows in not one piece of footage.

       I have no idea why we cant see muzzle flash. Perhaps killary hinted to what was used before any of this evidence appeared. She was claiming if the shooter used a silencer.  Even if you use a silencer you can still hear a gun shoot. Especially on a m240. A silencer or flash hider was used to eliminate flash. A flash hider is more common with machine guns. Yes these guns melt silencers but after a  prolonged period of time.

       Right. I was more referring to him talking about m240s, suppressors, flash suppressors and the kind. He doesn’t sound very knowledgeable when he talks about those topics but the way he’s presenting his arguments he’s making it sound like he’s the duty expert on the issue. Hence his downvotes.

       In theory yes, if you had a straight line of sight, but with him recessed in the room, it creates a smaller area from which a person would have direct line of sight as opposed to him sticking the muzzle of the rifle out the window.

       Maybe... he also could’ve had the lights on in his room. Still would’ve been difficult to see. Vegas is full of lights, so was the concert. Not saying somebody couldn’t have seen it, just saying it wouldn’t have been as easy to see as one would think.

       That is not a gun jam. Its single shots. Probably picking off people or shooting at something else. The rifle by the window is probably that gun in the crime scene photos. The automatic weapon is coming from somewhere else. I think its a helicopter but the automatic fire is not coming from that place he was at.

       Yeah there are some single shots, but I’m talking about the long pause in shots. I’ve read reports where they found a few of the guns in his room that were jammed. The pause could be from jams and then him switching weapons, or moving around in the room/situating himself. I’m not opposed to the idea of there being more than one shooter, but I think he also used automatic fire. You can hear multiple rounds going off in videos by the Mandalay that sound like an automatic weapon, and what about the +200 rounds he shot at the security guard in the hallway? He apparently hit security guard Jesus Campos in the leg but I find it fishy that this security guard hasn’t been flooded with interviews, and hasn’t even appeared on the internet or TV for all the matter. All we have is his name and that paddock apparently shot him but does this dude even exist? It’s just odd to me that we know nothing about the security guard yet

       The long pause is what i was mentioning in my previous the long pauses. Then you hear the same gun in the distance farther away which is why i was saying a helicopter. But you cant fire a machine gun constantly you would probably go off target. The security guard gave a whole different story. He said the door was open yet swat said they had to blow the door up. WTF? I believe he is the guard that said that.

       Yea for sure, the shots right around 3:11.   That's when people started running, and Security services probably told people to GTFO - And Aldean just thought they just wanted to clear more room and said at the front of the stage and said "Just move on back a little bit" as he thought he was helping out.

       I was watching the hotel corner. Thr room is six floors down from the top of the thick vertical light. Above is 4 seasons.

      <p>
       Did anyone else not see broken glass falling?  Why no pictures of broken glass or hotel video of glass landing on lower roof and ground. Surely glass would scatter on a 320' + fall to the ground and reflect the lights of the strip and be very visible on the way down.  Nevermore the sound, a taxi in front of the hotel would have reported that.

       The bus stop girl did mention the glass, but if it came from the 32nd floor, why didn't anybody in the videos recorded from the Foundation Room patio notice it? They would have been able to see one of the broken windows:

       He doesn’t say that. He says “alright what do y’all say we take it back up (or possibly ‘pick it back up’) a little bit”. Implying they’re gonna play another high energy song or more than the last.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would also like to see a source that it started during the first song of his set too because usually when a band says something like that it means they played 1 or more slow songs already in their set.

       He said "ok we're gonna pick it back up a bit", because he has just played a slower tempo song and was going to bring up the energy. Source: I see a lot of live music. That was a segue into the next song.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the first shots were definitely during the end of that song.

       Yes, I made a post last night where someone pointed out another post that linked to this video.. unfortunately the OP doesn't have enough logic to catch the earlier gunshots, but is trying to use a strobe light to argue that there was a helicopter. It's sad.

       Well, the word 'know' is short for 'knowledge' - a word that means familiarity with
       <strong>
        facts
       </strong>
       . And facts are things that are proven to be true through evidence. And evidence is something that is essential to  form a conclusion. You might wanna try that apporach sometime, instead of starting of with the conclusion and then cherrypicking whatever 'facts' that will support your conclusion.

       Yeah I saw a few videos late last night that show the shots coming like at least a minute before most people realize. I heard one or two shots..then a few seconds later a few more..then a pretty decent pause until the next song started.

       crazy, pretty clearly shows 3 single shots about 30 seconds before the "full auto" bump fire baragge started.  Some people recognized what they were and already started to flee.  I wonder if those were the shots at the gas tanks in the airpot?

       I thought so initially but you can hear the bullets from the single shots hitting a target. He must have been trying to hit the tanks with those first shots. Plan was probably to blow up tanks and mow down people running away from the explosion toward mandalay.

       This makes me feel so sad. I feel like veryone should watch this because it really brings it home, it makes it feel like you were there, and it makes it really feel real, it's different to when you hear about the number who died or hear about what happened or see videos from a distance, this one really captures what kind of evil these bastards did, firing on completely defenceless people like that. It makes you really understand why it is SO important that we don't give up with pressing for the truth about what happened, why it's not enough to let the media drop the story and leave it as a 'lone wolf' scenario without answering any of the other questions, because the people who did this and orchestrated it need to be found and exposed. And if there are elements in the government or these elites who stand to profit from this, who see these individual living breathing human ebings as nothing more than cannon fodder for their manipulation and for their personal gain, if they are involved, then people need to know and people need to watch this video and understand what exactly happened and feel the rage at the enormity of the cowardly disgusting evil that happened, and demand answers and demand justice.

       It’s a plane taking off.  Find a map of Vegas.  You’ll see the direction of the runways, plus the angle of this video.  It’s a plane leaving Vegas.   From this angle, the plane goes behind the main tower, and then appears “between” Mandalay Bay and Delano but it’s just a plane on ascent out of McCarran Intl

       That isn't a strobe light, it's probably the tourist helicopters from Maverick Helicopter. Their flight path goes right behind Mandalay Bay and they take off from just farther south. Not only that, but there's also tons of helicopters in the air in Vegas almost constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a map of their flight path, it's consistent with the "strobe" between buildings. And yes, they do night tours.

       Is it possible those first 3 shots came from the helicopter? You can see it enter from the left and go behind MB. Once it's in between MB and Luxor is when those 3 shots can be heard. Then the barrage begins.

       possibly so. A helicopter being used can explain why people here the same machine gun fire within their resort. Also the change in pitch of the same gun points to it being moved(heli) or the same gun being used in a different location. Also the gun being used is this gun and take note who is shooting it

       The windows of the pyramid slant upwards. It would be very hard to shoot from there. What u see is a reflection from a flashing billboard near by. U would notice a window out in the pyramid.

       Or, 20 guns is what he planned on using, so why quit? If you lugged all that shit up there with intention to rain Hell down on people below, are you just giving up after 8 min and a few guns? Especially when a security guard knocks on the door? He had monitors, he knew what was outside in the hall, and where it was. Something stopped the shooting.

       We can debate this all night. But this aside how do you explain videos of firing starting and after 10-15 rounds while that gun is still firing you hear another gun with a totally different ROF shooting.

       Well, the word 'know' is short for 'knowledge' - a word that means familiarity with
       <strong>
        facts
       </strong>
       . And facts are things that are proven to be true through evidence. And evidence is something that is essential to  form a conclusion. You might wanna try that apporach sometime, instead of starting of with the conclusion and then cherrypicking whatever 'facts' that will support your conclusion.
