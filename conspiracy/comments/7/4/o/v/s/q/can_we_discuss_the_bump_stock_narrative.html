        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I do not claim to be a &quot;weapons expert&quot;, but I do certainly have more firearms experience than the average American.  For nearly a dozen years, I was involved in the firearms industry, on the manufacturing side.  Both of the manufacturing facilities I have been employed held a Class 3, and I am no stranger to bump firing and bump firing stocks.</p>

<p>When I had listened to the most widely available video of this horrific event, I immediately thought that the weapon heard was a .30 Cal automatic weapon (initially I thought M60).  People disagree, because they state that the cyclic rate of fire is not &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;choppy&quot;.  I can understand people coming to that conclusion, but what they are listening to is the projectile itself, hitting the ground, or more morbidly, a human being.  At least to me, the report of the weapon sounds like a sustained rhythm.</p>

<p>That being said, bump firing, even with a designed &quot;Slide Fire&quot; is not &quot;easy&quot; to control, and even more difficult to sustain large dumps of 50, 100, or more rounds consecutively.  Anyone who has any experience with automatic weapons can tell you, it is impossible to keep a 7.62 on a level plane at full auto.  I understand this was a &quot;fish in a barrel&quot; scenario, but these people were 400 yards or more away, moving the barrel just a few inches from target would put rounds above the horizon...lots of rounds.</p>

<p>In my experienced opinion, automatic weapons were used, probably illegal or illegally obtained automatic weapons.  It concerns me that the current narrative of this terrible and evil act is that it was portrayed by an otherwise law abiding man with no previous firearms experience, and legally obtained weapons.  I don&#39;t buy it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I was in the infantry for 12 years, deployed a bunch of times. Carried both a SAW and a 240B for some years. None of the gunfire I&#39;ve heard sounded like either of these weapons. I believe it was 7.62-chambered firearms with a bump fire stock. All of the bursts I have heard had a variable rate of fire. You can only get this &quot;sluggish weapon&quot; with a SAW or 240 which is <em>very</em> hot. Even laying on the trigger with a thousand rounds with either of those weapons will <em>not</em> get you to a sluggish weapon. I am confident that he used a &quot;normal&quot; rifle chambered in 7.62 that had been somehow modified to fire fully automatic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I mean by &quot;sluggish&quot; weapon and variable rate of fire. A sluggish weapon is a weapon that -- for whatever reason (usually heat) -- the rate of fire is slowing down because the mechanism is beginning to seize. It takes <em>lots</em> and <em>lots</em> of heat to do this to a SAW or a 240. Many more rounds than were fired in the whole episode. You can lean on the trigger and put ten belts through either of those weapons and they will not become sluggish. The variable rate of fire of the weapon(s) being fired in the video points directly to something like a bump fire stock, which is a kind of &quot;bypass&quot; of the bolt&#39;s sear mechanism (which is essentially what prevents a semi-automatic weapon from becoming a fully automatic weapon).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t believe it was an m240, but if it were, another reason for pauses would be the swap barrels. Fairly quick and easy process for a trained machine gunner, could take some time and fidgeting for somebody not quite as versed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even for us pogs it’s pretty quick but if you never swapped one before it could be clumsy. I never put enough rounds through a barrel that it would need to be changed, but say he wasn’t changing his barrel, could the heat impact the rate of fire at all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We’ve gotten them glowing white hot where you could light a cigarette off of them (not a good idea, warps the barrel) and from my recollection it didn’t really alter the rate of fire. If the gas plug had excessive carbon build up, that could alter the rate of fire, but it most likely just slow it down further and further until you finally had a malfunction. I wouldn’t think that it would slow down, speed up, slow down, etc. </p>

<p>Primary purposes for swapping barrels is to prevent he barrel from warping and to prevent cook offs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t necessarily need gloves to change the barrel on an m240, there’s a barrel release on the side, and the handle that you see on pictures of a 240 is NOT a carrying handle... it’s sole purpose is to change our the barrels.

<p>But his rate of fire, his bursts, and the amount of rounds he fired was never really enough to constitute a proper barrel change, nor did he fire enough rounds within a burst, to justify a pauses the long pauses if he were firing an m240</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t use one example of a guy firing what sounds like a weapon chambered in 5.56 and using a bump fire stock as a measuring stick for <em>all</em> weapons with bump fire stocks. Plus the firing in this video (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpsqirFRdTo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JpsqirFRdTo</a>) is definitely much faster than a 240. This is the first burst. It is much, much faster than the ROF in the video used in your link. The one thing we <em>do</em> know is that the ROF has been variable the whole time. The mechanism could be slowing down due to heat, due to gunk, or to the bump fire stock itself starting to show signs of wear. I&#39;m telling you: You can&#39;t get a variable rate of fire out of a SAW or a 240 without a shitload of heat. You have to put <em>a lot</em> of rounds through one of those weapons to get a sluggish weapon and there is <em>NO WAY</em> there were enough rounds fired to get this weapon into a sluggish state if it were truly a 240 (or a SAW). If you slow a rifle chambered in 7.62 down, it will sound like a 240 because -- surprise! -- it&#39;s also chambered in 7.62. They&#39;re going to sound similar if your shitty bump fire stock is causing your semi-automatic rifle to fire with a similar ROF as a 240.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, people are putting a ton of faith in these Youtube videos of weapons firing, but that&#39;s just because they haven&#39;t heard these weapons on a regular basis or out in the real world, so it&#39;s all they have. I spent a few years in combat, and I can hear right through the echoes and also the actual inbound rounds. And really anybody can if they listen. The echoes are there. The inbound rounds are there, definitely, but none of these sounds are interfering with the actual sound of the weapon firing. That&#39;s the most plain sound in any of the videos. And it&#39;s not going to affect how the ROF of the weapon sounds or make the sounds somehow warped. There is line of sight between the weapon and the cameras. The actual gunfire sound is plain. For example, you can hear the &quot;snap&quot; of the inbound rounds <em>before</em> you can hear the actual gunfire in the video of the very first burst, because they&#39;re moving faster than sound and arrive prior to the sound of the weapon. That&#39;s why in the video of the very first burst, you hear the little snapcracklepops of the inbound rounds arriving in the crowd before you actually hear the percussion of the rounds being fired. I mean this is all stuff anybody can train themselves to hear. Just that most people don&#39;t have really <em>any</em> experience with this stuff except some Youtube videos, so they get wild ideas about echoes and stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Based on my experience, it does sound like 7.62 rounds, and the variable ROF tells me that the weapon was not designed to function as a fully automatic weapon in its current state, and so there is some kind of bypass being used with the weapon. A bump fire stock sounds like a great candidate for that mechanism. Based on the photos we have of the shooter&#39;s hotel room, I believe the weapon(s) on the floor in those photos is the weapon(s) being fired in the videos. Huge magazine, bump fire stock, and a barrel that looks like 7.62 chamber. It&#39;s definitely not 5.56, sounds to me like 7.62, and almost all of the &quot;AR15&quot; style of weapons are chambered in either 5.56 or 7.62, like almost all weapons used by the US Army (except for some sniper rifles and handguns).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first I thought it might be a full auto AK or even an AK pattern rifle with a slide fire due to the rate of fire. After queuing up videos of the shooting with videos of the m240 and full auto AKs for reference that sound is a 240 no doubt about it. Same cadence same rate of fire. Its really hard to deny it listening to them back to back.  </p>

<p><strong>Our</strong> guns are not automatic weapons.   As far as &quot;our guns&quot; are concerned, they&#39;ve <em>already</em> taken away our automatic weapons.   Only the wealthy and powerful can feasibly possess them at this point.    </p>

<p>A significant public outcry to further restrict the availability of <em>actual</em> automatic weapons would tend to disarm the wealthy and powerful.  Or more specifically disarm the security the wealthy and powerful use to protect themselves. </p>

<p>It also undermines the cultivated ignorance and misinformation already laid for trying to convince the general public to think of all scary black rifles as machine guns.</p>

<p>That said, the clips I&#39;ve heard highlighting the rate-of-fire inconsistency <strong>do not</strong> point towards any method of &quot;bump fire&quot;.  I think these are just the talking points they had prepared and the true facts of whatever tragedy they exploit is secondary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If laying prone, it would help to utilize a bipod, sure, but using a bump stock from a prone position would be REALLY difficult to have a significant rate of fire.  Bump firing is a style of shooting that is &quot;loose&quot; and sloppy, you are encouraging the rifle to move independently of the shooter while the trigger finger stays more or less static in place.  Anything that will hinder the movement of the rifle itself will hinder the functionality of bump firing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my perspective, a bipod would have been completely useless on a bump fired weapon.  The bipod mounts to the underside of the barrel shroud to stabilize the entire frame of the gun when shooting.  When using a bump stock, the full auto method comes from moving the entire frame of the gun back and forth from the stationary stock, meaning the bipod would be moving also.  Either he didn&#39;t practice/think it through, or whoever set up the guns is full of shit and didn&#39;t know what they were doing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure I agree with your hypothesis, but here&#39;s a video that was uploaded yesterday that hasn&#39;t been posted enough and hasn&#39;t reached the front page that I can find.. shooting starts at around 3:10, seems to be silenced or muffled, and I think closer to the shooter. Maybe it will change your perspective, it&#39;s quite different than any other video I&#39;ve seen yet.</p>

They&#39;ll ban them, move on and the rest of the world goes back to counting down the days until the next white American goes on a rampage</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I completely agree the weaponry really didn&#39;t make sense when I saw the pictures..
the pile of magazines he had fitted an assault rifle he was using which had an EOTech sight on it.. surely at the range he was at with the full auto that&#39;s making life more difficult for himself..</p>

<p>I did see some guns with a bipod and a scope.. which made much more sense.. but the media were pushing that the assault rifle with the EOTech optic was his main weapon..</p>

<p>When I initially heard the gunfire and saw the videos I instantly assumed something heavy, designed for rapid fire over a medium range, otherwise yeah as you say he&#39;s just shooting the air..  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just wanna throw my two cents. The closest rifles to the body looked like DDm4’s. Which is a Daniel Defense M4. Personally I’ve always wanted one of these rifles so I’ve watched A LOT of YouTube videos of people firing them. I have yet to find a video of someone being able to bump fire a DDM4 for more than maybe 5-6 seconds before it jams. And the DDM4 guaranteed one of the weapons he used. So it doesn’t make sense to me how he was able to fire for a long period of time with a weapon I’ve researched and seen no one do what he did</p>

<p>Does anything think he may have been just using 2 weapons at once? Firing one after the other? ARs on bipods, set on the ledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a weapons expert or conspiracy theorist but the weapons angle of this really interest me.  I have shot the majority of the weapons he had. There are a couple things that I noticed about what he used. Feel free to add to or challenge what I say because again, I&#39;m not a expert but I do ramble you bear with me.</p>

<p>Bump stocks are incredibly inaccurate. Not necessarily strange but I have seen people miss at 25 yards because the muzzle starts to travel upwards quickly. 400 yards away he would have to stop firing to readjust his aim after probably 20 rounds. 100 rounds sustained and he would be firing into the sky. The videos I saw have 3 shots (sounds like a 7.62x51 or x39) first then sustained gunfire into the crowd without pause. If he was planning on having a mock full automatic rifle and money to do so then why not go binary trigger but I digress. </p>

<p>Based on the few pictures I have seen, there are not nearly enough spent casings for shooting 100&#39;s if not 1000&#39;s of rounds. Go to the range and shoot 200 rounds and you will be slipping on empty casings because they will be everywhere.</p>

<p>All the guns in the pictures look incredibly staged. Strewn around the room but a neat stack of Surefire 100 round mags (aren&#39;t they incredibly unreliable or am I thinking of a different brand) by a pillar. You would think he would have made a shooting bench of sorts with the guns at ready by each window. A bipod is useless if you can&#39;t rest it on something. Haven&#39;t seen any muzzle flashes in the videos suggesting the barrel was inside the room and not hanging out the window. Daniel Defense DDM4 with a EOtech red dot at night? Wouldn&#39;t be my first choice for optics for shooting at night. Could have been if he planned on a CQB trying to escape but who knows. If the first 3 shots were from a higher caliber then why stop after 3 and switch to the bump fire? The crowd hadn&#39;t gotten a grasp on what was happening until the sustained fire.</p>

<p>Hearing protection? To my previous thought of him firing inside a closed room (if the muzzle wasn&#39;t out the window). If you ever fired a rifle inside without hearing protection you will know that the concussion from the muzzle blast will disorient you and cause instant tinnitus. Firing 100&#39;s or 1000&#39;s of rounds without hearing protection inside a closed room would probably make you throw up. So he took out his hearing protection or off his ear muffs before shooting himself with a Taurus Judge? </p>

<p>Taurus Judge chambered in .410 or or .45 is going to take the whole top of your head off. Or I would assume since it will explode a pumpkin in one shot.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the media understands that a hobby like shooting is addictive and if you have the disposable money to spend then buying a bunch of guns and ammo is no indicative of a soon to be mass shooter. Most avid gun enthusiasts buy ammo in bulk because it is MUCH cheaper than going to your local store. Check out some redditors collections because 23 guns is not a lot to a collector/enthusiasts. It will be interesting to see more crime scene photos when they are released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve read more on the shooting than I have, I didn&#39;t know anything about the Judge being used to shoot himself.  On that though, a 410 slug would be more damaging than a .45 I would think.  410 can kick out some pretty nasty ballistics, much higher velocity than .45.</p>

<p>As an anecdote, I witnessed a hog get shot in the forehead with a .45 Long Colt, you&#39;d think that would be fatal.  But the hog got up like nothing happened and ran away, for a few hundred yards anyway.</p>

<p>The initial shots prior to the auto fire sounded like a lighter and faster round to me, more consistent with .556, than the thump of the auto fire.</p>

<p>As far as the close quarters shooting, I can touch on this with experience.  Much of my time in the manufacturing of firearms involved time in the test-fire facility.  I can assure you, even with ear protection, it is uncomfortable to shoot a 7.62 or really anything other than a sub sonic round or .22 for more than a few rounds.  Without ear-pro, it would be like subjecting your ear drums to a jack hammer.  That&#39;s a good point you brought up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Had off work today so unfortunately I did nothing productive except read up on this. </p>

<p>In the wide angle death photo there is a silver revolver that looks like the Judge from the long cylinder. I could be wrong. Never shot flesh with a .45 but plenty of other things. Leaves a giant hole. That hog was pretty tough.  </p>

<p>As a shooting enthusiast and concrete worker, I can tell you that I would jack hammer all day without hearing protection before I shot 5.56 or 7.62 indoors without ear pro. Lot of avid shooters weighing in but nobody mentioned the hearing protection angle so I thought it was a interesting point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Night time is night time and I didn&#39;t want to leave any question about where my rounds were headed. Just crank the brightness all the way down and there you have it. That tour I was a fifty gunner and so I would have been engaging most targets with the fifty, only really using the SAW for someone running up behind the turret or otherwise someone in a spot where I need to put some rounds immediately. The tour before that I used it only during raids, which were always at night, very early. I prefer iron sights over anything else, e.g. ACOG or CCG. I don&#39;t really like the kind of stuff gear ninjas love like laser sights and flashlights and pistol grips and all that crap. I did like the pistol grip (with short barrel and tiny buttstock) on my SAW but couldn&#39;t stand it on the M4. About halfway through that tour, I bought a very slim-profile red dot sight which was very helpful going door-to-door. I used it less than half of that tour, but I was so pleased with how it worked out that I used it my entire next tour specifically for those instances when I needed to shoot someone and couldn&#39;t use the fifty.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They analyzed multiple videos and articulated it to be a very intermittent pattern, the rate of fire was not consistent. It also was in bursts of different speeds which is a characteristic of a bump fire stock being used. It still makes zero fucking sense how he had the recoil control at that range to use a full auto 7.62. All it would take is a three round burst to throw the barrel above the horizon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there was such a huge load of life on 9/11 that they were able to sneak the TSA in and have most people think &quot;well, I guess that&#39;s how it is now&quot; but I find  the whole &quot;metal detectors everywhere&quot; theory a little far fetched. I could be wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you ask me, the idea of an illegal arms deal is too far-fetched for the simple reason that no one is looking to buy AR-15s with bump stocks preinstalled.  Taking the good stuff when they left?  Absolutely, but the 23 or whatever guns laying around most of them with bump stocks pretty clearly stinks of &quot;pass legislation to ban bumpstocks&quot; to me.  If anything, he would have had one or two guns that had bump stocks on them.  Mr. Big Money Paddox would have been able to afford fully automatic weapons if he wanted, or at the least have had semi-autos converted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This theory is so hilariously dumb to me. Hey let&#39;s meet up at MANDALAY BAY A GIANT CASINO WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN AND AROUND IT AT ALL TIMES AND TRADE TONS OF GIANT GUNS IN A ROOM FOR CASH.</p>
