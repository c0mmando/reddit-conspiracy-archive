Whats the word on this security gaurd? Is he being questioned? If Steven had cameras set up on the peep hole, why are they claiming they werent recording? Was there a live stream? Wtf?</p>

<p>They said he recorded himself during the shooting. Release the video!! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. With IP cameras you’d have to pay for cloud storage from the vendor, or set up an external system with storage. Some might have SD card options I suppose, but it is 100% believable that the cameras didn’t actually record anything. It would be extra effort for no reason. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m talking about the cameras that were set up to monitor from the suite. I’ve read that Mandalay Bay doesn’t have hallway cameras in the hotel area. If they do, and that footage was “not recorded” or “lost”, it’s super shady. I’m just saying that it makes sense that the planted cameras didn’t record anything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My b. When you said IP cams I thought you were talking about the Casino itself. So many places these days gets IP cams and store their video either on DSA&#39;s or the cloud. That is interesting they don&#39;t have hallway cams. I figured there would be some in the hallways, elevator, and stairway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ATF says the reason cameras on the floor weren’t working is because he was using a jamming device. 
Didn’t affect his cameras though I guess.</p>

<p>Also to clear up the confusion regarding from original report that Jesus Campos approaches his door because it was ajar, with later police statements that it was barricaded, official stance is now that it was another door which was ajar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your premise is logically flawed and filled with inaccuracy.  No disrespect, but who could have had a chance of seeing him fire?  </p>

<p>The security guard approached the room, and was shot through the door.</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing the shooter was kind of busy.</p>

<p>The cameras described were similar to a baby monitor.  They don&#39;t record.</p>
