       Every one is just assuming Paddock was the shooter. Yet, no one actually saw him firing the gun. Whats the word on this security gaurd? Is he being questioned? If Steven had cameras set up on the peep hole, why are they claiming they werent recording? Was there a live stream? Wtf?
      </p>
      <p>
       They said he recorded himself during the shooting. Release the video!!

       I could have sworn Wednesdays interview they said that none of the cameras were "recording". Only showing live feed for the peep hole and the cart. One being a baby monitor withing the suite.

       C'mon man. This is how bullshit spreads. They were talking about paddock's cameras in the hallway not recording. Probably were some kind of live feed and didn't need to be recording.

       Of course the lobby/hotel casino's cameras were rolling. That's what everyone's interested in seeing

       Oh for sure they casinos cameras were rolling. I want to see that too. They need to release the cameras that he was using and what electronics he had inside for us to get a better picture if he was recording to something or someone.

       They can pull his timestamps of when he used his room key and trace him back through the hotel, in theory we should be able to see all this hardware coming in if he brought it all in himself.

       Yeah. With IP cameras you’d have to pay for cloud storage from the vendor, or set up an external system with storage. Some might have SD card options I suppose, but it is 100% believable that the cameras didn’t actually record anything. It would be extra effort for no reason.

       I’m talking about the cameras that were set up to monitor from the suite. I’ve read that Mandalay Bay doesn’t have hallway cameras in the hotel area. If they do, and that footage was “not recorded” or “lost”, it’s super shady. I’m just saying that it makes sense that the planted cameras didn’t record anything.

       My b. When you said IP cams I thought you were talking about the Casino itself. So many places these days gets IP cams and store their video either on DSA's or the cloud. That is interesting they don't have hallway cams. I figured there would be some in the hallways, elevator, and stairway.

       ATF says the reason cameras on the floor weren’t working is because he was using a jamming device. 
Didn’t affect his cameras though I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also to clear up the confusion regarding from original report that Jesus Campos approaches his door because it was ajar, with later police statements that it was barricaded, official stance is now that it was another door which was ajar.

       The security guard approached the room, and was shot through the door.

       I'm guessing the shooter was kind of busy.
