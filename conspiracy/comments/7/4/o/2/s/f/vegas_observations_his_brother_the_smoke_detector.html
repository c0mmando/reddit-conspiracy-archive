        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Two comments I found really strange from his brothers second interview.. He stated something along the lines of “I don’t have the best past, I’m sure you’ll all look into it and find something” and then “when Steve asked you to do something, you just do it and don’t ask why. That’s the cost of hanging with Steve. If he wants a sandwich, you get him a sandwich.”
Just speculating, but maybe his brother knows he played some roll, was used or manipulated somehow? I believe he knows more than he let on...</p>

<p>Also... regarding comments I’ve seen about him not covering smoke detectors... I was in a suite on the 31st floor of Mandalay Sept 25-28th for a business trip. My memory could be fooling me, but I could SWEAR there’s a sticker on the window that says they will alarm if broken.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a panoramic photo I took from my suite on the 31st floor on Monday, Sept 25th. You can see the Harvest billboard down at the stage. <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wsKHs">https://imgur.com/a/wsKHs</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>IF the one window were for attacking fuel tanks, once he saw that was futile it probably made sense to retreat to primary shooting position.  All of the items left in the car point to an abandoned part of the plan (accomplice flaked, coconspirator was not who he seemed).  If you remember the failed ISIS attack in Texas (Geller&#39;s free speech event), an FBI agent arrived with the attackers but then tried to flee the scene undetected.  Sadly the desire to appear heroic and relevant has led us to the point that we have government agents working with and even encouraging terrorism.  </p>
