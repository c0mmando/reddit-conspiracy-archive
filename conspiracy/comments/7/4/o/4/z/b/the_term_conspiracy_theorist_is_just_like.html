       All the missing family member, eye witness accounts , tattoos on their arms all must of been crisis actors. This includes Hitlers hate speeches and rhetoric that must of been made up to.  Thereâ€™s a difference between conspiracy and ignorance. And if you truely are a conspiracy theorist then you shouldnâ€™t really believe The Red Cross.

       I'd say that rounding up and imprisoning hundreds of thousands of Jews, gypsies, gays, and other "undesirables" is pretty damn hateful.  Alot of them died, especially near the end of the war, when they were basically abandoned in their prisons, with no supplies.  But it wasn't an extermination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you bothered to count how many of these "witnesses" were little girls who just "miraculously" walked out of their "death chambers", while they were being systematically executed?  Or how many diamonds they had to poop and re-eat, just to get by?  Most of the "escape" stories are too laughable to even be believed.  And can we forgot about the human soaps and lampshades that suddenly became so fashionable, amongst the caricature Nazis?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's mountains of documented and credible evidence that the Holocaust was an extreme exaggeration of events.  The only evidence
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       it is one or two questionable post war documents, and some (literally) tortured "confessions", and a slew of liars who profited greatly from their own lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       But hey...  When you've got people like Steven Spielberg selling you decades of lies, the truth doesn't matter much, because you're supposed to feel bad.  Feels.  The feels are all that matter any more.

       Thereâ€™s mountains of evidence of millions of new round up and put into work camps. The ones who couldnâ€™t work were immediately put into death camps. Many people donâ€™t realize the war didnâ€™t start when the Americans entered. The round up of Jews and the hatred being spewed out of the Nazi party happened for almost a decade before we entered the war

       most people don't realize that according to the orthodox* holocaust narrative, the extermination program didn't begin until 1942 -- which is, ironically, the year the united states joined the war. most people are also unaware of

       A couple people going missing in Poland explains it all.  It's a miracle your family even survived, with all the exterminating going on.

       My grandfather was a Dachau inmate. Told us the story of the day his family was rounded up. And of a friend, who was now a military officer, from Germany who had come to warn him. But he didnâ€™t leave. His wife and entire family was murdered but his brother and his cousin. He went on to fight in the Warsaw Uprising, and was a printer for the Nazis. Told us about Dachau, and role call. And prisoners being shot for leaving the bunks. Yeah, I believe it happened.

       Why is it so hard to believe? The Nazis were clearly anti-Semitic, and they clearly rounded up Jews. Camps definitely existed. And the Nazis wanted to get rid of the Jews. Whatâ€™s so hard to believe here? Genocide is pretty common.

       You donâ€™t know any holocaust survivors. So I understand why you may be skeptical. But the Nazis clearly wanted to rid themselves of the Jewish problem. Extermination wasnâ€™t the first solution. They would have loved to send them elsewhere. But other nations wouldnâ€™t accept many of them. So they were put to work as slaves and the rest were murdered.

       My grandfather was always angry after the war, especially with his Jewish brethren. He couldnâ€™t understand how they just let the Nazis round them up like that and murder them. My grandfather actually went on to marry by grandmother who was 20 years his younger, whose father was a Nazi officer.

       After 9/11, in the media, the word 'conspiracy' was usually always followed by the word 'nut'.. As in 'if you don't agree with the msm, you are insane. Now the term' conspiracy theorist' is pretty much the same. Just like how the Internet is so condescendingly disparaged on the msm..' oh, the Internet said that? Then it must be true'!!

       My understanding of the holocaust is that millions of Jewish people were killed under Hitler's fascist regime. There's no denying that it happened. My further understanding though is that the number of millions of Jewish people that were killed can be drawn into speculation when we examine what methods were used and what camps were set up. I don't deny the holocaust what so ever, but I have seen evidence that suggests the number of deaths during it may not have been six million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately this sort of speculation is what can often label a person as a holocaust "denier".
