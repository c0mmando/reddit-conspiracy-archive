    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say that rounding up and imprisoning hundreds of thousands of Jews, gypsies, gays, and other &quot;undesirables&quot; is pretty damn hateful.  Alot of them died, especially near the end of the war, when they were basically abandoned in their prisons, with no supplies.  But it wasn&#39;t an extermination.</p>

<p>Have you bothered to count how many of these &quot;witnesses&quot; were little girls who just &quot;miraculously&quot; walked out of their &quot;death chambers&quot;, while they were being systematically executed?  Or how many diamonds they had to poop and re-eat, just to get by?  Most of the &quot;escape&quot; stories are too laughable to even be believed.  And can we forgot about the human soaps and lampshades that suddenly became so fashionable, amongst the caricature Nazis?</p>

<p>There&#39;s mountains of documented and credible evidence that the Holocaust was an extreme exaggeration of events.  The only evidence <em>for</em> it is one or two questionable post war documents, and some (literally) tortured &quot;confessions&quot;, and a slew of liars who profited greatly from their own lies.</p>

<p>But hey...  When you&#39;ve got people like Steven Spielberg selling you decades of lies, the truth doesn&#39;t matter much, because you&#39;re supposed to feel bad.  Feels.  The feels are all that matter any more.</p>

<p>most people don&#39;t realize that according to the orthodox* holocaust narrative, the extermination program didn&#39;t begin until 1942 -- which is, ironically, the year the united states joined the war. most people are also unaware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement">the haavara agreement</a>.</p>

<p>significantly, dachau was not an extermination camp.</p>

<p>has anyone ever claimed that no one died in nsdap-controlled concentration camps? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>After 9/11, in the media, the word &#39;conspiracy&#39; was usually always followed by the word &#39;nut&#39;.. As in &#39;if you don&#39;t agree with the msm, you are insane. Now the term&#39; conspiracy theorist&#39; is pretty much the same. Just like how the Internet is so condescendingly disparaged on the msm..&#39; oh, the Internet said that? Then it must be true&#39;!! Attacking the only source of unedited, independent information and trying to embarrass people into refraining from discussing independent theories </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My understanding of the holocaust is that millions of Jewish people were killed under Hitler&#39;s fascist regime. There&#39;s no denying that it happened. My further understanding though is that the number of millions of Jewish people that were killed can be drawn into speculation when we examine what methods were used and what camps were set up. I don&#39;t deny the holocaust what so ever, but I have seen evidence that suggests the number of deaths during it may not have been six million. </p>

<p>Unfortunately this sort of speculation is what can often label a person as a holocaust &quot;denier&quot;. </p>
