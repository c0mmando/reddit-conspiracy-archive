       Considering that we have next to nothing to go on in terms of motive at this time. What if this was literally just some dude who wanted to commit suicide, but wanted to kill a bunch of people before he was forced to pull the trigger or suicide by cop.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of men out there who choose to commit suicide later in life. A lot of men who feel for one reason or another life is not worth living.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he just felt like a worthless loser? No kids, no wife, no real friends it seems like, no close family. A wealthy former accountant aimlessly wasting his life away in casino bars with no real attachments to society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he felt his own life was and had been empty and meaningless. This could have been a source of his compulsive gambling, the thrill of the bet, let the dice fall where they may, just fuck it, because wealth means nothing without a purposeful life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The above characteristics could have been cause for the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       He resents people like the ones at the country music festival. People that had friends, family, purpose, youth, excitement. And in his final high stakes game, one of life and death, he would roll the dice for 20 000 people all at once by firing indiscriminately into the crowd from a penthouse suite. In 10 minutes he would purposefully go from being "just a guy" in his brothers words, to become one of the most discussed individuals in American history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard he was actually a country music fan and attended concerts regularly. This isn't hatred for politics or race or religion. This sounds like an envy killing of the purest variety.

       You buy regular, totally legal guns and then convert them to automatic fire. It's not difficult to do, and there are people who are happy to do it for you.

       Well first of all, I have no idea how many fully automatic weapons the guy had, or indeed whether he had any. I haven't seen anything in the news about that either way yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was that the answer to "How do you get an automatic weapon?" is as simple as buying a regular semi-automatic weapon and converting it to fully automatic operation. It's not even hard.

       His brother almost lied about owning a semi auto. then changes his mind (almost as if he realised how bad it would look if it turns out he did own after claiming he didn't haha) and says how he teaches his kids as well

       Full out the appropriate ATF form, get a chief LEO from the county or city you reside in to sign off on it (with a clean background you'll most likely get it), send it off to the ATF with $200 and wait 6-18 months for the tax stamp to come in, buy 1 fully auto firearm per stamp(only 1 issued at a time) that was manufactured before 1986.
      </p>
      <p>
       Full autos are more cost prohibited than anything else, a cheap one will run you more than 5k and that's for something like a Mac 10, a m16 will run you around 20k.

       With so many DIY experts out there, he could easily have split the deed between people. Take the first/nearest 23 responders to a craigslist ad, for example. Or find 1 shady guy who will do so no questions asked?

       It's a stock that slides back and forth that allows you to bump fire easier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bump firing is using the recoil of the shot to reset the trigger and pulling the gun forward with your other arm to re-engage the trigger more rapidly than normal.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still isn't full-time though because only 1 bullet is fired per pull of the trigger.

       there's nothing to catch on to the parts are readily available and advertised freely online - they aren't illegal at all nor are the guns once they have been modded. Anyone that's even slightly familiar with guns knows about all of this.

       Dude fully automatic firearms made after 1986 or purchased without the title 2 tax stamp are indeed illegal. That includes modifying a semi-auto into a fully auto.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your talking about bump fire and binary firing then those are still semi-auto since it's still 1 shot per trigger pull.

       But there are only a few methods (such as bump stocks) that are actually legal (or at least in the grey area).  Actually modifying the firing mechanism in any way to shoot continuously is incredibly illegal and cannot be done without breaking the law.

       They weren't all automatics. He had a bump stock as some people suspected shortly after videos started surfacing, he might have had some modded according to LVPD, though that has yet to come out as fact.

       But it is Las Vegas, an illegal modder isn't that far fetched an idea if you've got the money and you're the most boring old white guy of all time.

       With all the crazy speculation circulating on this subreddit about this guy right now I tried to do what Sheriff Joe Lombardo said he couldn't do when he said "I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point."
      </p>
      <p>
       And no disrespect to Sheriff Lombardo, this is an unprecedented, tragic attack on this country and he is under an unimaginable amount of pressure. He's got more things to worry about right now than the rationale of some fuckin sore loser.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI psychs will need to take their time to digging up this guys entire life, that's why this motive thing has taken so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly Stephen Paddock is one of the sick fucks that people will be making documentaries about for years to come, which seems ironically is exactly what he wanted.

       He was 1,700 feet away. I don’t think he knew how many people he wounded or killed. He had many more guns with him and lots of ammo. Why did he stop shooting so early? Don’t he me wrong, I’m glad he did. But it doesn’t make sense to me.

       I guess I'm not totally sure. But, it seems like if someone got their hands on ammonium nitrate and actually brought it with them to a mass shooting, they had a bomb in mind. I have no clue how to make a bomb or if this ingredient is used for other practical purposes (seems unlikely he was practical about anything). Just seems like a weird component. Or, possibly even planted.

       you are saying he did this for shits and giggles. No motive, just angry and sad and gonna shoot a crowd of people.

       Your theory doesn't make ANY sense. You can't seriously be arguing that he had no motive except angst towards the world at large.

       That's not at all what OP said. OP said he pretty much hated himself and wanted to commit suicide. Being an adrenaline junkie, clearly jaded as fuck, this was his suicide. Like OP said - all his money didn't mean shit, so he wanted to be remembered. Like OP said - many older people are suicidal. Did you read the post?

       Yes and that logic doesn't work. If he was an adrenaline junkie, why did he shoot fish in a barrel and kill himself far before anything really exciting happened to him?

       Why would you not assume there is someting happening behind the curtain with this guy? Occam's razor thinking is only useful in certain situations, and as others have said, there was way too much forethought put into this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was angry enough to want to kill a bunch of people, you'd think he would probably target somebody he is upset with - considering he's upset enough to mass murder a crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       The action is too heavy for a shallow, light motive. If this were something that happened quite often, then maybe you can write it off as happenstance, but this was planned and the response was not typical either. Too many questions. By making a shallow judgement, you are being horrendously ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fine to say we dont' know yet, but I noticed one other thing with your take - do you not believe there is any chance that the intelligence community or bad government actors might be involved? Is it impossible in your mind that the shooter was actually connected to the FBI?

       did you know that he used to work for Lockheed Martin and various defense contractors? It's not like he has zero affiliation with government actors or anything....
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why haven't they released ANY information? wouldn't that make some sense if he were one of their own as opposed to an enemy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Dont' get me wrong - I don't think the FBI as a whole is behind the shooting. However, bad actors within the FBI having their cover blown? I think it's a possibility...
      </p>
      <p>
       but your opinion is fair. If you can't see the connections, then we'll just have to see if any more pop up as we go.

       I agree that the lack of information at this point is the biggest cause for suspicion.
      </p>
      <p>
       But from what it seems this guy was as low key as you can possibly get up until the shooting itself. It wouldn't surprise me that it will take some time to dig into this guys head and history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah he worked for a predecessor company to Lockheed, as an accountant. He also worked for the IRS and DOD for probably similar reasons and in similar roles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you worked for the HSBC doesn't mean you were directly involved in handling money for drug cartels.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government connections just don't add up, but I guess if he was undercover or working some crooked shit outside the bureau itself, they were never meant to. Just doesn't seem like the kind of guy to be involved in some undercover or illicit weapons deals, but we don't know the full story yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still all possible though. I'm not trying to discount other theories, just trying to work out the simplest most likely theory with what we've got.

       It's possible, I suppose, but this wouldn't be the byproduct of a manic phase or even a typical temporary break from reality, this took a LOT of preparation and planning. Getting the hotel reservations alone during a big event like this would have had to be done months in advance. All while appearing completely normal to the people that knew him to the point that they were unconcerned.

       Think he'd probably been to The Harvest festival several times as a relative local and apparent country music fan and concert goer.
      </p>
      <p>
       He probably knew the nearest casino pretty well too, maybe he stayed in that room or one on another floor in years prior, possibly after getting rejected by a woman, or being completely ignored by everyone as a nothing, loser. He might have slowly brewed resentment in which to couch his depression to separate himself from those people and their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard somewhere he had booked that specific room 10 months in advance, and he waited for the last show of the night till everyone had had their fun, to have his own.

       Just speculation. But if this is some deranged lone wolf, non-political mass shooting, those are very plausible thought patterns.

       Because he did not fire that many rounds. Those are 13 clips with 100 round capacity = 1300 rounds. Add this to his other fully loaded 29 guns in the hotel room.

       That doesn't answer the question, theres no way of knowing from the pictures if those are loaded or empty mags. No one said anything about them being empty due to being fired, just never loaded.

       I don't know for sure. I suppose I'm using a common sense assumption that A) every weapon and clip brought up to the suite was brought there for the purpose of being used in the attack (not sure what purpose over a dozen empty magazines would serve) and B) it's far more likely that the shooter would neatly stack his magazines before firing them than after firing them.

       It's impossible to know from the photo whether the magazines are empty or full.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, it is more plausible that they are full because they are stacked neatly. However, we don't know and either way, this is not a detail that is going to "crack this case".

       Every detail helps form the story. If those clips were full, then it would be under consideration that he meant to use them or planned to. IF they were empty there is two options either they are spent mags or he brought up a bunch of empty clips. If he brought up a bunch of empty clips why? Was he planning on selling the guns and it went wrong or what? Or did he simply plan to attack and kill as many as people as possible. If it is the former than it really does matter if the those clips are full or not. If they are still full why aren't  they spent then? Not enough time to use them? See even little details can lead to more questions.

       Yes, it is easy to get lost in details if you are looking for a conspiracy that doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       What evidence do you have that he was planning on selling these guns?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would someone neatly stack used magazines in middle of massacring people? That makes zero sense on multiple levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Equally implausible is that they were never full in the first place then neatly stacked on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       While these remain possibilities, they do not jive with events in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure at some point we will find out more about such details but, like I said, either way, this is not a detail that is going to determine any sort of outcome in this case.

       With the information given about the event, we are left with questions.
I have no evidence I have questions. You see evidence will be able to answer questions.  Some times evidence presented will lead to new questions. 
Just because I am able to entertain ideas outside of the main narrative doesn't mean I believe them. My mind is open that is it. I haven't come to any conclusions because I don't have enough evidence to make concrete conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suppose you can  say it isn't going to solve the case with this detail alone. But that isn't how an investigation works. You accumulate all the known details about the case to form a hypothesis on how it played out. Each detail can lead you to the next clue. I'm glad we don't have you as an investigator on the scene.

       Give me a break. You think I don't know all of that?

       You think I wouldn't be a good investigator because I am sticking to known facts ad not making shit up whole cloth for no apparent reason? That's just plain crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't make a good investigator because I have ZERO interest in such a line of work. However, sticking to known facts before moving on to speculation is absolutely how police officers work.
      </p>
      <p>
       YOU ARE NOT AN INVESTIGATOR. The police already know the status of those magazines, full/empty, used/un-used, there is no mystery here. This is already know information. WE don't know more info about the magazines because we are not part of the investigation and never will be.
      </p>

       What I'm saying is you can't see the significance of one little detail. All the details add up to make up the picture. If you already know this then wtf. Yes we aren't actively involved in the investigation this is why we are investigating on our own with the limited information given. We then explore all options, doesn't mean that are exploration into those options will be fruitful. See things like this interest me but I wouldn't make a career out of it. I'm a citizen just trying to understand. If you don't want to part of this then why the fuck are you here.

Thanks for talking with me, yeah I suppose it makes me seem unhinged I'm just upset with the terrible loss of life that occurred and want answers. It wasn't my intention to emphasis that the mags themselves represent the mystery of the case. Rather just it was a detail needed to be cataloged in my brain, that I still have questions about.

       You keep a level head during crazy times, its great to grounded. I need to ground myself from time to time, I have an imagination and sometimes it gets the better of me. I don't disseminate material but I do discuss. Without discussion I am unable to learn. I ask questions, people like yourself or others with answers can help shine the light as to why my question and or statement is out of line. Or if it is still plausible. 
I hope that we both can take something away from this exchange. I know I will.

       What really gets me is why does this bother you so much? I understand that facts are important. If society always just stuck to the facts and never looked closer or outside of the realm of the facts would we be where we are today?

       You were curious about the magazine and I explained to you that A) the most plausible scenario is that they were full because the other options don't make any sense and B) regardless of anyones speculation, the police already knew the status of those magazines prior to anyone in the public viewing these photos.

       investigate: carry out a systematic or formal inquiry to discover and examine the facts of (an incident, allegation, etc.) so as to establish the truth.
You are following the story, because you are searching for the truth are you not? Is this not investigating? I don't know seems to me it is I might be wrong.

       Isn't it fun when citizens actually take up the mantle of investigator rather than just accepting what someone says as truth. When the citizens of this country starts asking questions this is a good thing. To be critical is what our country needs. We don't need no more of this zombie mentality we have of just accepting things as is.

       People like you and people like me create the balance society needs, we need people to stick to the facts, we also need people that are able to see the facts and expand upon them. We also need people that ignore the facts entirely.. All of these perspectives are good for the society as a whole.

       sometimes you have to make an assumption to ascertain if it is plausible. It is more of a hypothesis than anything. Hypothesis are the pinnacle  of scientific discovery. So to ask him to not make assumptions or to hypothesize would be to render this individual a non thinker. We want some thinkers here.

       Okay can you explain why it would make more logical sense to have 13 empty neatly stacked magazines that couldn't be easily fired if desired? Or can you more easily explain why it would be more logical to have 13 full neatly stacked magazines that could easily be fired if desired?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which one makes more sense? I'd go with latter. Apparently this is my own bias, but that is what I would deem more logical.

       and this is why you could and might easily over look details. no one knows if the stacks are empty or full (assumption, full). no one knows if he simply didnt get to them, or for some reason decided to stack them back up (assumption, didnt get to them).
      </p>
      <p>
       unless we were to ever get unadultered access to the evidence as it was found, or access to the supposed video he recorded of himself (if that existed, might explain a lot), there is no way that we will ever know what truly happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can take a single still frame out of context and make up any story about it that you want, but unless you were there, unless you have some other information other than being able to look at a damn picture, you have no idea what happened precisely.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is perfectly fine to make assumptions about what you believe could have happened. It is quite different to phrase it as knowing or proving that something happened a specific way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not quite sure why you think that a situation like this would all play out to the perfect logic in your head. If Paddock did this, he wasnt using logic. Logic would guide him away from murdering others and himself.
       <strong>
        IF
       </strong>
       it was him, I do not believe he was thinking logically, and therefore I do not believe that your logic definitively applies to his actions.

       I don't claim to know the exact truth. No one knows for certain that Paddock is the guy who did this. No one knows if that hotel room was where the shooting occurred. But I can and will make assumptions on some of the more common sensical components of the night of the attack. I'm not a "detective", I'm a redditor. Just like you.

       Because why would you take the time to neatly stack empty mags? You push the mag release, mag drops to floor, you need the full ones organized and handy for faster reloading. You aren't going to stop shooting to pick up empty mags and stack them in a neat little pile.

       I was concerned about the same thing. Would be nice to get one image. But if you look at the receipt closely in both images they have the same exact blemishes that would be hard to duplicate (same scuff marks on the receipt paper; same ink blots on thicker letters; same faded ink on certain letters).

       I agree that they appear to be perfect matches. I just don't see the need to hold the camera that close unless to activate macro mode and get the focus rite.

       I think for now we need to discount the receipt.  It's not a good photo, it's not a good source (Facebook? C'mon).  Until some other evidence corroborates it as a legitimate receipt showing the shooter checked on the 27th (whatever that means to the investigation?), or gives it better context, I'm just putting the receipt aside for now as interesting, but not necessarily conclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have plenty of other questions to occupy my time other than a weird ass random photo from someone's "friend's uncle" on Facebook.

       Yep. Even if the reason was something stupid like he got a discount, or it was the only large event nearby (unlikely being Vegas), there was still a specific reason why he chose this place and time and method.

       I'm all over it. It's mostly just screen shots of text. "I saw a shooting in another casino" or "he's actually an FBI agent". The only post that gave me pause was the receipt. Do you have any other examples of gaping holes?

       The receipt to me is valid for one person,  especially someone who knew they were not going to live to see the next day.  He got a burger and soup for dinner and a bagel for a snack so he wouldn't have to call again. And 2 cans/bottles of Pepsi are the same size or smaller than most fountain sodas.  It just would seem like an inordinate amount of food for one meal for one person, but not when you consider his size and circumstance.

       Yeah i'm not saying the receipt swayed me, but at least its something of substance. Almost every other post is just a screen shot of some text of some guy telling a story "he heard something". At least the receipt is tangible evidence. Although I agree it means nothing by itself - what so Stephen and his accomplice ordered fucking room service together? His top secret black bag handler didnt think it would hurt to have a bagel sent up to the room? Amateur hour at the CIA apparently

       Pretty sure it was 30 and that was just the primer. Imagine if hilldog got weaseled into office. I wouldn't put it past them to have used this event, she would've put an anti gun justice into the supreme court, and made an executive order banning certain guns and ammo and silencers or whatever over the holidays.

       Regardless of what strings you think are being pulled behind the scenes, as a country we still operate on laws. As such, the gov't can't just come in and take people's guns. It'd take a vote in which 2/3 of the populous votes to do away with the 2nd amendment.

       They won't take everyone's guns, that's the thing. If hilldog weaseled her way into office, I may have had a different opinion. But I don't think what they are doing is working anymore. Will that stop them from doing it? No.

       Lol no never heard of it. Apparently you don’t have the “simple understanding of the laws of physics”. Because if you would, you’d understand that the weight of top floors collapsing would be enough to crush the bottom floors and cause the building to collapse into its footprint.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s okay, I saw Loose Change too. I also saw the directors of Loose Change get obliterated by the Editors of Popular Mechanics in a debate regarding this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, you’re saying the government is simultaneously the smartest and most ingenious planners, but at they same time they’ll spectacularly fuck things up so that you, the “woke”, can pick it apart?

       No. It doesn't. The mass of the top section is less than the bottom, momentum wouldn't have allowed it to collapse fully into it's own footprint.
      </p>
      <p>
       How can an office fire only visible on two floors from the outside cause wtc7 to disappear in under a minute? The only way that's possible is if the steel beams were cut. And you can see the pictures of ground zero with classic demolition style diagonal cuts on the beams. Jet fuel can't melt steel, and even if it could, there wasn't nearly enough left over from the initial explosion to heat up the entire building to bring it down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch architects and engineers on 911. And get off of this sub if you're not willing to open your mind beyond the mainstream narrative.

       Good lord. Your first paragraph makes zero sense. Your saying that when multiple floors collapse, the floor directly below can hold them all up? This is called pancaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       -There were fire on multiple floors of WC7 plus it was wrecked by falling debris from the collapse of the other towers. 
-You see a couple beams that look sliced, that is not evidence of high powered machinery. 
-JET FUEL DOESNT NEED TO MELT STEEL BEAMS JUST DAMAGE THE INTEGRITY OF THEM AND WEAKEN THEM. 
-Regardless, the jet fuel ignited fires all over the place, it was an office after-all, with flammable objects.

       So the buildings can collapse completely, and they can find the terrorists passport lying on the street? Do you realize how stupid they think you are for believing that?

       You can't even get out of your own ego driven head to be open to the possibility that I'm not driven by self gratification. If you'd just shut the fuck up for a day and took the time to listen to what others have to offer, like the researchers who made rich mans trick and sacred geometry in plain sight, you'd realize that you know nothing. Your entire life has been built on lies, deceit, and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not arguing with you so I can feel better about myself, I'm trying to get you to simply open your mind to the possibility that there's more to the world than is on the surface.

       Why don't you take the time to expand your knowledge of the facts on 911 beyond loose change. Like I said, I haven't seen it so I'd have to watch it before I watch the video you linked.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really want you to watch that last video I linked. Why do you think there is so much occult numerology in DC? Why isn't it ever discussed or speculated on? It's undeniable.

       Another video is about the human brain and psychology. It's my favorite video because it shows you what your ego is and why letting go of that illusory "self" is how you are able to see beyond yourself. And trust me hombre, you've got a big one.

       It's all planned and coordinated hombre. They know they can't do everything at once. It takes careful execution. But they got greedy and doubled down when they should have backed off to reassess. But I suppose they know that if they back off, that gives room for us to grow and evolve and progress and they don't want that. So they double down, keep shoving the square block into the round hole.

      <p>
       Conducting a deeply covert attack on your own country involving hundreds or possibly thousands of people. Maybe thermite, maybe a missile to strike the Pentagon, demolition charges in tower 7 to cover up the FBI involvement.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or getting some intel that "Osama Bin Laden determined to strike within the United States," and then just letting that shit happen so you can use it to your own advantage.

       It doesn't matter what is easiest, it's what the facts point to. And the facts point to Osama bin Laden being a CIA asset from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easier to say Oswald was a lone gunman, just like it's easier to say weed rots your brain so it should be illegal. But the facts are that it's physically impossible for two airplanes to bring down three concrete steel beamed skyscrapers in under 1 minute each. Sure, they were burning, but anyone watching the videos knows there is no visible structural failure until it just vanishes. Especially WTC7.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the facts and you can't just brush them off because it's easier for you. Take Eric Braverman's advice and just follow the money. That's what the researcher who did Rich man's trick did.

       Let someone that's already worked up a plan to commit terrorism within your borders attack you because you want them to, or attack yourself in an overly elaborate plot that might end up coming back on you.

       Because they don't want people to stop thinking and arguing and bitching for 2 seconds to realize that we are all getting fucked in the ass by the banking and oil cabal who control the CIA. They don't want us to see the fear they impose on us. They want us afraid of each other and of them. They don't want us to see that there's nothing to be afraid of.

       Please walk me through the steps in which professional CIA operatives and management are assigned tasks by the banking and oil 'cabal' (dog whistle). How do they interact with intelligence oversight committees? What do their budgets look like?

       Look up Steven Greer and the Disclosure Project, there's a lot of shit the intelligence agencies are doing under the radar. They don't need a budget because they sell drugs and guns illegally, look up George Webb and Iran contra.

       People who haven't spent time around the mentally ill have a hard time getting a handle on that concept. Hang out with someone in the middle of a manic episode and it quickly becomes apparently you're dealing with something inexplicable. Such events can last months, plenty of time to execute a truly wacky plan that nobody sane could ever understand.

       But that IS the reason. He wanted to kill a bunch of people before killing himself, so he picked a good time, a good place, and a good target. The reasoning makes sense because it was a good time, a good place, and a good target. Those are the multiple reasons.

       I think his target was the Mayweather fight initially. The concert was in the same place where media day was held. My guess is he couldn't get a proper room with a view for that event and had to plan better. Imagine shooting Floyd or Connor, that would've blown up in the media.

       Idk much about reflections and light but to me it seems plausible the flashing light around the 10-15th floors could have been reflections. I mean you could clearly see flashing gunfire on those floors so either it was a reflection or the multiple shooters is for real

       Posting my earlier comment here:
Couldnt this dude have been a hardcore leftist who orchestrated the worst lone wolf attack in US history for the specific purpose of setting up the political landscape in favor of harsher gun laws? He could have known that since he was white/rich/retired/successful the only thing left to talk about is the gun, of which he owned legally and modified using legally sold shit?
      </p>
      <p>
       So he carries out the shooting and its fucking devastating in a very short period, to the point that its obvious he had set a new record, at which point he stops and shoots himself in the head. He had enough ammo and time to kill every person who stuck around, along with surveillance outside his door; everything points to him bunkering down. But he doesnt even try to fight off police because he kills himself a full hour before they bust down his hotel door.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he had started shooting again after the first 9 minute wave (when medical assistance was being given), the results would be absolutely more horrific. Deaths would certaintly have been 100+ in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk what to think really. I don't believe this dude was an FBI agent and that this thing goes very deep. I think its simple because it was almost politicised by design, but I also know that us humans use logic to try to cope when horrible things happen. People die and we identify with it and reflect ourselves and our loved ones and try to make sense of horrible things, but sometimes it just doesn't make sense. The theory that hes an old idiotic athiest that wanted to live out his rambo fantasy fits just as well unfortunately.

       Most difficult in piloting is in takeoff and landing, or adverse conditions. Flying the jet in good weather is trivial. Did the US government know about and not stop, or maybe even sponsor, the attack? Probably. But why bother with a risky controlled demolition when you have groups you can prod into doing it for you? Hell, I bet they didn't plan for the towers to actually come down, just sustain enough damage to launch a war for that Halliburton dosh.
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK's angle matches Oswald perfectly. He already had anti-American sentiments and military experience. Most likely paid and promised an assisted escape once in prison (so he wouldn't talk upon arrest) by the Rothschilds (could be CIA or a few other groups, but my bet is Federal Reserve based) and then killed by Ruby before he could talk. With Ruby mysteriously dying in prison. No need for a second shooter for elite involvement. They'd want their tracks as covered as possible anyway.

       I don't get why people overcomplicate things to the point of implausibility.

       Its because people don't just become expert marksmen when they've never been great at anything in their entire life remotely close to this. Becoming an expert shooter IS FUNDAMENTALLY COMPLICATED. Also your name checks out.

       It's not laughable, the thread is laughable. That is the null hypothesis. Restating the null hypothesis as if it's insightful isn't really something I'd expect to find on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . That's more of
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       territory. The poster above me sums it up better than I can, with satire:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        What if 19 hijackers with no commercial jet experience actually just wanted to take down 3 buildings with 2 planes?
       </p>
       <p>
        What if Oswald actually was an ace commie assassin with a magic bullet?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It's laughable because while both of those explanations are definitely possible, taking the most basic and obvious explanation for an event is not something I really appreciate reading on a
       <em>
        conspiracy subreddit.
       </em>

       Thanks for this, this thread is basically devoid of any of the evidence we already have so far and is meant to dismiss conspiracy right away. Those who refuse to look at the evidence versus the narrative are literally crazy for this shit because it allows them to pretend they know something and get on with their day.

       IMO it's also very convenient for people trying to push the gun control narrative; if he's just some random dude with absolutely no political motive it's a lot easier to push the "we need to ban all guns" angle than if he were radicalized by oh I don't know the John Brown Gun Club or similar radical Antifa affiliated organizations. Not saying that's what happened, not saying he's
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       some random crazy subhuman animal, but concluding there is no deeper motivation is at this point very premature.

       The sheriff's comments last night were somewhat odd, and there's at least some evidence to suggest other people knew about his plot (why would he just up and send his SO back to the Philippines and write her a check for 100Gs? What of the people at the concert who said there were people telling them they were all going to die?)

       I think the point is that if you spend a lot of time on this subreddit you can start to see conspiracy where none exists.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure either way on this one, there is a lot of strange things about this situation and I hope we get more information in the coming weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think sometimes people need reminding though that bad things actually do just happen for no reason. Sometimes someone just snaps. It's not always a big conspiracy.

       these days. But let's be honest, it's not astroturf. The sad truth is that this is the GenPop of reddit making a beachhead here. As the subscriber numbers grow, it's going to continue to be more and more basic-bitch. I've seen it happen over the last year or so especially. "They use the two party system to divide us" has been almost totally replaced with "You're a T_D/ShareBlue shill!!" accusations (buying into the very obvious D&amp;C hyperpartisan tactics carried over from places like
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       or
       <a href="/r/the_donald">
        /r/the_donald
       </a>
       .) Expect
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       more of this. Also, expect
       <em>
        way
       </em>
       more people lobbing accusations of "tinfoil" or the like. You can see it clear as day in this thread: comments such as "LOL THANKS FOR THE LOGICAL POST xD" are legion, even though this post really doesn't belong on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       I'd be very happy if it's an influx of normies.  That means they're getting exposed to critical views of news events and the structure of society, even if it's a shock to their worldview.

       I would normally agree but I just can't understand why he would have taken such a risk smuggling so many guns in. And the amount of ammo too. Add to this the taxi footage indicating two shooters, I don't know, I just can't help but think that something is amiss.

       I was thinking about how he would smuggle so many guns in without anyone noticing. But why would he need to buy 33 guns within 12 months?! I feel that maybe he was selling guns to the black market (cartels, some speculate ISIS). Whether it be an inside job or a botched job..something doesn't add up. Also someone posted that his private plane is now owned by a defense company. Per his previous employment history, he clearly had to have security clearance. My dad works for a defense company, govt always keeps tabs. It's difficult to understand how he could have planned such a horrendous act in advance without any red flags.

         Girlfriend was a 62 year old retired high-stakes hostess who seemed to be away more often then not. She might have loved him, might have been the only person he thought loved him -- ( point 5.) possibly the reason for the wire transfer, possibly to her family in the Philippines.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Lived a reclusive life in a retirement community 80 miles outside the city and according to neighbors he kept his houses rather bare and spent most time in town gambling. Staff that knew him as a regular considered him nice, but a bit of a slob, a bit of a schmuck, a well comped whale -- He had money, but this isn't some Hugh Hefner lifestyle we're talking about here.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         His mom seemed to be the only person he was emotionally close to, possibly because he and his brother Eric never knew their father. But considering she's almost 90, and the call wasn't to her but to Eric to see how she was doing following hurricane Irma, I dunno if she is present enough to be considered close.

       This is all just speculation, but lines up pretty closely with what we've learned so far about the guy.

       So you've proved my point about a gf that loved him, he had multiple houses and was often traveling. Not living at a retirement community. He might've been resident there but he wasn't really living there. As you say he traveled for long periods of time. What's your point exactly? You're not disputing much. Also A couple million dollars is luxurious in 95% of people's minds.

       To be fair, he also doesn't even know if his brother and Marilou were married or not, just that they were dating. There's something sketchy about the brothers answers. He didn't seem close with his brother at all, saying the last time they talked was 6 months ago, aside from Stephen asking about the hurricane.
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, the person who responded to you was talking about Marilou travelling, not about Stephen travelling. You said he proved your point by saying Stephen was travelling, which he did no such thing.

       I wouldn't really call him a world traveller, he occasionally traveled to Florida to visit family and see his mother and took cruises, not what I'd call a man of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       For normal people, millions of dollars is luxury and the one or two cruises they took on vacation from work are an amazing break from everyday life. For a multi-millionaire retiree, that's just every other day and if you're unfulfilled personally that shit doesn't really make you happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be fun, for a while, but once that shit wears off it can feel pretty hollow, and feeling emotionally empty around genuinely happy, excited people, can be soul crushing.

       Mental illness isn't logical. Mental illness isn't rational. Mental illness doesn't give a fuck about whether you're poor or wealthy. Just because he was in a good position in life does not make him immune to it. People that are in a good place financially, materially and seem like the happiest people you know kill themselves all the time. That's the nature of mental illness.

       If this is the case, they apparently found explosives; seems more likely he'd just use them? He'd been there for a few days at this point. He had enough time to do SOMETHING with them if loss of life was his main agenda.

       I think there's a large gap between "disaffected loser" and the extensive effort put into going out this way. 
 Even if the motivation turns out to be some kind of non-rational thought process we don't really understand.

       Someone with his means could have boosted his ego much more easily.  In fact, I would assume an older male with a lot of disposable income would have been found overdosed on cocaine and robbed of his money by some hooker, with casino employees relating anecdotes of him buying drinks and hanging out with lounge lizards.

      <p>
       The logistics of getting that particular room, well in advance of the concert, moving all that equipment up there, setting up cameras, etc, etc... Way too involved for someone just wanting to go out in a blaze of glory.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my humble opinion.

       The number of guns is a little odd and puts a strange spin on the level of planning. You could probably reasonably plan this in a weekend. Get 5 rifles, plenty of rounds might take a couple weeks, but I know nothing about that stuff. He likely had stayed at the hotel when there was an event in that area, maybe even in a similar room. So the only planning needed would be to say "id like to stay in the room I stayed in before or on the same side" and to look up when an event would be at the venue. Order cameras online and get a big suitcase, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is clear he did plan this out, which makes a few things odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       23 guns. Why? Maybe he had accomplices that backed out at the end?
      </p>
      <p>
       Security guard shot through the door. Doesn't seem to match the police scanners.
      </p>
      <p>
       No info about bags in his room or how he got to the hotel that I have seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plenty of rounds not used. And long pauses in his shooting. You'd think with the number of guns and amount of ammo, the goal would be to shoot as much and as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kind of brings me back to the Boston bombing and how the bombers acted after the shooting, going on that strange, GTA-esque spree through Boston. It almost seemed like they saw they were being blamed for the attack were surprised to see that and freaked out. For someone that had planned something like that and expected to get away with it, I would expect there to be an exit strategy and an understanding that they would be identified.

       As much as it seems like everything doesn't add up and there should be more to the story, the surprising lack of information makes me think your theory is probably closest to the truth.

       What do you think of the media being obsessed with the wife and also filing FOIA requests before the investigation is even finished and finding out he was employed by the USPS, IRS, and Department of Defense? They didn't just ask the investigators, they filed FOIA. Do you find the answer they got interesting?

       Hijacking this comment a bit to share my story
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in the woods, at a music festival, frying face in the woods when this all went down
      </p>
      <p>
       I was in the overflow section of the campgrounds, in a spot I'd never been in before. Apparently it is close to a shooting range, which I didn't fully realize until the next morning
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, when the sun came up, I was greeted by the sound of people revving their bike engines and gunfire
      </p>
      <p>
       Tripping, I was terrified. I imagined this whole scenario very similar to what OP described, except with a group. I thought maybe a group of biker misfits had enough and were about to roll through the campgrounds capping people and raping chicks to get their revenge for being rejected by the party atmosphere of the festival grounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was horrified to get home and find out that the same weekend, my nightmare was coming true in Las Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I desperately hope that this is some kind of heavily orchestrated ISIS attack, because to me, the notion that loneliness can just make someone snap like this is even more terrifying to me

       I think you just summed up why people immediately go full conspiracy when shit like this goes down. Imagine a world where at any moment some person can lose it and kill people indiscriminately. No rhyme no reason, no grand scheme or sexy plot line. Not a larger than life movie villain, just your neighbor or a coworker. Or some guy hundreds of feet away watching you having fun, living your life. People want this so badly to have a bigger purpose so their lives aren't meaningless and scary. So here we are grasping at anything to give this meaning, hoping it's the evils we know instead of dangerous uncertainty.

       I was thinking that too, but it's always important to consider all possibilities, regardless. This shooting is different from the others in some key ways so it's good to consider different possibilities.

       For someone to do that, they would have to be a complete sociopath. Perhaps he was a complete sociopath, there should be evidence of that throughout his life though. People can normally tell if they've been around a sociopath long enough that there's something not right about them. So far all interviews with people who knew him don't seem to indicate he was one, but it's possible I suppose.

       You really think that someone with the mindset of killing other people before they killed themself isn't going to try to hurt as many people as they possibly can? Regardless of motivation, every single one of these mass killings have a goal of taking out as many people as possible. The only difference between this guy and others is that he chose a setup that gave him the ability to hurt more people.

       It is possible, but unlikely.  But we can admit its a possible scenario.  From a shut and close case, it looks that simple dont it? Nothing to see here, move along.  Just a gun nut that had debt so he offed himself after killing a bunch of people he didnt know, that was all preplanned for a long time, booked ahead, he had cameras setup, a ton of guns, he used to work for lockemartin, though he was super quiet and just "hung out" and had a low key life....but next his brother and everyone is saying, oh no he made us rich abd was a huge gambler and he just was so good at gambling he was rich and lived a large life and blah blah.  Which is the opposite of what the bro said before. The bro was probably involved in with what his brother did or at the least knew about his bro being a spook that made money doing "defense contracting deals" that are actually illegal, but they regularly met at the casio hotels and did deals there.  Gambling in vegas is a great cover and a easy way to launder money.  His wife either knows about everything and theyll somehow "silence" her, or shes an idiot that was just with this guy for his money.  The family is suspect for sure, either knew what he did and covered for him and spun it like it wasnt bad, and now his bro is kinda nervously covering and acting weird cuz he knows hr could be in huge trouble for taking money and knowing his bro did shady stuff with shady peeps

       Yes, the simplest explanation is usually correct, and this is the simplest explanation. People do shit like this, he just killed more than usual.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think there was some darker stuff in his past than at first glance, which is why I theorized that he was a weapons dealer who used gambling as a cover for illegal income. I don't know if it had anything to do with the shooting at all, probably not.

       Even in that case, he'd be
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       more likely to pick a bunch of people he knew, or who he felt definitely had it coming.
       <br/>
       I'm not going to say that it's impossible that he just wanted to kill a bunch of random people, but I will say that it's one of the least likely possibilities, especially considering that the PTB are desperate to disarm the public in a hurry (scary shit) and this shooting arrived right on schedule.

       To play devils advocate, OP is describing the life of rich gambler casino addicts as one of loneliness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats just not true. Casinos as well as the entire city are meticulously built to play on your reptile brains reward centers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Old rich folks in a casino are having a great fuckin time. Millionaires aka the top 1% of successful people don't consider themselves losers.

       The public, especially the victims families, would like to know what that note says. They’d also like to see the surveillance footage from a hotel in Vegas of him moving about, checking in, using an elevator etc. Basically all the proof possible to show that this isn’t  a conspiracy.

       Hard to say, sometimes those connections don't mean shit, either. Ever met an HR department? DoD's HR is just as shitty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example: lets say I did something crazy and wind up on the news. Media could then say that "i killed tupac was known to the FBI, and had been interviewed by them prior"....which is true!! But, it's true because I have a concealed carried permit and professional licenses (meaning I am "known by" the FBI), and I had a room mate who applied for an IT job with the government, and he used me as a character reference, which meant I willingly talked to an FBI agent to give a character reference. All legit stuff...but-could be spun to sound very nefarious.

       I think often people drawn to gambling have low dopamine (due to genes, poor nutrition, aging), and then they get a dopamine surge when they win allowing them to feel kind of OK for a while and it's very addictive for them. A normal serotonergic antidepressant isn't going help this kind of person much and I think it could even make him worse, so I hope details about any medication he was on come out. I think the simple explanation of depression being the reason is definitely possible. Because he is older, I would also want to rule out dementia, and I didn't see the gory pictures of his corpse but if they can check his brain for tumors I am guessing that would be good info.

       Interesting post man.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've heard from his brothers account though, he wasn't the kind of guy to ask for help, so I don't think he was on any kind of medication.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for dementia, he seems a bit young for that, and considering the planning involved it seems unlikely, but tumors are a very real possibility I hadn't considered.

       It really raises my hackles how armchair detectives keep over-analyzing this. Maybe there is more to the story, maybe not, there's no way to tell with our limited vantage point. Sometimes people just snap and want to kill a bunch of people because humans are apes with guns. It could may well be the only reason this guy was so "successful" with his killing spree is because he was more wealthy, methodical, and intelligent than the average bear.
      </p>
      <p>
       But my guess, is that he was a rich misanthropic loner who felt like lashing out at the "normies" who were out having fun enjoying music and camaderies in the ways that even with all of his money is was not able to.

       I am enjoying some of the theories so far. Not the ones that are obviously way out there, like that occult ritual bullshit, or the fake dead bodies/crisis actors stuff. But the leaked pictures, the speculation on other shooters, and the letter on the desk. Even the girl that was out of the country. Its kind of a wild ride lol. That's the only reason I browse this sub.

       My scanner notified me around 10pm and I couldn't turn it off til 3. Heard all the chaos. Watched all the videos. Heard them breach the door. Heard them read the lady's name off the credit card. Immediately opened a tab to 4chan, and someone already had her and her husband's social media accounts posted. It was crazy!

       This theory and one other theory are the only theories that I will entertain until more information comes out.
      </p>
      <p>
       His father was a bank robber as well, Could be a genetic trait for some kind of aggression or cloudy thinking / mentally torn up. Or He maybe felt like he needed to one up his father in some sick strange way that he never got to do.. even in being successful in his life.. and watching it be completely meaningless without happiness? Possible that all of what you said is true and some of this could be tied into his brain.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only other theory Is that he was a patsy. He was happy just living it up. But had outstanding debts.. and was offered a deal to do an arms trade in his hotel. He takes xxx amount of bags into a room as seen in some footage to be released any day now.. Once all the guns are there they shoot him, two guys shoot up the crowd and leave. Legislation gets pushed through for metal detectors in buildings that have more than xxx amount of floors in metro areas.. Metal Detector businesses make millions since it's quite obvious that after sandy hook guns aren't going to be pried out of anyone's cold dead hands... who else could stand to make money?

       I can't buy into the isis crap or that he was a CIA agent and something he was doing fell apart very badly and someone else did it or that he was forced to do it. There are too many holes in those theories still. And usually, even in conspiracies the most obvious answer is the correct one.

       It sounds plausible, but there have been billions of people who were old, bored, tired of everything, and depressed.

       Even if this were the case, there would probably be SOME catalyst, and that would be nice to know at the very least

       A Conservative, 2A supporting, 1A supporting, Traditional, Family-Oriented, Miltary-Loving, Rural, Red-blooded Americans.

       Maybe he chose his target for that reason. Maybe he chose his target because it was a very easy target to inflict mass casualties. I’m not agreeing or disagreeing with you. The lack of known motive is the biggest question I have. Hopefully we will have an answer soon enough.

       I don't think he picked the festival for any specific reason other than that it would have  a huge crowd and be easily targeted from a hotel window. There were reports that he had considered a downtown concert a few weeks before that had a different audience (I think it was rappers). For a practical reason he decided to wait or change targets.

       Practical?
Or maybe he targeted the assumed political affiliation of his enemies; instead of his allies?

       By practical I mean I think he switched targets because he couldn't book the hotel room facing the concert he wanted. He had no allies. If he wanted to make a political statement he would have chosen a specific political target or made his intention known with a written statement. This was chosen for how many people he could kill at once.

       I’ve seen somebody else ask this elsewhere and i thought it was a good point. I want to see his medical records. Maybe the mix of what you mentioned (no life, no big accomplishments, etc) mixed with a diagnosis of a terminal illness sparked him to do something “great,” something he would be “remembered for,” good or bad.

       Yeah, that's a big question that hasn't really been discussed that much, considering he still had stacks of mags.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the crowd thinned out enough he wasn't able to just fire randomly into the crowd, maybe he wanted this to be random and not personal? Maybe he tried but wasn't able to make the shots. Maybe he felt remorse or guilt after the fact? Maybe he felt a sense of power in being able to decide life and death, and the decision to stop felt more powerful in that moment.

       This is a question the videos he was taking would be key to answering.

       I'd understand 5 or so rifles being needed for overheating if he was planning on firing 1000+ rounds. 23 seems to me like he had these guns and (as sick as this is) wanted to try out some of his favorites before he blew his brains out.

       1) I'm not "trying to strawman," what you said just doesn't make any sense. 2) You said he only needed 5, but brought 23 because he wanted to "try out" some of his faves. So he brought 23 of his guns, so he could "try out" 5 of them before he killed himself? Because... he wanted to kill himself in the presence of his favorite guns? That's why he brought so many?

        Yeah, that's a big question that hasn't really been discussed that much, considering he still had stacks of mags. Maybe the crowd thinned out enough he wasn't able to just fire randomly into the crowd, maybe he wanted this to be random and not personal? Maybe he tried but wasn't able to make the shots? Maybe he felt remorse or guilt after the fact? Maybe he felt a sense of power in being able to decide life and death, and the decision to stop felt more powerful in that moment? This is a question the videos he was taking would be key to answering. Great question.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       He might have planned to keep shooting. He might have wanted to try them all out when he planned this, but for some reason he stopped. We don't know why as of yet.

      <p>
       The point about strawmanning was that you said:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        your best explaination: man brings 23 guns to LV to sit amongst them in a hotel, and says, "hey why not?"

      <p>
       Which is not at all what I've said within this thread and is a total oversimplification of even that single comment I made to you.

      <p>
       this sounds to me like you're saying: he just so happened to have 23 guns with him, and then all of a sudden wanted to "try out" just a few of them before committing suicide. Apparently that's not what you meant? hmph.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now you're thinking... maybe he brought all 23 of the guns, because they were all his favorites, and he just wouldn't be able to pick a fewer number than that- and maybe he really wanted to use all 23 of his favorite guns... but then he lost the will for life after "trying out" just 5 of them... yeah, maybe.

       With all the crazy speculation circulating on this subreddit about this guy right now I tried to do what Sheriff Joe Lombardo said he couldn't do when he said "I can't get into the mind of a psychopath at this point."
      </p>
      <p>
       And no disrespect to Sheriff Lombardo, this is an unprecedented, tragic attack on this country and he is under an unimaginable amount of pressure. He's got more things to worry about right now than the rationale of some fuckin sore loser.

       The FBI psychs will need to take their time to digging up this guys entire life, that's why this motive thing has taken so long.

       Sadly Stephen Paddock is one of the sick fucks that people will be making documentaries about for years to come, which seems ironically is exactly what he wanted.

       What I'm saying is you can't see the significance of one little detail. All the details add up to make up the picture. If you already know this then wtf. Yes we aren't actively involved in the investigation this is why we are investigating on our own with the limited information given. We then explore all options, doesn't mean that are exploration into those options will be fruitful. See things like this interest me but I wouldn't make a career out of it. I'm a citizen just trying to understand. If you don't want to part of this then why the fuck are you here.

       What really gets me is why does this bother you so much? I understand that facts are important. If society always just stuck to the facts and never looked closer or outside of the realm of the facts would we be where we are today? I think you don't mean ill and you just respect facts a lot more than the average person and that is commendable.

       There are all sorts of questions I have about why Paddock decided to shoot up a concert. However, why there is a stack of magazines in his hotel room near the window isn't one of them. It's entirely in concordance with his activities.

       and this is why you could and might easily over look details. no one knows if the stacks are empty or full (assumption, full). no one knows if he simply didnt get to them, or for some reason decided to stack them back up (assumption, didnt get to them).
      </p>
      <p>
       unless we were to ever get unadultered access to the evidence as it was found, or access to the supposed video he recorded of himself (if that existed, might explain a lot), there is no way that we will ever know what truly happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       you can take a single still frame out of context and make up any story about it that you want, but unless you were there, unless you have some other information other than being able to look at a damn picture, you have no idea what happened precisely.
      </p>
      <p>
       it is perfectly fine to make assumptions about what you believe could have happened. It is quite different to phrase it as knowing or proving that something happened a specific way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not quite sure why you think that a situation like this would all play out to the perfect logic in your head. If Paddock did this, he wasnt using logic. Logic would guide him away from murdering others and himself.
       <strong>
        IF
       </strong>
       it was him, I do not believe he was thinking logically, and therefore I do not believe that your logic definitively applies to his actions.

       You can't even get out of your own ego driven head to be open to the possibility that I'm not driven by self gratification. If you'd just shut the fuck up for a day and took the time to listen to what others have to offer, like the researchers who made rich mans trick and sacred geometry in plain sight, you'd realize that you know nothing. Your entire life has been built on lies, deceit, and fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not arguing with you so I can feel better about myself, I'm trying to get you to simply open your mind to the possibility that there's more to the world than is on the surface.

       It's about math and sacred geometry and freemasonry, not even about illuminati.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another video is about the human brain and psychology. It's my favorite video because it shows you what your ego is and why letting go of that illusory "self" is how you are able to see beyond yourself. And trust me hombre, you've got a big one.

       Or, you can stay afraid. That's probably easier right?
