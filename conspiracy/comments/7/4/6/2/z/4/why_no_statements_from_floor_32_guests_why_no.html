        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Still trying to wrap my head around all of this. </p>

<p>I get that there are crazy people who do crazy things, but what we do know about this guy and the situation just doesn&#39;t fully make sense. At all. I know I&#39;m not the only one saying this, but really think about it EVERYBODY. </p>

<p>Why no statements from floor 32 guests? There had to be people staying on that floor near him. Or below him. Or above him. Why didn&#39;t people immediately call to the front desk? Or why haven&#39;t they come forward to give their statement on what happened? They never saw him lookin weird?</p>

<p>Why no security footage? There are cameras EVERYWHERE in Vegas. They have to have video of him taking up all of these suitcases. And if so, just release them and put people&#39;s mind at ease that he brought them all. And show him just on security footage!</p>

<p>Why the high dollar money transfers? I get online gambling. I love it myself. But transfers to the Philippines and a recent one of $100k?? Why?? And who to?? Unless it was in crypto, they can track it!</p>

<p>Why all of the weapons? That is so many weapons for one person. And he didn&#39;t even use them all. He had to have either been selling them or stocked up for multiple people. </p>

<p>Why stop so early? If he had all of these guns and all of this ammo and he was by himself and had cameras set up to see when people were coming, why did he stop when he did?? I am very very very happy that he did end up stopping when he did. I wish this shit never even happened. Or came in to people&#39;s minds to do such a thing to anyone. But if you&#39;re this set up, why the sudden halt??</p>

<p>I know other people are thinking this shit, but damn it is eating me alive. This kind of stuff is so fucked up. So many people&#39;s lives just destroyed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure, I was questioning the fuck out of the broken window situation yesterday and today.  &quot;They were really far a part&quot; &quot;was there one or 2 rooms&quot; &quot;32nd floor of a 43 story casino hotels typically has the suites towards to top levels&quot;... I even searched for floor plans and evacuation escape maps that would have the floor plans... I found nothing.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/745npv/eleven_years_on_reddit_and_this_is_the_first_time/dnvpwlc/">Then a user just game me a video</a> of a guided tour of (I think the actual room) of a suite on the 32nd floor, showing exactly the layout.  Then it made sense and i moved on.  Does that mean my questioning was stupid or dumb. To question and think for myself is one of my favorite things, but once you find evidence to make your doubt less unattainable or realistic , than accept and move on to other questions.  </p>

<p>Moving on when proved wrong is the most important but difficult part. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess, for me it&#39;s just an Idea or question, and I honestly believe there is no stupid question that can&#39;t be answered... So why not ask it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When presented with undoubtable facts, I immediately move on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, to a certain extent, unless I think the undoubtable truth is bias and being sold to me vs actually making sense... There is a difference imo and I see emotions or conclusions sometime trumping basic facts (on both sides).  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The only constant is that a bunch of people died and got injured and is super fucked up and should never happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes and no, I would agree people died, but if there is someone who is questioning whether this whole this was fake (which I truly doubt), I don&#39;t blame or harp on them for questioning that.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But always be aware and help change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, at least in the sense to help to correct any misinformation.  Totally agree whole heartily!!! have a good evening! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To one of your points...Why stop so early? I haven&#39;t got statistics in front of me but I would say your average mass shooting is over in say 20 minutes give or take a few minutes. This guy seems to have fired on the crowd for around 15 minutes. And he probably anticipated that was about the time to police would be kicking his door in. Try and step in this guy&#39;s head for a bit. Imagine how you would be feeling after 15 minutes of continuous killing. Your adrenaline would have been absolutely pumping during that period. I reckon he would be a wreck mentally and physically. He probably created more carnage than he anticipated. He may have even had a sudden jolt of &quot;holy fuck what have I just done&#39; or &#39;fuck it time to tap out&#39;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely have thought about it that way, but I have also REALLY put myself in this guy&#39;s head for a minute too. And I see a very thought out plan, with an obvious arsenal and massive amounts of ammo, including mags stacked. He knew what carnage he was going to create. Or they were. Or he was just the fall guy. I, of course, have no fucking idea. 
But seriously, why no barricade on the door? 
And he had that camera outside. He had to have been watching. And yes, he shot for a very long time. Be he had soooooo much more time before a lot of cops got there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Couldnt this dude have been a hardcore leftist who orchestrated the worst lone wolf attack in US history for the specific purpose of setting up the political landscape in favor of harsher gun laws? He could have known that since he was white/rich/retired/successful the only thing left to talk about is the gun, of which he owned legally and modified using legally sold shit?</p>

<p>So he carries out the shooting and its fucking devastating in a very short period, to the point that its obvious he had set a new record, at which point he stops and shoots himself in the head. He had enough ammo and time to kill every person who stuck around, along with surveillance outside his door; everything points to him bunkering down. But he doesnt even try to fight off police because he kills himself a full hour before they bust down his hotel door.</p>

<p>If he had started shooting again after the first 9 minute wave (when medical assistance was being given), the results would be absolutely more horrific. Deaths would certaintly have been 100+ in my opinion.</p>

<p>Idk what to think really. I don&#39;t believe this dude was an FBI agent and that this thing goes very deep. I think its simple because it was almost politicised by design, but I also know that us humans use logic to try to cope when horrible things happen. People die and we identify with it and reflect ourselves and our loved ones and try to make sense of horrible things, but sometimes it just doesn&#39;t make sense. The theory that hes an old idiotic athiest that wanted to live out his rambo fantasy fits just as well unfortunately. </p>

I definitely see how a crazy person wanting to help the fight for strict gun laws would have some crazy thought that this would help and do this fucked up stuff. 
However, if you&#39;re that crazy, why not kill more people to make more of a point? Make it worse than a terrorist attack so people see gun control more seriously than terrorism?
Also, if you are so against guns, how can you continue buying them for over 20 years?

As for why didnt he make the number bigger, idk thats for him and i guess god to know. The Columbine killers could have killed plenty more, but the theory is that they just didnt enjoy the killing after the first wave of adrenaline and chose to kill themselves ahead of schedule. I personally cant look at road kill without vomiting so I couldn&#39;t ever imagine something so horrible, it has to get to you at some point. At least I hope it does, and I hope we don&#39;t live in a world where terrorism becomes a political mean for the retired baby boomer.</p>

<p>A simple do not disturb sign on the handle is all that would take. Most hotels won&#39;t even bother knocking for 3 days if they are paid up.</p>

<p>This is true in pretty much any motel across the land so I imagine hotel casinos see quite a bit more DND signs with the occasional midnight call for fresh linen. </p>

<p>As Dee Jay Silver and his wife Jenna took cover from the gunfire raining down on the Route 91 Harvest Festival on Sunday night (Oct. 1), their 13-month son, Wake, was even closer to the shooter. In a post on Instagram, Jenna recounts how <strong>her young boy was only three doors down from the 32nd-floor room in Mandalay Bay from which the shooter, Stephen Paddock, was firing</strong>.</p>

<p>“Our sweet baby slept through the horrific sounds coming from just down the hall that have now forever changed us,” Jenna says, before thanking <strong>first responders “who beat the door in”</strong> and her Aunt Mary, “who was watching him and protecting him all the way to safety.” </p>
