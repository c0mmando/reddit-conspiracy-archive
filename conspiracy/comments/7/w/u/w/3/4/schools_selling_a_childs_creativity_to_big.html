        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the UK, we have a school financing crisis. Usually there are between 30-45 kids in one primary school class, in some parts of London it can go up to 60 kids in one class. With population increasing, more schools should be built but that&#39;s not the case - instead funding is being cut.</p>

<p>This problem is so big that some schools have been going around with collection tins just to stay open. Teachers have been buying stationary out of their own pockets because funds are so tight. Not to mention traditional school fundraisers such as fairs.</p>

<p>But when I was at primary school, only a decade or so ago, my school didn&#39;t have a funding problem. In fact, we were always getting expensive upgrades such as jungle gyms and were handed the latest tech such as PSPs - which we were allowed to keep and take home until the end of the year. Unfortunately some kid downloaded porn on his PSP and we all got them taken off us.</p>

<p>But do you not find that strange? Playstation Portable was cool as fuck to a kid that age so no questions were asked by us, our parents didn&#39;t complain at free shit either. But I think there was something sinister going on there. I can tell you now, as soon as we got those PSPs, every single kid in the class convinced their parents to buy at least one game to play with - i got Gran Turismo 5.</p>

<p>Sony make sales for games, they take the device off the kid and they have to buy their own PSP to keep playing the games, now they&#39;ve sold a PSP as well. They now have a potential lifelong customer and to top it all off, it has little annual cost since they can just reuse the devices. The school takes a small royalty to keep the pencils sharpened and they get to impress parents with free tech.</p>

<p>That is not the only time I believe me and my fellow flatmates were played by big business and our school. We used to have this class where every week we&#39;d get driven out to the Newcastle Falcons (rugby club) IT room, and they&#39;d show us examples of banner ads for their sponsors/partners such as O2, Lucozade, Northern Rock, Puma and we were just told to create promotional content for those brands, design banner ads, make power-points about why the product is so good, slogans, posters, you name it.</p>

<p>We were very easy to manipulate. Unlike a team of hired, adult designers, we were all fueled with creative energy, enthusiasm, the need to feel rewarded and recognized, and competitiveness.</p>

<p>If you do that with every year 4 class in the city, you&#39;re bound to find at least one idea that is original and brilliant. Better still, those companies got a look at their product from a child&#39;s perspective - meaning they can market it better and make apt adjustments. And additionally, those companies are deeply seated in that child&#39;s mind as they&#39;ve been spending an hour a week making promotional material for it, direct marketing at a young age is very powerful as it can earn some lifelong customers and lots of sales. Again, it would be relatively low cost compared to alternatives that achieve the same thing.</p>

<p>At the time, we just saw this as an excuse to get out of lessons and do something different so it was great, obviously we were getting some sort of experience from it so our parents and the school were fine by it.</p>

<p>I think what makes this conspiracy so beautiful/scary is that I only remembered about this last night when me and a friend were discussing old times - most people won&#39;t think about this kind of stuff years down the line and when they do, it&#39;s still very well hidden.</p>

<p>Is this wrong or is this an all-parties-benefit situation?</p>

<p>Did any of you have similar experiences?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s fascinating that despite being 1/5th our size, our brethren across the pond have experienced the same issues we have here in the States.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we have a school financing crisis. Usually there are between 30-45 kids in one primary school class, in some parts of London it can go up to 60 kids in one class. With population increasing, more schools should be built but that&#39;s not the case - instead funding is being cut.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This describes the Public School situation in almost every major inner city in the US. Massive funding issues and overcrowding- but instead of fixing this problem, or building new schools, our politicians are seeking to build &quot;charter schools&quot; which saps money from the PS system and privatizes it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Teachers have been buying stationary out of their own pockets because funds are so tight. Not to mention traditional school fundraisers such as fairs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same stuff happens here in the States- as I said, especially in the poorer (and usually far larger) inner city districts. Teachers buying stationary for students that just can&#39;t afford it in a school that just can&#39;t afford it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>in fact, we were always getting expensive upgrades such as jungle gyms and were handed the latest tech such as PSPs - which we were allowed to keep and take home until the end of the year. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve seen this before as well- but with Tablets and laptops instead of PSP&#39;s. This seems to be something the current generation gets more of than mine did, but something I&#39;ve noticed nonetheless. For example- schools will give laptops for the year that the student is expected to use inside and out of class- yet it is still school property.</p>

<p>Perhaps some of these districts get deals- with Dell, or in your case with Sony, where they get a major bulk discount and everyone &quot;wins&quot;...the school looks hip and the business gets its name known among children.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>we were just told to create promotional content for those brands, design banner ads, make power-points about why the product is so good, slogans, posters, you name it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This never happened to me but is again something that I have heard about in various regions across the country. I think it&#39;s the same idea behind why China is placing 3D printers in all of its schools as well...to see what the kids come up with and be there asap to snatch it all up.</p>

<p>Great post OP...very insightful when compared to the experiences of schooling as I&#39;ve had and seen them in the US. </p>

<p>This reminds me, I forgot to mention something else, basically I remember in secondary school we were asked to design a perfume bottle in Design Tech class and i designed this in some basic modeling software - it&#39;s selling for £25 a bottle now - obviously it is possible that its a coincidence but it is EXACTLY the same as what I submitted to my teacher just years ago <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/DSquared-He-Wood-EDT-50ml-Spray-For-Men-/401467118820">https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/DSquared-He-Wood-EDT-50ml-Spray-For-Men-/401467118820</a></p>

<p>Also thanks, it&#39;s really interesting to see how similar things are in the states and china.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crazy! Thanks so much for sharing, I fully agree with the conclusions you&#39;re suggesting. The borrowed PSPs are especially insidious considering that Sony had made their proprietary UMD format for it, and was trying to push all kinds of media on it. </p>

<p>Look at this list (not even complete!) of movies released on UMD that will never be playable again for anyone who bought them - <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXoypizjW3WknFiJnKLwHCnL72vedxjQkDDP1mXWo6uco/wiki/List_of_movies_and_television_shows_released_on_UMD.html">list!</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>In our town parents buy everything for everyone. They even have made up packs for us at wally world. There&#39;s a list each year, such items as 3 packs of clorox wipes, 3 packs of kleenex, so many boxes of pencils, red pens, black pens, glue, construction paper. Then we might have to buy those same things again sometime during the year because the classroom ran out. All these things are shared by the whole classroom so those that don&#39;t want to buy because they are &quot;&#39;too poor&quot;&quot; don&#39;t buy. Thing is, you won&#39;t find 15 kids to a classroom that are too poor, but you will find 15 that are hispanic. So the parents that don&#39;t buy are the parents that are also working for cash and getting welfare and food stamps. I&#39;m so glad we don&#39;t have kids in school anymore. </p>
