    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I have to always be mindful of not just letting my biases take over, and it&#39;s definitely an ongoing challenge, but for <em>some small</em> things it doesn&#39;t really matter.   </p>

<p>The problem I see here so often is that people will claim to be &quot;free thinking/woke/critical thinkers&quot; but all that means is agreeing with anything that is anti-government, anti-corporation or comes from Alex Jones or whatever other conspiracy theorist/alternative news site, and disagreeing or dismissing anything that the government has an official stance on, or a large news corporation has a story on. It&#39;s like every single mass tragedy always has to be some conspiracy or there&#39;s hidden shooters, crisis actors, or other similar things. They&#39;re more likely to believe some YouTuber who found a few small discrepancies, or some other coincidence, and then use those tiny pieces to completely dismiss the event as a hoax because they think the government or the authorities are always conspiring against them.  </p>

<p>What they fail to recognise, is that sometimes the story you hear from the authorities is the truth, and sometimes there are small discrepancies in an otherwise truthful story. And on the other hand sometimes there is enough evidence to truly doubt a story, and sometimes they are covering something up. But the most important thing is not &quot;picking a side&quot;, but forming an opinion based on all available evidence and not dismissing any other evidence because it doesn&#39;t fit with your pre-formed opinion/theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. I am only 19 so I am young and naive. Ive only been in this since the Bernie Sanders incident. For about a month or 2, I was on the &quot;Trump train&quot;(I&#39;m from Canada), while i was only a lurker, it felt good to &quot;stick it to the man&quot;. I fully understand why people fall for it, and I don&#39;t blame them for it. Yes lots of the negativity are from whats called &quot;shills&quot;, but regular people can be that way, no doubt. After-all, we are all dopamine driven to different extents, and when your dopamine gets intertwined with the ego(most people), you get ignorance. </p>

<p>I always try to take an objective look at my thought process and try to identify my biases, even if they are long lasting biases. 
If the attention is on being introspective and trying to be your best self, and always trying to get better, that is awesome; you are likely a good person. Yes good people can do bad things, I have done some things I regret. Point is, people who are &quot;truth seekers&quot; are just regular people who crave the truth. I am one of them. </p>

<p>Maybe the stress and insight is a little stressful, but its for a larger purpose in my opinion. I believe in the power of conscience, and that may be one of my biases; I accept that. I feel it makes me a better person, and more wise as I try to understand whats going on in this place called reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t think that being a free thinker means you’re without bias. I think it’s more being able to see through other people’s bias and form your own conclusions. Of course they’ll be biased too, based on everyone’s individual experiences, religious beliefs, political opinions, etc. But I honestly think that a person who did their own research and made their conclusion through critical thinking but ends up being wrong is still better off than the person who heard it online and believed it without question and ended up being correct. But that’s just my take on things</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First one I agree with, but it sure felt like that one was pushed by flat earthers, and I’m already skeptical enough about that theory being pushed to discredit real conspiracy research.</p>

<p>The Las Vegas shooting however is a perfect example of what I said, which is the authorities withholding information, and the information that is available conflicts with their own story. If I had to put a number on it, I’d say it’s a 98% chance that what the media told the public had happened is far from what actually happened. If you dig into it more, that one is sketchy as hell. Biggest mass shooting in US history was swept under the rug in under a week? Sketchy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, but I say it’s a good idea to be skeptical of any highly televised “mass shooting” event. And once the pieces started not coming together, the theories just grew from there.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>People gave plenty of explanations, many of them contradictory, and therefore a lot of them are necessarily wrong. If it were a conspiracy, there were likely several goals on varying timescales or that fit into other longer term plans. </p>

<p>But from another perspective, I don&#39;t need to understand exactly <em>why</em> some group of persons and institutions might have conspired to say that there&#39;s something that smells fishy. I don&#39;t need to provide an alternate theory to say the official story has holes in it, and the official story having holes in it alone is significant enough to merit attention. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that&#39;s my point, putting the explanation ahead of the research.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s fine to say that there is something wrong with the official story, bearing in mind that reporting is usually fluid within a few days after a traumatic event.  And it&#39;s cool that you don&#39;t need to understand the whys when something smells fishy, but in the community of people interested in conspiracy, that tends to be the way it goes.</p>

<p>JFK - do we know 100% for sure anything on that?  Lots of theories, from CIA plot to mafia hit job to USSR assassination.</p>

<p>Words have meaning, they&#39;re theories.  </p>

<p>Conspiracies?  How about the banks conspiring to steal trillions of dollars from federal coffers by betting with our money.  I dunno, we don&#39;t seem to talk about that shit anymore.  Maybe TPTB are getting better at hiding it.  Sure as shit feels like we&#39;re heading towards a new housing crisis in the US and Canada.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the term conspiracy that needs to change. The word conspiracy has been given a negative connotation. </p>

<p>A conspiracy theory refers to a theory. It wouldn&#39;t make any sense to change that to research. You might be able to call conspiracy theories as a whole conspiracy research. But it just sounds clunky and awkward when you try and refer to conspiracy research in any way. </p>

<p>Conspiracy on the other hand could easily change, and I prefer to think of it as skepticism because I don&#39;t actually believe most conspiracy theories have actual literal conspiracies at the root. </p>

<p>But it&#39;s also the communities that have the problems, not the words. Skeptic communities attract the fringe and they attract manipulators. So you change it to Alt Theory or Skeptic Theory or whatever and then it&#39;s that word that becomes corrupted. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree. I am only 19 so I am young and naive. Ive only been in this since the Bernie Sanders incident. For about a month or 2, I was on the &quot;Trump train&quot;(I&#39;m from Canada), while i was only a lurker, it felt good to &quot;stick it to the man&quot;. I fully understand why people fall for it, and I don&#39;t blame them for it. Yes lots of the negativity are from whats called &quot;shills&quot;, but regular people can be that way, no doubt. After-all, we are all dopamine driven to different extents, and when your dopamine gets intertwined with the ego(most people), you get ignorance. </p>

<p>I always try to take an objective look at my thought process and try to identify my biases, even if they are long lasting biases. 
If the attention is on being introspective and trying to be your best self, and always trying to get better, that is awesome; you are likely a good person. Yes good people can do bad things, I have done some things I regret. Point is, people who are &quot;truth seekers&quot; are just regular people who crave the truth. I am one of them. </p>

<p>Maybe the stress and insight is a little stressful, but its for a larger purpose in my opinion. I believe in the power of conscience, and that may be one of my biases; I accept that. I feel it makes me a better person, and more wise as I try to understand whats going on in this place called reality.</p>
