<p>First- thank you to everyone on this sub, and especially those of you who browse /new...you are the beating heart of this sub, what makes it what it is, and without you this sub is nothing. Without you the shills dominate the narrative. So again- keep up the good work all.</p>

<p>To those of you here tonight- what is on your mind? Conspiracy related or otherwise (personally I think a wide range of things can be conspiracy related). I&#39;m still processing the Israeli/Syrian drama from earlier today and the significance of a US supplied F-16 being downed by Syrian AA, and its repercussions on US and Israeli policy moving forward. Also, I am almost done with a fantastic book on Memetic Magick by Kirk Packwood, the PDF of which I will link below (and likely in a future post).</p>

<p>Just looking for discussion...currently on beer #3 and listening to Quiet Riots song Bang Your Head.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You asked what is on my mind. Well, this might not be a conspiracy, but I have noticed this and it has been on my mind. I think that about 90% of actors/actresses have blue or green eyes. Hardly anyone has brown eyes.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a new thing either. My husband and I were watching Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s The Birds today. All the main characters had blue eyes.</p>

<p>Just something that had been on my mind and has me wondering why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder if it&#39;s got something to do with our perceptions of beauty? Or perhaps because they &quot;pop&quot;...on both the conscious and subconscious level you are going to notice vibrant colored eyes over dark ones? Might be interesting when considering the ancient Greek concept of the Soul flowing from the eyes, or even the modern Japanese use of large eyes on Anime characters to denote personality. Interesting observation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That still doesn&#39;t touch upon why many actors have those colored eyes...correlation doesn&#39;t equal causation but it&#39;s not like ones eye color makes them a better actor...unless it does? Perhaps there is something about the genetic makeup of people with vibrant eyes that makes them tend towards acting? Just wildly spitballin&#39; lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think eye color makes them a better actor. But I do wonder if people with brown eyes are discriminated against in acting. Seems like it might be that way.</p>

<p>Too much predatory behavior for my tastes (behavior I&#39;m sure you are aware of). I would never let my children become child actors...I feel it would be a dereliction of parental duty to do so. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Indeed. Now, referring back to what you said about the majority of actors having these colored eyes, could be that they are rare, therefore more exotic to people. Thus, making the character more intriguing, mysterious, etc etc. </p>

<p>If the majority of people have brown eyes, then that would be boring to see in the movies (people are looking to escape or see something that they normally don&#39;t get to see), because the majority of people do. </p>

<p>So, give a brown eyed actor/actress contacts to make them have colored eyes, adds  something more to the part. Not really a conspiracy, per se, but maybe human nature? Humans love exotic things that do not understand or know little about. Either way though, colored eyes (blue, green, silver, etc etc) are very rare. I&#39;m glad I have blue-green eyes. I&#39;m such a unique snowflake :)</p>

<p>Not just on the big screen, but, in life. I had a husky hybrid with ice blue eyes. He was fierce, but also could melt your heart. There is just something majestic about eyes. Truly is the gateway to the soul. Maybe that is the grander conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently at the time of The Birds, nearly half of white Americans had blue eyes. I would assume that racial mixing is the cause of the decline.</p>

<p>That said, it does also seem quite common for modern celebrities despite the decline. I can&#39;t help but agree with u/bradok that beauty standards probably play a significant role in this.</p>

Less and less tenured Proffs, more adjuncts to pick up the slack, paid at a pittance. I wonder how long it will be until our Higher Ed really starts to show the neglect we have been showing it? We are still top notch in Grad programs as it stands...but that can only last so long under the current model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I&#39;ve been reviewing the most recent SpaceX fraud and the laughably fake stunt they just pulled in their latest hoax space mission, what has struck me is that the average person doesn&#39;t even know this has happened. It&#39;s not even big news. They don&#39;t know that their tax money pays for this fake shit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s as though Space X and Musk are given just enough publicity that the Space X fanboys and NASA-defending shills are placated, and that the average normie might notice it then get back to what they are doing at the time, but not enough attention that the whole country sees and is exposed to the imagery enough to even begin to question its authenticity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it has the exact same feel of all their other fake stunts but with added ridiculousness with the steals roadster up there. But there are many inconsistencies such as with the live video feed that was changed after the fact, the way there&#39;s no continuous shot of the rockets leaving the atmosphere, some glitches in the video, and others -- you should check out Jeranism&#39;s
YT channel if you want a really good review of all this so far. </p>

<p>To me, I already know Space X is fake. They are full of shit so I don&#39;t expect anything they do to all of a sudden start being authentic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been diving deep into the concept of a Corporation, what it is and where it comes from myself recently, especially municipal corporations. I doubt most know this, but the concept of a &quot;municipum&quot; or a self-governing body granted such Rights by a higher power (the State) is a Roman concept. Many cities in Roman times strived for this self governing status granted at first by the Senate and later the Emperor. </p>

<p>That got me into a deeper rabbit hole about stuff you have talked much about and I have looked into, but has caused me to keep digging. Stuff like the Crown Corp (which is why I started looking at the root of Corporations) as well as the English Bar...I am struggling to find a solid connection, however, between the British and American Bars tho. </p>

<p>That said- cheers. Just cracked open #4 myself lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The concept of Rome itself has always fascinated me...so much so that I have learned Greek and Latin in order to better understand it. I have always been drawn to their history, as I see it as the genesis of Western Civilization itself. Just watched the vid, and it&#39;s very interesting. Also worth noting that the Eastern Roman Empire didn&#39;t officially fall until 1453. </p>

<p>That said, what are your thoughts on this SP I made a few months back? It attempts to draw the connections between the ancient Roman nobility and modernity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good night bradok. Well, when it comes to the recent events in the middle east, I think things will continue to heat up, but I doubt we will enter in WWIII yet, all the more if the US and Russia still hold back for the most part.</p>

<p>I&#39;m always contantly thinking about conspiracy related things, but I like to save those for when I post. I noticed a lot of people like my content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Earlier today I was thinking on the progression of the loss of value on the common man.</p>

<p>Briefly like this:</p>

<p>Manual labor--&gt; Labor assisted with machines--&gt;automated labor --&gt; decisions assisted with machines--&gt; automated decisions.</p>

<p>I think that in any of these steps the people involved in making things easier were cheated out of their best intentions, instead of doing less work and having more time, they ended up jobless, among another thousands.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thinking about some of the crazy stuff about the moons of Saturn.  They are cool, and super interesting, but the claims of “unprecedented” are kind of dumb.  Saturn has all these weird moons, sure, but we have closely examined, what?  Like 10 or 20 so moons.  And the majority are the ones around Saturn that Cassini examined. So in truth the <em>majority</em> of them are “Unusual”.  Just means our assumptions are wrong.</p>

Also the fact that the younger generation is being groomed into wanting to share every stupid detail about their lives instead of valuing privacy.

<p>And it&#39;s just <em>accepted as normal</em> now! Even 20 years ago, people in school wouldn&#39;t share with their <em>friends</em> half of what people are sharing with strangers online now!</p>
