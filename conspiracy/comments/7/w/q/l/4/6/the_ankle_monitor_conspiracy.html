    <div class="md"><p>Hillary has no political office and McCain is sick, it&#39;s hardly proof of anything. Hillary has been pretty active, just not at major events. </p>

<p>Seriously, this entire conspiracy is idiotic. Why would they need to put ankle monitors on Hillary/Obama when they are actively being guarded by secret service? Wouldn&#39;t the democrats be screaming about their former leaders being arrested/monitored by the opposition party?</p>

<p>Hillary and McCain and Obama will never face charges. There will be no military tribunals (because they are illegal). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because Trump is president, and Clinton is not. They&#39;re both &quot;nasty&quot; in varying degrees, but Clinton never called a Gold Star widow a liar. Who does that? Especially as Commander in Chief? </p>

<p>My other main beef is why does he keep losing staff like dandruff? A chief executive needs to be able to manage people as well as his own personal wealth, but nope!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure about Trumps major &quot;scandals&quot; at this point, I&#39;m reserving judgment. But if he just came clean, in a publicly-televised deposition (can you imagine the ratings? he loves ratings!) he could put all this crap behind him and actually do some work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When his job is to say nice things to Gold Star families in particular, yes. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m in love with America&#39;s war machine, but his behavior is emblematic of his DGAF attitude.</p>

<p>Listen, we&#39;ll never (ever) know how good a president Hillary could&#39;ve been, but anyone who wants to give Trump the benefit of the doubt needs to focus on Trump&#39;s deeds, good and not-so-good. BECAUSE HE&#39;S THE PRESIDENT! Bring Hillary back into the spotlight whenever Trump looks bad seems like you&#39;re (you and him) are hiding something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am sure there are millions of things going on behind close doors, deals made here and there amongst middle management. And trump expects certain things.. so maybe he’s firing them all. </p>

<p>Or maybe they are all corrupt and just keep dropping like flies. I don’t see without insider information how we can even draw an opinion on what is going on inside the White House. The president doesn’t manage anything lol.. you think he has time to manage who works for him, if anything he is managing them by firing them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The president, in theory, has way too many responsibilities to not take recruitment seriously, I&#39;m not sure how you don&#39;t see that. But even if he just managed his cabinet and high-level White House employees properly he wouldn&#39;t be missing a chief strategist, chief of staff, National Security Advisor, HHS secretary, a few comms directors and spokespeople, the wife beater guy (allegedly) and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting some. </p>
