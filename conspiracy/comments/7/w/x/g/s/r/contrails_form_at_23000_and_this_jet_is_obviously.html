<p>Using the speed of sound as a reference (around 1,125 ft/s) and just visually it seems to be at most under 12k&#39;</p>

<p>And the fact it stops after the jet passes the mists and then spreads out is an obvious issue too.</p>

<p>In my area these mists are always in front of the sun, so perhaps it&#39;s some sort of research for the climate change agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contrails form at lower altitudes on the presence of colder air since they are a product of temperature differential between engine exhaust and the outside air. Think of this: If it&#39;s 60 degrees at sea level, at 16000 feet it will be approximately 0 degrees. However if it is 0 degrees at sea level, it will be approximately -52 degrees at 16000 feet (3.3 degrees per 1000 feet, slightly less than normal due to the already cold air temperature). This means that contrails CAN and WILL form at lower altitudes than at standard temperature/pressure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Several things wrong with your statement. First of all I am an aircraft mechanic, and I can tell you with 100% certainty that there are no &quot;pumps&quot; for the &quot;chemtrails&quot; that you speak of. I have been in the wings of many planes, and I can assure you the only tanks out there are fuel. There&#39;s barely enough room for wiring out there, let alone added tanks for chemtrails. Second, the reason that the contrails &quot;turn off&quot; in the cloud is that clouds are  slightly warmer and less dense than the surrounding air due to the presence of water. As I explained in my other comment on this thread, the formation of contrails is dependent on temperature differential. If the air is warmer than the contrail formation threshold even slightly (such as in a cloud), they won&#39;t form.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is entirely dependent on wind speed. It it&#39;s not very windy up there, the trails stay for a long time because they aren&#39;t moving around. However if it&#39;s windy, contrails aren&#39;t dense like clouds so they dissipate quickly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through sublimation, but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called deposition and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation, or merge with others into an unbroken layer of haze. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sure about that? We have technology well beyond what we are told.</p>

<p>In any case, that is one theory. Here is another:</p>

<p>&quot;At first glance, it appears to be  a good idea, but were you aware  that any  chemtrails  debunker will not hesitate to suggest  for us to track a  plane with a flight tracker service? That got me thinking. Most likely it  s because Flight tracker is not a 100% reliable source for tracking all planes. You see, FLIGHT TRACKER depends on aviation reports, and if the , let’s say pilot of a chemtrail plane wishes to remain invisible on a tracker, they simply do not report the flight.</p>

<p>In addition to ADS-B data, we also get data from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States. This data is based on radar data and includes all commercial air traffic in US and Canadian air space (i.e. not just planes with ADS-B transponders). Unlike the ADS-B data that is presented real-time, the FAA data is delayed by roughly 5 minutes due to FAA regulations. On the Flightradar24 map, all planes based on FAA data are orange.</p>

<p>Pay special attention to the following statement:</p>

<p>Common aircraft models that do not have an ADS-B transponder and are NOT visible on Flightradar24 :
(<em>show list of planes</em>)</p>

<p>There are also some older A300, A310, A320, B737, B747, B757, B767 aircraft flying without and ADS-B transponder, which make those aircraft invisible on Flightradar24.</p>

<p>Flightradar24 relies on volunteers around the world for the majority of our coverage. Find out how you can contribute.”</p>

“Why can’t I see every plane?
By way of explanation we pick up ADS-B data transmitted by aircraft and received by ground base stations. Aircraft must be equipped with suitable transmission equipment for them to be detected by our receivers. Currently not all aircraft are equipped – Europe is currently well ahead of the US. Across the world countries are making ADS-B mandatory for most aircraft over the coming years so this will get better and better too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not necessarily.</p>

<p>&quot;Materials That Make Planes Vanish</p>

<p>Atoms and molecules that vibrate at the frequency of the incoming waves tend to absorb what&#39;s coming at them instead of reflecting it back out.</p>

<p>Carbon and iron tend to absorb radio waves well, especially when wadded up into little balls of carbonyl iron. These tiny particles, suspended in resin or plastic, were spread across the surfaces of crafts since World War II, but they only took care of some of the incoming radar.</p>

<p>Across many reconnaissance craft are layered materials that form a honeycomb structure. These layers of honeycomb get every denser as they move inwards from the surface. These structures are designed to reflect radar in a particular way. Radar waves, like water waves, have peaks and valleys. Like water waves, if a peak meets a valley, they cancel out, leaving smooth water.</p>

<p>The honeycomb layers reflect radar waves back out into the atmosphere, but do so out of sync with the way that they came in, so that a peak of an outgoing wave meets the valley of an incoming wave. The two cancel out, effectively erasing the incoming radar. A combination of absorption and precise reflection can be used to eliminate as much radar as possible.</p>

<p>In the modern flying wings, another detail is obscured. Engines outside the plane leave exhaust trails that glow visible in infrared. Making the entire plane an aerodynamic wing gives the engines a break when it comes to overheating. Burying the engines deep inside the plane muffles them slightly. And as the exhaust leaves the engines, it&#39;s passed through multiple cooling systems and filters, obscuring its heat signature further.</p>

<p>What&#39;s Next for Stealth Aircraft?</p>

<p>The next generation of spy planes seem pretty improbable, but spy planes have always been defying expectations. One option is erasing incoming radar. Instead of passively canceling radar out, future plane may be able to detect it and send out a canceling, opposing pulse of radar.</p>

<p>Another possibility is ionization. Radar doesn&#39;t move through ionized gas the way it moves through regular air. Ionization occurs when enough heat or electric potential runs through the air to separate electrons from their atoms. It happens often during lightning storms, which aren&#39;t optimal flying conditions. Simulating these storm conditions could allow future aircraft to further thwart radar.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Methods</p>

<p>Various techniques have been proposed for delivering the aerosol precursor gases (H2S and SO
2).[2] The required altitude to enter the stratosphere is the height of the tropopause, which varies from 11 kilometres (6.8 mi/36,000 ft) at the poles to 17 kilometres (11 mi/58,000 ft) at the equator.</p>

<p>Airliners could use lower-quality sulfur-rich fuels on higher altitudes. That approach would utilize regular flights and enable airlines to use cheaper fuels on long-distance flights. It would require using separate fuel tanks for takeoff and landing in populated areas, due to toxicity and olfactory sensations of sulfur oxides. <strong>This can be achieved in many airliners without difficulty, since they already have separate and selectable wing and fuselage fuel tanks.</strong>
Civilian aircraft including the Boeing 747-400 and Gulfstream G550/650, C-37A could be modified at relatively low cost to deliver sufficient amounts of required material.[34]
Military aircraft such as the F15-C variant of the F-15 Eagle have the necessary flight ceiling, but limited payload. Military tanker aircraft such as the KC-135 Stratotanker and KC-10 Extender also have the necessary ceiling and have greater payload capacity.[4]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Contrails form at lower altitudes on the presence of colder air since they are a product of temperature differential between engine exhaust and the outside air. Think of this: If it&#39;s 60 degrees at sea level, at 16000 feet it will be approximately 0 degrees. However if it is 0 degrees at sea level, it will be approximately -52 degrees at 16000 feet (3.3 degrees per 1000 feet, slightly less than normal due to the already cold air temperature). This means that contrails CAN and WILL form at lower altitudes than at standard temperature/pressure.</p>

<p>Now maybe you could explain why these contrails spread out and become thin cloud cover within an hour or so of being laid down in tight geometric patterns by planes that apparently have no where else to go than a half-state wide weather front...?</p>

<p>Okay. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">sublimation</a>, but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">deposition</a> and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation, or merge with others into an unbroken layer of haze. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It&#39;s not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.</p>

<p>No, we are not talking about ordinary contrail science, however prepared you are to talk about it. Chemtrail-equipped planes inject nuclei into the sky which are necessary to form specific types of cirrus-like clouds. Meteorologists have had to create new nomenclature for these clouds. They tend to spread out, merge, and cover large areas after the planes operate. They tend to create halo effects, and block sunlight. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Yes, but it remains a single linear phenomenon and then slowly or quickly disappears. That&#39;s not what the issue is. We&#39;ve all seen normal contrails for many decades - you can see them in WWII era films. What is new (since the 1990&#39;s) is chemtrails and their deliberate operations to block solar irradience.</p>

<p>Outside of the hysterical fear porn sites like geoengineerinwatch and naturalnews, you won&#39;t find anything to back up that claim. Anyway, the persistent contrails are coming off scheduled airliners...check Flightradar24 and you&#39;ll see.</p>

<p>... the huge rise in air travel since then. It&#39;s rising at 10 percent year on year. More planes equals more contrails, and more contrails means a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVD9IUO9Ftk">permanent haze</a> of artificial cirrus.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, it&#39;s possible in Alaska to get persistent contrails right down to the ground, and aerodynamic contrails are very common in England in winter, coming off the entire wing during landing. Most sources agree that for most of us looking up at contrails, they start at 26,000 feet.</p>

<p>Oh bullshit. For a start, the speed of sound is different at different altitudes. Before you could even estimate how long the sound should take to reach you, you would have to know the altitude of the aircraft.</p>

<p>For that reason, you simply can not use the speed of sound to estimate the aircraft&#39;s altitude.</p>

<p>Secondly... what sound are you using to estimate the distance? The constant sound of the jet engines? How can you tell when to start counting the seconds?</p>

<p>Your comment is simply full of ignorant bullshit.</p>
