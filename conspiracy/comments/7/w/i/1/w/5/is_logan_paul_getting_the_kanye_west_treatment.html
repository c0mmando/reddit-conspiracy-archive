       Is Logan Paul getting the Kanye treatment after he half-joked about becoming President?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since making that joke :
      </p>
      <p>
       -He found a suicide victim (no other youtuber has done this). Logan says "it doesn't make sense" and "happened for a reason". The CIA has technology to induce suicide, see comments by Naval intelligence EMR weapons expert Barrie Trower.
      </p>
      <p>
       -His fish were poisoned with chlorine. He said to the cameraman "they were poisoned" though the cameraman believed it was an accident rather than sabotage.
      </p>
      <p>
       -His parachute failed to open. This has only happened in like 1 of 10,000 jumps.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Home invasion
      </p>
      <p>
       -Complete loss of youtube revenue over tasering a dead rat (seriously?)
      </p>
      <p>
       All these events are designed to cause stress, promote paranoia, leading to a mental breakdown. When that happens, the star is hospitalised and given brainwashing treatment such as electroshock (see Britney Spears, Kanye West etc). This ECT has been shown to create new personalities:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Is all this caused by Logan wanting to be President and not being part of the Skull and Bones club? What do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how none of this has happened to Jake who has not expressed interest in becoming President.

       The only close case is Pewdiepie who started talking about Jews.

       Are you sure the complete loss of youtube revenue was over a dead rat?  Really?  Also while the 1/10,000 failed parachute statistic is telling, what does it really tell?  Did you look this up?  While the source I used may not be 100% accurate it is closer to 1/1,000.  More important, given the normally rare occurence of parachute failure could there be another explanation, such as attention seeking and possibly someone, given all of the other events, is staging?

      <p>
       I dont want to piss on your post, you seem to engage in interesting dialogue, your Paul McCartney post was a brief but outstanding respite from a state of constant Space X nonsense, but I think I see this from a completely different perspective.  I see someone who monetized youtube, fucked up, and may be making desperate attempts at regaining credibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love your posts regardless but on this one I just don't see it, but I hope you keep posting because your stuff is thought provoking.

       I want to argue with this entire premise based on this bit:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        He found a suicide victim (no other youtuber has done this). Logan says "it doesn't make sense" and "happened for a reason". The CIA has technology to induce suicide, see comments by Naval intelligence EMR weapons expert Barrie Trower.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, he went to a place where suicides often take place in Japan and made jokes while showing a dead body. That caused the loss of his revenue and fanbase, not the rest of the shit. He was and is a meaningless moron that made one really bad decision and lost whatever cultural capital he had, like a dozen youtubers before him.

       Sadly, his fanbase actually increased as a result of that stunt. His fanbase consists almost entirely of prepubescent boys, so it's not particularly surprising.

       Maybe, but YouTube and his other corporate sponsors backed out, which is what destroys a vlogger. I'm not now, but have taught a digital rhetoric course in the past, so I follow this sort of thing for future semesters.

       He went to a haunted forest. The chance of actually finding a dead body are extremely low, that's why when someone goes missing they form such huge search parties with dogs.

       They're real staff. People who don't understand comedy think Karl Pilkington is some kind of genius pretending to be stupid. No, he's that dumb. Just like Jordan Schlansky genuinely has aspergers.

       He went to a haunted forest to make jokes about sleeping in a haunted forest, found a suicide victim by pure chance, made some nervous jokes about wearing an inappropriate hat, then uploaded it just like if you found a beached whale or something and you vlog your life for a living you'd upload that too.

       Seriously how many dead people have you seen on the news? I've bet you've seen hundreds actually being killed. You're only faking outrage because I assume you're highly suggestible and the media told you, or you were bullied by someone who looks like Logan Paul or something.

       Aokigahara is literally called ‘the suicide forest’, it wasn’t fucking invented by Logan Paul. Volunteers/police search it every year for bodies and they find bodies every time. If you hadn’t heard of it before that’s your own ignorance.
And yes I’ve seen video clips of people dead on the news. This is
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       the same as making a video of a dead body myself, for t3h lelz.

       clutch (one's)/the pearls
To react in a scandalized or mortified manner to once-salacious but now relatively common things, events, situations, etc. Parents should try not to clutch the pearls every time their teenagers come out of their room dressed outrageously—it only makes them want to push the envelope even further. My mother would always clutch her pearls whenever I began telling her about a new boyfriend, so eventually I stopped filling her in altogether.

       Conan Obrien has producers, who know the game.  The script always goes across the admen's desks for approval.  Paul Logan, who is a boob BTW ..just saying, is a loose canon.  Today he makes an ass of himself in Japan, tomorrow it might be in a McDonald's. The admen can't have that, and so google gets a nasty phone call. This is how television was back when it was radio, and this is how it will be now that it's Youtube.. Welcome to the Machine.

       How is that an immaculate characterization of what happened? I watched the video, and what I saw was an American trying to be as rude and disrespectful as he could while in the city, only to finish it out with the suicide forest bit.

       This is an interesting post. But you have to realize. Logan Paul is a fucking idiot. He is no threat at all to any establishment. The only threat he poses is to the brains of the prepubescent boys who watch his channel. Eventually they'll grow up and realize he's a despicable idiot. He intentionally went to the SUICIDE forest. He knew what he was doing. And he uploaded it, knowing his fans are children. Then he tasered a dead rat like a sadist.

       Before the scandal, a finance magazine said he'd be the first billionaire influencer. Note the word influencer ie. controls the opinions of the peasants.

       He's definately a threat just like kanye.

       He went to a haunted forest which is also known for suicides. Many other youtubers have also done this.

       I really doubt his influence on kids politically means much to anyone.

       He literally searched the suicide forest for a suicide victim. Not many youtubers have done this, and not many have decided it would be a good idea to show this to their 10 year old fans.

       Because none of them found a body. Seriously the chances of doing so are close to nil. That's why when someone goes missing in a forest they form huge search parties with dogs.

       Well it's the right word if you want to vilify someone you resent because he's successful but at the same time want people to think you're being objective.

       Palestine-Israel relations is a very complex issue. You don’t understand it deeper than “The Jews are killing people”, but I’m not going to correct you because I can’t grasp the issue either. I’d rather not spew out half-baked, unsupported claims regarding a topic that I am not confidently informed of.

       If you believe that a violent minority represents an entire population, then I suggest you pursue modern journalism. And you would be sorely mistaken to overlook Palestine’s flaws in order to shift more blame to Israel. Nobody’s perfect but not everyone uses children as suicide bombers and we have the obligation to criticize them and bring them to justice.

       It seems like they’re only supporting ISIS because they have no defense against Iran. I’m not supporting their decisions, but this seems far more like a tactical choice than a sympathetic one. The longer they keep Iran distracted, the longer they have to secure their borders. There isn’t an easy solution.

       911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?

      <p>
       A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:

      </p>
      <p>
       Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:
      </p>

       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">

      </p>
      <p>
       This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:

       Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:

       The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:

       Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:

       Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the "art students":

       Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, "it's good for Israel".

Debris on the upper floors caused them to fall through, creating a domino effect. This is also why they fell straight down.)

       Unbelievable. Want to know my proof? My Boy Scout troop did a trip to New York and met the men of engine 54, ladder 4, battalion 9. They were one of the first responders. They watched the planes hit the tower, they watched their family die when they fell down. My proof is the testaments of the heroes. I’m done explaining the obvious.

        <strong>
         the deception of the Commission by various key government agencies, including the Department of Defense, NORAD and the FAA; and, the denial of access by various agencies to documents and witnesses. "So there were all kinds of reasons we thought we were set up to fail."[8]

       Cognitive dissonance means to be mentally uncomfortable due to holding contradicting beliefs. I don’t think that’s what I’m experiencing right now. I think that I feel frustrated because neither of us are being reasonable in this argument. You’re unreasonable because you feel that it’s impossible for the events of 9/11 to have unfolded in the way that they did. You feel that you’ve gathered enough articles and sources to piece together a rough idea of a possible scenario that doesn’t make much sense to me. I’m unreasonable because I’ve talked to witnesses and seen physical evidence, which you always write off as being fake. Any evidence I bring up you immediately write off as fake because “I’m wrong and you’re right” according to you. My video of people talking about the attack didn’t show a plane, but your video of someone describing it as a missile didn’t show one either. It’s an impass. Listen, I told you I’m done. This is going nowhere. I like to keep an open mind about issues, but there is no discussion on 9/11.

      <p>
       What physical evidence did you see? Did you see a Boeing engine at Ground Zero on 911?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's important to make sure you understand what your evidence proves.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, a video of an explosion and some women saying it was a plane proves there was an explosion and some women thought it could be due to a plane. It doesn't prove there was a plane or that the women saw a plane.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you watch forensic shows like CSI Miami? Try to approach 911 from that frame of reference and you will find it less frustrating and more interesting.

      <p>
       Well I have a video of someone describing it as a bomb and a raw video which shows a missile or spherical drone. But I agree there is an impasse. That's why you need to look at multiple classes of evidence, not just footage and witness testimony. The CIA analysis technique is explained in this book:

       So you like to be open minded about issues EXCEPT 911 and I guess the holocaust. Doesn't that tell you something about these events? For example, you've been psyoped?

       And then there's witness testimony from journalist Chris Hedges:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Yesterday at this spot the Israelis shot eight young men, six of whom were under the age of eighteen. One was twelve. This afternoon they kill an eleven-year-old boy, Ali Murad, and seriously wound four more, three of whom are under eighteen. Children have been shot in other conflicts I have covered—death squads gunned them down in El Salvador and Guatemala, mothers with infants were lined up and massacred in Algeria, and Serb snipers put children in their sights and watched them crumple onto the pavement in Sarajevo—but I have never before watched soldiers entice children like mice into a trap and murder them for sport.”

      <p>
       General acceptance of killing Palestinian children pervades Israeli politics:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Israelis proudly tweet their desire to murder children: “Kill Arab children so there won’t be a next generation,” “Stinking Arabs may you die, amen,” and “Arabs may you be paralyzed and die with great suffering” are some representative tweets exposed by Israeli journalist David Sheen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Israeli parliamentarian Ayelet Shaked has announced that she wants to kill not only Palestinian children, whom she calls “little snakes,” but also the Palestinian mothers who raise them.

        An October 2004 study by British Medical Journal confirmed that this is a common practice, and never punished: “Two thirds of the 621 children (two thirds under 15 years) killed at checkpoints, in the street, on the way to school, in their homes, died from small arms fire, directed in over half of cases to the head, neck and chest – the sniper’s wound…Clearly, soldiers are routinely authorised to shoot to kill children in situations of minimal or no threat.”

       No I'm saying the CIA used EMR mind control weapons (like those used on Cuban embassy) to mind control a Japanese man to commit suicide in a place easily accessible to Logan Paul, and they also used EMR mind control weapons on Logan Paul so he would find the body.

       If they could, why would they do this to somebody so insignificant and so laughable as Logan Paul? What threat does he pose? 
Why must EVERYTHING be a conspiracy? Is that that out of the realm of reality that some people are just classic idiots?

       Is Logan Paul a bully? Considering I’m not a dead animal, the answer is no. My beef isn’t with Logan Paul... he’s insignificant. My beef is with this mentality that you possess. That everything is a conspiracy, even when it isn’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s like antibiotics... doctors prescribe so many of them that when you really need it, they don’t help. You, especially, just sit around all day and try to think of conspiracies stories. You craft them. It’s fiction. Nothing happens organically. You don’t sit there and try to connect the dots. You move the dots around to fit your bullshit.

       Dude, the evidence  is right in things you posted. You claim that goverment mind controlled Japanese man so he can kill himself all in order to frame Logan guy. You are an epitome of conspiracy nut. You need help

       is right...even if you believe in deep state mind controlling devices and what not...ask your self why is Logan significant so that all this machinery is worth using?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am from Australia, I am internet savvy and would consider myself very informed when it comes to internet celeberties , etc. Saying that I had no idea who Logan was until the incident.

       Do you realise that people who Logan has any influence over is insignificant in both numbers and demographics.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact I would argue that Logan only gained in popularity and prominence with the incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       So ask yourself...why would goverment do that?

       He's well connected node in society. Of course all the major celebrities, musicians and youtubers are on the mind control program. You can even see Logan Paul being programmed in a sensory deprivation tank in his vlog today, just like musician Leonard Cohen.

        Unlike others, Cohen is said to have enjoyed the sensory deprivation experience and participated frequently and that's what he's seen here doing.
Removing stimulation can have "serious effects on the physiology of the brain," as Hebb conceded in an interview 20 years later.

       No evidence huh? Explain the tons of evidence I found to support that Jews did 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?

       A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">

      </p>
      <p>
       This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what wasn't CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their "art" - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!
      </p>
      <p>
       Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.
      </p>
      <p>
       They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That's why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn't sliced in half at all:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">

      </p>
      <p>
       WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.
      </p>
      <p>

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">
        /r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they're told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it's a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:
      </p>
      <p>
       Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the "art students":
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, "it's good for Israel".

       If you cared to check my post history at all, you’d notice I’m from NYC.
      </p>
      <p>
       My mother works/worked downtown blocks away from the WTC. She was heading to work when this happened. I also lost a cousin who worked inside WTC. Anyway, as my mother was trying to get to work and incidentally got stuck standing on the street staring at the tower that had just gotten hit, she witnessed the second plane hit the tower. With her own eyes.

       So do me a favor, take your bullshit videos elsewhere. This is your problem - you’re lazy. You’re lazy to do any actual research. You’re lazy to find any actual truth. You leech onto moronic shit that benefits your narrative and then further it by creating more false content. You take the word of a small sample size (sometimes, literally one person) as gospel, but don’t acknowledge how unlikely it would be for millions of people to keep these secrets you claim they’re keeping. You are confirmation bias in its truest form. And then...
      </p>
      <p>
       When you run out of ammo on one conspiracy (Logan Paul), you fall back on good old 9/11? Why? Were your subreddit buddies ganging up on you and calling you out on your stupid as well so you needed to fall back to 9/11 to rein them in? Go to sleep, dude. Your brain is fried.

       So hey dude, honest question here... If the CIA has these EMR devices that they can use to control people's minds, why go to the trouble of using them to get a Japanese guy to kill himself, while also using them to get Logan to go to Japan and find the body?  Wouldn't it be way simpler to just get Logan to think "Actually running for President is a stupid idea, I'll never do that."?

       Great question. A possible answer is that even if they mind controlled him to believe that was a stupid idea, people around him who could sense an opportunity if he ran for President would be persuading him otherwise. Another possible answer is that you can control people to do things, influence their behavior, but changing their goals might be more difficult. From microwave weapon expert Barrie Trower:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I don’t like the word ‘mind control’ because you don’t really control the mind. You can change it to act in a different behavior, but you do not permanently control it. You can make people do things, and that’s very easy. I could do it. I could do it to you in less than three days. I don’t like the word ‘mind control’ because you don’t really control the mind.

       Ok yeah, I can see that.  Still though, this plot seems needlessly complex; oftentimes the best solutions are the simplest ones.  Involving multiple people and international travel seems like it introduces a lot of variables and a lot of ways in which things could go wrong.  Why not just have Logan kill himself?  Or if they wanted to disable him but not kill him, have him, fuck I don't know, get caught soliciting underage sex from one of their honeypots.

       I mean they take advantage of situations. They knew Logan Paul was going to the suicide forest. All they had to do was push a suicidal man to kill himself in a spot they could later direct Logan Paul to find.

       Honest question, how many Youtubers have had a fan murder suicide them? Or attempt to do so? I can find at least two cases.

       If you can project voices into the head then yes the instructions you give the target count as mind control.

       They used it on Iraqi soldiers during the first gulf war.

       Why do you believe the article stating that they can project voices into the head of even deaf people is somehow not about mind control?

        The Army's very strange webpage on "Voice-to-Skull" weapons has been removed. It was strange it was there, and it's even stranger it's gone. If you Google it, you'll see the entry for "Voice-to-Skull device," but, if you click on the website, the link is dead.
       </p>
       <p>
        The entry, still available on the Federation of American Scientists' website reads:
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonlethal weapon which includes (1) a neuro-electromagnetic device which uses microwave transmission of sound into the skull of persons or animals by way of pulse-modulated microwave radiation; and (2) a silent sound device which can transmit sound into the skull of person or animals. NOTE: The sound modulation may be voice or audio subliminal messages. One application of V2K is use as an electronic scarecrow to frighten birds in the vicinity of airports.

       It's clear that you are set in your beliefs and nothing will change that.  This was not an attempt to demonstrate authority, I'm just trying to help, even if it's misguided.  What you are suggesting is not only very extreme but also doesn't make sense even under the assumption that the technology exists.  Additionally, wired.com is not a reliable source.

       They have to test these weapons on someone ... clearly you don't understand psychological warfare.
      </p>
      <p>
       You do know they torture young mothers to the point they kill their own children? Why do you think that is. Think about it a little. How do you demonstrate the efficacy of a torture system? By overriding the strongest biological urge, to protect ones young? How do you ensure that your soldiers will undertake any mission successfully without interference from their conscience?

       I bet you looked at the pictures of Abu Ghraib and thought it's "not only very extreme but also doesn't make sense" but yet it happened.

       You really think the deep state is fucking with a random YouTuber now to sabotage his potential run in 13 years when the constitution would actually allow it?

       Directing what?

      <p>
       I mean if you don't have evidence to support your claim it comes from prejudice and stereotypes.

       Like seriously how would you know? Only the CIA follows people around and knows what they get up to. So this is just your hallucination based on stereotypes/prejudice.

       Then why did they call it a plane. And honestly, if you don’t think it was a plane, I don’t think you’ve ever talked to anybody who lives in New York. I said this would happen you know, you would refuse to believe me.
