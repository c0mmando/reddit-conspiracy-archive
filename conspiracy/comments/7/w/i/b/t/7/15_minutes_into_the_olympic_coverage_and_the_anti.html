    <div class="md"><p>Would just say there are two types of anti-North Korea propaganda possible:</p>

<p>(1) Anti-North Korea propaganda that wants to lead us into a &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; war that benefits the elites.</p>

<p>(2) Anti-North Korea propaganda that wants to highlight the fucked up nature of a North Korea type regime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nice dream.</p>

<p>When it comes to North Korea, and the American take on it, it&#39;s all propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure.</p>

<p>But one lie leads to us all dying in a nuclear war, except for the elite.</p>

<p>The other lie leads to Americans questioning how much we&#39;re like North Korea, ourselves.</p>

<p>Sure, the truth is great. But how are you posting here and thinking that truth guides public debate?</p>

<p>North Korea is awful. AWFUL. It&#39;s a prison-country. The USA shares too many of those traits for us to be comfortable. Prison labor. State media. Etc. </p>

<p>So what? What should you say about North Korea? How do you handle that framework, to better their lives and your own?</p>

<p>Well, first off, I&#39;d say, you don&#39;t embrace some idiocy that gets us all nuked.</p>

<p>If it is a lie it is a lie. Why call what Nkorea is a piece of propaganda if it is the truth?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sure, the truth is great. But how are you posting here and thinking that truth guides public debate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m saying the search for Truth <em>should</em> guide the debate, not that it does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>North Korea is awful. AWFUL. It&#39;s a prison-country. The USA shares too many of those traits for us to be comfortable. Prison labor. State media. Etc.</p>

<p>Then why do you call it propaganda? if it is Truth it is Truth. Let the reality speak for itself and don&#39;t defend the Propaganda of either side. </p>

<p>In reality the propaganda of both leads to the same end- Nkorea is a shit hole, says the one side, so we must invade, says the other. All lead to war, in the end.</p>

<p>Well that isn&#39;t true.</p>

<p>If they&#39;re a threat, war is an option. They really aren&#39;t, though.</p>

<p>So they&#39;re just an omen of what we might become, but that doesn&#39;t mean we go to war against them.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t see how the propaganda, which you yourself claim both sides are, are working together, then that is your loss.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It isn&#39;t just about threats. Getting the American people to join a war against a country that may or may not be a threat is greatly helped by the idea that it is a war of liberation for its people...like Iraq.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re not listening to anything I&#39;m saying. That&#39;s frustrating.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve listened to everything you&#39;ve said. I have pointed out issues with what you have said. The last thing you can claim is that I am ignoring what you have said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone ever stop and think that ironically the only reason NK still exists after all these years is because of America&#39;s occupation of the south. If we weren&#39;t in SK or Japan they either would have collapsed already or some unique equilibrium between the Asian pacific nations like Japan/China/Korea/Russia would have de escalated the situation. Instead we&#39;ve been frozen in this endless stalemate for over 50 years.</p>
