       SS: Seems like this is gonna be one of the main agenda points of this Olympics (also to down play the North and South team unity).  Disappointing that absolutely everything has to be politicized and that people still fall for it. :/

       Would just say there are two types of anti-North Korea propaganda possible:
      </p>
      <p>
       (1) Anti-North Korea propaganda that wants to lead us into a "Dr. Strangelove" war that benefits the elites.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Anti-North Korea propaganda that wants to highlight the fucked up nature of a North Korea type regime.
      </p>
      <p>
       One is not the same as the other.

       When it comes to North Korea, and the American take on it, it's all propaganda.

       Yet you seem to draw a line between them...propaganda is propaganda. There is no difference, there is no "benevolence" in propaganda. A lie is a lie, the Truth is the Truth.

       Sure.

      <p>
       But one lie leads to us all dying in a nuclear war, except for the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other lie leads to Americans questioning how much we're like North Korea, ourselves.

       Sure, the truth is great. But how are you posting here and thinking that truth guides public debate?

       North Korea is awful. AWFUL. It's a prison-country. The USA shares too many of those traits for us to be comfortable. Prison labor. State media. Etc.

      <p>
       It isn't just about threats. Getting the American people to join a war against a country that may or may not be a threat is greatly helped by the idea that it is a war of liberation for its people...like Iraq.

       So do you think propaganda against the Germans in ww2 was justified? You realize that N. Korea citizens are in modern day labor camps similar to conditions that were experienced at extermination camps in WW2? You really think it needs to be sugarcoated because it's the Olympics and yippy yay the 2 Koreas are marching together? No, it's a brutal regime who is systematically starving and killing off innocent people. They should be portrayed in a negative light.

       Yes, by the Koreans and their opening ceremony.  They even had a huge dove and sang Imagine by John Lennon.  Quite the dichotomy from the war mongering we get on the news.  Will be interesting to watch.

       Anyone ever stop and think that ironically the only reason NK still exists after all these years is because of America's occupation of the south. If we weren't in SK or Japan they either would have collapsed already or some unique equilibrium between the Asian pacific nations like Japan/China/Korea/Russia would have de escalated the situation. Instead we've been frozen in this endless stalemate for over 50 years.

       The war machine obviously needs some kind of ever present and obvious threat to its "allies" in order to justify having so much military hardware parked in front of China's capitol.
