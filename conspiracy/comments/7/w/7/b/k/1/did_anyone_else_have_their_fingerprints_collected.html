       It just occurred to me that when I was in jiu-jitsu as a kid (about 7 or 8 years old), our instructor had the great idea to round all of us up and collect our fingerprints. He was also an RCMP officer, so of course I trusted him and figured that it was just a part of growing up, but now I can’t help but believe that he straight up abused his position of authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now from what I’ve been able to gather the police cannot do this without parental consent, however, the fact that he targeted a group of people who already looked up to him doesn’t sit well with me. Furthermore, what would even compel the RCMP to gather our fingerprints other than the assumption that we may one day become persons of interest?

       The Masons do this where I live. According to them the fingerprints go into a database for missing and exploited children.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is, if your kid goes missing they have their fingerprints? Which doesn't seem helpful at all when locating a missing kid.

       I've always thought it was strange.

       it is helpful so they can check their fingerprint if this kid in their basement is already searched for.

       <li>
        if a man was seen with a kid matching how the parents describe it, they can check his car for fingerprints of the kid and see if it fits.

       I recollect my early public education like it was a dystopian novel.  In first grade I was the fastest runner in the entire school that went up to third grade and I was on average 9 month younger than the average kid.  I think that this says as much of my natural endowment as it does the sorry state of health of the kids going back even three decades ago.  I had too much energy so they drugged me with Ritalin.  They said it made me better.  I remember everyone being taught shit like "Christopher Colombus sailed the ocean blue" and seeing the robot children repeat it back like it meant something.  Even as a fucked up little kid I knew that something was deeply wrong and that I was surrounded by idiots and being taught idiot things.  It couldn't have been that they were all fucking idiots being taught idiot crap and were slow lethargic Pac' N' Meal eating low trajectory middling people but rather that I needed another dose of the drugs to see the awesomeness of that first grade wisdom.  Holy fuck what a waste of life.  Fortunately they didn't drug me for long and I figured out a few ways to skip out on it.  Thirty fucking years ago in the first grade I was hacking the system to get out of being forcibly assigned amphetamine drugs so that I could sit there like a potato.  As far as something like fingerprints.  You have to bet your fucking ass they served us up.  We were sold out and some more than others.

       I had the same experience in elementary school. I learned real quick that intelligence was punished in school. Lesson #1 never say anything too smart or you will get in trouble. Shut up and play dumb, answer questions wrong on purpose. They took our finger prints on the first day of school from I remember. This is in the early 80s.

       Fortunately I wasn't in that kind of more ghetto culture so I didn't have to pretend to be dumb.  I often just failed to find the meaning in most of the retarded lessons.  This then pushed me away from valuable skills like learning multiplication.  I knew that "Colombus sailed the ocean blue" was pointless so probably my times tables were as well.  It didn't trust them.  However, the bar on achievement is set so low that I could just pick it up the next year.  That is really just a lot of wasted time.  There is an early Star Trek TNG episode where a 11-12 year old kid is complaining about learning calculus.  That is easily achievable.  Instead we get fluoride toothpaste, Ritalin, gender confusion and baby sitting.

       I wish their was a way to perfectly ascribe this accurate feeling to others (intuition maybe).  I was one of those kids who lived in the principle's office for various reasons, usually accused of being "disruptive" (questioned teachers).

       Shit like that triggered me cause I would become exasperated with shit curriculum, getting me to memorize the dates of when Napoleon lived &amp; died rather than expounding on the principles that guided him as a conquer &amp; leader or what it means to wield Power - nope, my man over was stranded on Elba, that's all you need to know.

       The police used to do this here, in truth it was to be able to identify a body if recovered because dental records for kids may be spotty, non existent, or if the child's teeth were baby teeth at the time they went missing (think kidnap cases) they could match prints, now there is DNA so it's not as common to get the prints.   They fingerprint all lawyers in my State and I hardly believe it's in case I go missing...

       They require lawyers to be printed as they use it to run a background check. It's easy to change your name to hide a crime, but your prints will bring it up when run through the FBI database.

In our state we collected DNA, fingerprints, a dental imprint, a few Polaroids, and coached the kids on what to do if they were abducted (things like spit everywhere for evidence). Not all Lodges in our state do this, but ones that do usually do it in conjunction with a town event like fire house open house, town fair, etc. I think the average is about 200 kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's worth noting that the identification kits were given directly to the parents for safe keeping, to be given to the police if something happened. No database or registry, at least in our state.

       I remember doing going to some local police community event when I was little and they would have you fingerprint. I think it pushed off as "it's for in case you're missing!", but now that I think about it, who knows why they wanted them.

       Or you didn't kill someone and someone nefarious hacks the database and uses it to reproduce your fingerprint via a 3-D printed finger, or just the tip. Then uses it to apply finger prints on a murder weapon and viola, they've got a fall guy.

       You know whats fucked up is they predict future prison populations based on report cards of elementary school students. So they probably just do this in areas of high crime rates and pat themselves on the back for future crimes solved.

       They did this at my school growing up. One of the lowest crime areas of the state. They said it was for if we got lost or kidnapped. My parents did it. It’s not an issue for me bc I voluntarily gave up mine on two separate occasions

       I used to volunteer for a science outreach organization where we did fun science activities with kids. We did a forensics demonstration where the kids would stamp their fingerprints onto balloons and then blow them up and analyze the different structures, compare and see how they're all unique, etc. But it was emphasized that the kids either kept their balloons or we discarded them. If it involved collecting and storing kids' fingerprints in some giant database, I'd never have participated in that.

       That was his first name. I always called him Fred McGruff, hence why I didn't use a first name in my post, lol.

       Not from Chicago, or even close. McGruff was nationwide I guess.

       As a kid, I thought Scruff McGruff must have been very important since you didn't need to put a street in the address.  As if everyone in Chicago (a huuuuge city in my mind back then) knew who he was and he'd have no problem getting his mail.

       They do fingerprint background checks on all employers, I am guessing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your fingerprints identify all relevant information in your life: birth, name, addresses, employment and arrests. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) fingerprint database will include your "rap sheet" consisting of any criminal arrest dates, charges and the disposition of cases.

       Once you have been fingerprinted you do not need to do it again. So maybe other jobs required it but saw that you already did it so they did not say anything. I imagine the Orlando parks have strict security procedures for hiring since it's popular with children

       You still need to be printed again for new jobs that require it. Having your prints run is how they check your background and look for previously committed crimes.

       I vaguely remember a big push, like that ugly DARE program, where police departments were running programs at the county fairs and other public gatherings.

       Bring in your kids to get fingerprinted, for identification, if they are ever kidnapped.

       DARE was creepy and frightening and Nazi like since it directed children to turn in their parents.

       Yup, Canadian here. This was common practise in the 80's and stopped in the mid 90's in the province I live. It was setup under the pretence that it was a meet the police day. It was for K to grade 1. Always wondered why they did it and why they do not anymore

       Could this have just been due to the Adam Walsh case?  The son of John Walsh who disappeared and inspired him to do Americas Most Wanted?  Also around this time day-care centers were being accused of Witchcraft.  I think people were just profiting off the missing child mania.

       I was in first grade in 2001.  They didn't come to our school to collect them, but during an ice cream social type event the local pd used to host during the summer, they had a booth for the "missing child I.D. Cards", which had things like blood type and a picture of your fingerprint.  Our babysitter's kids got them the day before, and i thought they were sweet, which lead to being devastated when my mom said absolutely not.  In retrospect that was a pretty cool move.

       I remember in my elementary school we did a thing with fingerprints, but the reason was basically just a learning experience type thing, learning about different types of fingerprints, how no two humans have the same fingerprints, not even twins, etc.

       Could be potentially a coverup for something else but I can't remember much beyond what I've already said.

       We refused to allow our kids to have fingerprint scans taken at school under the guise of being used in their new library system for checking books out instead of a card.  It just seemed off. Not to mention data protection at that school was shit to hell, they often sent a letter for one parent out to a different parents house.

       Pretty sure everyone that grew up in the 80’s-90’s era got fingerprinted at some point out of fear of kidnapping or some other shit.

       Totally remember doing this. Each parent got a kit &amp; we were supposed to give our fingerprint &amp; a lock of our hair. In case we went missing or something. Now that I look back it was creepy as fuck.

       Yeah we had this done to us in school but it was on a field trip to a police station. It was presented as a fun thing, "see how finger printing works". Kind of like when you get to play with the fire trucks.

       I didn't but yes, this is something that is done now and it's supposed to be a good thing to help identify the child if they are kidnapped, etc. While there might be some truth in that the information and records should remain with the child's parents I would think. It seems to be just a way to collect records which go into a national database.

       They did this at the local McDonald's when I was a kid in the early 80's. You got a free ice cream cone and they said it was to identify you if you were abducted or something. It was put on by the police dept. Looking back it seems extremely weird.

       For what it was worth back then I don’t know how much foresight really went into it. It was about identifying children as the media created a certain paranoia about children being kidnapped at the time.

       I remember they would always hold little community policing events where they would have fingerprinting as a cool activity.  This was southern ontario in the mid 80s.  When I got older and realized what they were doing I was pretty outraged.

       He probably did think he was doing the right thing. I can remember years ago, here in Cali, at different times the police departments would have drives to fingerprint kids and collect school pictures--but it was always with parental involvement and voluntary. This would be back in the late 60's through 70's. They would send the packets home to parents. But we were told it was in case of abduction--they would already have what they needed on file to hand out to other PD's when looking for an abducted child. And many times it was a parent during a divorce with custody issues in those days, so sometimes kids were found living with the parent in other states with alternate identities. That's where the fingerprints came in handy. Who knows what the higher ups wanted, but I think the rank and file law enforcement officers probably believed it was for the good of the child. They were parents, too. Back then, people were not so suspicious. But it also seemed like there were fewer pedo's. I'm sure there were more back then than we ever realized. But I think there really are more today. I don't know what's happened to people. The morality has really plummeted. Maybe it's that there are more drugs and that creates more dysfunctional families--I don't know. There just seems to be more evil than there used to be.

       We did that in elementary school when we were little.  It's just a tactic that they use to get information from people to use later on.  We helped them build a database on people.  Nowadays it's through our smart phones and other technology.  And the funny thing is that they knowingly did this under the assumption that we are dumb and don't know any better.

       I was in the Boy Scouts and they collected ours. I was maybe 8 years old and for some reason, I still remember it today and thinking it was weird at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       That night we were making little models of log cabins in one of the school rooms out of twigs and all this other stuff. I thought it was a lot of fun and then an officer came in and our den mother interrupted and he gave some little speech about drugs and being an honorable Boy Scout and all this other stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually, I think this was probably the first time I had heard of drugs as I was just a young kid. Then they made some fun game out of collecting all of our fingerprints. Pisses me off when I think back on it.

       I used to work in a store that families routinely visited. By the exit, there was this box, looked legit, that had a bunch of peal off forms, larger than a business card.  Asked questions like...  How many kids are in the house?  What hours are they left alone? How many entrences to your house are there?
      </p>
      <p>
       The box promised to send you a "kidnapping" kit, you'd get this envelope with finger print gear and a place to put photos, just in case, just so you're prepared.
      </p>
      <p>
       The box had no company name on it, no phone number, no "mail contents to" X. It was there when I got there.  One day I called the police about a theft, and while they were there I asked them about that box.  They'd never seen one like it, he decided to take it.
      </p>
      <p>
       "cool story, bro" but holy shit that box was full of forms.

       i I think I remember mine having a place for a tiny drop of blood too or is this some crazy ass Mandela thing going on. It was before any real DNA technology so I remember thinking that it was ominous. Like there is only one reason they need your blood and it cant be good. But again I grew up in Florida so there were many crazy components to my childhood not just this one.

       They took us to some department store like amusement park. I remember the fingerprints, and also this weird hole we had to stick our hands into. Felt like a bowl of spaghetti with a big hot dog inside it that got bigger whenever I touched it. At one point it started throbbing, and then some warm cream came out and when I pulled my hands back it was smeared all over the place. It was really gross, but I got a cool sticker.

       as a child, yes. There were places that would hold a day or two for children to be finger printed, they'd receive a balloon and or a certificate on it saying how you got your prints done? That specificity I cannot recall. However flash forward to being in my late teens and hanging out with friends and being stopped by police to be checked for drugs, warrants, etc. Afterwards they asked if we could give consent to be DNA swabbed with a q-tip being rubbed in the inside of our mouths. The reason they gave was to be sure that none of us were serial killers or wanted suspects in a serious crime. I remember we consented just to show we had nothing to hide. Funny because I was literally thinking about this yesterday and how we had the right to say No, but because we'd be refusing them, they'd probably get angry and start doing their BS. We were already held for an hour on the side of the road and one of us had priors and with bud so they were cuffed and went down that night. 
But I can't help how having one's DNA on database could almost give too much away to be framed for whatever they'd want. So many different outcomes that may be nefarious.

       Curious to know those who have gotten it, how heavy the crime rate was. My school was in a heavily gang populated area in the 90s and the city consisted of mostly minorities. And gangs back then NEVER bothered children, so going missing was rare.

       So many people recalling that it’s in case the kid goes missing... Do they dust for prints if a kid goes missing? Even if they did, wouldn’t they be dusting for prints at home? It’s not like they would know where to go. And say they dusted and found the kid’s print somewhere... how would that help, exactly?

       The elementaty school in the 80s fingerprinted my children and everyone elses children under the guise of identifying missing children when they were abducted and discovered dead.  This was done without parents being aware of it until our children came home with a card having their finger prints on it with a note to put it in  a safe place in case our children disappeared.  What? I thought.  This was nuts and, to me, a violation of individual rights.

       I remember them telling us it was in case we went missing or were kidnapped but honestly have fingerprints ever been helpful in a missing persons case? Probably not. I remember one kid who was earned by his older brother before hand and it took 2 hours for the teachers to get him out of the hall ways. I wish I had balls like him cause his mom was eventually called and got him out of it. Probably know one else's parents new it happened until after.

       Yeah in first grade they wanted us to have fun with markers and put our finger prints on paper. Then in 3rd grade we had an assignment to use our pencils to chart our prints and label them. I denied both. Later on I was arrested and it didn't matter at that point...

       I had the same experience in elementary school. I learned real quick that intelligence was punished in school. Lesson #1 never say anything too smart or you will get in trouble. Shut up and play dumb, answer questions wrong on purpose. They took our finger prints on the first day of school from I remember. This is in the early 80s.

       I wish their was a way to perfectly ascribe this accurate feeling to others (intuition maybe).  I was one of those kids who lived in the principle's office for various reasons, usually accused of being "disruptive" (questioned teachers).

       Shit like that triggered me cause I would become exasperated with shit curriculum, getting me to memorize the dates of when Napoleon lived &amp; died rather than expounding on the principles that guided him as a conquer &amp; leader or what it means to wield Power - nope, my man over was stranded on Elba, that's all you need to know.

       Couldn't believe I made it high school &amp; I still dropped out. Best decision I've ever made.

       I remember when I was in kindergarten we had to say the pledge of allegiance, but on top of that we also had to stand up and sing the song "were a grand old flag were a high flying flag".
