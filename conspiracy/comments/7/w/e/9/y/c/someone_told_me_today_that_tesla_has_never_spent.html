       Pretty sure a majority of his efforts, and a ton of his money, went towards sending one of his cars (and many cameras to record the event) into space -- as a test for an even better mission later.  His project PERFECTLY LANDED two of the three rocket boosters back at the predicted time and predicted location, to be re-used.  This saves millions and millions of dollars.  This cannot be overlooked.

       Yea I am sort of questioning how these words are being defined. Because I’ve definitely seen Tesla adds before, posters, in magazines. 
I don’t know that I’ve seen a commercial, but I don’t watch TV, but there’s definitely an ad presence, even if they don’t pay for it, it’s there lol.

       Considering its back by Elon, im guessing he uses his fame and/or other companies for the "marketing" of the company and then likely uses journalists requests for interviews/ demonstrations as more marketing that technically doesn't cost the company anything on its books.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tldr: he uses his name recognition and other companies to get the book cost of marketing $0 for Tesla

       Step2thejep who replied to you isn't interested in a good faith discussion, he runs a website where he has titled himself as the world's leading skeptic and does not believe in atoms, space, missiles being capable of level flight, all of history, dinosaurs, that the earth is round, that anyone died on 9/11, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       He will move goal posts, ignore your argument and nit pick one detail, and keep demanding more evidence like a 3 year old playing the why game.
      </p>
      <p>
       His standard of evidence is that he has to see it with his own eyes and that the science has to make sense to him. Since his understanding of science is rather rudimentary and wrong... basic newtonian physics evade him, he deems everything as fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is actually john le bon, and the reason he arguing with you is once he shows you his superior intellect he will tell you to PM him for some information too edgy for the this site, or just post a video to a john le bon site that promises a lot, delivers nothing, and tells you to become a member of his website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steptothejep is actually  95% likely to be john le bon and almost exclusively shills john le bon videos. He is here because he has been banned from cyptocurrency websites.

       I think it’s just that Elon is a fantastic at having a presence on social media that attracts people. His tweets constantly get 10s of thousands of retweets. And his work and personality cater to reddit even more. Can’t rule it out but it’s plausibly he doesn’t have to pay for it too

       Clearly the right answer. The US Gov't isn't gonna trust millions of dollars worth of assets to an unproven technology. Launching the FH proved that SpaceX
       <em>

       launch the FH successfully. This will get gov't contracts, private contracts, etc.

       I believe in Simulation Theory, same as Elon. Within that simulation it seems we are stationary on a flat plane. I'm not rigid in that belief but I'm convinced that NASA footage was faked before they erased all of the tapes and telemetry data - look it up if you don't believe me. The footage we have today was not allowed to feed directly to news reporters - they had to film it from the screen in the control room. Further, we had color video but they decided not to use it which further degraded the quality of documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Space X's fake ass footage is just about as good as

       It's not easy to admit that you've been fooled your entire life about something so fundamental. Most people won't believe it until they see it confirmed on CNN.

       I don’t believe Apollo went to the moon. I think they launched, orbited the planet and faked video from the capsule.

       I believe we have been to the moon via the secret space program.

       Why do you believe this? No reason to worry about sounding condescending. I used to investigate the Secret Space phenomenon and I think those researchers are def on to something. I just seen anything to convince me that the moon is a place we can go.

       No I think the standard model of the solar system is a Religion created by the Jesuits and spread through conquest. It is a religion that teaches:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Earth revolves around the Sun at 66,600 mph.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Earth's surface curvature is an average of .666ft (8in) per mile.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Earth is angled at 66.6 degrees off the solar plane.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       PLEASE, verify these figures for yourself. You can use mainstream sources but know that they generally round the numbers to obfuscate the 666. This is a religion of Sun worship!
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't claim to have proven the simulation theory but I does solve many fundamental problems with Jesuit physics like the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_effect_(physics">
        Observer effect
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, like I said even Elon believes in the simulation theory as it is statistically more likely that we are living within some kind of simulation as opposed to living in a time just before such a simulation can be created.

       Along with those bullshit numbers, you complain that they round up most mainstream numbers to hide this fact... any then you go and use mainstream numbers? And not only that, but Earth’s average surface curvature is
       <em>
        approximately
       </em>
       8 inches, making it roughly .6666666th of a foot. But the actual number is closer to 7.98, making it .665ths of a foot.

       You can see stars in space, most cameras have trouble doing so though, for the same reason you have trouble seeing stars in any large city. Light pollution. The Earth reflects about 6-7 times more light then a full moon, and of course there is the moon and the frigging Sun as well. The situation in orbit is basically like three different immensly bright spotlights shining on any object from three different angles.
 Note also there that there is no shades of gray in space, the absence of atmospheric occlusion means no light is hitting the air and bouncing randomly around to weakly illuminate shaded areas, in space, all light moves in a straigh line from source to object. Tings in space are either in absolute shadow or in absolute light.
 Very few cameras can show the incredibly faint light of a star in that enviroment, ESPECIALLY if the camera is focused on a brightly lit object, like say, a Tesla.
      </p>
      <p>
       To see this yourself, point your smart phone on a brightly illuminated object at night and see what happens to all the less illuminated objects in the background. Now times that a thousand and you have what happens in space.
      </p>
      <p>
       The human eye on the other hand has a sharp cone of vision that gives high clarity, but is not very light sensitive, but we also have an incredibly light(and movement) sensitive peripheral vision. So humans can see stars in space, though if the star is dim it will seem to vanish if you focus on it, and reappear if you look to the side of it. This too you can test yourself everytime the stars are out.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, neither astronauts or NASA are lying about A: Cameras have problems seing stars while in orbit or B: Humans can see stars.

       Why should I care about wasted money and fuel sending a car into space when that could be used for scientific equipment with an actual value to humanity.

       just more right-wing hate for Musk since he resigned from dear leader's so-called science council. This was a monumental and historic moment in space exploration but the most these anti-human trolls can come up with is it was all faked and filmed in some soundstage in San Bernadino, CA (a Sneakers reference).

       It was a test flight.  Test flights normally use a dummy payload because the chance of a failed launch is too high.  Musk used his Roadster instead of a dummy, likely for PR reasons.  Maybe learn a thing or two and you won't be so befuddled.

       for those caring about reality, it's a bunch of baloney as they aren't classifying FANTASTIC PR work as marketing/advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
       it supports his cult of personality, which I am sure is being buoyed by tactics that are paid for.
      </p>
      <p>
       whether or not they're paying for upvotes is non-material in my mind, it's really just a good positioning of PR v. advertising, which is all marketing - and he's paid a lot of money to do great marketing. if he's paying for upvotes, it's basically 'black market' advertising and regardless of whether or not that's being done, it works.

       I would say pretty good. He is almost single handedly pulling us away from our fossil fuel dependency and onto cleaner alternatives like Solar and Battery power. That transition is a massive one that should have been done a long time ago but the fossil fuel lobby is so massive and powerful that they have corrupted politics even though better alternatives are inevitable. What Musk has done is nothing short of amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has also been at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence warning of the danger AI pose if unchecked. He created OpenAI as a nonprofit for that purpose. He has been very critical of Mark Zuckerburg's outlook on AI too.  This is a guy that asks why the world is the way it is, figures out a way to change it, and then acts on that. They don't come around very often.

       Step2thejep who replied to you isn't interested in a good faith discussion, he runs a website where he has titled himself as the world's leading skeptic and does not believe in atoms, space, missiles being capable of level flight, all of history, dinosaurs, that the earth is round, that anyone died on 9/11, etc.
      </p>

       He will move goal posts, ignore your argument and nit pick one detail, and keep demanding more evidence like a 3 year old playing the why game.
      </p>
      <p>
       His standard of evidence is that he has to see it with his own eyes and that the science has to make sense to him. Since his understanding of science is rather rudimentary and wrong... basic newtonian physics evade him, he deems everything as fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is actually john le bon, and the reason he arguing with you is once he shows you his superior intellect he will tell you to PM him for some information too edgy for the this site, or just post a video to a john le bon site that promises a lot, delivers nothing, and tells you to become a member of his website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Steptothejep is actually  95% likely to be john le bon and almost exclusively shills john le bon videos. He is here because he has been banned from cyptocurrency websites.

       I've been following Tesla since the beginning.  They do have $0 marketing budget a LOT of the time.  When there is a marketing budget, it's usually related to having an in person event where they have their premieres for their new cars and such.  It's true.  I don't believe they've ever even ran an ad in a magazine, much less a commercial.   I guess you could put the cost of the Tesla and Star Man into their marketing budget.

       I'm afraid it's a little bit more complex than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a handful of advertisement and communication companies that have world reach, huge personnel, lots of contacts and gigantic budget, whose job is basically FURKING with ppl's mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have access to every media on the planet: TV, newspapers, online publication, social media, local medias, etc. Plus they have an army of paid shills, botnets and have access to many important ppl pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Say you are a politician who wants to go to war with Iran, they will set up a campaign that will look like a legit grassroot movement from the inside, but it's actually made of false reporting, fake documents, fake ppl agreeing, paid ppl discussing and falseflag traps. This is very effective - even though it cost a shittonne.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this is the total conversion bundle, but the same ad companies also work for major corporations, using the same tools but maybe with a less aggressive tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Tesla did spend on ad, just not the usual TV commercial that bored everyone to the bones.

       Since Elon owns both, I don't think Tesla the company paid for anything on the launch itself.  Launching a car into space, however, is absolutely going to make a lot of people talk about it.  Come on, a
       <em>
        car in space

       That's no conspiracy, that's just great marketing. The same way launching that rocket at sunset near LA. It looked amazing, and got people posting and talking about SpaceX for days, which in turn got the story spread further about the Saturn V launch.

       I think you are all forgetting that something like Tesla and and Salce X doesnt just pop up without major aupport from capitalists. So remeber that US has anstock market and in that major companies stocks are ownee by far few people that one would assume. These people are the rich elite that get together and decide things. In this case, they needed a "market" answer to the issue that is green renewable energy. So what happened, they gave elon apportunity to make tesla great and it was/is, now the market also needs an answer to the space race. NASA is gov and capitalists dont want government invovled do they. So here is space x and tesla just coming out of nowhere with huge spending and clearly investment. Because lets face it, future is space and owning large stakes in such companies is no brainer for the elite capitalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the media atm is owned by 5 corporations who are run by the same capitalists, eho own largest companies in the world. Thats thr true power of US, and reddit, is a part of that web of influence corporate run america and indeed western media. It doesnt help that elon is a good guy and what he is doing is good, but in time the influence from these capitalists will show.
      </p>
      <p>
       So telsa doesnt need to spend money on actual advertisemnt. Its associates have a vested interest to promote tesla and SpaceX. Because public money going into such companies such as amazon, spacex, tesla, etc is propping up those stock on the market and convesly making everyone rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when Tesla and SpaceX do a PR stunt like sending elons car into space, as a test payload of the large rocket, the novelty will get everyone talking and sharing. The company doesn't need to have an advertisement department and funding of siad operations, because its associated corporate ties will promote said content, because the people like it, its popular, its sensationalist, and sites like reddit will have real people and bots and algorythims all working together for this greater social agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats just how things work, its not good or bad. But we clearly see the effect of such system in terms of political ideologies, since 2016 reddit has remaind a filthpool. But in terms of promoting future relsted comoanies and tech its good. And so we remain playing this game of areas of grey.
