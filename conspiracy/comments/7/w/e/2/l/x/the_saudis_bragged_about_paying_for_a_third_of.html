       Probably not as ridiculous as you. This post is complaining about why we aren't pursuing Hillary and the Saudis in addition to Trump and the Russians, and the answer is (among many many other reasons), that she didn't win and isn't in power, and so doesn't matter nearly as much.

       Because there's no evidence that she has committed the crime you accuse her of, because you have absolutely no fucking idea if an investigation
       <em>

       This is the same shit we've seen for going on 3 decades, endless shit throwing to see what sticks, but now it's no longer being used to discredit a potential political opponent, but rather to distract from the corruption and incompetence of the people in power.

       Guess what, you were the one that asserted the issue hadn't been investigated with absolutely no evidence to support that. You have no idea what's going on, you're just spinning your bullshit accusations hoping that people will be too lazy to call you on them, or that Trump supporters will upvote them regardless.

       There's nothing to defend, your empty claims are designed as such. Making large, unverifiable claims then demanding the opposition prove you wrong is a pretty common argument style around here, and ultimately the only answer is to walk away. So, I'm done, have fun with your Clinton-rage.

       Isn't whataboutism usually used to undercut accusations? I didn't see OP say "let's not investigate Trump at all because Clinton did the same thing". Sounded like they're saying "hey while we're at it" to me. Especially since the person the US people trusted less was investigated by her own party and the other is actually getting an independent investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also say the tribalism is causing you only seeing it that way (whataboutism).
       <strong>
        Clinton getting a real investigation has been a major focus of this and many other subreddits long before Trump even thought about throwing around some birther accusations.
       </strong>
       That's not gonna go away because an elephant chooses to sit on the coffee table. We
       <em>
        are

       capable of walking and chewing gum. If we can waste time investigating steroids in baseball or planned parenthood, we can sure as hell independently investigate this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a crazy reason why it's not - they own both parties. Why won't Sessions just reopen the investigation? This is why.

       Air Force one isn't a fucking uber and should not be for hire. It also wasn't offered to other candidates. I'm not a Trump fanboy either.
Don't confuse the original comment which was Air Force one should not be used for a political campaign of a person who isn't the sitting president

       I clicked through the links now that I'm on desktop again, and it looks like she
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       flying with Obama. Legality and behavior of prior candidates aside, I personally agree she shouldn't fly on Air Force One on her own for campaign reasons, but it looks like she was riding with the sitting President.

       It actually reflects more poorly on obama but it still misuse of govt funds and should draw a red flag and hi light the spread of corruption taking place. These are supposed to be our representatives and public servants but they mistake it for being elected royalty.

       The President, like our other elected officials, is allowed to participate in the political process. The use of Air Force One (or other government transportation) is required for him while he is in office. Pretty sure it would be a massive security risk if he hopped aboard a Southwest flight to get places.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, Hillary (and any candidate in that situation) is required by law to pay a predetermined amount when they use Air Force One, so that it isn't breaking all sorts of campaign finance laws. But the ethical question here really begins and ends on if you believe elected officials should be able to participate in the political process while in office (I do), because once you allow that there is no alternative for the President to using Air Force One.

      <p>
       The hackers who hoaxed you and everyone else by posting this fake story?

      <p>
       Your own sources say that's what happened, so are you saying to investigate that hack, and the subsequent anti-Clinton story the hacker posted?

       What's the mechanism the Saudis used to donate this money, which they couldn't do legally? How did it get laundered? If your mind jumps to the CF, how did the charity launder money into Clinton's campaign? What evidence is there that any of this actually happened besides one badly translated quote?

       Just to correct the record, those sources are not anonymous to the person who compiled the dossier or to the FBI. And many of those claims have already been proven true, so I'd agree that it is credible enough to launch federal investigations.

       Laundering isn't what this is.  It is probably some sort of PAC/SuperPAC bullshit that Citizens United opened up.

       I keep seeing people throw around the term laundered, but that is specifically for money obtained through criminal acts that needs to be cleaned ("laundered").

       Here's what the zerohedge story links to:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Jordan's official news agency said on Tuesday that it was hacked when, over the weekend, a story briefly appeared on its website that said Saudi Arabia is a major funder of Hillary Clinton's campaign to become the next president of the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Sunday a report appeared on the Petra News Agency website that included what were described as exclusive comments from Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The comments included a claim that Riyadh has provided 20 percent of the total funding to the prospective Democratic candidate's campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report did not remain on the website for long, although the Washington-based Institute for Gulf Affairs later re-published an Arabic version of it, which quoted Prince Mohammed as having said Saudi Arabia had provided with “full enthusiasm” an undisclosed amount of money to Clinton.

       It was a hack of the new site, that then placed that story there. I guess this is today's ride on The_Donald's bullshit carousel...

       She didnt win. Who cares if she cheated? What are the consequences? I see what you are doing, you want to equate this to the Russian collusion investigation. But the big difference is Trump won, Hillary lost. If the roles were reversed I would not want Trump investigated, its a waste of resources.

       If i have to explain to you why a Russian plant in the white house is much more serious than illegal campaign contributions to someone who didn't win and is not in public office, the task of enlightening you is far too great for any one person.

       So Hilary as a saudi plant would be better? Remember it was hilary that gave Russia uranium, not le drumpf. I'll believe Trump is a Zionist Israeli plant, not a Russian one. Now please, do tell how Russia managed to gain control over the us.

       Moot points aside, I'd really like to know how you think shithole country Russia, that can barely push around eastern Europe anymore, would gain control over the US. If you respond with more deflection and name calling I'll just assume you know your wrong as well.

       Because the theme of the recent struggle is to prevent russias rise on a global scale. Because US is already suffering, another large competitor globally is really going to put a spanner in the works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus USA is hypocritical liar, if anyone fails to see that, they are blind or stupid. Constantly they say one thing ,and do another. They accuse other nations of what they are guilty of as well, the difference in their actions is that US believes its somehow entitled to be world government or something, that they are in right to do the things to, whilst scolding others for doing the same. But it conducts itself as anything but a beacon of good will and leadership atm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure maybe once a great nation, it has now been infiltrated by corporate agenda, and thusly empathy and humnism is gone out of the window. Corporate agenda of the big boys like Nestle believes water is not a human right.....what lind of lunacy is that?

       This is exceptionally weak, even for this sub. The only sites that have picked this up are sites nobody has heard of or sites that are know for bullshit. Those include zerohedge and infowars.
      </p>
      <p>
       You read something that fits with your opinion about Clinton. Then you posted it without any supporting evidence. When you were called out for that, you googled and found a few sources that allegedly support you predetermined views of Clinton. You're taking the word of Prince Mohammed bin Salman on face instead of doing any sort of actual investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no actual evidence of this happening. There is data to support that the Saudis donated to the Clinton Foundation. Further there is no evidence that foundation money was used to fund the campaign. Your post is baseless speculation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could have at least picked something that has at least a little meat on it. Like whether it was ethical or not for the Clinton foundation to take donations from foreign countries while she was secretary of state. That at least starts with facts.
