<p>True story,. </p>

<p>She served two terms as senator (8 years), yet she has been involved in scandals after for  26 years. </p>

<p>She was in scandals 15 years before taking public office. Each and every time there is the same thing: missing documents, refusal to comply, etc. etc. </p>

<p>it is delusional to think she is innocent. </p>

<p>The whole statement is saying that we shouldn&#39;t investigate her because she holds no executive office (because she lost).</p>

<p>No, I said that whataboutism contributed to downvotes, in that &quot;Why is the President of the United States being grilled on foreign influences in the election when the loser of that election, who holds no public office, isn&#39;t?&quot; is a bullshit argument that has been pushed hard enough to generate instinctive downvotes.</p>

<p>At least you can admit that it&#39;s your instinct to downvote posts about Hillary Clinton. Most people aren&#39;t so honest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t whataboutism usually used to undercut accusations? I didn&#39;t see OP say &quot;let&#39;s not investigate Trump at all because Clinton did the same thing&quot;. Sounded like they&#39;re saying &quot;hey while we&#39;re at it&quot; to me. Especially since the person the US people trusted less was investigated by her own party and the other is actually getting an independent investigation. </p>

<p>I&#39;d also say the tribalism is causing you only seeing it that way (whataboutism).  <strong>Clinton getting a real investigation has been a major focus of this and many other subreddits long before Trump even thought about throwing around some birther accusations.</strong> That&#39;s not gonna go away because an elephant chooses to sit on the coffee table. We <em>are</em> capable of walking and chewing gum. If we can waste time investigating steroids in baseball or planned parenthood, we can sure as hell independently investigate this.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a crazy reason why it&#39;s not - they own both parties. Why won&#39;t Sessions just reopen the investigation? This is why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The President, like our other elected officials, is allowed to participate in the political process. The use of Air Force One (or other government transportation) is required for him while he is in office. Pretty sure it would be a massive security risk if he hopped aboard a Southwest flight to get places.</p>

<p>Now, Hillary (and any candidate in that situation) is required by law to pay a predetermined amount when they use Air Force One, so that it isn&#39;t breaking all sorts of campaign finance laws. But the ethical question here really begins and ends on if you believe elected officials should be able to participate in the political process while in office (I do), because once you allow that there is no alternative for the President to using Air Force One.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what the zerohedge story links to:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jordan&#39;s official news agency said on Tuesday that it was hacked when, over the weekend, a story briefly appeared on its website that said Saudi Arabia is a major funder of Hillary Clinton&#39;s campaign to become the next president of the United States. </p>

<p>On Sunday a report appeared on the Petra News Agency website that included what were described as exclusive comments from Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. The comments included a claim that Riyadh has provided 20 percent of the total funding to the prospective Democratic candidate&#39;s campaign.</p>

<p>The report did not remain on the website for long, although the Washington-based Institute for Gulf Affairs later re-published an Arabic version of it, which quoted Prince Mohammed as having said Saudi Arabia had provided with “full enthusiasm” an undisclosed amount of money to Clinton.</p>

<p>It was a hack of the new site, that then placed that story there. I guess this is today&#39;s ride on The_Donald&#39;s bullshit carousel...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the theme of the recent struggle is to prevent russias rise on a global scale. Because US is already suffering, another large competitor globally is really going to put a spanner in the works. </p>

<p>Plus USA is hypocritical liar, if anyone fails to see that, they are blind or stupid. Constantly they say one thing ,and do another. They accuse other nations of what they are guilty of as well, the difference in their actions is that US believes its somehow entitled to be world government or something, that they are in right to do the things to, whilst scolding others for doing the same. But it conducts itself as anything but a beacon of good will and leadership atm.  </p>

<p>Sure maybe once a great nation, it has now been infiltrated by corporate agenda, and thusly empathy and humnism is gone out of the window. Corporate agenda of the big boys like Nestle believes water is not a human right.....what lind of lunacy is that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exceptionally weak, even for this sub. The only sites that have picked this up are sites nobody has heard of or sites that are know for bullshit. Those include zerohedge and infowars. </p>

<p>You read something that fits with your opinion about Clinton. Then you posted it without any supporting evidence. When you were called out for that, you googled and found a few sources that allegedly support you predetermined views of Clinton. You&#39;re taking the word of Prince Mohammed bin Salman on face instead of doing any sort of actual investigation. </p>

<p>There is no actual evidence of this happening. There is data to support that the Saudis donated to the Clinton Foundation. Further there is no evidence that foundation money was used to fund the campaign. Your post is baseless speculation.</p>

<p>You could have at least picked something that has at least a little meat on it. Like whether it was ethical or not for the Clinton foundation to take donations from foreign countries while she was secretary of state. That at least starts with facts.</p>
