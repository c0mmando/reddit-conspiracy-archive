       What does everyone here think about the planet Saturn?
Scientifically or otherwise. It really boggles my mind, it's so different from all the other planets with it's ring and hexagonal pole, and the explanations I've heard for those things are not convincing at all. I also understand there is a lot of occult symbolism to do with Saturn, I'm usually pretty skeptical towards that sort of thing but considering the anomalies I'm open to hearing what people have to say about that.

       Jupiter has rings as well. Just learned about that this week. Apparently they are thinner and made up of dust mainly vs ice crystals around Saturn. This is what I read on the internet so...

       Tbf, it has been known that both Jupiter and Uranus have had rings for a while now. We also know that Neptune has rings as well. I had a book about the planets I used to read as a child in the early 2000's which was published in the year 2000. Not everything is a conspiracy, things like this happen naturally.

       " by Liz Greene regarding Saturns transit cycles. Saturn represents Father Time. It has had a reputation as a "malefic"--pain, restriction, discipline, the taskmaster. Looking at it all with honesty, can offer greater consciousness, self-understanding and freedom. In other words, if you deal with the crap Saturn puts in front of you, you can use it to further your journey of self-discovery and wind up in the light.

       Saturn is kinda the gateway topic into occult and esoteric stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are tons of theories, all kinda play with the same set of facts or themes.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is modern-day Saturn worship.  The more elite one is, the more likely one is to worship Saturn.  Corporate logos pay too much homage to Saturn to be random.

       Why Saturn?  If you can find this, PM me.  It's basically the Holy Grail of Conspiracy.  Leaders in the clubhouse include Graham Hancock's expansion on (Velivchovsky...? Russian Name I cannot spell)'s work with the Electric Universe, suggesting the planets had a different alignment eons ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out David Icke's youtube videos on Saturn.  They;re a good compilation of various theories.  Keep in mind he is likely the counterpoint to Alex Jones - sure he speaks some truths, but he'll also bury them in emotion and lies.

       Jordan Maxwell is somebody, off the top of my head, that talks about this. But he dives into vocabulary of our languages as well and he's probably difficult for most people to even listen to, because he'll challenge the simplest and most common paradigms and world views.

       Haha yea you and me both.  I figured out Saturn worship in middle school, delved into it in high school, and 30 years later haven't figured out a Why.  It is easily the driving interest for me and conspiracy/occult/esoteric stuff.

      <p>
       Is Saturn worship mis-placed Sirius A or B worship?
      </p>
      <p>
       Was Saturn actually an old sun in the Electric Universe model, or merely Very Close and Bright?
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was a sun, did we see it flare out?  Was it Sirius B's binary partner?

       Its interesting you say this, I remember reading about a theory along these lines. That Saturn was much brighter and more prominent in the night sky before the cataclysmic comet impact(s), and the following Great Deluge and mini-ice age some ~13,000 years ago. It sort of aligns with much of the Saturn-based mythology. I have no idea why Saturn would have become dimmer in the night sky, however, and it doesn't really make sense from what I know of astronomy.

       I've kinda set my astronomy assumptions aside.  IMHO we have (almost) none clue how that stuff works.  Sure we get orbits and apogee and stuff we can measure, but how it works... not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the Electric Universe model, Saturn was RightFreakinThere.  Like the opening scene in Star Wars on Tatooine when Luke is all angsty, there are planets in the sky that are not stronger than the sun (in the movie).  In this model, Saturn was stronger/brighter than Sol.
      </p>
      <p>
       We were barley aware of Sol (the current sun) and only cuz it reflected off (or shone from behind) Saturn.  Something massive and celestial occurred, pushing the planets into their current somewhat perfect orbits.
      </p>
      <p>
       All in this theory, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all we know, we were once a moon of Saturn.  We orbited it closely, it shone on us 24/7, we were utterly under its energy and control.  Then a celestial event occurred (Tiamat?) and scattered Earth (and maybe Venus and Mars too?).
      </p>
      <p>
       It does seem like there are Saturn planets and Sol planets, and these two Star System merged at some point.

       I'd start with Icke (understanding he is a gatekeeper like Alex Jones), then hit up Electric Universe/Graham Hancock, then whatever youtube video you like (which normally stick to biblical or ancient texts and how they're about Saturn).
      </p>
      <p>
       In short:  Saturn, Venus, Mars, and Earth all lined up on one axis.  Like you could run a straight line through the cores of all four.  Mars was so close to Earth, that the two bodies exchanged electrical energy over the vastness of space.  Saturn is a gas giant (or a brown dwarf)(or whatever), and provided Earth with light and heat.  The current sun was only experienced as a shadow on Saturn.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second part of my reply assumed the reader was familiar with this, so I riffed on my own pet theories.  Shilling4Shekels seemed familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's Hancock who explores the concept of two Star Systems, Saturn and Sol, merging.  Each were the Systems main star, and somehow (maybe Jupiter's power?) Saturn got pulled into Sol's orbit.  This riffs on Jupiter being the planet/god than often saves humanity from Saturn.  This is secondary and more speculative.
      </p>
      <p>
       My own pet theories at the end are ignorable.  Just me trying to synthesize all the various concepts with others who are trying to do the same.  More Conversation than Claim.  I'm not gonna try and present Earth as a Moon of Saturn as anything but my Critical Shower Thoughts.

       In astrology, there is the idea of a Saturn return.  When Saturn returns to the place it originally was when you were born - it is said to coincide with successes for tough life lessons learned, punishments for failures to learn those lessons and the cycle repeats although manifested differently its basically the same shit different form for the next cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saturn is the lesson teacher, breaks you down to discover what youre made of and rewards those who put in the work.  We typcially get our first Saturn returns at age 28 - 30, compounding failures to recognize the cycle or lesson and to do anything about it, then you get the 'midlife crisis'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saturn's a big human life clock in astrology.  Not the end all answer but important to point out I think.

       And assuming back in the day we were more sensitive or open to these celestial energies, we might have been Extremely Aware Of Saturn's Return, or Mercury retrograding, or whathaveyou, and therefore set it up to be worshipped.

       This is the idea.  In astrology, you can google, theres so much dedicated to the Saturn return and how it's not something to dread unless youve got some serious bad karma.
      </p>
      <p>
       The articles that tell this describe it as a 'take your lumps' style of embracing it, the death and rebirth of a more mature grounded individual but with something given up in return.  It speaks to a lot about even the little things in life, cant have your cake and eat it too type of thing.  Sacrifice is a complicated part of life and is present in the micro and the macro, as above so below, these esoteric principles you reiterated over and over again in the occult.

       Which is odd cuz the ancients considered the "Time of Saturn" (for lack of a better phrase) to be one of abundance, where labor was not required to harvest the bounty of the earth (I think cuz Saturn was so close, no night, long growing seasons, different light energy than our sun gives us, different atmosphere, and such).
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems at odds with Saturn as Ego or Death or Sacrifice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe something changed?  Saturn was close and good and light... then wasn't.

       As its traveled north and over time it adopted a more 'if you squander the harvest you starve in the cold' sort of thing.  Even back in the warmer regions you could just harvest then sit on your butt, you had to get immediately back to work.  After the feast that is.  Thats my spin.

       Good question.  Curious for other's answers too.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO, yes, but only if dots are connected.  To my knowledge, we don't see them worship Saturn like Catholics at a Mass or Muslims at Mecca or anything.  Like, I don't think they drop to their knees and face Saturn and chant or sing or anything.  Certainly not publicly.

       The hexagon is pretty strange. Not everyday you see a geometric pattern at the pole of a planet. I also find it interesting how much occult worship goes back to Saturn and how they use

        black cubes

       as symbolism. Makes you re-think Mecca right?

       Are we going by NASA pictures or amateur pictures? The amateur pictures I've seen seem to have a regular circular ring at the top. I don't have any reputable sources for a hexagon existing on Saturn.

       That's the problem. We're relying a government agency started by Nazi occultists to tell us their special planet has a special symbol on it. What's more likely: a planet has a hexagon symbol on it naturally somehow, so occultists considered the planet significant? Or did occultists in space agencies fake the pictures of their special planet to have their special symbol on it? I'm not saying I know this for sure, but the hexagon is fishy and for now most amateur non-fake pics just show a circular ring as far as I can tell.

       Sure but there's no reason to think it would be a hexagon, unless you believe their probe pictures. They also said Mimas looks like the Death Star, conveniently soon after the first Star Wars came out, if you believe that, too.

       Even NASA says they only discovered the hexagon aftertheir probe got a closer look. I'm not sure they even say their own terrestrial telescopes can seethe hexagon. Google amateur Saturn and in the non-space agency pics you can just see circular rings, and barely that.

       I have yet to see one single argument for flat earth that wasn't either just downright wrong, crazy, easily disproven, or the result of the flat earthers misunderstanding of whatever concept they're talking about or technology they're using to support or present their argument. Not one. And I've watched dozens of flat earth YouTube videos. Not a single one.

       Flat earth is even sillier than concave earth even though concave is the exact opposite of convex earth? It has to get
       <em>
        flat
       </em>
       before you can even reach concave if you're reversing the curvature! I think maybe you're susceptible to peer pressure, just one of the pack, part of the hive-mind. The majority thinks flat earth is silly, therefore you believe flat earth is silly.

       Sure if Jimmy John isn't a known liar with a history of faking things and lying at every turn. NASA also says Pluto has the image of Pluto the Disney dog on it. Fanboys believe anything they are told. For critical thinkers, however, we need something from reputable sources before we believe in nonsense.

       Geometric shapes are totally found in nature. some are more natural than others. Another thing about the Mecca cube is there is allegedly a meteor in it that the pilgrims either touch or kiss.

       The hexagon's not
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       strange. If you take a sine curve and wrap it around in a circle, it can look similar:
       <a href="http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar+plot+r+%3D+sin%286theta%29%2B30">
        http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar+plot+r+%3D+sin%286theta%29%2B30
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Wavy lines like that are common, such as Earth's jet stream. It forms a continuous wavy line around the planet. Saturn's is interesting in how regular it is, and that the wave has the right amplitude to make parts of it appear straight. It's not a hexagon though, it just looks like it; both the "corners" and the "straight lines" are curved (at least in terms of latitude), but we recognize the shape of the hexagon and see that, despite the curvature.

       The ancient religions nearly all seemed to worship Saturn as their chief deity. It has gone by many names, such as Osiris, Chronos, Tammuz, Remphan, Moloch, El, and Baal. I find it interesting that the star on the flag of Israel is probably the Star of Remphan, or Saturn, because there was no real "Star of David."
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did people begin to worship Saturn in the first place? And what is the significance of the Black Cube? I have no idea.

       let me suggest this to open a rabbit hole - a 2D hexagon is a 3D cube..
      </p>
      <p>
       So that black hexagon on saturn can also be viewed as a black cube.
      </p>
      <p>

       Took forever for that page to load, and the written-copy on the site is laughably dated jargon. "Tailor-made solutions based on high-quality intelligence, cutting-edge technology, unique expertise and out-of-the-box thinking." Holy shit, guys, it's not 1998.

       OTOH, I like the cool logo and photo of the translucent guy overlooking the city. That "back-to-the-camera" thing, I'm noticing, is some kind of secret society "tell," like the hand-in-jacket thing used to be.

       Saturn used to be our sun. It is a brown dwarf star. Our ancestors got a lot of symbolism from it, but when it comes to a lot of the occult stuff that the elites practice, it all started with Gilgamesh who became associated with Saturn. Nearly all epic hero tales, religions and mythologies originated with Gilgamesh. The occultism that the elites practice is a dark version of those practices.

       Can you link me a website where I can find more information on Saturn previously being our sun  and in being a brown dwarf star. Not trying to be rude this is purely out of curiosity, astronomy peaks my interest and what you are suggesting seems like a good read.

       Lol Saturn is not a brown dwarf. It's not big enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be a brown dwarf, it'd need to be bigger than the biggest gas giants, so approx 10x the mass of Jupiter. Too big to be a gas giant, too small to start nuclear fusion and be a star.

       Whatever happened to critical thinking?

      <p>
       I mean I;m sure I can make up some crap about Pluto actually being our 2nd moon millions of years ago and make it sound scientifically feasible and certain folks here would lap it up.

       As I've said in other posts of mine, I love a

       conspiracy theory. This sort of junk just gives us all a bad rep.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wished more people would think about what they were actually saying. Does the person I replied to even know what a brown dwarf is? It certainly doesn't sound like it.

       I don‘t know why but I‘m scared of that planet - sounds funny, I know. But whenever I watch a documentary about space and suddenly Saturn pops up on the screen I flinch and immediately look away. I can look at other planets but zooming in and out of any planet creeps me out. Saturn is definitely different.

       Jupiter and Uranus also have rings they just aren't so easily seen.
      </p>
      <p>
       The hexagonal pattern on the pole is created by static circular vortexes.
      </p>
      <p>
       This can be exemplified by the honeycomb pattern that is very popular on glass pipes, a central circular dot is surrounded by six more circular dots and this forms a hexagonal structure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it something other than a natural occurring vortex ??

       The mysteries of Saturn are something that you and I cannot know. We only catch glimpses of it, hearsay. It likely has something to do with the control of reality.

       In the Zodiac. Saturn is the planet of Capricorn and the 10th house. "The Tenth House is commonly referred to as the House of Social Status. It is about the place we have attained in our social (or work/career) grouping and in society as a whole. Think status, the authority it conveys, and consequently, the role we take in our community."
      </p>

       If there is a way to gain powers / energy from planets, it makes sense that the elite would want to get theirs from Saturn.

       Dude you're missing my point. This debate has happened on this sub hundreds of times. There was no point to bring it to this post. It's irrelevant because he never said anything was fake or non-existent, just that he doesn't believe what he's heard.

      <p>
       But let's say he did,  here it's how it would go

      <p>
       person 1: "you just don't understand the science so don't question it."
      </p>
      <p>
       Person 2: "I doubt you understand it fully yourself, so why are you so eager to defend it and why can't I question it anyway?"
      </p>
      <p>
       1:
       <em>
        googles "the science behind it" and repeats what he has seen
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       2: "that information is outdated/lied about for a reason and you didn't conduct the research yourself so how can you or I be sure?"
      </p>
      <p>
       1: "you're just crazy/stupid/won't believe anything"
      </p>
      <p>
       2: "You're just hypnotized/a sheep/close minded"

       It's just two average people's opinion, man. They are equal. Some people believe what they're told without seeing it or fully understanding it themselves. Other people believe that "current scientific understanding" could be fabricated for various different reasons. You're lumping a huge group of people together as stupid and superstitious without understand their points.

       Our model of the universe changes a lot over time and we find crazier and crazier stuff everyday.

You're not gaining anything by just dismissing questions when you yourself don't completely understand what you're defending.

       Seeing as we've only found any planets in other solar systems a little over 20 years ago, then no, I don't think it's fair to say that rings and hexagonal poles are unique at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early '90s, planets were supposedly unique to our solar system, or at least very rare. Now we see that the galaxy, and probably the universe as a whole is teeming with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not too long ago, water was unique to Earth in our solar system, now we know it's found all over the place.

       Ok, so once again, why is he posting on a conspiracy subreddit? It seems odd to me that you'd post about Saturn on a subreddit dedicated to conspiracies if you didn't think there was a conspiracy to do with Saturn.

       Saturn worship is one of the, if not THE, conspiracy.

       In terms of density, Saturn is the least dense and Earth is the most. Perhaps Sarurn is the gateway to the other worlds and dimensions from the 3D perspective. Perhaps this was symbolized in the movie "Interstellar" where Saturn was the wormhole guardian.

       The info coming from our current science (flying probes out) and the concepts discussed in this sub are not mutually exclusive.  In anything the data from Cassini supports the concepts being discussed... themselves stemming from what the ancients wrote, etched, carved, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to Cassini, we knew Saturn and Hexagons were connected.  Not sure why or how, just that they were.  Then Cassini shows us a Hexagon on the pole of Saturn.

       But large craft have been seen and photographed proliferating around it,and have been seen  appearing to "manufacture" its rings. See book "ringmakers of Saturn." I think its called.

       Saturn is providing the "feed" source code with the black cube in earth that is the underlying OS of our current reality. Next up we will have a cube of pure gold and illumination and will once again achieve unity with light.

       Also i really encourage you to look into astrotheology.  Again santos bonacci was the best at teaching this subject before he went all flat earth.  I honestly think the flat earth theory was resurrected to discredit this man specifically.

       Kronos is the baby eater, the father of time, the ancient name for Saturn.

       Black robes are symbolic for saturn, this is why judges wear them when taking away your natural human rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The black cube is another symbol for saturn.

      <p>
       Basically all of united states culture is based off ancient saturn worship.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why we have judges and presidents and cops that are human traffickers and pedophiles.  I honestly think they are cannibals too...
      </p>
      <p>
       Saturn worship is real and alive today.  It is the religion of the elite.

       the EL ites, El is an ancient name for saturn too.
