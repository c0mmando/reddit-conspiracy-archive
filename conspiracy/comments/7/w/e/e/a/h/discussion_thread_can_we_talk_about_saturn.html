Scientifically or otherwise. It really boggles my mind, it&#39;s so different from all the other planets with it&#39;s ring and hexagonal pole, and the explanations I&#39;ve heard for those things are not convincing at all. I also understand there is a lot of occult symbolism to do with Saturn, I&#39;m usually pretty skeptical towards that sort of thing but considering the anomalies I&#39;m open to hearing what people have to say about that. </p>

Saturn represents Father Time. It has had a reputation as a &quot;malefic&quot;--pain, restriction, discipline, the taskmaster. Looking at it all with honesty, can offer greater consciousness, self-understanding and freedom. In other words, if you deal with the crap Saturn puts in front of you, you can use it to further your journey of self-discovery and wind up in the light.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saturn is kinda the gateway topic into occult and esoteric stuff.</p>

<p>There are tons of theories, all kinda play with the same set of facts or themes.</p>

<p>There is modern-day Saturn worship.  The more elite one is, the more likely one is to worship Saturn.  Corporate logos pay too much homage to Saturn to be random.</p>

<p>Why Saturn?  If you can find this, PM me.  It&#39;s basically the Holy Grail of Conspiracy.  Leaders in the clubhouse include Graham Hancock&#39;s expansion on (Velivchovsky...? Russian Name I cannot spell)&#39;s work with the Electric Universe, suggesting the planets had a different alignment eons ago.</p>

<p>Check out David Icke&#39;s youtube videos on Saturn.  They;re a good compilation of various theories.  Keep in mind he is likely the counterpoint to Alex Jones - sure he speaks some truths, but he&#39;ll also bury them in emotion and lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha yea you and me both.  I figured out Saturn worship in middle school, delved into it in high school, and 30 years later haven&#39;t figured out a Why.  It is easily the driving interest for me and conspiracy/occult/esoteric stuff.</p>

<p>Is Saturn worship mis-placed Sirius A or B worship?  </p>

<p>Was Saturn actually an old sun in the Electric Universe model, or merely Very Close and Bright?</p>

<p>If it was a sun, did we see it flare out?  Was it Sirius B&#39;s binary partner?</p>

<p>Its interesting you say this, I remember reading about a theory along these lines. That Saturn was much brighter and more prominent in the night sky before the cataclysmic comet impact(s), and the following Great Deluge and mini-ice age some ~13,000 years ago. It sort of aligns with much of the Saturn-based mythology. I have no idea why Saturn would have become dimmer in the night sky, however, and it doesn&#39;t really make sense from what I know of astronomy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve kinda set my astronomy assumptions aside.  IMHO we have (almost) none clue how that stuff works.  Sure we get orbits and apogee and stuff we can measure, but how it works... not so much.</p>

<p>In the Electric Universe model, Saturn was RightFreakinThere.  Like the opening scene in Star Wars on Tatooine when Luke is all angsty, there are planets in the sky that are not stronger than the sun (in the movie).  In this model, Saturn was stronger/brighter than Sol.</p>

<p>We were barley aware of Sol (the current sun) and only cuz it reflected off (or shone from behind) Saturn.  Something massive and celestial occurred, pushing the planets into their current somewhat perfect orbits.</p>

<p>All in this theory, of course.  </p>

<p>For all we know, we were once a moon of Saturn.  We orbited it closely, it shone on us 24/7, we were utterly under its energy and control.  Then a celestial event occurred (Tiamat?) and scattered Earth (and maybe Venus and Mars too?).  </p>

<p>It does seem like there are Saturn planets and Sol planets, and these two Star System merged at some point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My bad, I said this thread had links to info.  There are two active Saturn thread currently.  This one is specific to links, etc.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7wfhr8/suggested_documentaries_on_saturnoccult_connection/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7wfhr8/suggested_documentaries_on_saturnoccult_connection/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;d start with Icke (understanding he is a gatekeeper like Alex Jones), then hit up Electric Universe/Graham Hancock, then whatever youtube video you like (which normally stick to biblical or ancient texts and how they&#39;re about Saturn).</p>

<p>In short:  Saturn, Venus, Mars, and Earth all lined up on one axis.  Like you could run a straight line through the cores of all four.  Mars was so close to Earth, that the two bodies exchanged electrical energy over the vastness of space.  Saturn is a gas giant (or a brown dwarf)(or whatever), and provided Earth with light and heat.  The current sun was only experienced as a shadow on Saturn.  </p>

<p>The second part of my reply assumed the reader was familiar with this, so I riffed on my own pet theories.  Shilling4Shekels seemed familiar.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s Hancock who explores the concept of two Star Systems, Saturn and Sol, merging.  Each were the Systems main star, and somehow (maybe Jupiter&#39;s power?) Saturn got pulled into Sol&#39;s orbit.  This riffs on Jupiter being the planet/god than often saves humanity from Saturn.  This is secondary and more speculative.</p>

<p>My own pet theories at the end are ignorable.  Just me trying to synthesize all the various concepts with others who are trying to do the same.  More Conversation than Claim.  I&#39;m not gonna try and present Earth as a Moon of Saturn as anything but my Critical Shower Thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In astrology, there is the idea of a Saturn return.  When Saturn returns to the place it originally was when you were born - it is said to coincide with successes for tough life lessons learned, punishments for failures to learn those lessons and the cycle repeats although manifested differently its basically the same shit different form for the next cycle.  </p>

<p>Saturn is the lesson teacher, breaks you down to discover what youre made of and rewards those who put in the work.  We typcially get our first Saturn returns at age 28 - 30, compounding failures to recognize the cycle or lesson and to do anything about it, then you get the &#39;midlife crisis&#39;.  </p>

<p>Saturn&#39;s a big human life clock in astrology.  Not the end all answer but important to point out I think.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And assuming back in the day we were more sensitive or open to these celestial energies, we might have been Extremely Aware Of Saturn&#39;s Return, or Mercury retrograding, or whathaveyou, and therefore set it up to be worshipped.  </p>

<p>I can dig that as a potential.  Ties in with Chronos and time and clock, so an easy Death Cult symbol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the idea.  In astrology, you can google, theres so much dedicated to the Saturn return and how it&#39;s not something to dread unless youve got some serious bad karma.   </p>

<p>The articles that tell this describe it as a &#39;take your lumps&#39; style of embracing it, the death and rebirth of a more mature grounded individual but with something given up in return.  It speaks to a lot about even the little things in life, cant have your cake and eat it too type of thing.  Sacrifice is a complicated part of life and is present in the micro and the macro, as above so below, these esoteric principles you reiterated over and over again in the occult.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which is odd cuz the ancients considered the &quot;Time of Saturn&quot; (for lack of a better phrase) to be one of abundance, where labor was not required to harvest the bounty of the earth (I think cuz Saturn was so close, no night, long growing seasons, different light energy than our sun gives us, different atmosphere, and such).</p>

<p>This seems at odds with Saturn as Ego or Death or Sacrifice. </p>

<p>Maybe something changed?  Saturn was close and good and light... then wasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question.  Curious for other&#39;s answers too.</p>

<p>IMHO, yes, but only if dots are connected.  To my knowledge, we don&#39;t see them worship Saturn like Catholics at a Mass or Muslims at Mecca or anything.  Like, I don&#39;t think they drop to their knees and face Saturn and chant or sing or anything.  Certainly not publicly.</p>

<p>It certainly can be. A podcast which recently spent an episode dealing with Saturn and &#39;synchronicity&#39; can be <a href="https://www.occulturepodcast.com/bitcoin">found here</a>.

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the problem. We&#39;re relying a government agency started by Nazi occultists to tell us their special planet has a special symbol on it. What&#39;s more likely: a planet has a hexagon symbol on it naturally somehow, so occultists considered the planet significant? Or did occultists in space agencies fake the pictures of their special planet to have their special symbol on it? I&#39;m not saying I know this for sure, but the hexagon is fishy and for now most amateur non-fake pics just show a circular ring as far as I can tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hexagon&#39;s not <em>that</em> strange. If you take a sine curve and wrap it around in a circle, it can look similar: <a href="http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar+plot+r+%3D+sin%286theta%29%2B30">http://m.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=polar+plot+r+%3D+sin%286theta%29%2B30</a></p>

<p>Wavy lines like that are common, such as Earth&#39;s jet stream. It forms a continuous wavy line around the planet. Saturn&#39;s is interesting in how regular it is, and that the wave has the right amplitude to make parts of it appear straight. It&#39;s not a hexagon though, it just looks like it; both the &quot;corners&quot; and the &quot;straight lines&quot; are curved (at least in terms of latitude), but we recognize the shape of the hexagon and see that, despite the curvature.</p>

I find it interesting that the star on the flag of Israel is probably the Star of Remphan, or Saturn, because there was no real &quot;Star of David.&quot;</p>

<p>Why did people begin to worship Saturn in the first place? And what is the significance of the Black Cube? I have no idea.</p>

<p>The hexagonal pattern on the pole is created by static circular vortexes.</p>

<p>This can be exemplified by the honeycomb pattern that is very popular on glass pipes, a central circular dot is surrounded by six more circular dots and this forms a hexagonal structure.</p>

<p>Is it something other than a natural occurring vortex ??</p>

<p>person 1: &quot;you just don&#39;t understand the science so don&#39;t question it.&quot;</p>

<p>Person 2: &quot;I doubt you understand it fully yourself, so why are you so eager to defend it and why can&#39;t I question it anyway?&quot;</p>

<p>1: <em>googles &quot;the science behind it&quot; and repeats what he has seen</em></p>

<p>2: &quot;that information is outdated/lied about for a reason and you didn&#39;t conduct the research yourself so how can you or I be sure?&quot;</p>

<p>I know. But it&#39;s typically explained with evidence, not &quot;MUH OCCULT&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The info coming from our current science (flying probes out) and the concepts discussed in this sub are not mutually exclusive.  In anything the data from Cassini supports the concepts being discussed... themselves stemming from what the ancients wrote, etched, carved, etc.</p>

<p>Prior to Cassini, we knew Saturn and Hexagons were connected.  Not sure why or how, just that they were.  Then Cassini shows us a Hexagon on the pole of Saturn.</p>

<p>This sub 100% accepts the science (minus any NASA friction).  There is literally no Nahhhhhh.</p>

<p>Kronos is the baby eater, the father of time, the ancient name for Saturn.  </p>

<p>Black robes are symbolic for saturn, this is why judges wear them when taking away your natural human rights.  </p>

<p>The black cube is another symbol for saturn.  </p>

<p>Basically all of united states culture is based off ancient saturn worship.  </p>

<p>This is why we have judges and presidents and cops that are human traffickers and pedophiles.  I honestly think they are cannibals too...</p>

<p>Saturn worship is real and alive today.  It is the religion of the elite.  </p>

<p>the EL ites, El is an ancient name for saturn too. </p>
