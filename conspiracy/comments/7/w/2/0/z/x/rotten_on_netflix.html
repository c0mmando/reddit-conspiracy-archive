        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys, I have a pretty good recommendation for you out there that like documentary type shows.</p>

<p>Netflix has an original series called &quot;Rotten&quot; it&#39;s all food related, but it is very conspiracy involved. It shows how corporations game the system to ruin small time players.</p>

<p>The two best episodes IMO are &quot;Lawyers, Guns, Honey&quot; and &quot;Garlic Breath&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Garlic Breath&quot; especially shows the corruption of big business, the way China ruins American industry, forced prison labor, how politics plays a big part on all this and how people can be bought out despite their best intentions (aka everyone has a price).</p>

<p>Warning, the episodes are a little slow, but if you have time to kill and are up for a learning experience with a good amount of conspiracy, I recommend this to you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was particularly interested in the honey one, considering the importance of the beehive symbolism in freemasonry. The pope&#39;s hat used to be shaped like a beehive. Many buildings around the world are architecturally meant to resemble a beehive, even domed structures like the Capitol Building. I find it strange that these people are just letting the bees die off given their significance to them. Or maybe it&#39;s just a symbol to them and they don&#39;t give a fuck about the bees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have 35 chickens but it&#39;s mostly for eggs that the kids sell around the neighborhood. It takes a long time to raise a chick to full grown hen...6-9 months based on the breed. You will need a rooster (if allowed in your county) to keep costs low and resupply of new chickens, and you will want fryer hens (for the meat) not any fancy easter egg laying hens. Based on your consumption maybe 100 chickens at a time with backstock constantly in production. But that&#39;s based on breast meat alone. Not all the meat. You can reduce the number further...but I know some people who can eat a whole chicken a day. :D</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To tell you the truth... Never weighed them. But they are the biggest roasters youll see in a store. </p>

<p>I raise about 90 a year 30 at a time and my wife and I never run out. 
Mind you that ain&#39;t at a lb each a day</p>

<p>I also clean them myself. I don&#39;t have a plucker and have found skinning them is quick and easy. Not the most fun job but it is not too bad. It cost $4 per bird to get them processed at the poultry farm. And they are graded and could be sold then. &quot;Organic&quot; free range chickens go for about $25 (can) up here.</p>

<p>These broiler birds are bred to grow super fast. 7-8 weeks and they are done. </p>

<p>We started raising them before we moved onto the hobby farm too. I made a small pen behind a shed  and not one neighbor or knew they were there. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try raising 25 meat chickens from a mail order hatchery your first go around. Yes, even the cornish cross are better tasting home raised (and can totally be raised on pasture.) 25 is a good number to see what batch raising is like on a small scale. </p>

<p>Slaughter a few when they reach 2.5 lbs (these will be cornish game hen size) a few at 4, 5, and up to 10lbs. We were surprised to find the smaller chicken size works better for us both in the kitchen and in the field. You are going to want to branch out from just breast or you are going to be up to your ears in chicken legs. Imagine 25 x 5lbs is quite a bit of chicken for your trouble!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had to take a break from that.  The level of corruption is nauseating.  Still, an excellent show.  I&#39;m consistently impressed with the level of truth Netflix spits out.  Hell, even the Punisher dabbled in real world scenarios with poppy in Afghanistan, and American death squads.  At times I question how they are allowed to do so.  Perhaps it&#39;s merely the platform didn&#39;t exist before, but I feel like TPTB are losing their grip...at least I hope so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely didn’t binge watch it. It does seem like more and more of these corporations are being exposed, but nothing will change until we learn to stand together as people, rather then dividing by race and religion. It’s really sad how they’ve driven us all apart. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This reminds me of something , that was happening in my country in like 2010-2012 or so.</p>

<p>They tried to pass some legislations to put garlic on the list of psihedelic substances..and therefor to ban it.</p>

<p>It was crazy.</p>

<p>Thing is garlic, is very  <em>very</em>  used here, from cooking to old tales that it protects from &quot;bad spirits&quot; lol. </p>

<p>This is also where the myth that galric scares vampires away came from hehe.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry if this post dosen&#39;t relate to your post to much, just a tought that crossed my mind.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Romania.</p>

<p>And I think,they tried to pass it as something between the lines of &quot;Codex Alimentarius&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if this was the context, I remeber that name because I always liked the sound of latin words, also it was a long time ago, I was very young (as in, didn&#39;t really had internet, or any idea about conspiracy theories and such) .</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The specific episode I recommend actually shines a light on how complicit the US Gov is in this.</p>

<p>Also, Netflix has MANY shows critical of the &quot;deep state&quot;. You def haven&#39;t been watching the right stuff.</p>

<p>Are you still mad about that one show that got everyone one up in arms, &quot;Dear white people&quot; or whatever?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>true. totally a limited hangout/ organized disinfo. Still, no need to throw the baby out with the bathwater. </p>

<p>Just remember, it&#39;s so much worse than what they choose to reveal through netflix.</p>

<p>That is the &quot;controlled outrage&quot; they want to foster vs the complete breakout revolution that would come from everyone seeing the whole truth about everything.  </p>
