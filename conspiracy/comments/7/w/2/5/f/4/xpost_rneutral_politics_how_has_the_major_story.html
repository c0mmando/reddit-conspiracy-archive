        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is probably a better forum to ask this question but every where I go I seem to run afoul of subreddit posting guidelines (post banned in neutral politics). I&#39;m not seeking any grand narrative for this question just wondering if anyone following the msm on a regular basis can untangle what seems to me a very obvious case of skulduggery by Clinton and an attempt to shift blame to Trump. I&#39;m posting this question here because its more or less the last place I know of on reddit where people seem to generally be open to questioning anything and not entirely dedicated to either a partisan cause or employed by an astroturfer ... at least that&#39;s how I remember this place though I don&#39;t visit often so maybe I&#39;m already in violation of a rule or two that&#39;s been added. Without further ado the OP:</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been out of the loop for a number of months now after it seemed like no new information of any consequence was coming forward. The Title of this post refers to my own understanding of the events which is as follows: Trump is alleged to have met with Russians and discussed emails hacked from Hillary&#39;s improperly (or possibly illegally) stored private servers and in these emails it was revealed that the Clinton campaign engaged in a calculated campaign to deny democratic primary voters the opportunity to select Sanders as a candidate. So in effect the treason Trump is alleged to have committed is the revelation of Clinton&#39;s either criminal or at least certainly sleazy political behavior. Is this about right or have I fused separate incidents into a single narrative? </p>

<p>The DNC picking Hillary over Bernie is about as much a crime as a restaurant giving a table to somebody who arrived there after you lol </p>

<p>The fact that Trumpsters are comparing literal treason to a private organization being an unfair meanie is ludicrous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another reason is that parties are private organizations so while what the dem party did was shady as hell, and has produced fallout, and limited reform within the party, what they did simply isn&#39;t illegal. ..if they wanted to they could have just directly coronated hillary as the nominee.  They essentially did but hid the coronation behind what appeared to be a fair process. </p>

<p>Trump on the other hand, if the accusations are true, broke federal law and state election laws, real crimes with real consequences if you can make the collar stick. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahaha.. ha.</p>

<p>The FBI investigated one of their own agents for doing their job so that they could get to the Trump administration.</p>

<p>The FBI was working with Carter Page since 2013, sending him into Russia to do secret sting operations and entrap Russian suspected UN operatives - had Carter Page wired up for YEARS...... using him...</p>

<p>Along comes the Trump campaign and the corrupt FBI DOJ dems send Carter Page over to Trumps campaign - luckily for the corrupt Dems he secures a lame low end position, then goes on the FBI missions... and returns, for the FBI... at which point the FBI and DOJ write up their &quot;get dirty Don&quot; plan using Carter Page, their own operative, as the &quot;lynchpin&quot; ...</p>

<p>Carter Page REMAINS UNCHARGED TO THIS DAY BECAUSE HE IS AN FBI DOJ INTEL AGENT....</p>

<p>The FBI obtained the recordings after Sporyshev attempted to recruit an FBI undercover employee (“UCE-1”), who was posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company. </p>

<p>UCE-1 might be Carter Page. From NYTimes</p>

<p><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-banker-sentenced-connection-conspiracy-work-russian-intelligence">https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/russian-banker-sentenced-connection-conspiracy-work-russian-intelligence</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html</a></p>

<p>The court documents say that Mr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital</p>

<p>I speculate that they didn&#39;t plan for everything to go this far. Their hubris kept them focused on only Hillary winning and still believe she did...</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s ditch this idea that Page was a controlled FBI informant/asset. That can&#39;t work because the TARGET of the FISA warrant was Carter Page. That is, the DOJ/FBI went before a FISA judge and swore under oath that they had credible verified evidence that Carter Page was working FOR a foreign intelligence service -- they alleged that he was a spy for the Russians, with the implication that Trump hired him because of this and Trump, through Carter Page, was colluding with the Russians to defeat Hillary. That&#39;s the Government&#39;s case.</p>

<p>Why did they think this? Well, according to Nunes&#39; memo, BUT FOR the Steele Dossier, the FISA court would NOT have granted the Carter Page FISA warrant.</p>

<p>So, the FBI was relying on the Steele Dossier for the key predicate fact that Page was a Russian Agent in the employ of Trump. Nunes&#39; memo, backed up by the sworn testimony of Comey, states that the FBI thought the Dossier was &quot;salacious and unverified.&quot; </p>

<p>ShareBlue responds, BUT FISA WARRANT WAS ONLY ISSUED ON DOSSIER! </p>

<p>Response: True, everyone admits that the FBI presented additional information to the FISA Judge, but ROSENSTEIN testified under oath that the FISA warrant would not have issue BUT FOR the inclusion of the Steele Dossier.</p>

<p>So whatever else the FBI presented to the FISA judge, it wasn&#39;t enough on its own to justify the FISA warrant. CASE FUCKING CLOSED. FBI rushed to get FISA warrant because they needed it RIGHT NOW to help Hillary Clinton win the election.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use American Citizen as an informant to bait foreign intelligence agents. </p></li>
<li><p>Use FISA to surveil this citizen and use their connections to foreign intelligence agents as the probable cause for them being a spy. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>That is, the DOJ/FBI went before a FISA judge and swore under oath that they had credible verified evidence that Carter Page was working FOR a foreign intelligence service -- they alleged that he was a spy for the Russians </p>

<p>They alleged he was a spy, when he was actually a controlled asset.</p>

<p>They perpetrated a fraud upon the court.</p>

<p>They perpetrated a fraud because the Title I warrant they sought and obtained is the broadest warrant available -- it allows you to look in depth into EVERY person Page had contact with.</p>

<p>This, I suspect is what Trump is bragging about here: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMiIgSpV5dY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMiIgSpV5dY</a></p>

<p>He and his team are &quot;the great sleuth&quot; because they managed to unravel this exceedingly devious FBI/DOJ strategy to surveil and take down Trump.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean clearly you are casting doubt on this account but all it would take for you to really do so would be to provide evidence that a single one of these points is not justified by the links he has provided. The fact that you have chosen not to do so indicates that either you don&#39;t have a counter argument to make that can withstand scrutiny or you haven&#39;t actually considered the ideas he presents as a neutral and impartial observer and have a vested interest in a particular outcome due to some emotional investment in these proceedings. I see nothing in the above reply that stretches credulity as an explanation of events based on what is know of the parties involved. It would not be hard to believe on the other hand that Trump was colluding with Russia for personal profit but every-time evidence is requested that does not rely on hearsay it is hand-waived away. I wonder if you realize your case is not yet made until you make it. This post is not a partisan post if you would like to make a case countering the claims above or even relying on an entirely different supposition you are cordially invited to do so. Until that time however you can&#39;t very well claim that someone who has done their homework has done so poorly when you have neglected to even attempt to do yours. Please don&#39;t respond with anything that implies its obvious what is going on with this scandal the entire purpose of the post is to establish clearly what are the facts of the case. If you can&#39;t play by the rules of the question don&#39;t be surprised if people regard your intentions and your wits with a certain skepticism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no need to address this copy pasted nonsense, partially because the sources cited are garbage and partially because cater page himself has stated that he is not an agent. ..he said if I was I would  know right. The wall of text sited share blue and the nunes nonsense that even the r&#39;s largely agree does not vindicate trump or invalidate Mueller, as well as other equally dubious garbage posters.  Piling 20 assumptions on top of shoddy assertions doesn&#39;t add up to a scrap of actual evidence. It is amazing to me that the biggest actual conspiracy in years is rejected by the members of this sub just because you yourselves didn&#39;t suss it out or you don&#39;t like the people being named conspirators.   </p>

If you can&#39;t concisely sum up your understanding of the current events then you are just another parrot for someone else&#39;s talking points. Disparaging another&#39;s views is not a substitute for a clearly held position with supporting evidence. If you don&#39;t have the time or the inclination to do so here as most people would not you should simply move on with your life and allow someone who does to make the case that you are clearly ill equipped or unwilling to do.

    <div class="md"><p>So is it necessary to know the correct answer to identify an incorrect one? </p>

<p>Cater Page, super spy,  was the subject of a fisa warrant initially because he bragged about the fact that he was aware of political dirt on hrc while drunk in a bar talking to an aussie diplomat. When news broke that the political dirt actually existed,  the aussie contacted the fbi.  On the basis of multiple pieces of corroborating evidence the fisa warrant was approved.  The warrant was renewed multiple times one of which contained the steele dossier as corroborating evidence,  the other times (at least 2) had additional evidence to that provided in the original fisa application obtained either via the surveillance or from additional outside sources to justify the renewal.   </p>

<p>People try to make significant hay out of the political  origin of the dossier but this misses the only point that matters,  is the information contained in the dossier factually correct,  if so the source is irrelevant.  We don&#39;t know yet which accusations are fact and which are not but more is corroborated as time passes,  and while the salacious accusations get press, the real meat of the dossier is in the Russian funding alleged for trump businesses routed through douchebank (mispelling intentional) which is itself heavily tied to Russian oligarchs. </p>

<p>Carter Page has himself bumbled his way through multiple interviews saying things which have either further implicated him or at the very least utterly failed to exhonerate him.   The fbi had in fact investigated him for ties to Russian spies in the past but both the fbi and the Russians found him to be an unwitting fool.  The fact that he hasn&#39;t been charged is actually evidence against the theory that he is a burned agent or stooge.  He is valueless as an agent now if it were true and if they want to destroy his credibility an indictment is good for that,  or if you want to play the let&#39;s get trump for nothing game you charge him now and continue pushing out trial dates insinuating that he is cooperating further tarnishing trumps image via insinuation. </p>

<p>So either:</p>

<p>Page looks sounds and acts like an idiot who wanted to big a big player while pulling off some 5d chess double agent trade craft but simultaneously unable to avoid the move where he gets set up asthe fall guy.</p>

<p>Or:</p>

<p>Page is a dumber, unluckier, crooked Sterling Archer bragging about how he is a spy to impress people in a bar. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to be on any of the investigative teams privy to all information in order to determine which of those potential explanations is more likely. </p>

<p>So essentially nothing has changed from the previous year in that nothing has either been corroborated or proven conclusively? I&#39;m sorry that you seem to take the question personally but that is essentially all that I am trying to find out. Now that I have two sides confirming this I will continue to go about my business until I hear something substantial. Thanks for your input. </p>

<p>Truth is often stranger than fiction. Smart people do dumb things on a regular basis. Dumb people occasionally do very smart things. I do not suppose myself to be so clairvoyant as to deduce merely from hearsay what is or is not likely in the affairs of men and women I hardly know. Nor can I reliably guess either the motives or means of arcane and Machiavellian three letter agencies. You on the other hand seem to have come to a conclusion that you feel comfortable with. I congratulate you on your powers of prediction. I will go about my life with no clue as to what is about to happen and enjoy the pleasant sensation that occurs when things turn out precisely as I didn&#39;t know they would.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the media itself gave Trump unprecedented access to the airwaves as a presidential candidate. This makes the media culpable.</p>

<p>The corporate media wants the public to believe they are getting reality based &#39;news&#39;. </p>

<p>In reality the stations are delivering eyeballs/selling a story(repeated big lies) for advertisers who pay them a fk ton of money. It&#39;s why it&#39;s called programming.</p>

<p>The media isn&#39;t going to stop &amp; say &#39;wait.......you know what it wasn&#39;t Russia who manipulated the election. It was us who had Trump on 247 to make certain the public doesn&#39;t focus on Clintons&#39; massive unpopularity &amp; scandals !!!!&quot;</p>

<p>They also didn&#39;t report AT ALL about a proclaimed socialist raising THE MOST MONEY of any presidential candidate ever all from individual donations &amp; not corporations.</p>

<p>They were lying by omission. But if they say it was their fault, do you think people would continue watching. They can&#39;t admit they are fake news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The money going to Paul Manafort is detailed in Mueller&#39;s indictment of him.  Your call on if you think that&#39;s reliable, but most of the info in there is pretty typical for a DC lobbyist (other than the size of the payments).</p>

<p>Online influence is diffuse, unclear, and though its been widely reported much of the coverage is prone to hyperbole.  A while back Facebook reported a few 100k of Russia-bought political ads (not too much), and there&#39;s been a lot of wrangling over the amount of Russian bots on Twitter, with centrists reporting there&#39;s a lot more than Twitter self-reports.  Bots and online influence isn&#39;t that hard for a state actor, and Russia&#39;s used that tactic before against Ukraine and the Baltic states.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the story currently atop r/politics about the allegation that Russia hacked US voting machines, which is eminently possible, but comes from DHS which is not really a credible source.</p>

<p>Lastly there&#39;s an <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/01/29/581424557/alleged-link-between-nra-and-russia-becomes-fodder-for-the-left">allegation</a> that Russians funded 10s of millions of dollars of pro-Trump campaign work through the NRA - which is entirely possible with our non-existent campaign finance laws.  Haven&#39;t seen corroboration of this one, but thanks to that same lack of regulation I doubt proof would turn up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol this thread is brigaded</p>

<p>It&#39;s because the media is complicit. They&#39;re NEVER going to report on their own corruption and complicity. Every heard the phrase &quot;the revolution will not be televised&quot;? It&#39;s because the owners of the media only deliver you the propaganda that helps them, they&#39;ll never tell you the truth if it doesn&#39;t fit their corporations&#39; agenda. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can we stop fucking talking about Hillary. She&#39;s not president, senator, or secretary of state. Crooked? Almost certainly. Is that currently irrelevant? yea, no shit. </p>

<p>The focus is on Trump because&#39;s he IS our president and it&#39;s treason we&#39;re talking about, whether the allegations end up being true or not. Either way, there&#39;s not a sane person on this planet that would argue that Trump is a man of strong character. He called the people who don&#39;t clap for him &#39;un american&#39; and treasonous, he has his products manufactured overseas (america first, I thought?), and screwed countless small business out of the money his company owed for services performed simply because it was cheaper to screw them with over litigation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s relevant in this case because the information Trump is alleged to have committed treason to obtain is directly connected to her campaign. You can stop talking about her but then you are deliberately omitting something that may be relevant to the controversy. Also commenting in this thread about other people talking about a topic you are tired of is an invitation to discuss it at length. You don&#39;t have to talk about Hillary and no one asked you too, you can&#39;t expect others to feel the same way or see it as irrelevant simply because you do.</p>
