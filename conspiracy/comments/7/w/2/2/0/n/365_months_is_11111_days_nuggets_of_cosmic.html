        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This was an ELI5 post but they flagged it as &quot;current event&quot; and said it wasn&#39;t explainable. what a freakin cop out. </p>

<p>The mod even said </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot; What is your question? why 365 * daysinmonth = 11111? Did you want someone to explain remedial math to you?A pencil and paper might help you calculate it and verify it yourself.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I dont think ive ever been censored like that before.</p>

<p>Hello folks, i found out yesterday that 365 months is 11111 days.</p>

<p>Months are a year divided into 12 a year being the time taken for the earth to travel around the sun.</p>

<p>A day being a total spin of the earth on its axis.</p>

<p>The month is most closely connected with the moon but months don&#39;t quite match the Moons lunar cycle which is called a period. and also matches the menstrual cycle. (curious)</p>

<p>So Year is Sun: Month is Moon and Day is Earth in this relational organization. these 3 bodies dictate time.</p>

<p>Its hard to wrap my brain around how you can take 11111 and divide that by the average number of days in a month (30.44) and you get 365 which is the number of days in a year.</p>

<p>This coupled with the near perfection of eclipses. the fact the ratio between distances and size have to be so precise for the effect that we see happen this ratio is not perfect but it is off by about .25 percent, which gives us the corona of the eclipse. Size and Distance are both off by .25 percent. Another body exhibits this SAME ratio. Saturn&#39;s period around the sun is 29.5 years and the Moons period around the earth is about 29.53 days.</p>

<p>So Saturn is like the mini moon in relationship. also interesting because Saturn is Cronos/Father time. and this is all about time and movement.</p>

<p>So ELI5 what is really going on here?
 IE what are the mechanisms that allow for such an occurrence. </p>

<p>This is the full story if you want to know more. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes you hit the nail right on the head. this is about sync Thank you so much for this find. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So to get to 11111 you have to pick special starting dates</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I didn&#39;t realize that. it makes sense though. </p>

<p>Here is how i found this data point. </p>

<p>I had been writing about xfiles, Terry o quin (john Locke from lost) I found out his nickname was mister 1013 on IMDB. I remembered that 10-13 -1307 was the origin of Friday the thirteenth and The destruction of the Templars. I learned that King Philip made the order to arrest the templars but it wasn&#39;t until 11-22 (JFKs assasination and Thanksgiving this year) that a Papal Bull was issued.</p>

<p>This made 10-13 a prominent point. As Chris Knowles fellow Synchromystic KNOWS Chris Carter.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-X-Files-Behind-Myths-Movies/dp/1933784725">https://www.amazon.com/Complete-X-Files-Behind-Myths-Movies/dp/1933784725</a></p>

<p>He wrote a book on the Xfiles which Chris Carter wrote the Intro for. Chris Carters company that made xfiles is called Ten Thirteen because that is the Birthdate of Chris Carter!</p>

<p>which lead to this commercial</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUoD-gPDahw&amp;amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUoD-gPDahw&amp;amp;t=1s</a></p>

<p>My synchromystic mind sees the 1013 and says there is SOMETHING here. But what? The song is “The time of my life” which Debuted in the film Dirty dancing on 8-21-1987</p>

<p>I think “Thats close to my birthday” Then the next thing I do is check from The release of Dirty Dancing until this commercial aired. 8-21-1987_2-4-2018</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gematrinator.com/calculator/datecalculator.php">http://www.gematrinator.com/calculator/datecalculator.php</a></p>

<p>I first notice the count of 11125 days and say damn that&#39;s really close to 11111 days. So I find the difference and it is 14 days or 2 weeks.</p>

<p>That is when I notice the Month count says 365 months and 14 days Which means.........................................................365 months = 11111 days Just absorb that for a second.</p>

<p>Shortly before the 8-21-2017 eclipse that divided America I found out that from my birth 6-30-1987 until the eclipse was 11011. coupled with the time the eclipse ended was 4pm (my time of birth)</p>

<p>I took me about 30 minutes to notice but the date Dirty dancing was released was 8-21-1987 Exactly 30 years before the Eclipse where I was 11011 days old.</p>

<p>After finding all this out I went to bed and was lieing there on the threshold of sleep and POP in my mind goes “A Saturn return is around 30 years.” Astrologically a “Return&#39; is a return to the position in the sky that the object was on the date and time of birth. Saturn&#39;s 29.5 year Trek around the sun makes it so around 30 years old you will be experiencing energies that have taken as long as you have been alive to cycle back too.</p>

<p>So I went on the quest to locate when my Saturn Return landed for me. 12-30-2016 was this point for me. This was 29.5 years into my life. So like I usually do when I get a date I pop it into google to see what the news was for that day.</p>

<p>I did this last night and I googled 12-30-2016. I saw the page “ If I was born 12-30-2016 how old would I be today?” I clicked and I seriously thought it was a joke or that I had done something wrong but NOPE.</p>

<p>1y 1m 1w 1d....... 404 (my area code)days....... Said another way I found the date of my Saturn return exactly 1y 1m 1w 1d AFTER it occurred. 1111 found via the 11111 found via the 10-13 that made me look into dirty dancing....... Christ on a bike I know this sounds crazy and a lot of folks are going to gloss over it and call it cherry picking coincidental nonsense. This is just my life and Im curious as to why its like it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Base10 is a human construct. Numerology is basically seeing patterns in random data.</p>

<p>Obviously an exception is human directed events intended to follow numerological rules for their own reasons. </p>

<p>Anything outsider that tho and out number system is arbitrary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am human...... i have ten fingers..... i never got this argument as any HUMAN construct could only exist with the foundational mechanisms for that thing to exist. </p>

<p>from the temple mount of jeruselum too the kabba stone in Mecca is 66.66nm and that translate too 123.45 km! 123456666 it gets stuck on 6 like the number of man and keeps repeating.</p>

<p>But what&#39;s wilder is the higher factor iterations of this same phenomenon.</p>

<p>Between the great pyramid and the avenue of the dead in Mexico is 6666 nm and 12345 km</p>

<p>And 666.6 and 1234.5km between Silbury hill (the tallest ancient megalithic structure in the UK and the shard the tallest modern structure.</p>

<p>What this states to me is startling. If we are to write them off as coinincidence we need not think any further. With the factor between the 2 main abrahamic religions most sacred spots too the comparison of the 2 biggest megalithic pyramids on the 2 main continent systems is very powerful.</p>

<p>But then we have to think of this alignment is intentional the the Egyptians and Mexicans who built these pyramids not only knew of each other but had the ability to measure acurratly across incredible distances.</p>

<p>What&#39;s wilder is that nautical miles and km wererent used by them so for them to align so such a significant (to us not them) number sequence. </p>

<p>here is the post that goes into it more. Numerology is seeing patterns but the data here is not random. it requires a holistic view to comprehend that there is even a pattern to glean. </p>

<p>Its like there is a block in the human psyche that prevents people from acknowledging it. I am reminded of Westworld &quot;Doesnt look like anything to me&quot; and THEY LIVE!.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9rrgJXfLns">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9rrgJXfLns</a></p>

<p>The divide is the People that look deeper and the people who refuse to acknowledge a deeper. </p>

<p>The people that look deeper make the people that refuse to look deeper mad/triggered. Saying things like base 10 is a human construct. </p>

<p>Why do we look at a body of information and look for the things that we disagree with or can disprove or disregard. </p>

<p>In essence people look for reasons to not think. Once you start thinking and making the links and developing a sync vocabulary it becomes impossible to stop. Also the content presented usually makes people look like madmen. People dont want to be viewed in that way, people don&#39;t want to be the outliers, so when one is presented with data that makes the person delivering it look off thier rocker then the data will not be absorbed because of this social..... quirk..... </p>

<p>Society suppresses truth. Truth is unpopular. Its easier to fool a man than to convince him hes been fooled. Self censorship and an army of logicians with an arsenal of logical fallacies to throw out and pop those truth bubbles. &quot;Nothing to see here folks, Move along please&quot; </p>

<p>Sorry for the rant but the Great Divide is a big thing for me. </p>
