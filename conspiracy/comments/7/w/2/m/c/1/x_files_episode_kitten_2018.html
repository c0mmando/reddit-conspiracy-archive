       In the latest episode of XFILES they explain how a gas was developed and utilized in Vietnam. The gas was deployed in enemy territory and once the person inhaled it they would see 'monsters'. They would try and kill anybody around them. I imagine this was used to real life. Why wouldn't it be.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the show progresses the antagonist in the episode explains that the gas has been modified to control the thoughts of ordinary civilians via chemtrails.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the episode comes to a end they show the planes releasing this gas over farms and cities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would like to know what people think of this. Why are they showing this? The previous episode was about how the media is telling the truth but they tell it in a way that no body will take it seriously. Are they ironically doing the same in this episode

       I feel that there was a lot of truth in this episode. We already know that various types of chemicals were utilized during the Vietnam War as well as the CIA testing chemicals, such as LSD on people. What’s to say that testing/trials are still not taking place?

       They certainly could be. I would even go as far as they are by drug manufacturers. I do believe that there is a shadow government in place that controls much of what happens, which leaves our elected officials to deal with the outcomes, or not deal with them as is usually the case. I wouldn’t doubt that the shadow government does utilize chemicals in various ways on us.

       they spoke about the mk series and a few others tonight as well. op is a little off tho at the end they show a normal passanger plane and the trail in the middle they showed farm lands being gassed during the NAM backflash. X files is full of sweet nods towards conspriracies so this isnt any thing new of course lol its what it was about. 
The way they are doing this show is very intersting to say the least, they brought it back and have been dropping bread crumbs to what could be seen as modern day issues. 
I really enjoy where the shows going. might have a cue from the illuminati cards to have been put into produciton sure.

       I was suspicious when I saw an episode about a chameleon man, but I haven't watched many episodes. I think it's working against us but it has real info layered in between bullshit/disinfo. After all, it's short-lived spin-off show The Lone Gunmen predicted 9/11 six months before it happened.

       It's a show about conspiracy theories. They're purposely using the popular theories to write episodes about them.

       You can say it's some predicative programming or veiled truths but I think that just dehumanizes the people that work on the show.

       A worldwide network where government is a method of control of the ants (us), where networks are built, strengthened and solidified by mystery school initiation and inclusion in fraternal societies and orders of all types. Think of Octopus and Quantum in the 007 films. These people in "power" could also just be puppets, for various other entities that we really haven't reached an informed conclusion on (Extra Terrestrials, Inner Earth humanoids/hominids, Inter-Dimensional entities). If it sounds too far out there, it's really not.

       Oh the truth is stranger  then fiction. Thanks for the reply. I agree with it. The brotherhoods Or sisterhoods that stems back thousands of years seem to be the puppet masters. And beyond them I theorize is something not human.

       Batman Begins (2005), the league of shadows tries to destroy Gotham city by dispersing a fear toxin through the water supply that they later aerosolize to spread rapidly. The toxin created by a character called the Scarecrow caused people to see terrifying visions of monsters and exhibit uncontrollable rage and fear causing mass panic and destruction.

       This is a sub about conspiracies and conspiracy theories. We like to talk discuss topics like these because it is without a doubt that certain events (black ops , black projects, paranormal) happen without a clear explanation for it. We have no proof and you have no proof to say otherwise as well.

       It is fact that the government and shadow organizations conduct experiments on the human population. A couple reasons for this would be to acquire more control and knowledge. So why is it so far out there that the somebody wouldn’t come up with a way to influence the minds of people.

       Yes, but there is proof enough to at least investigate the premise. Look at the experiments done with LSD, with sleep deprivation, etc. there is already evidence that our government has experimented on people in an attempt to induce the very conditions being depicted of ie. “Seeing monsters” or as many have experienced and could attest to drug induced psychosis or psychosis induced by other means ie. sleep deprivation, light depreciation, extended isolation, food deprivation, etc and etc. There is evidence of these  experiments and tactics carried out by our own government in the US and in many governments and regimes through history.

       The screen writers who write these movies and shows are not living in a vacuum, and everything they write isn’t purely from the realm of imagination. It’s illogical to think that it is. No one in this thread thinks that the Batman is a literal person or that the depictions on screen are literal depictions of real events that occurred. Anyone who thinks that’s what we believe is pretty dense and illogical which is why someone like that would think “retarded” should be misused as an insult to hurl at strangers on the internet.

       Christopher Nolan is a very smart man. Many of his movies have things in them like this that are very well going on in real life or will potentially be in the future. From the wifi vision in Dark Knight, his take on different dimensions/black holes/time travel in Interstellar, his take on cloning in The Prestige, idea creation/manipulation in Inception, showing the unique power of the mind and how it can work in Memento, etc.... One of my favorite directors for sure

       I noticed that at the very beginning of the show, when they were guarding the box with the gas in it, "MK Naomi" was written on the side of the box.
      </p>
      <p>
       MK Naomi is what MK Ultra morphed into in the 60's/70's.

       The truth is often hidden in plain sight. Or, to quote the actual show, "The truth is out there."

       There's also Jacob's Ladder (with Tim Robbins) which centres around the same theme, albeit don't recall whether the movie even hints at what kind of weapon was used. A platoon of US marines turn against one another in the opening sequence and Tim Robbin's character, who suffers from amnesia tries to get to the bottom of things.

       C.C. is a hardcore conspiratorist. He thought last season was his last chance to spread the message to the masses and so he tried to pack as much info as he could into his episodes. Now that he has another season he can be a little more gentle about it.
