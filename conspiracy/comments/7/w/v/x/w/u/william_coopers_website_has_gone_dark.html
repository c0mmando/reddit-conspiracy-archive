He then began to discover how corrupt the gov was, researched the freemason history and saw how there are secret societies behind the scenes trying to start a &quot;New Age&quot; with a New World Order. He mailed out packets of his funding to preppie and press, out it all in a book, and had an underground radio show. He was killed by the FBI right after 9/11, having foretold. 3 months prior that the government was going to attack the country and blame Bin Laden.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>UPDATE: William Cooper&#39;s associate, Doyel Shamley, may have taken the site down because he believes free information sharing is a concept young people have bought into because of socialist conditioning.</p>

<p>YouTube user Mojo Kitty said this under a video posted discussing an incident where an account named Doyle Shamley asked the user to remove another one of their videos for copyright infringement. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuDArvQzw6s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuDArvQzw6s</a>)</p>

<p>&quot;Doyle wants to be compensated, and rightfully so, for his 30 plus years of work in the &quot;patriot&quot; movement. He believes that the free dissemination of his and others hard work is a result of the socialist brainwashing of more recent generations. File sharing etc. He&#39;s right and as far as I can tell he is still fighting the good fight. Be respectful.﻿&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>Somebody tell why is there hundreds upon hundreds of people on Cooper videos on YouTube commenting that he’s verified disinfo. It’s one thing to think David Icke is disinfo. But I know nothing about Will Cooper and was ready to begin listening to his lectures before I reminded myself how careful I need to be with putting a bunch of b.s into my brain. I mean that’s the plight of the modern day conspiracy theorist. It’s a challenge figuring out what could be more credible than the next batch of info being spewed to us. This era of information is so overwhelming. I guess my curiosity will get the best of me and I’ll watch some William Cooper lecture that’s at least 16 years old later and just think to myself “can this be relevant to today’s time?”. </p>
