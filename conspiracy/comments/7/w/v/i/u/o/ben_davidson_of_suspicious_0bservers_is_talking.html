       I've been following suspicious 0bservers for several years now and I always liked Ben's style of presentation and his theories. I wouldn't say it's conspiracy theories as such, but more fringe theories, on the periphery of what mainstream theories present to us.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I always told my like minded friends about him was he isn't a doomsday, scaremongering, clickbaiting guy (in my opinion). That's why his latest video has kinda caught me off guard. He is talking about a magnetic reversal of the north and south pole, coupled with a weakening of earths magnetic shield and to add to earth's troubles a solar minimum starting this century. It doesn't make for a positive prediction regarding the possible outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the first time I felt a sense of urgency from him. He's nowhere near Alex Jones "we're all goin to DIE!!!" type of hype. But, if like me, you are familiar with his previous presentation style you would see a definite shift in his style.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is this something that the TPTB are aware of? 
Will this be hidden from the masses til the point they can no longer hide it?
Should we genuinely all start to have some sort of plan prepped?

       Geomagnetic reversals are a widely known phenomenon among earth scientists, although it's controversial whether they correlate with mass extinction events in the rock record. Here's a
       <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X14001629">
        recent-ish (2014) study
       </a>
       that says they do because of oxygen escape.
      </p>
      <p>
       These reversals are very hard to predict though, since there doesn't seem to be a consistent period length between them. The reversals themselves may take thousands of years. And we haven't had one in human history to know just what signs to look out for. It's a tricky problem, but an interesting one.

       I am gradually moving to the position that this pole shift may account for a number of conspiracy trails.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell, nobody really knows exactly what happens on earth when the poles switch. It could be mild disruption, or it could be very, very difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
       If somehow TPTB knew much more about what is likely to happen during the pole reversal than we do, they might just put a lot of very risky, high stakes gambles into play. From their point of view, they would be saving the human species. From our point of view, they would be launching a sinister global coup d'etat.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, it's frankly hard to imagine exactly why we would experience the brazen concentration of wealth at the staggering rate we have recently seen, unless there were some strong reason for it that cannot be explained to the electorate. Getting 50 billionaires to build city-sized sanctuaries would be easier than asking millions of ordinary people to give up the money they are about to spend for bomb shelter supplies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, geo-engineering. We have been shoveling black budget money into perfecting the HAARP+Chemtrails atmospheric control matrix for decades. And this project must be multinational - otherwise each major country would spill the climate beans on their rivals just to stir things up - notice that does not happen. It's amazingly still secret-ish that we can effectively control the planet's atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, there is a whole lot of freaky MSM-control and Media-fear-mongering going on. It seems like they intend for the population to feel vaguely unstable and fearful all the time, but about a lot of things that are dubious at best: pandemics, global warming, terrorism, immigration, identity politics, and so on... Would that be a good strategy to prepare the masses for some kind of upheaval?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like a three-pronged plan of attack for an astronomic disaster scenario: concentrate wealth resources to stage major super-expensive defense plans (eg Musk); rapid development and testing of geo-defenses to build the capacity to fend off potential effects (radiation); near complete psychological manipulation techniques extending over all advanced (wired) countries, to minimize and steer the inevitable social upheavals.

       In late January Undark Magazine had a scaremongering article on an upcoming magnetic pole shift.  Through all the attention their article got, they made people very aware of older evidence and comments, mostly from 2014, about how the Earth's magnetic field is weakening, and how the decline is accelerating, and how even the European Space Agency and the USGS have said it looks like we are entering a magnetic reversal.  Ben's video is one of many that followed the spike in interest after Undark's article.  My own research suggests that magnetic pole shifts lead to geophysical pole shift catastrophes, and I'm working on a book that reviews evidence and suggests we are due for the next pole shift soon.
