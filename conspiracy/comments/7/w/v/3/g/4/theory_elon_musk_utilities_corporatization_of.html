They aren&#39;t even quality content. <a href="https://reddit.com/r/pics/comments/7wov41/elon_musks_priceless_reaction_to_the_successful/">Fucking look at this one</a> 
<a href="https://reddit.com/r/EmpireDidNothingWrong/comments/7wttj8/finally_someone_who_supports_our_mission_to_bring/">Or this one</a>
Does anyone else feel the same way? Does anyone think I&#39;m just paranoid? I think it goes beyond the usual reddit fanboying that has always been there, especially because these positive posts are across all subreddits, which i would assume have different personalities/preferences. Also, when was the last time you saw a negative Elon musk article on reddit as well? I hate that corporations and billionaires use the latent opinion and bias forming nature of reddit to make themselves look good or more immune to public scrutiny. What do you guys thinks?</p>

<p>NASA really launched Apollo 11-17 into l.e.o with a rocket. That&#39;s why &quot;we destroyed the technology&quot; to go to the moon. We never had it, and a request of forfeiture would reveal that they faked it all along. </p>

<p>Why would they fucking launch missles into the world trade center disguised as planes? Why do &#39;they&#39; do anything? To deceive you from what&#39;s really going on. Keep you in the dark. Also look what forum you&#39;re on</p>

<p>No but I bet the have more at their disposal than the 4mb computer that allegedly put man on the moon and talked to Nixon with no problem</p>

<p>Do you have evidence that any cut to black means its fake? </p>

<p>Do you never have an independent thought? Or is your whole argument based on the fact that you know I can&#39;t pull an NBC.com article out of my ass as a &#39;reputable source&#39; for you on how this shit is fake. </p>

<p>They passed the belts. There are no stars. Shit on the craft moves as if in the wind.</p>

<p>Are all pictures from space fake?</p>

<p>Well when you learn that the Hubble isn&#39;t actually taking pictures, its sending data to be construed by artists back at NASA that opens the door. When you learn that there has never been an un-doctored single frame pic of earth from space its more a question on they definitely lied about this, what else will they lie about.

<p>Control of your mind. I&#39;m just saying I &#39;think&#39; its bullshit. Yet you assert you &#39;know&#39; its real. That proves you not in control of your own thought process. How do you &quot;know&quot; it was real. You weren&#39;t on that car.</p>

<p>How do you slow down a missile weighing over 1 million kg going 21,000 km/hr to a halt on boat vertically from 7km distance? Nevermind making it land perfectly on a boat in the wobby ocean.</p>

<p>( This is their own telemetry reading on the screen when it lands.) You CANNOT slow down such a heavy object free falling from few km above or making stop slowly on a boat in the ocean. THINK for a second about it my friend. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Where do you get your figures on the weight and speed of the rocket? The falcon 9 weighs less than half that including all of the fuel - most of which it burns during the launch itself. Therefore the weight when it lands is much less than that. Second, the first stage (which is the one that lands) is not going nearly that speed as it comes in for a landing. If you bother to actually do some research, you&#39;ll see it&#39;s going under 7,000 km/hr at the point of separation, before turning around and beginning it&#39;s flight back to the landing zone. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>(This is their own telemetry reading on the screen when it lands.)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the telemetry of the <em>second</em> stage - the one that is still accelerating in space - Not the one that is landing. Honestly, do you even pay attention to what you&#39;re making nonsense claims about?</p>

<p>The bigger the lie...</p>

<p>It&#39;s important for the ruling elite to control the three key aspects of our reality.</p>

<p>The spirit (The Vatican), The monetary system (City of London), and politics (Washington DC).</p>

<p>This power structure enables them too manipulate the play at their own pace. </p>

<p>We all know the elite are blood-drinking Luciferians, but we haven&#39;t figured out the whole picture yet. And this space propaganda works as a tightly knit and compartmentalized psy-op, that muds the waters even further.</p>

<p>The earth is not an oblate spheroid, where space starts at altitude &quot;X&quot;, and the curvature is &quot;Y&quot;. </p>

<p>They can&#39;t land masons on the moon. Personally, I find all this space propaganda amusing. </p>

<p>There is a lot of smart and vibrant people scrolling through this sub, so I guess someone here will know what I&#39;m talking about. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wise words, I respect that opinion. Since you are already familiar of Admiral Byrd, pizzagate and cern, I guess you&#39;ve heard of &quot;Operation deep freeze&quot;, &quot;operation high jump&quot;, &quot;operation paperclip&quot;, and &quot;operation fishbowl&quot; too?</p>

<p>These are some of the military explorations of the Antarctica region, relating some of the topics we&#39;ve mentioned. Operation paperclip is the one everyone has heard about, but the others are not common knowledge.</p>

<p>If you believe in God, do you trust the Bible? This book claims we are living on a fixed earth, immovable under &quot;the firmament&quot;.</p>

<p>Wernher Von Braun, the nazi war criminal, NASA spearhead, also cites a Bible passage: psalm 19.1 or 19.2 on his tombstone.</p>

<p>Not my cup of tea the Bible necessarily, but geocentricity is not a new psy-op, Heliocentricity on the other hand... Invented by the illuminated masons, the pictures of isaac Newton gesticulating mason hand signs states the obvious. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also strange that the elite chose the azimuthal equidistant world map as its logo for The United Nations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in agreement with a lot of this but Flat Earth... Hollow Earth i can entertain because it doesn&#39;t contradict as much (just our theory of what&#39;s inside, itself derived from seismic propagation and our theory of gravity, which we don&#39;t really know how it works still... kind of weak when you think about it), but with Flat Earth my god absolutely everything goes out the window, and the small elegant solutions of the sphere model (why are the stars slightly different in Cairo than they are in Athena? how we first came to the conclusion the Earth was a sphere thousands of years ago... aka long before nasa) become an absolute nightmare in the Flat Earth model where you have to change the nature of the stars, of light, of everything really, and even then you&#39;re left with a very clunky framework that will contradict itself if you look closely. It&#39;s crazyness really, and i&#39;m a very open minded person (for example i strongly lean towards Apollo 11 being fake, which is still somewhat fringe in the conspiracy world)...  i looked at FE a 110% hoping to learn things, but aside from laughter and desolation, there was not much to learn (although the mental gymnastic it takes you through feels nice on the brain so not all was lost).</p>

<p>Its really nothing compared to what electricity generation and transportation emit. Plus many of the satellites are actually helping to save the planet, provide better communications and thus better efficiency, or even monitoring global ice/water levels or atmospheric CO2. </p>

<p>Add the fact that Tesla and solar city provide renewable energy at fairly standard or even cheap rates. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think things are a bit odd with Elon Musk along with everything else that&#39;s being pushed with aliens, UFO&#39;s (or AAT&#39;s according to Tom Delonge), and other outer space related subjects.</p>

<p>We are going through another societal change and world views are being engineered to have people more open to globalist view. Well, it&#39;s always been going through changes throughout the times, but right now it seems to be at a figurative and literal turning point that&#39;s impossible not to see.</p>

<p>Of course Elon Musk has PR teams and I&#39;m quite sure they are active on Reddit. I mean Elon Musk has dropped Reddit&#39;s name more than once as a favorable place on the internet, so it would only go to show that he knows the influence that Reddit has between the internet community and the world.</p>

<p>I for one have mixed feelings on NASA and SpaceX. Call me cynical but anything that seems important, gets a lot of attention, and seems to be unveiling truth on a wide global scale has to be taken with a grain of salt when I believe that an ulterior agenda is hiding in a cloak &quot;what&#39;s good for the people&quot;.</p>

<p>To conclude, I agree on your opinion on what&#39;s happening, but I think on one side it might be happening more organically where people just naturally want to post about their interests, they want karma, they want attention, and finding a topic that garners the most &quot;buzz&quot; is a good target to make posts.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll stop there for now, but always look for more than one side to a situation to better understand what you question. </p>

Started with Musky hooking up with that ...what&#39;s her face bitch...Amber Heard, right after her break up with Depp. Nobody knew who Musk was back then. That was his first publicity stunt. Then the next thing you knew - &quot;good guy Elon Musk&quot; (it&#39;s hilarious because he&#39;s the most repulsive looking sociopath I&#39;ve ever seen), &quot;Musk is a genius&quot;, &quot;Musk wants to save our planet&quot; on IMGUR and Reddit. Literally almost every day for about 2 years. 
 They&#39;ve done the same thing with those two moronic pseudo scientists - Nye and Degrasse Tyson.
 Using popular social resources to brainwash the young is a pretty logical thing to do. Young people don&#39;t watch TV, they like social media.

    <div class="md"><p>Nothing to do with him being ugly. I can tell a sociopath out of a crowd just by looking at him/her. When you grow up around sociopaths you learn to recognize patterns in their behavior, the way they talk and look (and the way your own body responds when you see them). I&#39;m actually surprised not everyone can. Once you see, you cannot unsee and you wonder how something that simple and obvious is a mystery to others. It&#39;s a crucial survival skill. Humans are essentially divided into two categories: predators and prey. Sociopaths are predators. Prey instinctually always knows what a predator looks like, but because unlike other animals humans have cognition, they dismiss their instincts in favor of intellectual constructs/social programming. &quot;This guy is a doctor, he is smiling, he is funny - seems like a nice guy&quot;. &quot;This guy is poor. He looks like a Muslim. Muslims are terrorists. This guy must be up to something, better call the cops&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What science? 
Making Li-Ion battery cars while loosing a bunch of money (hence nobody is doing it)? Making ginormous vacuum tubes that will never happen because it&#39;s not possible/economically viable (hence nobody did it before)? Making space rockets with reusable stages that are not economically viable (hence nobody did it before)? Making toy flamethrowers?</p>

<p>Which one of these science are you referring to?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t go so far as to call you paranoid, but I do think you&#39;re probably wrong about this one.</p>

<p>Space exploration is something that a very large portion of the human populace cares deeply about.  It&#39;s something that crosses cultural/political boundaries and brings people together.  There should be no surprise that these posts are appearing across all different kinds of subreddits.  People are <em>very</em> excited about the fact that we&#39;re probably going to see a human being walk on Mars within 10 years.</p>

<p>Think of it this way:  If it were NASA making these huge advancements in the field of space exploration, reddit would likely be having the same reaction.  It just happens to be a company/individual representing those advancements instead.  I don&#39;t really think he needs to leverage his power or wealth to get attention for this, because it&#39;s already very important to most of the public.</p>

<p>No but I bet the have more at their disposal than the 4mb computer that allegedly put man on the moon and talked to Nixon with no problem</p>

<p>Do you have evidence that any cut to black means its fake? </p>

<p>Do you never have an independent thought? Or is your whole argument based on the fact that you know I can&#39;t pull an NBC.com article out of my ass as a &#39;reputable source&#39; for you on how this shit is fake. </p>

<p>They passed the belts. There are no stars. Shit on the craft moves as if in the wind.</p>

<p>Are all pictures from space fake?</p>

<p>Well when you learn that the Hubble isn&#39;t actually taking pictures, its sending data to be construed by artists back at NASA that opens the door. When you learn that there has never been an un-doctored single frame pic of earth from space its more a question on they definitely lied about this, what else will they lie about.

<p>Control of your mind. I&#39;m just saying I &#39;think&#39; its bullshit. Yet you assert you &#39;know&#39; its real. That proves you not in control of your own thought process. How do you &quot;know&quot; it was real. You weren&#39;t on that car.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important for the ruling elite to control the three key aspects of our reality.</p>

<p>The spirit (The Vatican), The monetary system (City of London), and politics (Washington DC).</p>

<p>This power structure enables them too manipulate the play at their own pace. </p>

<p>We all know the elite are blood-drinking Luciferians, but we haven&#39;t figured out the whole picture yet. And this space propaganda works as a tightly knit and compartmentalized psy-op, that muds the waters even further.</p>
