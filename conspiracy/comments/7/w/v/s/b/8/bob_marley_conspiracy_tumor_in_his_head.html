        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">27</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/tauteur.html">tauteur</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My brother was singing this song the other day, I haven&#39;t been able to stop thinking about it - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl1o60Ep9gQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl1o60Ep9gQ</a>   Lyrics go - &quot;John Lennon was shot.  That&#39;s what happens with you talk.  Bob Marley is dead.  They put a tumor in his head.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been smelling this foul chemical odor that my ex black ops xi friend Eddie told me was gallons of bug spray poured into the hood of my car to kill me.  I&#39;ve been having these terrible head aches lately and have been doing all kinds of paranoid research, brain tumor symptoms, or post infectious chronic headache syndrome (I had an ear infection Jan 3rd that finally resolved a week or two ago) Thats when the headaches started, so I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s it - but I can&#39;t figure out the chemical smell in my car.</p>

<p>Why would someone want to kill me you might ask?  There are 2 reasons I&#39;m juggling:  </p>

<h1>1  Exposing Adrenochrome.  The release of my new movie &quot;Adrenochrome&quot; on amazon got Tom Sizemore all freaked out over the Adrenochrome conspiracy theory and how it taps into the elite illuminati&#39;s appetite for young children to satisfy their taste for bloodlust.</h1>

<h1>2  A conglomerate corporation; who is, in conspiracy theory world, responsible for the death of Michael Jackson and there is a public lawsuit to back that up.  They have publicly admitted to hiring 2 private investigators to track me down.  Article here:</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/coachella-asks-court-fast-track-filmchella-lawsuit-1032454">https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/coachella-asks-court-fast-track-filmchella-lawsuit-1032454</a></p>

<p>Now that I&#39;m not giving up the name I had trademarked and have since converted it into a distribution company, their legal bills have sent them over budget and it&#39;d be a lot more painless to ex me.</p>

<p>Which leads me to the question of my post...   What is the conspiracy behind the death of Bob Marley?  A quick google search with no clicks sent the headline CIA Killed Bob Marley at the top.</p>

<p>How did they kill him?  Can you really put a tumor into someone&#39;s head?  A google search on that lead to a &#39;NO&#39; - but there are people disputing that.  </p>

<p>/conspiracy is where I look to for answers.  I learn a lot from you guys.  A lot of people here call me stupid, a shill, and shameless self promoter; none of these things feel good to read, but harm me none the less.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m worried about, is my headaches...  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A quick search and I found:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bob Marley died of melanoma cancer in 1981. He was 36-years-old. The official report is he contracted cancer after injuring his toe which never healed while playing football in 1977. The conspiracy theorists allege that Marley was given a pair of boots with a piece of copper wire inside that was coated with a carcinogenic substance that pricked his big toe by Carl Colby, son of the late CIA director William Colby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>According to Dick Gregory: Marley had asked Gregory to open for his show at the University of Maryland for 40K. Gregory had agreed to open for Bob Marley&#39;s performance at the UofM but wouldn&#39;t accept any payment since Gregory disagreed with the premise of his track &#39;Buffalo Solider&#39;. Marley called Gregory from a hotel in Manhattan shortly after landing and left a call back number. Gregory returned several calls but never got through to Marley. Gregory claims that they flew him out of New York to Germany, under the guise of &quot;alternative treatment&quot;, where they had him killed. Essentially, Marley goes from having an &quot;infected foot&quot; to brain cancer and dying within 24 hours. Hmmmmm... Rather dramatic turn of events in a very short period of time. They blamed this on Marley&#39;s refusal to undergo amputation due to his Rastafarian religious belief in &quot;not cutting the flesh&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very nice reporting.  I&#39;m afraid to say that honestly I think these tactics are being used against me.  Not these in particular, but something involving a carcinogen being placed in my car.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess I&#39;m dissident. I start a film fedtival and file for a trademark next thing you know you&#39;re getting sued and people are tracking you down. The original Judge for the case who everyone says was righteous and fair winds up dead a week before the first hearing and the new Judge is slashing protocol. I hope its all in my mind, I really do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made up theat story, about 10 years ago.  It was more speculation that imagination.  In my version, it was something on the cletes of a soccer player Bob was playing against barefoot, and he stepped on bobs foot, mashing in the toxin.</p>

<p>One thing for certain, someone tried to kill Bob in 1976 by shooting in.  That&#39;s why the lyrics in Jammin say &quot;no bullet can stop us now&quot;</p>
