        Down is the New Up: Aleister Crowley, 'As above, so below,' and Evil in the World Today
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Introduction
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know Aleister Crowley was not only an occultist but a British secret agent as well? (Kaczynski, 2009, p. 10). A few years ago, I remember getting into a debate with my dad. I brought up Aleister Crowley, and my dad noted he was just an agent – nothing more. When I look into his work on occultism, though, he really believed what he said, and perhaps his role was to ensure these beliefs were spread, and they have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you have never heard of Crowley, he had a huge impact and influence, specifically on pop culture and pop music. Brett (2017) writes, “Crowley’s doctrine ‘Do What Thou Wilt’ started to ring true once more for a generation desperate for a new spiritual saviour. Along with the Beats, existentialism, and counterculture, an occult revival was imminent.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, “Pop messiahs of the age ushered in the return of the Beast. Crowley appears on Peter Blake’s cover of the Beatles’ Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band. A statue of him also appears on the cover of the Doors’ album, Doors 13. Mick Jagger was seen carrying occult books ahead of the Stones album His Satanic Majesties, that cradled one of their most anthemic songs; ‘Sympathy for the Devil’. Both Jagger and Marianne Faithful knew Kenneth Anger, the Avante-Garde filmmaker and Crowleyite. Jagger recorded the soundtrack to his film Invocation to my Demon Brother, while Marianne Faithful appeared in Lucifer Rising. ‘Hail Atlantis!’ intoned Donavan. Black magic became the new black magic in a back to the future return to old spiritual ideas. Crowley’s career revival was on and the comeback tour secured. His call for a new world order beyond the conventions of society couldn’t have been more suitable for the 60’s libertarian culture of sex, drugs and rock and roll.”
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, even if you have never heard of Crowley, his teachings are alive and well today, and they continue to be shared and emulated, not just through music, but our society in general.
Perhaps one of the most famous phrases you may here around here, especially in conspiracy forums, is “as above, so below.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “This phrase comes from the beginning of The Emerald Tablet and its explanation embraces the entire system of traditional and modern magic which was inscribed upon the tablet in cryptic wording by Hermes Trismegistus and his hermetism.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/a/as-above-so-below.html">
        https://www.themystica.com/mystica/articles/a/as-above-so-below.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowley joined the “Heremetic Order of the Golden Dawn”, “the most celebrated and influential late ninteenthcentury magical society” (Kaczynski, 2009, p. 10).
      </p>
      <p>
       The Emerald Tablet is the foundation of Hermeticism, and here is the “as above, so below” saying in Isaac Newton’s words (By the way, he was an alchemist deep into the occult, too!):
      </p>
      <p>
       “That which is below is like that which is above &amp; that which is above is like that which is below to do the miracles of one only thing.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Tablet">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerald_Tablet
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But what does this really mean? Why is it “bad?”
      </p>
      <p>
       In this post, I want to explore the true meaning of this famous expression, and how our world is shaped by it more than we may realize. Crowley did not become famous by ‘accident’, and these beliefs are more alive today than ever, because when examine the world today, it literally feels upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        As above, so below
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This phrase is really a phrase of unity of the “opposites.” Ultimately, this belief is about  balance and oneness. Manly P. Hall explains, "We are the gods of the atoms that make up ourselves, but we are also the atoms of the gods that make up the universe"; and Paracelsus says that man's spirit comes from the stars, his soul from the planets, his body from the elements. More recently Carl Sagan had said quite simply, “we're made of star stuff.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://gnosticwarrior.com/as-above-so-below.html">
        https://gnosticwarrior.com/as-above-so-below.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       No surprise that Aleister Crowley also said, “Every man and woman is a star” (Kaczynski, Appendix III, p. 117)
      </p>
      <p>
       What this phrase really means is that there is a balance of good and bad, light and dark, and the light and dark have an equal necessity. This belief system is prominent in many other belief systems, but today, I want to talk more about it is influence. However, if you are interested, I wrote a post about this here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ov9ei/ancient_occultism_disguised_as_human_progress_and/">
        https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ov9ei/ancient_occultism_disguised_as_human_progress_and/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why is this belief system “bad”? It sounds quite nice, doesn’t it? Whether you believe this as a new ager, an occultist, a Taoist, or a transhumanist, there is something that I feel people are missing.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question to ask you first, is have you experienced true, pure evil? I am not talking about something “bad” or “not good.” I am wondering, if you are reading this, if you have witnessed true evil in your life? Sure, maybe you hear stories on the news, but that is not what I am asking. I am asking, if you, yourself, have experienced true evil firsthand?
      </p>
      <p>
       Most reading this might have to confess “no”. They have not. Before I witnessed true, pure evil, I was an agnostic Buddhist. I definitely had “the as above, so below” belief system, and I thought everything in life balanced itself out. Well, that was until I fell into an abusive relationship where I was nearly killed. I am not writing this for pity or sympathy, really, I just want to explain that I did not understand evil until I experienced it firsthand:
      </p>
      <p>
       • He almost killed me several times through strangling, beating, and knocking me unconscious. One time, he took me into the middle of nowhere, where nobody could hear my screams, and he beat me with a broom until I nearly lost consciousness. When he did these things to me, it was almost as if something else took over his body. After the experiences, he would act as if nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       • He beat his mom up once right in front of me. He was never apologetic.
      </p>
      <p>
       • He tortured animals.
      </p>
      <p>
       • He was a severe alcoholic, and he had “two sides”, so the world mostly saw his good side, but I saw his true, honestly, demonic side.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could write about him all day long, and if you are interested, I could expand on how I got into the relationship in the first place (my therapist helped me see that), and why I stayed, and how I escaped.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point of me bringing this up is that I never really understood evil until I fell into that relationship. I was naïve, and that is probably one reason I dismissed so much – I seriously did not know evil like that existed. It was difficult for me to process and comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
       And, for you reading this, my story is not even one of the worst out there. I am sure there are many who experience and have experienced far worse on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, after I escaped the relationship, I started to question evil, and I no longer saw it as some type of necessity in oneness. I wanted to know why it existed, and I did not want to justify it. Evil should not be justified or explained away.
      </p>
      <p>
       And to me, that is what this “as above, so below” belief system does. It equates evil and good, and it treats evil as a necessity in this world. It promotes moral relativism, as if there is no true ‘good’ or ‘evil’, and that simply is not true. There is evil out there, some horrors many of us cannot even begin to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       This belief system of “as above, so below” predominates our society today. Everything is becoming justified because people do not really believe that good and bad exist anymore. Most of us know about Aleister Crowley’s “do what thou wilt” phrase, which essentially means, do what you want, as long as it makes you happy. You can read more about “thelema” here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when I look at the world, it literally appears to be upside down, and I believe this is a direct result of people embracing this “as above, so below” mentality. I want to point to a few examples in American society.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        We are Gods now.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Aleister Crowley said, “There is no God but man”. (Kaczynski, Appendix III, p. 117) This falls into the we are all one/we are all Gods belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jason Silva, an “Emmy-nominated and world renown TV personality, storyteller, filmmaker, and sought-after keynote speaker and futurist” illustrates his beliefs at a “dangerous ideas” conferences entitled, “We are the Gods now”:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2VrefjIjk">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF2VrefjIjk
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly recommend watching the entire thing. His beliefs are really just occult beliefs disguised/translated into modern, futuristic language. He is saying the same thing that Crowley said, just in a more engaging way that is relevant to modern audiences. Again, I challenge you to watch it before you argue me on this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, again, what is “bad” about this concept that we are Gods? Whether or not God exists in up to you on your spiritual journey, but here are a few reasons that this concept has a negative impact on our society:
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, it is easier than ever to literally feel like a God, especially on a social media platform with an audience that worships you. Social media has a direct link to narcissism:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201211/is-social-media-blame-the-rise-in-narcissism">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/compassion-matters/201211/is-social-media-blame-the-rise-in-narcissism
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a world full of people obsessed with themselves, can anything really get better? Can anything really change? I’ll never forget the disturbing video of teens recording a man drowning instead of helping him:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/07/20/oh-he-just-died-disturbing-video-shows-teens-mocking-drowning-man/">
        https://nypost.com/2017/07/20/oh-he-just-died-disturbing-video-shows-teens-mocking-drowning-man/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At that moment, I suppose, they literally ‘played’ God.
      </p>
      <p>
       This “We are Gods” mentality promotes selfishness and morallessness. Even if one does not believe in God, claiming to be a God is at the peak of narcissism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, though, what if there really is a God?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Inversion of the Adult/Child
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       More parents today than ever have difficulty disciplining their children:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1251426/Modern-parents-avoid-discipline-fear-upsetting-children.html">
        http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1251426/Modern-parents-avoid-discipline-fear-upsetting-children.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do not trust the Daily Mail, I can offer some of my experiences as a teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, children are taking on more “adult” qualities and increasingly making adult decisions before they even really have the capability to understand what is going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       • Child Pageants: Why are children even allowed to dress like this? I have no words, really:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ranker.com/list/most-scandalous-toddlers-and-tiaras-outfits/fashionbaby">
        https://www.ranker.com/list/most-scandalous-toddlers-and-tiaras-outfits/fashionbaby
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       • Children are losing their childhoods: I am witnessing this daily as a teacher. Children do not have time to be kids anymore, and this is a direct result of technology. Children are overexposed and under-prepared for sexual content online, for example:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/real-healing/201208/overexposed-and-under-prepared-the-effects-early-exposure-sexual-content">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/real-healing/201208/overexposed-and-under-prepared-the-effects-early-exposure-sexual-content
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a snapchat video on one of the stories they post for millions to see, and somebody filmed their younger sister (5 years old) watching gay porn. He laughed about it, and millions of people viewed this, probably laughing, too. The girl was horrified, but did anybody ask, is there something seriously wrong with this girl having access to gay porn in 5 years old?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are kids growing up too fast? Dvorak writes, “Scientists are studying why we are seeing alarming numbers of 7-year-old girls and 8-year-old boys hitting puberty (they still don’t know, but some blame chemicals in food and personal products.)”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/are-kids-growing-up-too-fast/2011/11/14/gIQA36lKMN_story.html?utm_term=.c8e806ce4646">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time, we live in a world where is it not even shocking to hear that a man left his family to become a little girl:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3356084/I-ve-gone-child-Husband-father-seven-52-leaves-wife-kids-live-transgender-SIX-YEAR-OLD-girl-named-Stefonknee.html">
        http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3356084/I-ve-gone-child-Husband-father-seven-52-leaves-wife-kids-live-transgender-SIX-YEAR-OLD-girl-named-Stefonknee.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Adults are having difficult raising children because many are like children themselves. At the same time, children are being treated as little adults who are wise enough to make their own decisions and be exposed to anything and everything online.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Less is More?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This one honestly makes me laugh, in a saddened way. Want to fight climate change? Stop having children:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/jul/12/want-to-fight-climate-change-have-fewer-children">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, this is some sick kind of twisting of reality. Big corporations who are destroying the environment are somehow convincing the average joe that they are responsible for all of the problems and should probably stop having kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       And while the cost of living gets higher, people are living in more extreme situations like tiny houses. By the way, tiny house regret is growing:

       Look, if you have the choice to live in a tiny house and want to, that is on you, but most people who are “choosing” these tiny houses do not really have the choice. Maybe I am crazy, but I feel that families should have the right to adequate living spaces for reasonable prices. Look at our overworked America, and Mother Jones says some of these charts will make your blood boil:

       Finally, one of the creepiest things I have seen is the celebrity promotion of eating bugs. You can watch Nicole Kidman eating a four course meal of bugs here:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UqLAtdZ04">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3UqLAtdZ04
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever your views on eating bugs, there is something really off about this to me.  I am not sure what agenda they are working here, but it seems to be that we can be “more sustainable” by eating bugs, living in tiny houses as small as jail cells, and having less kids, and working more and more in our future prison cities where everybody will be happy! 😊
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you think I am being overly-dramatic here, but just watch that four course bug video before you decide.

       <strong>
        All Work, No Play
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The US is the most overworked nation in the world:
      </p>

        https://20somethingfinance.com/american-hours-worked-productivity-vacation/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet, we are told that if we just work hard enough and long enough, it will all be worth it. What is sad is that all this work does not really make us happier:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if it does make us happier in some ways, we just do not have time for it. Time poverty is a real problem:

       Something seems twisted about all of this, doesn’t it?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Food and Water
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This really could be an entirely different post and many have written about the conspiracies surrounding food here. The point is we now live in a world where we cannot even trust the food we eat. Gender-bending chemicals in food are found to feminize boys:
      </p>

      <p>
       And then we live in a world where we cannot even trust our drinking water. Does anybody remember the Flint Water Crisis? I predict many more events like this in the near future:

       And, yet, water bottle companies have monopolies on fresh water sources:

       What is he preparing for?
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that something is off when even the most basic necessities for life are completely out of our control. We cannot trust the food or water we drink, and water shortages are a real concern now. The elite families may not have to worry, but we do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Somehow ‘they’ twisted what is natural and turned it into something else…
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Gender Bending
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This will be my last section, but I probably could do this all day long. Before I get attacked, I really do not care what people identify as or what goes on sexually in their own private homes (as long as it does not hurt anyone). What I do care about is the propagation of these gender issues to children.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are just some things that children do not have the capacity to understand at young ages. Yet, gender identity is being taught to children as young as kindergarten:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.fpiw.org/blog/2016/06/02/washington-schools-to-teach-gender-identity-curriculum-in-kindergarten/">
        https://www.fpiw.org/blog/2016/06/02/washington-schools-to-teach-gender-identity-curriculum-in-kindergarten/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, this goes back to the adult/child thing. We are trusting children with too much, even trusting them to make decisions about their gender that could have permanent lifetime consequences at younger and younger ages:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2015/12/07/boy-6-becomes-britains-youngest-transgender-child-after-mum-found-him-trying-to-cut-off-his-willy-5549667/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, I always look to pop culture for agendas, and I have to say this Pink video was loud and clear:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBt_88nxG4c">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBt_88nxG4c
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       It is entitled, “Beautiful Trauma” which feeds on that ‘as above, so below’ concept. As somebody who has experienced pure trauma in my life, I see nothing beautiful about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I could probably write an entire post on just this one subject (and I have many times), but the point is there seems to be a flipping and twisting of things, and scariest of all, our children are being taught this all without the capacity to truly examine it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is where I get upset. If you want teens and adults to discuss these topics in schools, ok, but kids are just so impressionable. Something just does not feel right about it. More teens, by the way, are identifying as transgender:

       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the world feels upside down, and I feel like many are asleep. The problem is that I do not think people realize the influence of the occult beliefs of those like Crowley, and how they infiltrated pop culture, and then the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going back to the beginning of this post, Crowley had a profound influence on musicians like the Beatles and even David Bowie:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Bowie made no secret of his enthralment with the dark priest that was Crowley throughout his career frequently discussing the subject in interviews. As early as 1971 his occult adoration made its way into his songs, famously in ‘Quicksand’ from Hunky Dory:
I’m closer to the Golden Dawn Immersed in Crowley’s uniform of imagery. But what is beyond?”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://louderthanwar.com/aleister-crowley-influence-on-popular-music/">
        http://louderthanwar.com/aleister-crowley-influence-on-popular-music/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel these belief systems have infiltrated pop culture, which is a tool to brainwash the masses. Many, today, buy into the new age occultism of “We are all Gods” and “good and bad can coexist.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell that to the kids who have to eat mud cookies:

      </p>
      <p>
       Or the children killed by US forces (where is the outcry?):

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Or the children trafficked in sex rings:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.syracuse.com/us-news/index.ssf/2017/10/fbi_child_sex_trafficking_ring_arrests.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, it is easy to ignore the evil of the world, but it exists, no matter how it is twisted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Book Sources:
      </p>
      <p>
       I basically read a bunch of Alesiter Crowley books the past few days, so that I could write this post properly:
      </p>
      <p>
       *Aleister Crowley by Richard Kaczynski
      </p>
      <p>
       *The Book of the Law by Aleister Crowley
      </p>
      <p>
       *Magick by Aleister Crowley
      </p>
      <p>
       *The Book of Lies by Aleister Crowley
      </p>
      <p>
       *Modern Alchemy: Occultism and the Emergence of Atomic Theory by Mark S. Morrisson
      </p>

       "On November 3rd 2016, WikiLeaks released Part 28 in their series, which included an email thread between John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, and his brother Tony, an influential Democratic lobbyist. In this email, Tony asks his brother if he is able to attend a “Spirit Cooking dinner.” He says the artist hosting the dinner, Marina Abramovic, “wants [him] there,” and in a previous email in the thread shows the artist herself requesting John’s presence at her New York City home.

       These people can see these things and more for themselves, yet it still wont get through to them. The mass media "fake news" propaganda and spin campaign that started shortly after all this was discovered was too successful. I remember seeing it in real time too. A Yuri Bezmenov quote about ideological subversion is relevant here:
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't get through to them. They are contaminated. They are programmed to think and react to certain stimuli in a certain pattern [alluding to Pavlov]. You cannot change their mind even if you expose them to authentic information. Even if you prove that white is white and black is black, you still can not change the basic perception and the logic of behavior.

       Not an argument. Also false, I made a whole post with links describing the evidence.

       Sounds like you meant to say they aren't direct evidence. Because having inappropriate pictures of children on your social media account is absolutely, 100% admissible circumstantial evidence in a pedophilia case. Circumstantial evidence
       <a href="https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/circumstantial+evidence">
        is still evidence
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Circumstantial Evidence is also known as indirect evidence. It is distinguished from direct evidence, which, if believed, proves the existence of a particular fact without any inference or presumption required. Circumstantial evidence relates to a series of facts other than the particular fact sought to be proved. The party offering circumstantial evidence argues that this series of facts, by reason and experience, is so closely associated with the fact to be proved that the fact to be proved may be inferred simply from the existence of the circumstantial evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The following examples illustrate the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence: If John testifies that he saw Tom raise a gun and fire it at Ann and that Ann then fell to the ground, John's testimony is direct evidence that Tom shot Ann. If the jury believes John's testimony, then it must conclude that Tom did in fact shoot Ann. If, however, John testifies that he saw Tom and Ann go into another room and that he heard Tom say to Ann that he was going to shoot her, heard a shot, and saw Tom leave the room with a smoking gun, then John's testimony is circumstantial evidence from which it can be inferred that Tom shot Ann. The jury must determine whether John's testimony is credible."

        I'd be all for investigating human trafficking if it actually involved leads, not conjecture.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You also don't know what leads are. Leads can absolutely be based on conjecture, and they can be based purely on circumstantial evidence as well. Stop talking out of your ass and pretending that people having pedophile symbols on their businesses, using obvious code in their e-mails, and making disgusting jokes about tying children up and selling them is not evidence that they are perverts.

       You didn't say "pedophilia," you said "Pizzagate." I say pizzagate is a stupid partisan theory and you call me a "pedophile apologist." That's quite the escalation.
      </p>
      <p>
       While pedophilia is a worldwide problem that knows no partisan, racial, or geographic bounds, you guys have lowered the reasonable threshold for evidence so far you're seeing pedophiles and "pedophile apologists"
       <em>
        everywhere.
       </em>
       Seems less like you actually want to solve the problem and more like you just want the attention you get from "discovering" a secret pedo ring. Like SJWs go out of their way to call everything racism or sexism, you go out of yours to label people pedophiles.

       People like you getting away with your fake news distraction plan. The pizzagater who killed his parents " because they disagreed with him"? Nah, he killed them because they found out you guys are trying to deflect investigations away from the real pedophiles like you. Why else would you still be pushing such utter bullshit. You get laughed off conspiracy by flat earthers creep. No one is stupid enough to believe this shit story, you are trying to deflect investigations away from you.

       Just a couple of things. First, you put a lot of time into this and that is clear. However, there are a couple of things that can be discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may not be that some of these things are more prevalent. It may be that these things are more accessible and attainable to people not looking for them. People had to work harder and be more secretive about things they enjoyed in times past. It is just now easier to expose and discover these things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eating bugs is actually much healthier than eating beef. It just has a PR problem. I think that these celebs. Just heard about this and wanted to be on board early. Plus it gives them the attention they crave. Baby g eating is also better for the environment. More third world developing countries want to eat potent protein sources and our planet might not be able to sustain it. Bugs would help this.
      </p>
      <p>
       These don’t poke many holes in your argument (may even help it). I am not convinced a government is talented enough to pull off this level of conspiracy. I think that humans are just getting smarter and more sophisticated. What are they going to do with their sophistication? Exactly what they want to do.

       Hey thanks for reading!

       I watched a documentary on the benefit of eating bugs. I am not sure what to think, but found it odd that some of the richest people in the world are now promoting it!

       Same phylum. Some do think that we should change to bugs as main source! This is mostly people who are most fearful of global climate change. They would use up less water, food, land, and energy. Health nuts are also behind this.

       Sorry to hear about the terrible relationship btw. I have not met evil, but every year I get more and more convinced it exists. (Sword and Scale Podcast convinces me).  However, I don’t think it’s more prevalent. Just easier to find out about it.

       One thing a lot of the people who are caught in these relationships have is a great amount of empathy. Unfortunately, that is not something these predators have the ability to feel, but they sense it as a flaw they can exploit. Awful. It does relate to your Crowley belief system.

       My wife and I travel a lot around  Asia and I have eaten every bug that I have found on offer from tarantula to scorpions. They don't taste bad at all they look gross and I only do it to freak my wife out. Eventually she tried scorpion though and thought they were ok. In saying this I would rather eat meat than bugs. Most of them i have only eaten once except for scorpion I've eaten quite a few they kind of remind me of nuts in flavour. Water bug was my least favourite.

       It never hurts to try anything once within reason. Ive eaten a lot of other weird things in Asia and the US. 
A good beginner insect would probably be crickets they are really nut like as well as not being to big they are just like crispy fried prawns.
The first insect I ate was in Vietnam it was at a restaurant and it was quite large maybe about 5 or six inches long. It was really good so I had a second one. 
The rest of the insects I've eaten were from street stalls in Thailand and Cambodia. I dont really recommend the tarantula it doesn't taste bad they are just to big and the texture when you eat the large rear part is kind of disturbing. 
My wife eventually ate scorpion in Thailand when we were drunk  but they were only about an inch long and were kind of like eating crickets.

       Awesome info! It saddens me to see the world in this state. To see these things passed off as progress, evolution, or at worst, imo, acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowley's "whole of the law" seems to be a lazy and self centered view which embraces a false sense of self acceptance. Like the transgender argument. While I do believe in the idea of some people being "twin souls", SRS is not self acceptance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Popularizing transgenderism, under the guise of self acceptance, while not exploring the potential of a person being perfect as they were created is myopic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often wonder if all our "progress" is just a distraction from acceptance and self control. We put forth so much effort to control and change our environment while we grow more hedonistic as a culture every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our music was once a reflection of our souls entwinement with the divine, but seems to have become just another tool to popularize bad decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern pop love songs are most often about lust, and when they are about love, it's a very distorted version.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, Romeo and Juliet wasn't really a love story, so maybe it's just always been the popular mindset?
Idk, sorry to ramble.

       I'm aware of this. My understanding is that it is supposed to be about being true to yourself. To do what you want, so long as it respects and doesn't inhibit the rights of others.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it seems impossible to have zero effect on your surroundings. 
Especially when you're talking about practicing magick. People seeking power are not looking for equal respect, they are seeking a leg up.

       The thing that always proves to me that something is going on is the rage it incites in people to bring these things up, and how much even noticing these things is mocked and ridiculed. Think it's wrong for kids to get hormone blockers, you're a transphobe who thinks trans people should die. Talk about occult imagery in music videos? You're an idiot. Bring up the occult and "Satanic practices" that are a common theme in pedophile rings? You're a paranoid religious nut. Yet at the same time, there's this weird sympathy for Satanists that seems to be spreading like wildfire.
      </p>
      <p>
       And how much even typing out even a bible verse triggers people. I've used bible verses in threads about myths about certain Gods and topics like that, because obviously they fit. And it's strange to see some of the responses I get. Yet there's this new narrative that "Satanists are good people!" Yet the Church of Satan literally has its own bible and "religious practices" and the Luciferian temple started out originally worshipping Satan before it pretended to be some philosophy, and it's registered as a religion and is tax exempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question to me always is why is the idea of God so reviled, yet if Satan is your God, you're a totally cool person? This isn't by accident. And it astounds me how blind people seem to be to how everything is being turned upside down.

       Well said.

       I spend hours writing this stuff, and I know quantity does not mean quality but clearly I at least back up what I say with research!

       Comments I get:

      <p>
       1) Alesiter Crowley was not a Satanist!
2) You mispelleed this word
3) You are Christian; therefore stupid.

      <p>
       Like I would at least appreciate a well-thought out rebuttal. Then I get passive agressive rude comments, and I reply similarly, and these people act shocked!

       I don’t think you will get a well reasoned rebuttal, because there really isn’t one to be made. I guess one could argue Satan is better than God for reasons, XYZ, but you can’t really argue that what your saying is untrue. It’s all true and it’s very scary. Humans have given way to these influences without giving a second thought about it.

       Unfortunately this is just the beginning of the end. Hate for us will blossom as things on Earth continue to get worse, and we are left unharmed, for some of it anyway, having been sealed in our minds (foreheads) as spoken of in Revelation. Eventually though the beast must overcome the saints on Earth and rule for a short time, luckily, though they may kill us, we get to skip the horror which is God's wrath:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then he said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. 11 There will be great earthquakes, and in various places famines and pestilences. And there will be terrors and great signs from heaven. 12
        <em>
         But before all this they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake.
        </em>
        13 This will be your opportunity to bear witness. 14
Settle it therefore in your minds not to meditate beforehand how to answer, 15 for I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which none of your adversaries will be able to withstand or contradict. 16 You will be delivered up even by parents and brothers and relatives and friends,
        <em>
         and some of you they will put to death.
        </em>
        17
        <strong>
         You will be hated by all for my name's sake. 18 But not a hair of your head will perish. 19 By your endurance you will gain your lives.
        </strong>

       So much this. And it's all based on the ignorant idea that at some point, someone was a bad man and used "Christianity" as an excuse, so therefore the entire religion is wrong and God doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       People have an easy time arguing against "The Bible" because they don't understand it, or read it once when they were 12 and decided they have it all figured out.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you start talking about the values that Jesus taught - forgiveness, humbleness, being a servant to others, love, compassion, kindness... Well, how can anyone argue against these values? You can't. Because it's how we're supposed to live. You might be able to argue that the "Bible" doesn't teach these values. But it does, through Jesus.

       Happens literally every time I post about hidden symbols on corporate logos. People won't believe it unless it's absolutely undeniable, and then they'll usually brush it off as unimportant.

      <p>
       "Think about where you encounter logos on an average day: they are on household items, on cars, on clothes, in tv ads, on billboards, on insignas, all over sporting events and even on this very page (sorry). Logos are one of the results of extensive studies (funded by the Rockefeller’s  “Chicago School”) in cognitive sciences, neuropsychology and biology. Those studies constitute the core of  “marketing”, a heavily funded field which keeps its findings totally secret from the general public. Why are the findings secret? Well, if you knew why marketing worked on you, you wouldn’t fall for it anymore."

       Music "Stars" often put Illuminati shit in their videos, but I don't think it's pledging an allegiance to them, it's just something for people to Tweet, FB, talk about on forums and shit. It's just another way to get their music into more people's heads (and therefore wallets).

       "What they mean" will change from year to year and even person to person. Symbols don't have some kind of innate constant meaning like a hydrogen atom always has one proton, the meaning of a symbol is entirely what people give it.

       I'm sure you have researched a lot, and you had to go through some really rough things, but that is simply not "true evil", by your description it sounds like a bipolar disorder or him simply being a psychopath. Maybe all of this has helped you cope, but there doesn't have to be a meaning behind this.

       Look into how deep religion cuts in the world, all the "evil" things they have done over the years, all the suffering the have caused and hidden; They say "the truth will make you free", but will you be able to accept it, after all the good going from agnosticism  to christianity has done to you?

       How could you even conclude that? Even if mentally unstable, he knew exactly what he was doing. So let us say he had bipolar - that does not justify what he did.

       With that being said, he was diagnosed with no mental illnesses. My mom is mentally ill but she still has awareness and it does not excuse all her actions.

       If your talking about Catholics...they are the opposite of Christianity...they are who hid the Bible and murdered real christians, they caused wars they perverted what God taught. God said in his word that the truth of the Bible would remain, and though people may have tried to distort it the King James Version still stands as the closet to it, you know the one he got burned at the stake for by the Catholic Church.

       Well, for starters it was influenced heavily by contemporary writers. He was not burned lol he died of illness. But you have to consider that even that version was a translation, of translated texts, which is my point all along, not only it was written by humans, it was rewritten time and again.

       Thank you for coherently writing your initial post, in a way that didn't make my eyes cross. I can't promise that I'll do the same :)
      </p>
      <p>
       I gleaned many things from it, and I found to be a great read, but I do have an issue with your definition of evil, and I have a further problem with your assertion that people are justifying "evil".  My experience in this reality has lead me to different conclusions about this kind of thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Good" and "Evil" are simple ways to categorize human behavior, and I think that the concept of "Good vs. Evil" is archaic.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was really cruising through the post, having a good time, until I got to the section where you descrive the Evil that was perpetrated on you, and I came to a screeching halt.  It seems like you may be looking for meaning where there is none.   I don't say this to belittle it, and I feel genuine empathy for you and what you say that you went through.   (Additionally, every living person on this planet spends everyday looking for meaning, meaning you aren't different.
It's part of being Us.)  It's horrible.  Its terrible.  You suffered physically, and may still be suffering mentally.  A person who could do that to another person is a BAD fucking person.   Evil, at least to me, has anthropomorphic connotations-- Wouldn't there have to be an Evil Cosmic Force who was capable of "infecting" people with Evil?   Isn't that a little like Scientology, or any other Abrahamic Religion?  It just doesn't make sense to me, and I fear that it won't.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I am not a Christian-Bashing Athiest person.  I believe strongly that as long as you aren't causing harm to anybody, you should be able to live as you see fit.  We all have ways of navigating life, and I wish you the best.   I secretly want there to be a "God", but my version of "Him" looks more like a tangle of vibrations, or fractal explosions.  I've done mushrooms too many times to not want there to be something bigger.  There is something bigger though;  It's called the Universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope I'm not coming across like a dick, and I want to make clear that I love this subreddit, and have read it often.  It's entertaining, and it makes me think often.  I'm diving into this discussion because you seem mostly reasonable, and willing to talk about it.   I can only thinly promise you that I'm not a child-sucking Luciferian.  Just a slightly-stoned regular dude.  Sorry, I did get rambly in a few spots there.
      </p>

       Keep on looking for the truth-

       Well there lies in the problem. How can man define good and evil if there is no objective outside source for that?
      </p>
      <p>
       That would be God.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in the context of what is right and wrong in God's eyes, I would call his actions absolutely evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really find it interesting I have to argue this point, and I mean that in a respectful way.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it is more a sign that people are so far removed from what is "good" and "bad" due to the prominence of moral relativism.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact that really is the thesis of my post and many others I write. I do not believe in moral relativism, and though good and bad depends on context, there is true bad and true good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think true evil exists?

       I don't believe in "Evil" under your definition, nor your God-- just based off of the context of your posts-- which is totally fine!
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not going to try to convince you, because thats where the problem lies in discourse these days... i can only understand your position and apply it to my own philosophies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to believe in "relativism", as you put it, because I take things on a case by case basis, and have a very fluid understanding of morality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coralling all of humanity into "True Good" and "True Evil" doesn't do it for me.   People do bad stuff.  Other people do REALLY bad stuff.   Evil?  Maybe thats too scary for me to conceive of, or maybe I just think it belongs in fiction stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of that, however, negates the importance of continuing to examine and talk about these concepts, because when nothing is important, EVERYTHING IS.

       So I am asking you this serioisly because you did not really answer it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there objective evil in this world?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if a person willingly rapes a child, could anybody (of a sane mind) argue that is not pure evil?

       I'm sane, and I could call it "Evil", because "Evil" is a word for bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I'm to take your definition of "Evil" as something that exists in a world made by your "God", (To be clear, these quotation marks are not meant to be diminutive) then no, I wouldn't call it "Evil", because that seems not of a "sane" mind to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept of an eternity of bad guys versus good guys seems like it was made up a long time ago by men, who didn't have any other data to weigh it against.  Good versus Evil to me, is the equivalent of "God" playing with action figures, or writing a book, or making a movie--All very Human things to do.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person who willingly rapes a child was probably raped themselves.  THIS DOESN'T VALIDATE THE ACTION.  It helps us understand how human psychology works, in this case, in a really bad way.   Examining human behavior in many different ways allows us to understand it better, and perhaps take real steps to "fix" the problem-- Which, according to Christians, is exactly what they want.  The End of All Evil.  Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, for the third time, I will try to answer your question in the way that you want me to :)   No, I do not believe in Objective Evil, as you describe it.  Emperor Palpatine is Evil.  The Witch Maleficent is Evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       A Child Rapist is a Child Rapist, but may not have been born that way.

       Ok, even without God, let us try this one:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) A guy who was raised well with generally good life experiences (and was not raped himself) willingly rapes a child.

       Stuff like that does happen.

       Again, with all due respect--This seems straw-mannish to me, and I'm not even sure if I can respond to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're still trying to convince me of your point-- I get your point, but I don't agree with it.  Its totally cool, I'm not upset about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that you've put Evil and Wrong on the same level, yes, of course it's wrong to rape a child.  Of course it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can we look at why, though, rather than just saying "EVIL!  See?  EVIL is real, and it's creeping!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It's Wrong to me because:
      </p>
      <p>
       1:) Kid can't consent.
2:) It causes mental and physical harm to the kid, assumedly.
3:) I'm not into kiddy-diddling, and was almost a victim myself.  Yes, that sounds crappy to say--But please take my word for it.  That's another post.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's where it stops.   It was wrong of this imaginary person to have unwilling sex with the imaginary child.  I just won't take it so far as to say that there is a "Force" in the universe that compelled him to do that, beyond some crossed neurons in his Brain.

       I feel you are afraid to break the paradigm in your mind that you created about good and evil. You are very concerned about the word used. To me bad, evil, wrong - whatever.

      <p>
       The point I am making is that even those who support this oneness/occult belief system admit that there is some objective bad out there.

       If they are a psychopath or some other thing, they have effectively "broken" minds. That doesn't make it right and it absolutely does not excuse any punishment for any deeds committed. But its not "evil" in the abstract sense I think you are going for.

      <p>
       Wiccans practice witchcraft. they are not "Satanists", they are pagans.
      </p>
      <p>
       So am I asking what makes someone a Satanist to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is someone that doesn't believe in your version of Christianity a Satanist? Are all pagan belief systems satanist?
      </p>
      <p>
       How do Buddhists and Hindus fit into your beliefs relating to Satanism?

       That's another post that to me seems all over the place. You are attributing a lot of difference things to "Satan" that have nothing to do with a fictional character invented by Christians.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        2) Satan represents kindness to those who deserve it instead of love wasted on ingrates!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       taking aside your charged language of ingrates, this really represents evolutionary biology. Its a natural human impulse to take care of your genetic cluster and look at out-groups different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Typically this is seen as an evolutionary factor not anything attributed to some "Satanic" spirituality.
      </p>
      <p>
       By your definition here for instance someone like Ayn Rand's objectivism is "Satanic". While I don't like Rand its really not accurate to use some spiritual paradigm to describe her system. It comes as biased and judgemental. Also, based on your categories the biggest Satanist in the US at the moment is Donald Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, since you are quoting from the whole La Vey church of satan, do you know that he plagiarized that whole thing from an older pamphlet called Might Is Right by Ragnar Redbeard ?

       And what is this “end” in which it does not work?
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether or not your deity exists, ethics remains a mere construct that humans find useful. We take stuff that we observe as harmful and label it as “evil,” i.e., forbidden, simply because most of us  prefer to avoid harming each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any “morality” that is not human-centered and consequence-based in this way falls apart with a simple “why:” it always just comes back around to appealing to practical consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even your deity finds it necessary to impose artificial harm and benefit in an afterlife in order to convince its worshippers not to commit the victimless “sins” of idolatry and blasphemy.

       But I do care. It would be easier to just downvote you and move on to the next funny gif. I have laid out my argument because by them I myself was convinced that unless he can put his money where his mouth is and show us his badass “lake of fire,” that YHVH’s opinion on anything is of infinitely less consequence to humankind than that of your local mayor. 
Otherwise, it doesn’t matter whether or not he parted the waters and let there be light, he can just keep his opinions on anal sex to himself.

       My argument is that even if Adonai Sabaoth
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       his filial component personality/avatar/man-costume are 100% real, any values or opinions this entity holds are still, by virtue of being values and opinions, subjective, and thus only as valid as those of any other sentient being.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if ol’ “Ehyeh asher ehyeh” himself had a hand in teaching us about it, ethics always was and always will be just something we humans use to minimize bloodloss. That he has plans to fill a lake with napalm and chuck a bunch of us into it while the rest go live in his gated community only proves this fact. 
He knows that without this kind of might-makes-right system in play that his opinions on abstinence only matter as much as yours or mine.

       Pretty sure "sociopath" is just the psychological diagnosis for evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lack of empathy, capable of cheating, hurting or even murdering people with no remorse, operating solely on selfishness and having no motive but to manipulate others for your own personal gain. Lacking in any morals or values.  Pretty sure that's an evil person.
      </p>

       You're failing to separate religion from the teachings that come from the bible, or any other holy book for that matter.

       But the books have been translated, mistranslated and rewritten countless times by those religions. Were they to be trusted before, but not right now? If your personal answer is yes, I don't know what to tell you, be yourself. If you decide you shouldn't trust them before either you must agree that those holy books are useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I hope I don't have to remind you how much power they have had throughout history and the world, and all they stood to gain to modify them.

       Well, the article proves that Christianity is pure bullshit, then.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Christian concept of Lucifer/Satan is a lie, and you've just shown me that you already know this.
      </p>
      <p>
       What makes you think hermeticism is evil, when it's Christianity that lies? I mean you know fine well it's been used to keep people in a form of mental bondage and has been horribly corrupted..... so wouldn't it be Christianity that's the evil shit? Certainly seems so.

       I guess what I'm interested in is why you still think Christianity is the truth, despite the fact you know fine well much of it is lies? A lot of evil has been committed in the name of Christianity but it's the lies that I can't get past.

       All I know is my country (England) was originally a Pagan country. Christianity was forced upon us by punishment of death for not converting to Christianity during the European crusades.

       Can you treat this like a [premise] thread for a moment where you hypothetically consider what I'm saying to it's logical conclusion without necessarily accepting it entirely?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say that God and the devil are both 100% real.  that's the [premise]
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't it make sense that the devil would immediately start attacking any sort of rescue plan? i.e. christianity
      </p>
      <p>
       the church is completely corrupt.  They were indwelt with the evil we are discussing here.  Since we are assuming Christ is genuine in this discussion, then wouldn't CHrist's church become the devil's number one target?

       Well yeah, that would definitely make sense if we are talking hypothetically.

       I just don't think the Christian concept of Lucifer/Satan exists. I would be far more inclined to believe the occultists who hide their knowledge, because knowledge is power.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Christian concept of Lucifer, to me, is nothing more than scare mongering from a deeply corrupted organisation that seeks to keep humanity in the dark in regards to what
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the truth about Lucifer.

       Are we really short of creation myths that feature a rebellious entity giving knowledge to man?

       Thoth invented writing in Egypt
      </p>
      <p>
       Prometheus stealing Fire in Greece

      <p>
       Sumerian Legends tell us that their courts, metallurgy, ship building, all came from "star people"
      </p>
      <p>
       African legends are replete with supernatural visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's easy enough to dismiss this stuff but do you know about the Dogon tribe in Africa?  They were able to accurately describe the celestial movements of SIRIUS A and B  500+ years before modern science could do it.   We needed telescopes to do it, they did it without. They claim they were given this info by star people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it's just a bunch of retellings of the same myth.  What's the real truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       You are right that there are some control mechanisms.  But don't throw the baby out with the bath water.  Maybe the control mechanisms are only there to scare people away from finding the truth.  What is the truth?

      <p>
       Josephus the famous Jewish Historian wrote in his book "Antiquities of the Jews":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "The entire body of the people of Israel remained in that country; wherefore there are but TWO TRIBES in Asia and Europe, subject to the Romans; while the TEN TRIBES are beyond the Euphrates till now and are an immense multitude not to be estimated by numbers."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The ancient historian Kitto states:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "After the captivity we hear very little of the territories of the Tribes for Ten of them NEVER RETURNED."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore the LORD was very angry with Israel, and removed them out of his sight: there was none left but the tribe of Judah only. (2 Kings 17:18)
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to his house; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of the LORD. (1 Kings 12:24)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This event took place during the reign of Rehoboam, son of Solomon, approximately two hundred years before Isaiah lived. To finance his massive building projects, Solomon had taxed the people heavily during his reign. Following his death, the ten northern tribes appealed for relief from the heavy tax burden, but Rehoboam refused. The Israelites returned home in rebellious anger. Rehoboam sent the head of that day's Internal Revenue Service to either collect some overdue revenues or negotiate. The Israelites assassinated him. Fearing the northern ten tribes' secession, the Jews raised an army and prepared to go to war against their northern brethren. At that point, God directly intervened by sending a prophet to deliver the message contained in verse 24.
       </p>
       <p>
        God says He was personally maneuvering events to bring about His will.
        <strong>
         He wanted to divide Israel and Judah into two separate kingdoms with two separate histories—a situation that exists to this day. Israel was later scattered in captivity by Assyria. Judah followed Israel into captivity over one hundred years later but at the hands of Babylon.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This journey took the Israelites through a narrow gap in the Caucasus called the Dariel Pass or the Pass of Israel to the land of Arsareth in the steppes of what is now Southern Russia. Their gravestones are there to this day and we read, example:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "I am Jehudi, the son of Moses, the Son of Jehudi the Mighty, a man of the Tribe of Naphtali, carried captive with other tribes of Israel by Prince Shalmaneser... to Halah and Habor, to Gozan and to the Chersonesus."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Another Crimean gravestone reads:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Zadock the Levite died 785 years after our exile."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Prof. Chirolson of Petrograd deciphered over 700 of these epigraphs in the Crimea where Lost Israel passed through. Therefore science and scripture both say they migrated across Europe into these areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       And nations have seen thy righteousness, And all kings thine honour, And He is giving to thee a new name, That the mouth of YHWH doth define. (Isaiah 62:2)
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       A perishing flock hath My people been, Their shepherds have caused them to err, To the mountains causing them to go back, From mountain unto hill they have gone, They have forgotten their crouching-place. (Jeremiah 50:6)
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       I will seek that which was lost, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick: but I will destroy the fat and the strong; I will feed them with judgment. (Ezekiel 34:16)
      </p>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <p>
       But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel. (Matthew 15:24)

       This short post should help you comprehend how and why the church is corrupt but the original source of the church may not be corrupt.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Of course you're skeptical, and rightly so.  You were probably raised in a church.  I was raised to be an atheist and never really went to church very much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Churches  worship anti-christian things.  Churches ignore massive parts of scripture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's chat history.
      </p>
      <h1>
       How was the site for the church of the holy sepulcher  chosen?
      </h1>
      <p>
       Self-proclaimed-psychic, mother of constantine chose the area because the temple of venus used to stand in that spot.
      </p>
      <h1>
       How was the site of Mt. Sinai chosen?
      </h1>
      <p>
       Constantine had a dream and described the dream to his mother.  Then he sent his mom to Saudi Arabia to choose a mountain for Mt Sinai based on his descriptions of the dream.
      </p>
      <h1>
       How was sunday worship chosen?
      </h1>
      <p>
       Everybody knows the Roman empire was mostly pagan at the time of conversion to Christianity.  Saturnalia (became christmas) and Sunday (became a fake sabbath) were carried over from the previous religion of sun worship to make it easier for people to convert en mass.  A careful reading of scripture shows that these things have NOTHING TO DO WITH CHRISTIANITY
      </p>
      <h1>
       How was the site of the temple mount chosen?
      </h1>
      <p>
       In the fourth century AD, rabbis living in jerusalem all agreed that they did not know where the temple was, and there were 4 or more locations being suggested.  It was not agreed that the temple had been on the "temple mount" until the 12th century AD!!!!  Plus, if you read the scripture, regarding the location of the gihon spring and the city of david, it is clear that  the temple was not on the "temple mount"
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, what kind of person believes that the Romans would refuse to take the ONLY HILL IN JERUSALEM for their fort out of respect for the Hebrew God, when they themselves are there to oppress the Hebrews and keep them in line?
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the temple been on the temple mount, the Romans would have taken it for their fort.  But scripture tells us that soldiers could run DOWN from the fort into the temple, and Josephus tells us that the Roman fort was in a position to protect the temple.  So the modern "Temple mount" is probably not the correct location.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Don't people edit God's word?
      </h1>
      <p>
       Yeah, people do, but sort of like blockchain, there are so many copies of scripture in private hands, that it enforces honesty.  If somebody lies, everybody else tries to correct him.  We used to question our modern texts and their historical accuracy, but due to the discovery of the dead sea scrolls, we know that the old testament we currently use is IDENTICAL LETTER FOR LETTER  to what was used 2,200 years ago.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Why did the council of Nicea suppress certain books?
      </h1>
      <p>
       Maybe because they're serving the entities mentioned in some of the suppressed books?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       Pretty much everything that modern christianity believes is based on tradition and probably wrong.  If you ever believed in a literal devil, then wouldn't it make sense for the church to be his number 1 target on this earth?

       Honestly, this just makes me think  paganism is far closer to the truth, and that's why the Romans executed every last person who refused to convert.....

       Paganism is true in the sense that it exists and is real.  We agree there.  Paganism really has two definitions:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Worship of the Earth or the Heavens
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Worship of Fallen Angels or their children
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you familar with Genesis 6:4?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them: the same were the mighty men which were of old, the men of renown.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They call these the Nephilim. They are the children of the angels who rebelled against God and came to earth to sleep with human women.   They abandoned their posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       This actually explains a ton about world history!  Where magick comes from, where fallen knowledge comes from, why the bible calls it sinful, and why so many cultures worshiped deities that had "real" power.   Those deities were fallen angels!  They trade their fallen knowledge in exchange for worship by humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, as you noted, England was affected in several different ways by this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire thrust of Christianity is not to worship the fallen angels, but instead, worship the one who made them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dunno how you saw this conversation going down but probably not like this huh :)    Hope it's alright with you that we are going there.

       Yes, I've read about the Nephilim but admittedly I disregarded it due to my bias against Christianity. I'm trying to drop that bias and I've been reading your posts with a lot of interest.

       Thank you!  As mentioned previously I was a skeptic for most of my life and I also had a strong bias against Christianity.  I had some really intense experiences which lead me to drop my old bias and take a fresh look with adult eyes.

       Well I am non-denominational as I feel most churches are corrupted, and that is where the lies and misconceptions come.
      </p>
      <p>
       I grew up in a household where Christ was hated. I transitioned from atheist to agnostic Buddhist in my teens. I was definitely a new ager in my early 20s.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2015 I met a guy online. He was one of the smartest people I had met in my life. We talked about conspiracies and are still friends to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
       One day I asked what his beliefs were, and he told me he was Christian. I was shocked. How could somebody so smart believe that?!
      </p>
      <p>
       We debated for months. He almost always won. I mean I asked him some of the most difficult questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I could not take his word for it. I knew I had to investiage the truth myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spent at least a solid year researching everything I could. I read day and night and I slowly opened my eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In March 2016, I had a deeply spiritual experience where I feel I had the presence of Christ or holy spirit come over me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew I was Christian from that moment. The next year meant a lot of changes, and those changes are still happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was baptized Sept. 11 2017. Felt kind of symbolic as 9/11 is where I started with truth seeking.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for my beliefs, well I believe Christ is my savior.

       Well it is really personal but...
      </p>
      <p>
       I was at one of the lowest moments of my life. I would rather not explain what that was because I have many stalkers on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I decided in almost a desperate attempt to ask God for help. But this time, for the first time in my life, I sincerely asked Jesus. I asked him to show me he was real, and then I promised to change and be better and glorify him.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that moment, an overwhelming feeling of pure love came over me. It temporarily "healed" me. I was honestly shaken by it for months after.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not in a bad way - I just now knew Christ was real.

       Well for sure Christanity has been corrupted as a religion but Christ's words are pure gold. Find one you disagree with.

       Christiantiy came to supplant the mystery religions, and the early popes helped the mystery religions corrupt Christianity.

      <p>
       No one said hermeticism is evil. They said hermeticism is Luciferian. And if you want to really dig down on this, in the actual Greek and Hebrew originals, there isn't really anyone called "Lucifer" because that's a Latin term. Jesus calls himself the Morning Star, which would mean that Christianity is technically Luciferian. Not in the sense of being Satanic, but in the sense of revealing light rather than hiding the truth in darkness.

       I guess my point is that the Christian concept of Lucifer and the Hermetic concept of Lucifer are very, very different. Therfore when Christians hear the name Lucifer, they end up with a very warped and misinformed opinion of literal, horror movie style devil worshipers.

       The word generally translated "Lucifer" occurs
       <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrew/1966.htm">
        once
       </a>
       in the entire Bible, and most scholars don't believe it is referring to a fallen angel. They actually believe it is mocking a man that God is about to strike down because he saw himself as equal to The Shining One, which seems to be a not-evil angel, or possibly Jesus Christ. Jesus called himself the Morning Star in the book of Revelation.

       I disagree.

      <p>
       Here is a quote from a book entitled, The Golden Dawn: A Complete Course in the Practical Ceremonial Magic: The Original Account of the Teachings, Rites, and Ceremonies of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn by Israel Regardie:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The first Temple founded in England in 1887-88 under the governance of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was named very appropriately Isis-Urania.  Isis-Urania is Venus, and she is the occult planet which represents the Genius of this Order -- Venus, the Evening and the Morning Star, presaging the rising of the Sun of ineffable Light.  Venus is also, as Isis, a symbol of the Qabalistic
        <em>
         Shekinah
        </em>
        , the Glory of the Presence Divine, the Holy Spirit.  After the Revolt in the Order about 1900, the schismatic sect appropriated as the name of their Order, Stella Matutina, the Morning Star, thus continuing the significance of the enlightening function and purpose for which the Order was founded originally.  For, if one may speak of the Order as having a specific purpose, then that sublime motive is to bring each man to the perfection of his own
        <em>
         Kether
        </em>
        , to the glory of his own higher Genius, to the splendour of the Golden Dawn arising within the heart of his soul.  And its technique is always encompassed through the uplifting of the heart and mind by a theurgic invocation to Isis-Urania, the symbolic personification of the Sephiroth of the Supernal Light.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well known that Venus is a planet peculiarly associated with occult and mystical aspiration.  In
        <em>
         The Secret Doctrine
        </em>
        we find Blavatsky stating that "Venus, or Lucifer, the planet, is the light-bearer of our Earth, in both a physical and mystical sense."  And in quoting from the Stanzas of Dzyan, she presents the statement that "Thus Earth is the adopted child and younger brother of Venus."  Hence a good deal of wisdom is concealed in the very choice of the name of the Order.

        masonic
       </a>
       influences. Which makes sense, because the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn was created by

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quatuor_Coronati_Lodge">
        Quatuor Coronati Lodge
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       "Many present-day concepts of ritual and magic that are at the centre of contemporary traditions, such as Wicca[1][2] and Thelema, were inspired by the Golden Dawn, which became one of the largest single influences on 20th-century Western occultism.[3][4]
      </p>
      <p>
       The three founders, William Robert Woodman, William Wynn Westcott, and Samuel Liddell Mathers, were Freemasons. Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Golden Dawn system was based on hierarchy and initiation like the Masonic Lodges; however women were admitted on an equal basis with men."

       I never said they were Satanists, though it would be a logical conclusion. More likely, they worship Lucifer as God.

       I like the way you wrote your post and appreciate the time it took to research and put it together.
My own personal thoughts on the subject...
Everything seems to come out of the same place. 
Whether or not you would be the person you are today without the bad things that had happened in your past; its tough to say.  But i think alot of people have broken past thinking things are good or bad, but rather have i grown from them. I think the whole human experience is one of growth and development. It can come physically, mentally, or spiritually. 
Ive often wondered if the young trees curse the wind that blows them over, bending and breaking their branches;  all the while never realizing it made them grow straight.
One of my favorite bible verses is Isiah 45:7
 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.
That one keeps things in perspective for me. Thank you. I always enjoy your posts even though i dont respond. Have a goodnight

       I appreciate the effort, but unfortunately it seems like you might
be drawing the wrong conclusions. Crowley's ideas like Thelema
reject traditional Abrahamic religion and instead value the individual
experience and personal achievement; it comes from a specific time
period when intellectuals were interested in blending
Eastern philosophy and mysticism with Western ideas, which
inspired Golden Dawn, Crowley's OTO and many other "secret
societies". 
&amp;nbsp;
The controversial "satanic" movement or religion began
with the Church of Satan, which was founded by Anton LaVey in
1966, well after Crowley's death. The Church encourages personal
autonomy and obeying one's own desires, and was inspired by
Crowley's work, but its philosophy rejects obeying a higher power,
and is closer to atheism.

       That's more than okay, you can follow whatever religious doctrine
you want, and yes Thelema and Luciferianism could be seen as
"moral relativism".
&amp;nbsp;
   However I don't see a strong connection between these groups
and modern society/media in your post. Thelemic religions haven't
been popular since the 70's, and Church of Satan only gets
attention because their name scares Christians and old people
watching Fox.

       <p>
        Crowley's ideas like Thelema reject traditional Abrahamic religion and instead value the individual experience and personal achievement; it comes from a specific time period when intellectuals were interested in blending Eastern philosophy and mysticism with Western ideas, which inspired Golden Dawn, Crowley's OTO and many other "secret societies".   The controversial "satanic" movement or religion began with the Church of Satan, which was founded by Anton LaVey in 1966, well after Crowley's death.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These were neither new ideas, nor independent developments. All of these movements can be directly traced to Freemasonry. Golden Dawn came straight from high-level Freemasons:
      </p>
      <p>
       "The three founders, William Robert Woodman, William Wynn Westcott, and Samuel Liddell Mathers, were Freemasons. Westcott appears to have been the initial driving force behind the establishment of the Golden Dawn."
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowley was, without dispute, a
       <a href="http://www.freemasonry.bcy.ca/aqc/crowley.html">
        Freemason
       </a>
       (and British intelligence operative). So was Anton Lavey:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Satanic Ritual is a blend of Gnostic, Cabbalistic, Hermetic, and Masonic elements, incorporating nomenclature and vibratory words of power from virtually every mythos.....
.....Masonic orders have contained the most influential men in many governments, and
       <em>
        virtually every occult order has many Masonic roots
       </em>
       . (
       <a href="http://www.ritualabusefree.org/Freemasonry%20and%20Satanism.htm">
        Anton Lavey
       </a>
       ).
      </p>
      <p>
       Freemasonry is behind virtually all of the important occult groups. That's why high level Scottish Rite Freemasons are called
       <a href="http://www.mdscottishrite.org/regalia/caps/">
        Inspector General
       </a>
       , because they inspect all of the other occult groups and make sure they are doing what the Freemasons want them to do.

       Wow some very interesting stuff there. Yes, Lavey is right: as one
of the oldest secret societies, Freemason members and rituals
influenced satanism, Crowley's own occult orders and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       However, Crowley's actual status with the Freemasons is less clear-
a schism in Golden Dawn where he sided with his friend Mathers
against the other mason founders lead to him leaving England.
      </p>
      <p>
       &amp;nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
       Although he claimed many titles (like British spy), he wasn't
recognized by the official masonic order in England despite trying to
get accepted many times. He was basically kicked out of places all
over Europe for his offensive or controversial views, like some sort
of Victorian GG Allin.

       Unfortunately any sacred symbol, piece of knowledge/wisdom, etc etc can be twisted,  perverted and hijacked at anytime. A perfect example is the swastika. For thousands of years it was a beautiful symbol that represented good fortune and wellness. Obviously it's a hate symbol in today's society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's really important to separate the knowledge/wisdom/symbols from the individual/groups using them.  We shouldn't disregard the importance of that phrase just because someone that used it may or may not be corrupted.

       First, nothing you wrote actually shows Crowley is 1) a "Satanist" (the way that term was overused by 1980s Christian kooks) or 2) his ideas are any worse than Christianity, Judaism or Islam.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its no secret the early rock and roll musicians were into Crowley and the occult but there isn't anything wrong about that. Not sure why that is so controversial.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could bring out quotes from the Book of Job in the Bible that are far worse than anything Crowley wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       Props for writing a lot but I feel like you are confusing different things and the conclusion that Crowley is evil doesn't follow from the evidence.  I am not even sure that is your conclusion though so if not what is it?

       Also I find it a bit convenient how you casual excuse the Book of Job based on context yet you make no attempts to even grok Crowley's context.

      <p>
       Anyway I don't find your post very compelling in its claims that Crowley is somehow the source of evil ideas - Christianity, Judaism and Islam based cultures and people need no help there - they achieve evil all on their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway as I said methinks you are pigeonholing things you don't quite understand as "evil" in the way of hardline religious reactionaries instead of looking for the scientific rationale.

       2 Timothy 3 (KJV)
3 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come. 2 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, 4 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; 5 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 6 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts, 7 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a man named Rick Renner, he lives in Russia and has been studying Greek for 30 years. He says the "Last days" actually started at the "Day of Pentecost" Which is why people have been saying we are living in the last days for the last 2000 years. And this is what he interprets this one passage to mean after going through all the different meanings of the greek words used and the way they were compounded together. It really gives a much better insight than any english bible translation ever could. Makes me wonder what else the bible says that we don't know about.....And mind you, this passage is only one areas of the N.T. talking about the last days. Jesus also talks about them being full of "wars and rumors of wars" Nature and animals dying ect... And that these are only the beginning of birth pains.....
      </p>
      <p>
       Renner started giving this expounded version back in the 90's way before our obsession with violent video games and movies, social media, cell phones, the spread of "anything goes" crude and vulgar language and comedy like we have now today. (Sam Kinison is the first absolutely vulgar comic I know of from the early 90's) the massive spread of Pornography, the LGBTQI movement. ect...
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the greek words actually translates into the "I AM" Generation or what we now call the "ME" generation. A term that was coined in the 70's was actually coined in the bible 2000 years ago
      </p>
      <p>
       2 Timothy 3 Greek expounded
      </p>
      <p>
       The Holy Spirits prophecy warning speaking through the Apostle Paul,
      </p>
      <p>
       "You emphatically must know what I am about to tell you! In the very part of the last days - at the very end of the age and at the very last of the last days, - periods of time will come that are hurtful, harmful, dangerous, unpredictable, uncomfortable, and high-risk. People will feel encumbered by it, like you are standing in the middle of it with prison bars around you and there is no way to escape it. Mankind at large will have misdirected love from godly love to being self-consumed, self-absorbed, self-focused and in love with themselves more than anyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a result of this self-love, they will hoard money for themselves while spending very little to help others. These boasters are so committed to their own self-promotion and agenda that they are willing to exaggerate, overstate the facts, stretch the truth, embellish a story, and even lie if it will get them the position, advantage, or goal they desire. They will be arrogant, haughty, impudent, snooty, and insolent. They will never be satisfied and will never have enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       They disdain, mock, slander, and speak ill of anyone that stands in the way of their plans. Everything will be off the table, anything goes. They will think they have a right to everything and in this environment, parents will no longer be able to persuade, control, lead or exercise authority over their children. Although they were once thankful and appreciative, people will become void of gratitude and generally unappreciative of everything in the last time. As a result, impurity will seep into society and cause it to become unholy -- impure, ill-mannered, unclean, indecent, coarse, vulgar, offensive, crude, lewd and rude. Behaving and carrying on in a way that God would never sanction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love and commitment for family will degenerate; divorce will become epidemic with irreconcilable differences being the major cause for separation; and the court system will be overwhelmed as people go overboard in their suing others and in being sued. People will turn savage, vicious, uncivilized, violent, ferocious, and inhuman. A society where law is not primarily intended to protect the rights of good people but rather is used instead to protect and defend the rights of offenders. People will be preoccupied with and known for their obsession with violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       People will be lovers of pleasures and creature comforts more than lovers of God. Romantic with themselves, kissing themselves, showing deep profound affection for themselves, have a deep profound love for philosophy and wisdom while wanting to do everything they can to remove Truth (God laws) from their minds. Their doctrine will be that pleasure, comforts and happiness is the highest good; addiction to and obsession for pleasure as a way of life."
      </p>
      <p>
       Renner said some of the Greek words used in this one passage were so rare that they are not used anywhere else in the New Testament."

       great post but one quote you left out from Crowley is 'Love is the law, love under will", people who take up new age values as if choosing from a lunch buffet will not gain anything and often are the worst people to learn spirituality from.  Musicians and entertainers for the most part are good at getting attention, but have little to offer in terms of a unique insight into life or morality.  Christian, Muslim, and Jewish values have all been used to perpetrate evil.  I think there is evil in this world, I think some people seek it out.  Learning to protect yourself mentally as well as physically is very important.  I enjoy Crowley's writings, he makes a strong case for why he believes what he believes.  In his life he had very few actual followers.  He died addicted to opium and mostly alone.  But I have gained a lot of knowledge from his work, I think that if you can learn to focus your will to love those that deserve it, there will be less evil.  I have a lot of respect for your argument, and there is a lot of truth to it.  I just wanted to state my opinion on Crowley, good and evil.

       I agree.  There is one truth.  And I think we are better at knowing untruth, than finding what the actual truth is.  I also think that is by design, either as some kind of karmic test, or because those in power would prefer the general population to be disconnected from true spirituality.  I agree with a lot of your assertions on the problems with our culture.  Thanks for bringing attention to a great number of our modern challenges if we want to be better at withstanding evil influences.

       The world IS upside down and the majority are asleep, they are turning bad into good and good into bad just as it was prophecied to happen. The road into destruction is broad and easy to gain access to, while the road to life is hard, cramped and narrow. We will witness the end of all of this soon enough I imagine.

       It is sad but some people willingly choose to accept the satanic philosophy of you get one life and use it however you please. I can understand if people make a free will choice but the problem is that so many people aren't given the chance to learn the truth about what is going on to make an educated decision.

       As above, so below is not a saying by Crowley. It is a saying by Hermes Trismegistus, a Greek prophet/philosopher in Latin/Greek times who supposedly foresaw the coming of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       His book known as the Emerald Tablet was translated into Latin in the twelfth century by monks. I suggest you read up on actual Hermetecism and Hermes Trismegistus.

       The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn has nothing to do with Hermeticism. Hermeticism has been around since before the time of Christ, it is the belief that there is one driving force behind everything (what people call God). Some of the first followers of Christianity (before Rome took it over) even have writings on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern science is even based on it, the idea of testing reality to see what outcome occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn were more akin to Wiccans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hermeticism was what was followed by people like Galileo and Newton, although Newton was a hardcore Christian probably even more hardcore than you. Newton spent a lot of his life trying to prove the existence of God.

       Read the Kybalion. You’re basing a brick of text on a misunderstanding(as above etc.)mixed in with your personal feelings. I get that society is degrading just look at the rat utopia. It happens with overcrowding. You are also trying very hard to angle off on Crowley brining in moral relativism and occultistm which by the way means “hidden”. There was a time when science was “occult” look at the fervor associated with alchemy which itself was purely a spiritual practice of transmutation but was misunderstood by the outsiders hence “occult”. We no longer have a classical education that teaches the trivium and quadrivium. Language itself is a trap if you are not able to think critically. You also bring up Lucifer like it’s something bad and Christianity like it’s something good. All stories, allegories and myths are intimately of the human condition and our psyche(think Carl Jung). Your post can be summed up shortly but you overextended yourself here. Keep reading and try not to be so biased because of your anecdotal experience with “evil” and it’s relation to the world.

       Thanks formthe thread and for sharing your personal experience. Abbusive relatioships are like encounters with the devil itself.. Regarding what you speak off and conclusions I was introduced to all this concepts by Mark Passio- his seminars are all free online. Check him out if you haven't, many people are waking up, slowly but surely :)

       I made the comment to you a few weeks ago about how you don't get taught about Newtons occultism only his scientism, I have been down these rabbit holes and I have some tunnels to recommend. Read the the kybalion, it has the rest of the basic spiritual laws such as the law of correspondence (as above so below) that you are confused on like another poster pointed out. And read the Ra material (Law of One), you seem to have an appetite for reading and you will need it to get through the entire unedited transcript, it will explain service to self and service to others which I think might be more enlightening than the good/evil polarization perspective which might be limiting. A study of Neoplatonic philosophy is a good supplement as well (Iamblichus, Philo, Plutarch, etc.). Crowley was a follower of the left hand path, so culturally and societally he had to be a homosexual satanic lunatic as a mechanical necessity, something to keep in mind. Evil was introduced by God into the garden of Eden so that Adam and Eve could have the free will to spiritually progress, ask yourself why would God introduce Satan into the world.

       Sounds like you're a slave to the jews TBH

       Excellent write-up. Uncanny how similar our experiences and understandings are. I was hoping someone would state what you listed — that being about the occult and narcissism.

       Understand that Crowley and his contemporaries and acolytes were egomaniacal. They perverted sacred knowledge through the absence of compassion. Their moral compass and introspection were simply gone. There is a reason early esoteric sages tried so hard to impart their knowledge to compassionate  people. Anyone could absorb such sacred knowledge and employ it as a  device for social control.
      </p>
      <p>
       Understand that as reprehensible evil is, it’s a natural component of life that deserves to be understood.  Suffering mobilizes volition.  Volition leads to overcoming. Evil is the absence and fear of love. It’s the darkest and most desperate response to material vulnerability. Both forces do move each other, but the flame of spirit treks onward infinitely.  Forgive and you will see.

       The way I've come to look at it thus far, while I can fundementally can agree on a number of things in this OP, I don't see the 'were all one' as a gateway to nihilism and moral relativism. The 'oneness' from a personal perspective made me more ready to love other people and gave me a reason to try, if anything it makes me want to 'battle evil' (cheesy as that sounds), and sometimes I think I wouldn't mind going down myself in said attempt to do so because it feels like true purpose, it feels like a way to cherish life by self-sacrifice if needed. I don't seperate from it conceptually, or mentally because I'd like to understand what's going on. If I 'seperate' from one opposite I will get a reactionary attitude about these things and it swings into more despair and anger. If I do something bad, I also feel there are going to be consequences, and I don't base that on "their" occultism.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not that I even see it this way or believe it, but sometimes I assign this to myself: if I can't help the situation I'm gonna go down with everyone else if I fail.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil on a material level reads like a combination on of several things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what objective ''evil' is, in terms of what humans ascribe to it. Is it some really this astral energy that permeates human life that is simply being evil, (and I am completely open to this notion) ,or is it something intricate, like a polar opposite that manifests in certain behaviour here and is chaotic in nature? Is it a set of experiences like trauma, events that have led to self loathing, severe disappointment that lead to rebellion against everything, deeply rooted anger passed on generationally from ancestors and parents? I understand that psychopaths feel no remorse etc, but that also sounds like a lack of something to me, rather than some concept of evil at times, despite the horrendous nature in some of their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you put religious doctrines on people it seems some of them "rebel" out of spite, not understanding how something benevolent can be on such a crusade, be so callous as to punish its own creation and request submittance while being high-handed about following rules. Something, when seen on the material plane equates too much to enslavement and ownership, while by all means it could simply mean submit to some higher energy that is intent of taking care of you and not ascribing this material concept of submission to some master.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like "fuck you, then I get to be a prick as well you hypocrite."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Masters" or "lords" on a material level can have some pretty ominous meanings to it, it's authorative when looking at our history, but could mean something else "above". You have these mouthpieces, like the pope, bask in material wealth while preaching submission to God and the Vatican being this institution of authority on something that seems to surround us and seems available to everytone to begin with. It never made sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the 'onesness' is the fundemental truth, I think these types of occultist that preserve power have hijacked certain elements of it and created alot of reactionary mindsets. They might be using alot of reverse pshycology. "Master of lies" and "confusion" are two phrases that come to mind. Like some abusive step-father that's toying with your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are satanist tenets (depending on which cult/branch I reckon) which advocates self-service, where spiritual ambitions are "pipe dreams", and promote self indulgence. I don't like it because we have enough people looking out for themselves at all times. Then there those who worship actual entities, or one single entity, like the Luciferians. Point being, satanic tenets for example, I'm not sure how to automatically apply 'evil' to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe one doesn't have to conceptualize it as 'picking sides' at all, one just work againts what is intuitively regarded as evil and make sure evil loses, in some way of showing appreciation for life itself and for the sake of yourself and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry to hear about your abusive past OP. What I'm about to describe was never as serious personally as what you've described happened to you, but I used to have a step-father that could become aggressive and violent towards my mother. He was biploar and a deeply troubled man that would wake up screaming at night some times, but this particular man I don't think was evil in any way. He was immensely troubled. I'm not gonna equate your ex-husband to him, I can't dive into your mind (for now unfortunately, although it would seem reading thoughts, experiences and emotions seems to be possible, after a ton of reading  :) )
      </p>
      <p>
       To cut it short/TL;DR, 'oneness' doesn't automatically read like something that will automatically lead you on a path of evil, callousness and moral relativism. When you seperate concepts and distance yourself, I think you get the same type of mentality which is in our society today, where people are opposed to one another and no progress is made, only more personal anger from is fueled. You don't have to approve of evil in any way, maybe not even try to understand it,  but rather see it as a 'part of a grand play' where your purpose is to diminish it, or help relinquish the pain of others if you want to do that.
      </p>

       This is just my regular ol' 2 cents and this turned into a fricking short novel, sorry.

       I'm sorry, but you haven't understood Crowley in the least.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I basically read a bunch of Alesiter Crowley books the past few days..."
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes even the best minds years to comprehend Crowley. Not only does it take years of study and patience to understand his work, but the insistence that he was evil in any way in grossly misguided. His entire life was dedicated to the liberation of man from evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having an abusive relationship is terrible, but it does not qualify it as evil. I can tell from your writing that you have never experienced what can be termed radical evil. What you experienced is closer to the People of the Lie by M. Scott Peck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Crowley is also not New Age, in any sense of the term. You have confused Renaissance philosophy with Crowley ("as above, so below"). Crowley is not simple, nor is he easy to comprehend. There is great evil at work at all times, but he was not one of their agents.

       Yeah it's really obvious there are problems with society. I think Christianity needs a re branding in the modern age for people to really get it. Of course the only way for that to really work is for God to send down a son, and give him the proper tools.

       Nice post! I started researching some of Aleister Crowley's books because of your information and it's very dark. I came across a ritual called the "Mass of the Phoenix". So how it's performed is basically a wafer made from meal, honey, olive oil, Oil of Abramelin and blood/bodily fluids. It's stated in his book about what blood to use. Reminds me of spirit cooking with Marina Abramovic.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The best blood is of the moon, monthly: then the fresh blood of a child, or dropping from the host of heaven: then of enemies; then of the priest or of the worshippers: last of some beast, no matter what. (AL.III.23-4)"
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so I decided to do a youtube search on "Mass of the Phoenix". I found a disturbing result. A mom and a young girl performing the ritual together. The other videos they posted kind weird, almost like the mom is showing off the little girl for who knows what.

       I have known about Crowley for a while. Being a little ignorant on the subject, are there parallels between thelema and theosophy (Blavatsky). Is all esotericism "bad" in that regard? Is there "good" esotericism that promotes virtue and rejection of ego/Godhood?

       I enjoy the post and agree with its premise, with the exception of the decode on "as above so below" as sole interpretation of that is meant to be expressed as such. I've studied hermetics and Crowley for context, but I've always taken the saying differently. One version I saw was "As above, so below; as within, so without." I take it as a reference to the way the microcosm and macrocosm echo each other in familiar forms and patterns, and also in the way that one's mentality greatly shapes personal experience of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I've never had a taste for The Beast's work and this is no defense of it. Walls of text and layers of puns, mostly to troll would-be magicians. His method didn't do much for his eventual quality of life.

       Well it is really personal but...
      </p>
      <p>
       I was at one of the lowest moments of my life. I would rather not explain what that was because I have many stalkers on here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I decided in almost a desperate attempt to ask God for help. But this time, for the first time in my life, I sincerely asked Jesus. I asked him to show me he was real, and then I promised to change and be better and glorify him.
      </p>
      <p>
       In that moment, an overwhelming feeling of pure love came over me. It temporarily "healed" me. I was honestly shaken by it for months after.

      <p>
       Not in a bad way - I just now knew Christ was real.
