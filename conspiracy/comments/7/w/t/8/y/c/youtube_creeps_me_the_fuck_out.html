    <div class="md"><p>So.  I had a problem with my foot.  The doc told me to get a pair of house slippers vs walking barefoot.  Totally random/odd thing.    I talk last week to my gf in my house about it (phone in room). </p>

<p>I never searched web for them, or email etc.   I just drive to a store and got what I needed. </p>

<p>This week, here on reddit... I’m getting sponsored adds for high end slippers.. like the kind needed for my specific foot trouble.  </p>

<p>Out of all the adds to show me.  They pick slippers.  Hmm.  Lucky I guess.   </p>

If it was card then it’ll explain the fact that amazon and other online shops keep track of what you buy, with your cards, if not. Then holy shit mate, fucking listening on our conversation to target ads. Heard a story about a guy chatting via email with his friend mentioning going to japan, out of nowhere google started giving him ads on cheap flights to japan. Google scans your emails, others scan your messages, Facebook knows who you are before you like the 50th picture, and now apple is listening to you. 1984 doesn’t seem so unreal anymore. </p>

<p>Facebook goes further.  They can link you through the GPS in your phone if you are frequently in the same area as someone else.  Also, if you connect to someone&#39;s WiFi they can then link you to that person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had an eye appointment today and all the ads I’ve been served the past few days are all eyeglass shops. I have a Microsoft account linked on my phone and had a confirmation email sent to me late last week. It’s mind boggling how individualised it is.... like i forgot about the eye appointment but google ads didn’t? the ads actually reminded me about the appointment. Also I never put it in my calendar on my phone. Simply received an appointment confirmation email.</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t see the issue. If you don&#39;t want to be spied on, don&#39;t get a smart phone. You&#39;re literally carrying around a microphone, camera, and gps tracking device on your person 24 hours a day 7 days a week. No one is forcing you to do that... yet. If you don&#39;t want vampires, don&#39;t invite them in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It could be a coincidence, pattern recognition.  You might have seen ads for Tetris previously, but you never focused on them.  You only focused on them this time because of the recent conversation.</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s the &quot;You might be over-thinking it&quot; possibility.  Let&#39;s look at the other possibility, a thought many here share and that it&#39;s no coincidence.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious how to test it.  I propose a possible method to test this, and this will likely only work to prove it to you because part of this test requires no digital or verbal mention of the subject.  What you need to do is go somewhere away from your digital devices and bring a pen and paper.  </p>

<p>Ponder something you absolutely do not need, like for example if you live in an apartment building then a lawnmower would work great for this.  Or maybe you don&#39;t need clothes pins, because you just never do.  Write this down, put it somewhere like your wallet.  Try to be as specific as you can, like if you choose stuff for your kitchen pick soup bowls or copper pots; just to leave nothing to chance.</p>

<p>Put that somewhere safe and then watch your ads for the next few days as you peruse social media.  Don&#39;t type or search for it, and don&#39;t mention it in conversation when you are around digital devices of any sort.  If you see an ad for that specific item in those next few days, pick a new object or thing.  The goal is to try and create a control group of sorts, a reference point.  </p>

<p>After you&#39;ve carefully watched to make sure you don&#39;t get ads, somehow work it into a conversation or just talk to yourself about it while around your phone/computer.  Do not search for it or otherwise trigger ads through action, because you want to make sure you&#39;re being listened to.  If you see those ads right after talking about it, then there&#39;s a good possibility you&#39;re being listened to.</p>

<p>Not sure if this sounds like a decent test though.</p>

I never read them, but in my app manager, under the specific app (in this case YouTube) it clearly states what you have allowed. And, surprise, you basically give up the right to control your devices. Among things you&#39;re allowed ; full use of camera and mic. The ability to read and delete data on sd-cards, full access to contact lists and so on. And this goes for apps from all major companies, the smaller ones tend to be not so severe.
