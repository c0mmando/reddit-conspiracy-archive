<p>Everything regarding the discrediting of mainstream science. People think everything they were taught in science class and everything Bill Nye the science guy and Neil Degrasse Tyson say is 100% fact. The narrative is that we’re just insignificant monkeys that occured out of chance, and there’s probably other intelligent monkeys somewhere in supposed “space” so you’re nothing special. All an attempt to discredit God. And if you disagree you’re apparently an idiot.</p>

The stupid rules, and the confessing your sins, and the being gay is wrong, etc etc. it all is just so pathetic.

    <div class="md"><p>Can I ask a simple, non-threatening question? Do you encounter in your non-religious life - (1) stupid rules (2) times when you have to admit you did something wrong, or (3) some moral limit you personally cannot step past (not necessarily the gay issue, but something, well, bloodier...)? </p>

<p>You mention reasoning skills. Are the questions above reasonable? Do they make you consider that what you detest about religion is the specific content you are picking up from your experience with it, and not just what you literally said to describe your pain points?</p>

<p>Have you considered that religion - either in its entirety of world religion and world spiritual philosophy - or in its narrow American context of Christianity as the dominant form - embodies a nearly infinite variety of content to fit those pain-points. For instance, I guarantee you will find a church near you that does not enforce stupid rules, that does not require formal confessions, and does not consider being gay as wrong.</p>

<p>Would you consider any system that (1) has stupid rules, (2) requires self-awareness of faults, and (3) insists on certain moral limits to be a religion? Because I am almost 100% certain you have that, and that you actually want all the people around you to have that too.</p>

<p>I believe religion is necessary for us as humans for now. It gives people community and a strong sense of belonging which may be hard from a secular standpoint. The problem aren&#39;t the stupid rules really. The problem comes from followers who use the stupid rules as justification to do something or not do something that may harm another individual. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I think I didn’t really explain myself. I honestly have no problem if someone is a religious person, it’s not my thing but I haven’t studied it, so I’m not going to say you’re wrong for believing what you believe. Also, I don’t believe I’m always right so to each their own. What I have a problem with is people injecting their religion onto other people. People trying to create rules and legislate based on their religious beliefs. Get that out of my face. Not everyone is you. Not everyone believes what you believe. You do your thing, live life by your rules, but stop trying to control what others do. </p>

<p>And in my experience, when it comes up in conversation, it’s typically people trying to shove what they think is right down everyone else’s throat. The loud obnoxious religious people seem to be projecting their own fear about where they will end up onto every one else. Like if they yell they love Jesus loud enough they won’t go to hell or something. </p>

<p>I don’t know, maybe I shouldn’t even have commented on this, but there’s nothing I dislike more than a person who is loud about their religion in a condemning others way. Like if someone wants to just discuss religion in a normal way then NBD but my experience is the ones who are bringing it up have some agenda: trying to control others. </p>

<p>And yes, my experience is with American Christianity and the loud political ones are some of the worst human beings I’ve ever experienced. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>What would that look like? I already tried calling it &quot;spiritual philosophy&quot;. Everyone has a different way of talking about it. If you find more than three people who talk religion exactly the same way - you have a church. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not everyone believes what you believe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You said it has (1) stupid rules, (2) requirement to confess, and (3) is anti-gay right? Which of those has anything to do with believing something about the universe?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>evil thoughts ... that you need to scream about your love for god</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not about evil thoughts it&#39;s about evil actions - the thought is just thrown in there for you to remember it by. And it&#39;s not about love for god, it&#39;s about the certainty that something as big and strong and good as god - any god - cares about each person ever born. You pick. You have to love god, or god has to love you. Look it up - its in there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, you’re not getting it. People are telling you to do you, and let everyone else do the same. Your religion tells you being gay is evil? Then don’t be gay. No one’s making you be gay. No one has a problem with you not being gay. You’re not a bigot because you’re not gay. You’re a bigot when you try to tell other people they shouldn’t be gay and that they shouldn’t have the same rights because they’re gay. See the line is where you insert your beliefs on other people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah if you think there’s something wrong with being gay then you should be told you’re an asshole and your morals are fucked. That’s called preaching tolerance and trying to keep society safe and pleasant for all.  Should we also not be allowed to tell assholes that think only of themselves that that’s makes them a narcissist?</p>

<p>Sorry, but society is not going to build you a safe space because your religion has brainwashed you. This is how society progresses by telling folks stuck in the past that they are stuck in the past. </p>

<p>Still, no one is forcing anything on you, just communicating to you that your standards and morals are falling behind everyone else. That’s how society works. Your religion does not give you an excuse to classify others as second class citizens. </p>

<p>I’m still flabbergasted that you want a pass from criticism from society because religion. Yes, if you (royal you) think being ‘gay’ is wrong or women don’t belong in the workplace because your religion told you to think that then society has an obligation to tell you, “hey buddy don’t be so hateful. Don’t discriminate against members of our society and use religion as an excuse to do it”. We all have to live in this society together, and your (royal your) comfort and needs are no more important than the person you disagree with or disapprove of. You get no special pass to oust them from society. You get no special pass to be the one who determines what is an acceptable way to live. </p>

<p>I can’t believe I have to sit hear and argue with someone that things the people that call bigots are mean, not the bigots themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ya sure, that&#39;s what you meant, you just proved my point.</p>

<p>And thats exactly what I just said...I said I might tell them what I believe to be true...but I&#39;m not going to ouch it going to push it on them or tell them they aren&#39;t horrible for believing what their religion said.</p>

<p>I live in a place with a ton of different religions, and a lot of mormans. That are some of the nicest people I know. I&#39;m not going to be like &quot;hey your an idiot, for believing you get a planet and seven wives when you die.&quot; Let people believe what they want to believe for their lives, as long as they are not attacking you.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll tell you one thing, your approach right now is likely to turn someone even into more of a bigot when you come across an ACTUAL one.</p>

<p>Want to change people&#39;s view? Befriend them. Show them. Acting like a giant asshole and telling someone who they are and that they are horrible is not going to change the world. You can&#39;t force people to see your point of view you can only be an example so that they see something that they fear or don&#39;t understand is not that bad.</p>

<p>And I can&#39;t believe that people are so dense as to not figure that out. You can&#39;t change someone&#39;s beliefs, you can&#39;t force them...you can only give them a different experience and help to teach differently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you. But don’t let that cloud good information. Or make you accept bad information.</p>

<p>Religion is very close to spirituality and also mind. None of these things happen without the mind. But that’s relegated to philosophy.</p>

<p>The things I generally take from Holofractal are the patterns That replicate through all sizes and scales. The way DNA functions in ways that we don’t understand yet. Just what in the hell did those ancients really know?</p>

<p>I am not a Goodnuf this assist to debunk Harriman. I just like the concepts. </p>

<p>And I am aware that it one point saying “Dinosaurs arent like crocodiles...they are birds” would get you laughed right out of a paleontologist meeting.</p>

<p>Is it such a crazy idea that as you look down the well far enough you actually are looking back up at the sky? I remember something at Ripleys believe it or not museum. It was a hole in the wall and when you look at it all you saw was a person’s ass. And it turns out you were looking at your own ass. But how could that be done? It seems impossible. Is it such a crazy idea that as you look down the well far enough you actually are looking back up at the sky? I remember something at Ripleys believe it or not museum. Was a hole in the wall and when you look at it all you saw was a person‘s ass. And it turns out you were looking at your own ass. But how could that be done? It seems impossible.</p>

<p>Ripley just made a neat optical illusion. Perhaps the universe is pulling a similar trick on us all.</p>

<p>I find holofractal Also does a lot of digging into ancient archaeology and archaeological anomalies. I’m  just bringing all this up because I really enjoy that sub And I am very skeptical of the Harriman guy. But I still find a lot of thought-provoking information there. </p>

<p>Is there a better place I should be looking? Everybody here knows that science gets tipped on its head every 50 years or so. And the in between time is just arguing until the newer theories come to be accepted or disproved. </p>

<p>A good example. We have all grown up hearing about how impossible free energy is.  And then NASA releases their EM drive. It uses no propellant. It’s like a solid-state drive pulling itself through space or something.</p>

<p>NASA is quick to say that this doesn’t violate the law of thermodynamics. It’s just using special loopholes. OK fine....but why wasn’t I brought up and educated to understand that there are tons of loopholes in the law of thermodynamics? </p>

<p>If some crazy inventor came out with the EM drive it would be a violation of science laws. Regardless of if it worked. </p>

<p>I discovered a new kind of physics! It seems to ignore the laws of thermodynamics. I have an invisible weightless propellant!</p>

<p>So for the right people in the right institutions these laws are flexible? The faster things advance, the more we are going to have to face these moments....such as is light a particle or a wave. Can you have a weightless invisible propellant? Is light the fastest speed you can travel? What about when you think about nonlocal communication? In that case, light actually seems pretty slow.</p>

<p>Why all the hate on Holofractal anyway? Serious question! </p>

<p>Don’t be mean to me if I sound incredibly stupid. I’m less intelligent than I actually am. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just said it gives off the vibe, not that it contains nothing but useless bullshit. I have no doubt there are good discussions going on there. But just a quick browse through the sub and then the top posts looks just like stuff everyone I’ve known that’s taken acid and gone off the deep end starts to ramble about. I’ve subbed and will keep checking it out, just like I said at first glance I get the vibe of burnout convincing me they know the answers to the universe. Throw in some crop circle pictures and photoshopped pictures that look trippy like they’re trying to make a Tool album cover and it’s perfect.</p>

<p>I would have to dig for source but I would call these guys being staunch atheist scientist… Math geeks.. but towards the end of their careers they got all spiritual and of course the example they used flew way over my head.</p>

<p>Does anyone recall something like this? I feel like it might of been an old nova episode </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;d be possible to have &#39;evidence&#39; but the closest thing would be found in math, laws of physics, coincidences, etc.. What I mean is we didn&#39;t create math or laws of physics, we just discovered them, and perhaps this acts as the underlying code. The golden ratio is an interesting example to think about. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a really interesting video titled &quot;Sonic Geometry: The Language of Frequency and Form&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY74AFQl2qQ%5C">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY74AFQl2qQ\</a></p>

<p>This isn&#39;t directly related to simulation theory, but probably my single favorite video. Only 13 minutes long and well worth it, the ending is absolutely mind blowing. Definitely give it a watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHiad18ZwcY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHiad18ZwcY</a></p>

<p>It might be impossible to find hard evidence, but use some logical reasoning and it does make sense. To paraphrase Elon Musk: Look at where technology/video games are today and consider that 40 years ago we had pong, two rectangles and a circle. Assuming any rate of improvement at all, we WILL eventually have games indistinguishable from reality and AI will be capable of consciousness. And furthermore, we&#39;ll eventually be able to run ancestral simulations inside a simulated world. By that logic there’s a one in billions chance we’re in base reality, because either we&#39;ll be the first civilization to create ancestor simulations or we’re in one. Since this is all inevitably possible, either civilization is destroyed before reaching that point or we&#39;re already a product of a simulation (there&#39;s a very very small chance we&#39;d be the first civilization to create such a simulation).</p>

<p>It&#39;s difficult to grasp and I probably didn&#39;t do the best job of clearly explaining the line of reasoning, so here&#39;s Elon Musk talking about it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KK_kzrJPS8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KK_kzrJPS8</a></p>

<p>One of my favorite Black Mirror episodes is &#39;USS Callister&#39;, which is a very effective visual of the whole concept.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both conspiracies were clearly pushed by a lot of people on this sub and t_d to smear the DNC, Clinton and democrates in general. The pizzagate while claiming to be about pedophiles in general was clearly not as they pretty much solely focused on Podesta. Now the same people, IMO, try to make it about Hollywood. As if sexual assault/pedophilia is any more exclusive to one industry than another. It&#39;s a narrative they create to discredit the left and a group of people who generally disagree with Trump. Honestly, at least Hollywood is trying to call out and expose some of this shit. Unlike Trumps own administration, who this week literally got caught trying to suppress people from speaking out.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the reptilians. According to ET contactees/experiencers they literally eat children, not to mention raping adult men and women. The MSM secretly bans any mention of reptilians except these recent days as an absurd joke.

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t say this is too deep or dark to discuss anywhere, but it is less visible than most conspiracies so I thought you&#39;d be interested: Check out &quot;Missing 411&quot;, which is a whole big thing that deals with unexplained disappearances of people, and the common denominators amongst the cases.</p>

<p>To give a breif summary: A small group of investigative journalists have spent years profiling missing persons reports, looking for the ones that cannot be explained by rational means (i.e. murder/kidnapping/wild animals/accidental death/etc.). They&#39;ve looked at just under 2000 cases that defy explanation, but have eerily similar themes, such as bodies of the missing being found in areas previously searched multiple times by Search and Rescue folks, disappearances occuring in clusters in and around federally owned land (National parks specifically)... rivers/creeks/other water being in the vicinity, no scent trails found by search dogs, and clothing being found in an inexplicable condition, or just being gone.</p>

<p>Where this subject gets really interesting, and somewhat disturbing, is where it begins dealing with government coverups and some of the darker sides of the esoteric, as others have mentioned here (spiritual warfare, etc)</p>

<p>The general &quot;conspiracy&quot; is that there is something sentient causing these odd disappearances and deaths, something that is known and acknowledged by the National Park Service and larger government entities, but something that society can&#39;t really stomach right now...and something that the NPS keeps quiet about because they don&#39;t want to lose revenue.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a FASCINATING subject that would take tons of time to delve into, but I hope you and others will check it out.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just say to take it all with a grain of salt, because the main author is ex-law enforcement and an ex-Bigfoot researcher, which may diminish his credibility to some people. There are also people that resell the books on this subject for TONS of money on Amazon...personally I think they&#39;re shills trying to further discredit this research by making it seem for-profit, but I promise it is a legitimate thing. Either way, it is quite the rabbit hole to jump down. PM if you ever want to talk about this!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m absolutely with ya on that! I really do wish that this was more visible...every time I come on here and see shit about cults and satanists and all that, a nagging voice in my head is like &quot;aaahhhhhh fuck these people have NO IDEA&quot;</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t think that anything human is behind the missing 411 phenomenon, but I don&#39;t doubt that people who engage in harmful magick/satanistic practices are entirely unfamiliar with whatever the entity is...hell, maybe they are linked somehow, even if indirectly.</p>

<p>But the NPS <em>definitely</em> knows, I have no doubt. I got all the proof I needed when David Paulides filed a FOIA request about an Arizona park ranger who went missing, got stacks of paperwork about him, then filed a FOIA for a missing girl in Yosemite and was told he&#39;d have to pay 6 digit figures to get information on her, and basically to not bother trying. </p>

<p>It&#39;s fucked up and scary and SO interesting. There&#39;s so much more to our world than the black and white, good and evil, or even the gray areas for that matter......there&#39;s something out there we do not understand, that we should probably TRY to understand, because it literally hunts us...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand how you feel! It&#39;s absolutely that feeling of &quot;morbid curiosity&quot;, but I can&#39;t help it because this whole thing is captivating (and honestly pretty frightening too)</p>

<p>Here is a link to the Missing 411 subreddit&#39;s description of the phenomenon: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Missing411/wiki/about-missing-411">https://www.reddit.com/r/Missing411/wiki/about-missing-411</a></p>

<p>It is pretty lengthy but it will tell you everything you need to know. Fair warning, it is a little hard to stomach some of the stories, because a lot of the sadder missing people stories deal with kids, sometimes really really young kids too......but there are a handful who survive, and are found unbelievable distances from where they were last seen. I remember one about a boy who was around 3, in one of the south west states, and he was found sleeping on a boulder over 15 miles away--within the first day of searching! How does a toddler travel that distance in that amount of time without being seen by searchers/aircraft/etc? It really is fascinating.</p>

<p>Happy reading! If you have questions or want more info dont be afraid to ask!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your summary doesn&#39;t add up. For example, you did not mention a common denominator for motive, such as the most probable casue if they are connected, which would be that they knew too much. You implied that National Parks are used because there is so much land with so few witnesses, but there are many places in America where there is even more land with even fewer witnesses. You imply that this is only an American phenomenon, but that seems highly improbable if it is as epic as you imply (e.g. &quot;spiritual warfare&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be perfectly honest--my summary is really bad. It is difficult for me to accurately summarize the scope and complexity of this subject without accidentally being a little misleading, and saying some things that don&#39;t add up.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t read every word of this post, but I hope you&#39;ll give it a chance: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Missing411/wiki/about-missing-411">https://www.reddit.com/r/Missing411/wiki/about-missing-411</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s a WAY more detailed description than what I gave, and I hope it clears things up if you do check it out. I promise it&#39;s a rabbit hole worth diving into!</p>

<p>I will say this--I should have mentioned that nope, this is not an issue exclusive to the US, nor to National Parks or even wilderness areas. There&#39;s an entire book on urban cases--Elisa Lam&#39;s story is mentioned there, and I&#39;m sure we are all familiar with that. And all the books mention cases in other countries.</p>

<p>As for the motive, that&#39;s kinda the driving point of the books--to identify who/whatever is behind these odd occurences, establish a possible motive, and go from there. The whole thing is presented in a very fly-on-the-wall sort of fashion. The author never explicitly states what he thinks the phenomenon is, he simply presents facts and points out consistencies, and asks the reader &quot;what do you think?&quot;</p>

<p>It really is difficult for me to explain, haha. I&#39;ll end on this note: Barring all of my own descriptive inconsistencies and misleading phrasing, what I believe &quot;missing 411&quot; is about, is an extradimensional entity that our human species cannot physically see or comprehend--one that we don&#39;t even really have a name for, because it&#39;s not a sasquatch or a werewolf or whathaveyou. It&#39;s as if we are ants in an ant hill, and there&#39;s a highway next to us. Ants <em>probably</em> can&#39;t comprehend big vehicles and the people inside them...and similarly, we cannot comprehend a big invisible world that exists alongside ours, nor the predators within it that may prey on us.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all a big thing. Happy reading!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of those &quot;take it with a massive grain of salt&quot; stories, but one missing 411 case dealt with a boy around the age of 4 or 5 who may have been to one of these bases at Mt. Shasta.</p>

<p>Long story short, he somehow slipped away from his family during a camping trip, was found alive and well within a day or two, in a bush... his clothes were all missing I believe...and when questioned about what happened, he said something along the lines of this:</p>

<ul>
<li>His grandma found him and took him into the mountain</li>
<li>He saw lots of metal things, dusty &quot;purses&quot;, guns, and &quot;robots&quot; that were sleeping</li>
<li>Someone or something wanted him to defacate on a paper, but he said he didn&#39;t need to.</li>
<li>He was then placed in the bush</li>
</ul>

<p>The craziest part is that his grandma had been hiking in the area some time before the disappearance, and woke up with a red mark on the back of her neck of some sort, but not a bug bite--more like a puncture wound or something.</p>

<p>I apologize because memory doesn&#39;t serve tonight, and I&#39;ve probably butchered the details, but it&#39;s a fuckin WEIRD one, to say the least. I&#39;ll try to find a link to the actual story tomorrow!</p>

<p>Most of these stories involve the inexplicable removal of clothing, regardless of age. One of the more disturbing ones involved a pair of pants turned partly inside out, near a pair of shoes that were unscathed after the boy had been gone for <em>over a year</em>...unfortunately some of his teeth and bones were there as well.</p>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes kids are found alive, but STILL have weird clothing-related abnormalities...kids missing one or both shoes, all of their clothes, random clothes (like shoes socks and shirt only).......my personal favorite is about a little girl who had a big sunhat on when she vanished, and later that day she was found alive, clothes torn up in a nearby tree, but no hat...and when someone asked her where her hat went, she said &quot;the big wolf ate it&quot;...YIKES</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe it man. Honestly, I don&#39;t know how much I personally believe in the &quot;NPS coverup&quot; part of this, but I do wholeheartedly believe that some higher-ups are at least aware of this phenomenon, and wondering what to say to the public and what to do about the whole thing. I can imagine plenty of decent people are in a very uncomfortable position about this whole thing.</p>

<p>When you were with the NPS, did you ever have any odd experiences, or did you hear any stories from coworkers? I always love hearing from people that were in the field! That&#39;s actually how I found missing 411--the author asked for a NoSleep author to come out and say it was fictional writing, to avoid interference with the real research LOL..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flat Earth. All others have been discussed in some form or another here but most people seem to agree that the Flat Earth is a psy op to discredit the conspiracy community. Why should it need help being discredited, considering some of the shit some people come up with? Wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to let dumb people believe stupid lies without having to convince other people that they are dumb and falling for lies? Secondly, doesn&#39;t it seem a little strange that we can all agree it&#39;s definitely a CIA psy op but we can&#39;t come to a similarly complete agreement on any of the other psy ops being waged? Watching people proclaim that it&#39;s a psy op used to discredit the conspiracy community is like watching someone say their eyes are open, but when you look at them, they are wearing black contacts. Yeah your eyes may be open, but you still cannot see.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are various subreddits dedicated to flat earth. R/conspiracy has been inundated with FE posts to the point where you could almost change the subreddit name to FE.... </p>

<p>The reason most people call this a psy op... is because its glaringly obvious to most people. Those who don&#39;t agree tend not to have a grasp of basic mathematics and physics. I mean in all honesty, how can ANYONE believe someone like eric dubay when he claims such obsurdities  as &quot;the sun is only 3000 miles away&quot; &quot;there is no such thing as dinosaurs!&quot; (Despite all the fossilized evidence he seems to think thats a conspiracy too) &quot;there is no such thing as gravity&quot;  etc etc etc.... </p>

<p>Why anyone would fall for this shill is beyond me....but it seems enough have to warrent having yet another conversation about it here</p>

<p>Widespread availability of Porn online is going to soon endanger females more than ever. Look at India and Pakistan gang rapes today. Especially with the rise of secularism in the West, which is effectively paganism and diminishes the value of human life. Singapore is correct to censure entertainment which doesn’t contribute to humanity!</p>

<p>Organized evil has corrupted most of the World’s institutions. At least more people than ever are aware of it, though. </p>

<p>Millenials are choosing cyber-addiction over development of life skills and professional success. South Korea is correct to shut down internet gaming between Midnight &amp; 6AM! I wish the USA would do the same. I have a teenage child so I am qualified in making this assertion. </p>

<p>“Aliens” are more often than not demonic entities. </p>

<p>George Bush senior is probly Luciferian and involved in rigging Watergate to take down Nixon. </p>

<p>Child snatching for ritual torture and/or brain-wash procedures is far more prevalent than Americans want to know.</p>

<p>The debate on the US / Mexico is partially influenced by players in the narco-trade. This includes the CIA which is steered y shadow govt types which is another name for a cadre of evil men wearing suits except when they wear robes.</p>

<p>Electro magnetic / radio frequency (EM/RF) tech is the blackest pgm in the US military/intel kingdom. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This sub is now so heavily manipulated it&#39;s incredible. Both from the mod end of things, and from invisible brigades shaping the dialogue.</p>

<p>There have been a lot of posts hit the fun page of this sub recently that pose as a &quot;new take&quot; on a classic or popular topic. And the analysis takes the topic straight away from what has been the clear and obvious points of the matter.</p>

<p>In simpler terms, there are clear and obvious disinfo posts rising to the top.</p>

<p>I mean you&#39;ll get that anywhere online. Just be careful of how you view consensus.</p>

<p>Examples (off-site): anti-vaxxers are being pushed by the MSM intentionally. No one in science has made the claims against vaccines that you hear about on the news. The truth of the vaccine scandal is that of safety regulation and necessity of <em>some</em> vaccines, not the inefficacy or deadlines of vaccines as a class. It may even be that the &quot;community&quot; of anti-vaxxers has been provoked, or wholly created to have something &quot;crazy&quot; to report on. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the more extreme elements were directly funded by pharma interests, as they down out genuine criticism.</p>

<p>Same with flat Earth. I mean really?! Why flat Earth, why now? Simple. Because the public is starting to wake up to the lies. People are starting to see through police brutality, the 1%, concealed budgets... These are starting to become household concepts.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s important for MSM to bring out some bona-fide tinfoil hatters so people won&#39;t want to associate with those kinds of ideas.</p>

<p>Of course there have always been a few flat earthworks. But there&#39;s no. Way. It would have gotten the mainstream celebrity support it does now unless by design and careful marketing among the impressionable.</p>

<p>This sub is a huge part of that effort. Just realize that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your summary doesn&#39;t add up. For example, you did not mention a common denominator for motive, such as the most probable casue if they are connected, which would be that they knew too much. You implied that National Parks are used because there is so much land with so few witnesses, but there are many places in America where there is even more land with even fewer witnesses. You imply that this is only an American phenomenon, but that seems highly improbable if it is as epic as you imply (e.g. &quot;spiritual warfare&quot;).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Coming from a guy who used to work with NPS on a daily basis NPS entry level employees, which is there highest population of employees such as people who work on the trails, visitor centers, etc.. do not have a security clearance to know details of such matters. If NPS has hushed information about this sort of thing only higher ups have a chance of knowing something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep you are correct! The odd thing about finding clothes (in good OR bad condition) is that it&#39;s one of the common denomimators in these cases.</p>

<p>Most of these stories involve the inexplicable removal of clothing, regardless of age. One of the more disturbing ones involved a pair of pants turned partly inside out, near a pair of shoes that were unscathed after the boy had been gone for <em>over a year</em>...unfortunately some of his teeth and bones were there as well.</p>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes kids are found alive, but STILL have weird clothing-related abnormalities...kids missing one or both shoes, all of their clothes, random clothes (like shoes socks and shirt only).......my personal favorite is about a little girl who had a big sunhat on when she vanished, and later that day she was found alive, clothes torn up in a nearby tree, but no hat...and when someone asked her where her hat went, she said &quot;the big wolf ate it&quot;...YIKES</p>
