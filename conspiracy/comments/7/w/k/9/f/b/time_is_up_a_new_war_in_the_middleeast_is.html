        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">68</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/jeanfrancois111.html">jeanfrancois111</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First, the &quot;Israeli&quot; &quot;press&quot; if <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/army-intercepts-iranian-drone-that-breached-israeli-borders/">full of reports this morning</a> of <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7wjql7/army_shoots_down_iranian_drone_that_breached/">important clashes</a> on the northern front. </p>

<p>Second, anecdotal commentary by local redditors say the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7wjo95/israeli_fighter_jet_shot_down_by_syrian_fire/du0ymdc/">shit has hit the fan</a>.</p>

<p>Third, there is this &quot;Netanyahu being indicted by police&quot; nonsense, as if the power structure in &quot;Israel&quot; wasn&#39;t monolithic. This is meant as cover for war, i.e. so gullible people think &quot;he starts a war to distract from accusations against him&quot; (instead of seeing the actual, much more sinister motives).</p>

<p>Fourth, the market turmoil. The timing seems impeccable, and fits well into the dialectic.</p>

<p>Fifth, examine today&#39;s (edit: <strong>tomorrow&#39;s</strong>) date closely. Note you don&#39;t need to believe in numerology to understand the enemies of civilization do. Sometimes (often tbh) predicting events like this doesn&#39;t work, but <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7v26pp/time_for_some_tinfoil_hat_numerology/">sometimes it does.</a></p>

<p>TLDR: I predict the long-awaited war opposing &quot;Israel&quot; and Lebanon/Gaza/Iran to kick-off this week-end. I will not delete this post if it doesn&#39;t pan out, and I shall gladly accept the ridicule.</p>

<p>edit: <a href="https://twitter.com/LTCJonathan/status/962234436418002944">shit seems to be escalating indeed</a></p>

<p>edit 2: Al Masdar <a href="https://almasdarnews.com/article/breaking-israeli-pilot-shot-syrian-air-defenses-dies-injuries-hospital/">is reporting</a> the pilot of the F-16 that was shot down by Syrian&#39;s air defence has died of his wounds. Zionist mouthpieces are <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/condition-of-f-16-pilot-in-downed-jet-improves-after-emergency-surgery/">denying this</a> for the time being.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Me too. Obviously I am not sure, but I think it is likely enough to make a speculative/predictive post about it.</p>

<p>I have the intuition the Zionist leadership actually seeks to inflict much pain on the Jewish population (in addition of killing Arabs, but that is self-evident) . When/if the motives and end-goal become clearer in my mind I may post about it. In a nutshell I&#39;d say they might be looking for the Jewish population of Israel to turn (even more) against the Arab population of their country, ignite a full-blown civil conflict, and drive them out so they can &quot;annex&quot; the West Bank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7w4du9/israeli_police_chiefs_have_decided_to_recommend/dtz3yp6/">Here</a> is a recent comment of mine. It seems relevant enough to repost it in this thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israel has been warning/preparing a new war against Lebanon ever since its 2006 defeat. Ostensibly to &quot;counter the Hezbollah threat&quot;; Hezbollah is stronger than ever, it was made stronger by its involvement against America&#39;s/Israel&#39;s proxy war against Syria, and emboldened by the victory there. It has amassed considerable long-range ammunition and defense capabilities.</p>

<p>That&#39;s &quot;1st level reality&quot;. Mainstream, exoteric knowledge. (Level 0 will be &quot;Netanyahu goes to war to distract from the prosecution against him&quot;).</p>

<p>2nd level understanding has to do with natural gas deposits offshore Lebanon, Palestine and Gaza.</p>

<p>3rd level understanding involves eschatologic propaganda, i.e. convincing Muslims the Mahdi is about to appear; battles in Syria were chosen and timed for this too; for example Israel/ISIS destroyed Palmyra for this very purpose. For this to work Iran will have to be dragged into the conflict. Note Muslims aren&#39;t the only faith group targeted by this &quot;end-times&quot; propaganda.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter one&#39;s level of understanding; war is on the horizon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>About the 2nd level:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. There&#39;s a war going on already. What war you ask?</p>

<p>Take a look at Syria. Take a look at who&#39;s involved. If you really want to know what&#39;s going on don&#39;t expect the mainstream media to tell you... because that&#39;s not their job.</p>

<p>What you do is look at who the players are and think about what each one wants.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Syria - wants to remain intact with the same government.</p></li>
<li><p>Iran - wants to their ally to survive. They also know they&#39;re next on the list if/when Syria and Assad go down.</p></li>
<li><p>Russia - wants to support their ally and to retain their only naval base in the Mediterranean.</p></li>
<li><p>Turkey - views Syria as a former province in the Ottoman Empire (what Turkey used to be). Turkey has a problem with Kurds wanting independence. Kurds live in Syria too. Independent Kurdish nation (or region) in Syria means trouble for Turkey. This is why they sent their forces into Syria.</p></li>
<li><p>Israel - wants to turn Syria into a failed state. Eliminate an opponent and eliminate the ally of another opponent (Iran). Syria as failed state means offshore gas deposits are up for grabs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>US - Wants Assad out and wants to see Syria broken up into smaller pieces as part of the ongoing &quot;Piece Process&quot;. </p>

<p>Things get murky really quick because you&#39;ve got Russia Iran and Syria on one side and US, Israel and Turkey on the other. There&#39;s some minor friction between Turkey and the US over American support for the Kurds against ISIS as well as the Assad regime. But the US dropped the Kurds like a hot potato and Turkey is making sure they don&#39;t get established inside Syria.</p>

<p>The real red line here is the presence of US forces inside Syria itself. Russia and Iran really prefer to maintain the status quo. They haven&#39;t been willing to launch a direct attack against the US forces in Syria... yet.</p>

<p>The amazing thing is how nobody sees this situation for what it really is. It&#39;s not a Syrian civil war. It might have started out as one, but you can&#39;t call it a civil war when forces from 5 outside nations have gotten involved and grouped themselves up into two opposing sides.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for mentioning this. Quite a few areas in the Middle East with significant Shia populations. Iran likes to promote itself as a protector for these while using them as leverage for it&#39;s own machinations.</p>

<p>One thing few people are aware of: Saudi Arabia has some Shia groups living in some of it&#39;s biggest oil producing areas. Makes them as nervous as fuck and this is part of the reason why they&#39;d like to see Iran go down for good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I purposefully didn&#39;t detail this, as some people dislike such stuff so much it tends to distract them from the main point. Also note I am neither a specialist nor a &quot;believer&quot; in numerology (although I acknowledge synchronicities arise in nature and that numbers are not merely an abstraction), it&#39;s just that I&#39;ve observed (and I think I have a pretty good idea) how TPTB think.</p>

<p>So tomorrow is the 11/02 : as with all 11th day of any month, it is significant.</p>

<p>Secondly: 11-02-2-0-18 adds up to 33</p>

<p>Thirdly this week-end <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnival">Carnival</a> season opens across the world. As you may know that is a very old pagan holiday celebrating fertility and the return of sunlight. Christianity merely incorporated this pagan &quot;festival&quot; in its own tradition (as the beginning of Lent).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From the anthropological point of view, carnival is a reversal ritual, in which social roles are reversed and norms about desired behavior are suspended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is a holiday that is typically celebrating with gluttony, orgies and transvestism.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Traditionally, the feast also was a time to indulge sexual desires, which were supposed to be suppressed during the following fasting. Before Lent [fasting] began, all rich food and drink were consumed in what became a giant celebration that involved the whole community, and is thought to be the origin of Carnival.</p>

<p>Friend, tell me honestly, do you think your contribution here is original? Do you feel intelligent, or superior? Do you feel proud because you took calculus in college and can solve simple differential equations?</p>

<p>Yes, numerology is not science. Yes, the way &quot;numerologists&quot; count can vary. No, it is not a consistent discipline.</p>

<p>Feel better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are typically 3 or 4 different ways date numbers are added, from what I&#39;ve gathered. Sometimes the year isn&#39;t even counted. Sometimes it&#39;s only the last 2 digits. When the full year is counted, it is usually done like this. Don&#39;t ask me why, I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>Regardless of how you count, it is a fool&#39;s errand to rely only on that. You need other corroborating indications to suspect you might be onto something.</p>

<p>On most &quot;numerology significant dates&quot;, nothing happens. Most times the TPTB do something significant/evil (such as the start of a war, or a major false flag terror attack), the date is numerologically significant. Numerologically signifiant dates are a very small minority in any given year.</p>
