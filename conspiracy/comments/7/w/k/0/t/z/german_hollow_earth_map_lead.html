        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">46</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-10 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Zenyx_.html">Zenyx_</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hey guys, found some really spooky coincidences when researching more about the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/xtuKI">German Hollow Earth map</a> that popped up a while back around here. Some of you also may remember the <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-09-antarctica-weddell-polynya-kiel-climate.html">Weddell Polynya</a>, an odd pocket of warm water in a sea of ice surrounding the Antarctic continent. A group of researchers studied the warm current that was being produced in the Maud Rise and Maud Seamount (64S 0E) and they concluded with some <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2008GL034629/full">very interesting data</a> about the current to the left of the Seamount, at the coordinates <a href="https://imgur.com/a/qJiln">64S, 1E</a>. Scientists do not know what is going on, only that the upwelling and circular flow could be caused by actual warmer water coming up from below. Now I know some of you may have already realized this but at the exact point at which the odd warm current is coming, a German Hollow Earth Map has the entrance to Hollow Earth: 64S, 1E.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? Did the &quot;prankster&quot; that supposedly created the Hollow Earth document know about the Weddell Polynya at the exact location he specified? Did he know about the  EXACT location of the upwelling, something only discovered in 2005? Did he correctly know about the general shape and slope of the Maud Seamount and Maud Rise by pulling it out of his ass? Seriously, take a look at <a href="https://imgur.com/a/EjmOC">this image</a> of the entrance and the measurements of distance they use corresponding with the line of the &quot;rocks&quot; of the Antarctic continent above. Is it a coincidence that 100 miles into the journey you encounter a steep hike in the terrain(Maud Seamount is 100miles southeast of 64S, 1E)?</p>

<p>OR.... Or, is this document real, and is the information in it worth checking out atleast? If this was a joke or a hoax, it would be a very lucky or well planned out one.  </p>

<p>TL;DR: That weird ocean current you heard about might just be the entrance to Agartha.   </p>

<p>Bonus Document: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/eYZzo">Karl Unger&#39;s Letter</a>  and <a href="http://www.imperialgermans.com/documents.html">link to website with more</a>  </p>

<p>Translation:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear old comrade,
This message will be a surprise to you. The U Boat 209 has made it, the Earth is HOLLOW! Dr. Haushofer and Hess were right. The whole crew is doing well, but they cannot come back. We are no prisoners. I am certain, that this message will reach you, it is the last contact with the U 209. We will meet again comrade. I am worried about the people that have to live on the surface, since the Fuehrer is gone.
God bless our Germany always.
With hearty greetings,
Karl Unger</p>

<p>thought experiment: you have incredible manipulating/propaganda power, someone finds something that brings up questions that are a little too difficult to easily handle, in order to &quot;deal&quot; you (as a person with some power) create a disinfo campaign or a over-the-top cult-following of &quot;crazies&quot; and the entire thing is quickly dismissed by the masses, mission accomplished</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In support of your theory: The lowest point of descent would be 500m according to the diagram. A German U-Boat had a crush depth of about 300m. I&#39;d say that fact alone suggests there is little to no chance of it being an authentic document. However, why meticulously create a fake to only make such a massive blunder as not considering the maximum dive depth at the time it was supposedly written? Perhaps to purposefully send the message that its maker, and thereby the information within, is utterly ridiculous. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah a quick solution to an issue like a real document leak is to change one critical piece of information to some nonsense, this makes most people dismiss the entire piece as nonsense rather than consider it may have been altered to appear nonsense, the crush depth thing Is interesting in itself. If you read escape from the deep (a book about the american sub that sunk at 55m and people survived [only to be put into a japanese war camp...]) you can learn alot about submarines.</p>

<p>I wonder, If you are in an ice-tunnel wouldn&#39;t the pressure from the water be much less than in your simply 400m below the surface surrounded by the entire oceans pressure. Basically what im trying to say is would the ice surrounding the water-tunnel negate some of the pressure found at the same depth in regular under-water conditions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s not hollow like a balloon that is the claim but rather having large cavernous tunnels that may be habitable.  We already have examples like Carlsbad and various sinotes which are known.  There’s no reason such caverns are impossible in Antarctica.

<p>tunnels and caverns doesn&#39;t make the earth hollow. there is still a core at the center that distributes heat/energy throughout the entire earth. The inner core is made up of super solid iron,  and the outer core is made up of molten metal (nickel, iron alloy). Therefore, it is impossible for the earth to be hollow because there must be something at the center holding it all together, and the intense heat makes it impossible for anything to live there. the hollow earth concept is so incredibly stupid and nonsensical that it could only have been conceived for the purpose of discrediting legitimate conspiracy theorists (similar to flat earth, or bigfoot) that threaten the establishment.</p>
