       I have been interested in the allegations that the Assad regime has used chemical weapons (CW's) during the Syrian Civil War, and have been examining information for some time, trying to piece things together for a clearer understanding of what has been going on, and why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sources on details of the attacks hard to come by, and I used the most reliable I was able to find (mostly Wikipedia and the Lancet... if anyone knows of better sources, please post links)
      </p>
      <p>
       I am nowhere near finished putting all this together, but given the
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7we6tb/us_sec_of_defense_mattis_admits_there_was_no/">
        "we have no evidence"
       </a>
       bombshell recently dropped by Secretary of Defense Mattis, I could see that there is much confusion and misunderstanding on these matters, so I'm posting what I have now.
      </p>
      <p>
       (
       <em>
        Note: I have not had time to fully proofread all of the material, so if there are errors
       </em>
       ,
       <strong>
        <em>
         (mea culpa!)
        </em>
       </strong>
       ,
       <em>
        please let me know so I can fix.
       </em>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The evidence I have found so far has shocked me
       </strong>
       . There have been far fewer incidents of alleged CW use than I had imagined, and the number of persons reportedly killed or injured by such weapons is far lower than I had expected to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the data I have compiled so far:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          The number of deaths from CW's is lower that I expected:
         </strong>
         The total number of deaths in the Syrian war, civilian and combatant, is estimated at 400,000, while the total number of deaths attributed to chemical weapons is
         <em>
          1,020
         </em>
         --
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ECrLhPB.png">
          0.26% of the total.
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Civilian CW casualties are magnitudes higher than are combatant casualties
         </strong>
         : with death rates at
         <strong>
          254/1
         </strong>
         and injury rates at
         <strong>
          14/1
         </strong>
         , respectively.
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/QtSJHOc.png">
          See here for the figures

         ,
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/8qR330k.png">
          and here for a better visualization
         </a>
         . Hell of a way to run a war, no?

       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Regarding civilian casualties, the number reportedly caused by CW's is surprisingly small
         </strong>
         . In January 2018, The peer-reviewed
         <strong>
          <em>
           Lancet
          </em>
         </strong>
         ,
         <em>
          "one of the world's oldest and best known general medical journals"
         </em>
         , published the following:
         <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214109X17304692">
          Patterns of civilian and child deaths due to war-related violence in Syria: a comparative analysis from the Violation Documentation Center dataset, 2011–16
         </a>
         <em>
          (Note: The deaths reported ALL occurred in areas that were NOT under the control of Assad or the Syrian government)
         </em>
         Only about 1% were attributed to chemical weapons. I created a pie chart to help visualize the
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KUU33bN.png">
          number of deaths by cause.
         </a>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          On the whole, the chemical weapons reportedly used in Syria have NOT been very effective
         </strong>
         at killing and maiming. Of the 69  incidents recorded on Wikipedia, 28 (40%)
         <em>
          didn't kill or injure anyone
         </em>
         . Here is a bar chart illustrating the numbers of reported
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/U8Gaczw.png">
          deaths and injuries to both civilians and combatants.

       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          92% of all reported civilian deaths occurred in only 3 instances
         </strong>
         : The infamous twin attacks in Ghouta (August 21, 2013) accounted
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Y9f94cQ.png">

           837

          deaths,
         </a>

         <strong>
          100
         </strong>
         more. The remaining 79 reported deaths were spread out over the other 66 reported incidents, giving these an average of ~1.2 deaths per incident.

       <li>
        <p>
         <strong>
          Of the few military/combatant casualties that were reported, Assad's forces had the highest number
         </strong>
         , reporting 1 death and 66 injuries. These were followed by Kurdish forces, who suffered 3 deaths and 12 injuries. The rebel Free Syrian Army
         <em>
          (Assad's enemies)
         </em>
         reported ZERO deaths and 2 injuries.

         <em>
          (see above)

         . Second prize goes to chlorine, which, has reportedly been used on about 30 occasions
         <em>
          (5 times more often than Sarin)

         , but is responsible for only 18 reported deaths, and 312 injuries (all civilian). For more details,

        HYPOTHESIS
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       From my the info above and my observations over the course of the war...
       <strong>
        <em>
         I suspect
        </em>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         That
         <em>
          the overall public perception
         </em>
         of the number of deaths and injuries caused by CW use in Syria (by Assad's forces, or anyone else) is grossly inflated and flawed.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That
         <em>
          this flawed public perception is not organic
         </em>
         , but is the product of an intentional propaganda campaign conceived by western governments/intelligence agencies, and entrenched into the public mind with the willing cooperation of major western media organs.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That the goal of this deceptive misrepresentation was (is) to change public opinion to favor/accept western intervention in the Syrian war.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Moreover, I suspect that the motive for misleading us is the same that compelled them to lie about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's (non-existent)
       <em>
        "Weapons of Mass Destruction"
       </em>
       :
       <strong>
        <em>
         Powerful players have long wanted regime change in Syria
        </em>
       </strong>
       , as they wanted (and got) in Iraq and Libya, but that isn't likely to happen without direct western intervention, and THAT isn't going to happen if they can't find a way to get public support, so in their minds, they must find a way to convince a war-weary and skeptical public public that they need to support direct western intervention in Syria so that its "monster" of a leader and his evil regime can be put down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemical weapons suck on the battlefield, but the mere mention of these are a
       <strong>
        <em>
         major
        </em>
       </strong>
       trigger of emotion and reflexive repulsion in the human mind. So for propaganda purposes, CW's can be a
       <strong>
        <em>
         Tzar Bomba!
        </em>
       </strong>
       , or, at least that's what the Big Players are hoping for.
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep your eye on the puppets and the pawns, and mind the False Flags. The ones they've pulled in Syria have failed, so we shouldn't be surprised if someone conveniently linked to (Syria, Lebanon, Russia
       <strong>
        <em>
         IRAN
        </em>
       </strong>
       ) should strike using CW's in Europe, the US, or maybe South Korea?
      </p>
      <p>
       God forbid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spread the word. The more the people know, the less power they have to manipulate us.

       the most fucked up part is how easy it is to provide evidence of a chlorine attack, just go buy some pool chemicals and bam you have the chemical signature present.
      </p>
      <p>
       the problem with chemical weapons from a use standpoint is it basically greenlights international intervention. no leader with a 1/4 of a brain would ever risk when some one like the US is foaming at the mouth for an excuse to invade and depose you.
      </p>
      <p>
       tactically they are all but useless unless used broadly either. i mean they work great when you have a long dug in front, but they make almost no sense to use in an urban setting because they actually make it dangerous for your own troops to enter the are afterwards unless they decay quickly after they are deployed.

       I heard and argument that a lot of assads strategy was to depopulate rebel areas, because he didnt have enough troops to hold the ground otherwise. Chemical weapons in this scenario would be used to drive people out of an area, not necessarily kill them.

       The 7th report of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint Investigative Mechanism about the attacks on Umm Hawsh and Khan Shaykhun is pretty interesting:

       Wow, I have yet to read the linked report, but the quotes and your notes in the post were eye-popping:

       Yes it is. From further down:

       No, what it really exposes is the excellent quality of health care offered by the enemies of Assad. Their al Nusra medical teams are
       <em>
        so good
       </em>
       that they start treating the injured
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       the injuries are even inflicted, and their ambulances are
       <em>
        so fast
       </em>
       that they can move patients 125 km (77 miles) in under 30 minutes -- an average speed of 250 kph (154 mph)

       Americans and Europeans should be ashamed. Their health care systems pale in comparison to the speed and quality of the amazing

       There are far more effective ways to kill in this day and age than chlorine barrel bombs and sarin gas. Im sure Assad as well as his generals are quite aware of this.

       The open secret is that Obama reversed course on Syria and the “red line” when NSA provided intercepts/analysis that Syrian army units did not fire those CW rounds. US / Israeli relations tanked thereafter, coincidentally.

       From what I've read, the not-so-open secret is that the Ghouta chemical attacks were carried out not by Assad, but by rebels that were trained and equipped by the CIA and Israeli commandos in Jordan.
