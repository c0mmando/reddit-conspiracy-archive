        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">204</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-08 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/SixVISix.html">SixVISix</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I can&#39;t find anything in the media, anything by CDC but there&#39;s a respiratory illness that is affecting virtually everyone I know. The symptoms match RSV but with longer duration, and blood in sputum is happening with more people than not. I can positively say 23 people including myself here have encountered it and the reproduction rate exceeds anything I&#39;ve seen in years of ER nursing.</p>

<p>It starts with a rapid onset fever, spiking as much as 104 F in the hours of initial symptoms. The fever gives way to a severe headache followed by a day or 2 of asymptomatic/afebrile physical disposition.</p>

<p>After this, the onset of loss of voice, &quot;sore&quot; or &quot;scratchy&quot; throat hits for approx 12 hours then respiratory symptoms of barking, hacking dry cough that can produce blood. For weeks.</p>

<p>Zithromycin, the typical go-to for respiratory infections of bacterial origin, is useless. Once the respiratory part settles in, it is brutal and relentless. Antiviral therapy may be effective but I have not seen it used. If it&#39;s RSV or some bastardized version of it, it&#39;s not getting any media coverage AT ALL, yet it is EVERYWHERE. Go to gas station, clerk is coughing his ass off. Go to restaurant, server is coughing until she excuses herself. At work, 9 employees hit with symptoms in a single day.</p>

<p>I live in central US and I&#39;m curious if anyone is seeing similar symptoms where they live. I relate this to r/conspiracy because I question the absolute lack of coverage regarding this and I question why more focus isn&#39;t being put on this. This is not the flu. This is not a cold. This is not bronchitis. If it&#39;s RSV and it&#39;s an outbreak of this scale, it should be gaining a large amount of coverage based on the mortality rates typically associated with RSV.</p>

<p>Thanks for your input.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely anecdotal, my wife&#39;s been super sick since last Friday, but with no respiratory illness.  Took her into the doctors yesterday and they were really suprised there was no respiratory issues.  I mean, to the point they asked 5 or 6 times, which I found surprising since she was right there and they could see she didn&#39;t.  Seemed to me like something was up, but chalked it up to the flu that&#39;s been going around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s what I was think till I read your post.  But on a side notes, one of my clients said he got the flu and the doctors told him he&#39;d have respiratory issues for 2-3 weeks and to only come in if he had severe pain in his chest.  That was a week ago and saw him earlier today, seemed well enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Influenza is a pretty broad scope, so I didn&#39;t initially dismiss that - until the blood. Coughing blood is typically associated with more severe disease like TB or RSV that has progressed into severe status. Coughing blood combined with influenze would tell me it&#39;s a new strain of influenza, which would then force the question: does this new strain mean they have to admit the flu vaccine is a complete joke?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what I was looking for. Another central/south central state with these symptoms. IF this is RSV, it is a unique strain. And it&#39;s strange to me that there&#39;s a virtual media blackout on the subject. I&#39;ve seen headlines for RSV in small towns, let alone spreading state to state. RSV by definition seems mild. It isn&#39;t. The mortality rate for it, particularly if you&#39;re immune system is already compromised/underdeveloped, is no joke. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My son and I have both been sick the past week.. I first started having symptoms Sunday Jan 28th and am just now feeling mostly better, though I still have the cough and low energy. Very yucky and productive cough, but no blood thank goodness.  Strangely, my son didn&#39;t have any of the respiratory issues but he had a low-grade fever for several days (I did for about a week). He was out of school Wednesday through Monday, and the school said a lot of kids were out and averaging about a week that they are out. It hit me a lot harder than it did him. And I never get sick. It&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve gotten sick. And this shit was gnarly. I still feel kind of shellshocked and stupid, not back to normal yet. I&#39;ll PM you my state, I don&#39;t want to share it openly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>FL here. Sounds like what hit my house. 3 out of 5 family members hit hard. It has been 2 weeks and hubby and I are still coughing. Most other symptoms have subsided. The fever was scary. Daughter reached 102.9.  This area of FL has been hit pretty hard. Some have blamed red tide along with whatever respiratory bug is going around.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Texan here and yes. Few friends and I About two weeks ago all got the “flu”.  I collapsed at work from (what I think) a nasty respiratory infection. No fever or anything. Just basically extremely week and my lungs were coved with brown crap that I was coughing up. </p>

<p>A week of extra strength Mucinex, amoxicillin, and Generic cold and flu cough syrup cleared it up in a matter of 5 days.  I tend to have an occasion cough but I that might just be allergies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Both of us.  Daycare said no other kids were sick.  It&#39;s weird too because what happened is she came home sick with 100 degree fever Monday.  Then, next morning burning up at 103, hair damp, and super mopey.  Seemed mostly like a mild cold with a fever.  Next day still not great but fever almost normal - eating ok and running around all sassy like normal but with a cough.  She seemed almost over whatever it was except for some yellow nasal stuff and a cough that is consistent but not often enough to be a huge issue.  Today, apparently, all day she was awesome and then all the sudden she has a fever again and is freaking out.</p>

<p>I ended up with the firey sore throat and fever Tuesdya and my chest is getting progressively worse.  It is the most painful chest cold experience I can remember in the last 5-10 years.  Tiny bit of blood earlier in the week but nothing since but it is extremely painful and feels tight in the area just above the center of my boobs (to me that feels like it is my very unscientific term of &quot;deep chest&quot;).</p>

<p>She had no blood as far as I can tell but it appears she is now getting worse after better which is a first for us &amp; this is also the first time out of no less than 10 child illnesses where it has passed to me (so whatever it is, I have no immunity).</p>

<p>It seems to stay in your system for a long time, not really debilitating you, but being a major nuisance.</p>

<p>Over the past few days I&#39;ve noticed a lot of congestion in my nose and chest. I assumed that they were maybe spraying the fields with something I was sensitive to, but who knows.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The week before September 1st I began to feel sick. I already have an autoimmune disease, but this soon turned into something else. I&#39;ve had pneumonia before, and I knew that&#39;s what it was. When I got to the ER, my O2 level was 88. I didn&#39;t have a fever and I don&#39;t even know how to explain this in anyway that makes sense: mouth thermometers do not work on me. I&#39;d figured that out the year before when I had an even worse pneumonia. The EMT took my temp with an ear thermometer and it read 105,2. In the hospital it said 97.6 using two different mouth machines. Then they did a forehead scan and it was 105.6. I KNEW I had a fever, I could feel it... And the weird thing is they never diagnosed pneumonia, just systemic Inflammatory response syndrome. </p>

<p>ANYWAY, I tried to explain this to the doc. I couldn&#39;t even breathe in deep enough for a good x-ray and a fever didn&#39;t show up, but I knew I had one. He diagnosed me with asthma, which is insulting bc ofc I have asthma. I got steroids in an IV and it felt like I was being stabbed with shards of glass down my back and legs. He begrudgingly prescribed cough medicine. Well, I knew he was full of shit. The next day I went to my GP and another x-ray showed pneumonia. Thing is, I&#39;ve taken two rounds of levequin, a round of amoxicxlin and two z-paks since then and it. Keeps. Coming. 
Back. Maybe it is RSV.</p>

<p>Sorry for the length, but I like to think I&#39;m not insane. Idk if I trust doctors anymore :(</p>

Also was very much a thing over the past few months amongst friends up in Pittsburgh PA, so it&#39;s definitely over here in Appalachia.

Purge the mucus best I could. What I&#39;ve seen seems to attack the respiratory system for sure, and same could be said. My girlfriend is  TSA agent and just the other morning she woke up complaining of feeling sick.

    <div class="md"><p>Here in Boston? I&#39;m very solitary so very there&#39;s little personal contact with others = no idea. One way to protect yourself from getting flu or other respiratory infections is to wear a dust mask or surgical mask when you go outside during an epidemic.  I do and I don&#39;t care if people think I&#39;m weird.  I already know that!  Also keep your hands away from your nose, mouth and eyes until you wash your hands, and do that first thing when you get home from outside somewhere.  Carry some 91% alcohol with a proportionate amount of grapefruit seed extract added, and use it often when outside, like if you ride buses and grap the poles or hand straps while onboard. (find propotions online?)</p>

<p>Doctors could prescribe something, but there are absolutely effective natural remedies. Elderberry syrup is used to prevent and treat respiratory infections, and thyme (herb) is antibacterial and antiviral, and a good cough supressant.  Thyme is the source of thymol, which is used in hospital disinfectants, as is grapefruit seed extract. In anticipation of negative comments re: natural/herbal treatments-please don&#39;t ask for sources that vouch for their effectiveness.  Either you&#39;ll seek info and maybe try treatments or not. </p>

<p>I’m not your fuqqing google machine. If you’re finally ready to provide some much needed evidence to back up your insane original claim, go ahead and do so. Otherwise, please stop responding with this drivel that has no bearing on your original assertion whatsoever beyond the fact that they all happen to mention the word “flu.”</p>

<p>--Absenteeism rates at all Eureka City schools have climbed since Tuesday, ranging from 13 percent at Washington to 32 percent at Zoe Barnum.</p>

<p>“Public Health had set 20 percent absenteeism as a trigger point for closure,” Baird said, “but given the broad distribution of the virus we think the prudent course of action is to close all 10 schools.”</p>

<p>As of yesterday, no schools in the Eureka City district had reached the 20 percent threshold.--</p>

<p>Having same issues currently as OP. 5/5 roommates have it. Family members and friends have it. Thought it was flu but doctors don’t have a diagnosis.</p>

<p>Starts with crummy feelings, quickly a very high fever followed by a day or two of fatigue almost unable to move. After the fever died down started to get a bad cough and throat irritation. This has lead to chest congestion and a near constant cough throughout the day but more severe at night. </p>

<p>I’m personally on day 7 of this, though some friends have had it less, 4-5 days. Others almost two weeks now. </p>

<p>This has been extremely concerning as I’ve watched over 30 people around me become sick with these symptoms. I have heard of far more with similar symptoms. Seems to have started around January. </p>

<p>I wonder if there is some sort of outbreak that’s not being talked about or being called seasonal flu when it’s not. </p>

<p>Has anyone noticed any throat sores in the back of the mouth ? A relative has them bad and I’ve noticed my throat is very irritated but no open sores. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My elderly mother, in Austin, was hospitalized for pneumonia on Christmas Day. Low blood oxygen due to severe congestion.  She had no excess fluid in her lungs and failed to respond to antibiotics. They did further testing and determined she did not have flu or bacterial pneumonia but HPMV virus. Doctors said it was very rare.  Wikipedia states most kids have had HMPV by age 5.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Richmond, Virginia reporting in. My girlfriend and most of her department at work have been sick recently. Patient First told her that she had a sinus infection and prescribed Amoxicillin. After her symptoms worsened, they prescribed a Z pack and prednisone. We went to the ER today because she&#39;s been still sick and super lethargic. Must have had a worse cough than I thought because they prescribed robotussin wth codine. Their assessment was &quot;probably acute bronchitis or possibly pneumonia&quot;. I don&#39;t think she had anything courageous or I&#39;d have gotten sick, too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the context of infection, hemoptysis usually only occurs in bronchitis, pneumonia, TB, and various fairly rare fungal infections (aspergillosis, coccidio, etc.) The barking cough is common in croup which is usually a parainfluenza infection. This virus can also cause a viral pneumonia. RSV can also cause croup and can become viral pneumonia or open the door for secondary bacterial pneumonia. </p>

I also have been waking up most nights for the past 8 weeks literally choking and unable to breathe, and I invariably end up dry coughing and wheezing or a long time, until it results in finally coughing up loads of bloody sputum. I&#39;ve tried antibiotics, rescue inhalers, allergy treatments, nebulizer treatment, and nothing helps. I have good insurance and a good doctor but they&#39;re lost. I&#39;m exhausted.

<blockquote>
<p>At the heart of this &quot;condition&quot;, from the perspective of this researcher,  is the presence of a sub-micron cross-domain bacteria that is extremely resistant to extinction.  This postulated bacteria has the property of developing the growth of an enclosing sheath, or filament which further serves to house, protect and transport these same bacteria.  This sheath, or enclosing filament, also exists in its most primitive form at the sub-micron level.  This protective and resilient sheath appears to be composed largely of a keratin (protein) construct, but it also remains impervious and inpenetrable in comparison to other keratin structures such as hair.  </p>

<p>After this, the onset of loss of voice, &quot;sore&quot; or &quot;scratchy&quot; throat hits for approx 12 hours then respiratory symptoms of barking, hacking dry cough that can produce blood. For weeks.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You have eerily described, to the hour, exactly what me ad my family just experienced. We are in WI. Son&#39;s elementary classmates have been absent en masse the past 2 weeks with similar. Word among parents is this is the flu, but this doesn&#39;t seem like flu to me. My family has opted to stay out of the doc&#39;s office with this, and recover at home. Also, no coughing blood for any of us.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this cold fucking SUCKED... HARD. With a 6 yr old, I&#39;ve had my share of nasty little germs in recent years, but this one wiped me the fuck out. I&#39;m still at 50% and I&#39;m on day 5. Keep asking your questions!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Describes what my mom has been battling for over a month. She&#39;s been embarrassed about the coughing (which leaves her totally winded), has been very tired, and has tried to hide the bloody phlegm from me. I didn&#39;t catch it from her, but I rarely catch anything so Im not sure that&#39;s a good indicator. She&#39;s been calling it a cold all along, however, so she clearly thinks it&#39;s something she caught. Could be coincidental since it doesn&#39;t seem to be as contagious as you have described. This is in southern New England. Thank you for this post - there should be a whole sub dedicated to crowd sourced reporting of contagious illnesses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Azithromycin is always useless on adults because they use the same dosage as for a toddler.</p>

<p>The other go-to antibiotic, Amoxicillin, is literally no more effective than placebo when taken orally.  I can find you studies showing this for pretty much every ailment it&#39;s used for, and the mechanism of inaction is well understood (it falls apart immediately in even mild acid, so it never reaches the bloodstream.  Injected it would probably actually work).  Yet it&#39;s been the 1st line recommendation since the 1950s, so you have to go to the doctor 3x before actually getting real antibiotics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I work in a large Portland ER and we have seen a dramatic uptick in respiratory illness accompanied with fever. Having said that many of these patients are testing positive for the flu, RSV, or a known pneumatic bacteria,. Another thing to consider is that fever (sepsis) being considered a potentially dangerous symptom is only recently being acknowledged by the medical community. As we now carefully index patients for sepsis we are discovering higher rates of it. Truth is though the flu vaccine is a yearly crap shoot with unpredictable strains that are not identified early enough to be developed for vaccination getting through. And despite the impression of certainty that the WHO and CDC websites give about their understanding of the flu it is anything but. One small genetic mutation, which everybody agrees is a common event in viruses, could turn an average season of sniffles into a catastrophic event.</p>

I&#39;ve been through two rounds of steroid packs and two round of different antibiotics, and still have a faint cough (it&#39;s much better, but still annoying). The symptoms started similar to what you&#39;ve described here, but I remember specifically waking up with a very bad sore throat in the early morning of the day it got really bad back in November. I&#39;ve seen two doctors in the states, and one doctor in Germany about it. I&#39;ve had multiple CBC tests done, and the only thing that&#39;s changed is my MPV went up to an abnormal level (but this could be related to a ski injury I got over holiday). The doctor abroad and the two in the states just say it must be some virus that won&#39;t go away, so I&#39;m just taking vitamin c every day at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same story for pretty much other side of the world in my case Netherlands. </p>

<p>It started with a tingling sensation around palate.
Few hours later felt like I had a beginning sore throat 
An other few hour later, onset of rhinorrhea. But in surprisingly large amounts, I could feel it running down my throat at night. 
Late that night, fever. But only just for that night.
Next morning blood in sputum.
All the above stopped within 3~4 days. Now, just a occasional cough (day 8) </p>

<p>But, It didn&#39;t progress into worse. Like many others around me seem to had and like OP describes (5 in my direct circle)</p>

<p>The only variable between me and my inner circle which I can come up with. </p>

<p>I had h1n1, they did not.</p>

<p>I use dextroamphetamine (Adderall-ish) non of them use that.</p>

<p>I use marijuana on a sporadic basis (Max 2~3 joints per week). They all do not</p>

<p>I don&#39;t drink alcohol. They all do</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not the disease that&#39;s the problem. It&#39;s the toxic environment that&#39;s drying us up and making us even more susceptible to the diseases already around us. I bought a humidifier when I realized my room wad at 20% humidity. Now it&#39;s at 45% and I recovered within 3 days.</p>
