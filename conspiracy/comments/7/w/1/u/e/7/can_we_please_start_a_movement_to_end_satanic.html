    <div class="md"><p>Well see, thing is it <em>is</em> just a crazy conspiracy. The &quot;Satanic ritual child abuse&quot; thing all started in 1980 with a book called <em>Michelle Remembers.</em> It was written by a Canadian psychiatrist about one of his patients. The psychiatrist hypnotized his patient and she &quot;recovered&quot; memories that had been &quot;lost.&quot; This went on for hundreds of hours of sessions. During that time the patient told stories about being subject to Satanic rituals, including witnessing the summoning of Satan himself.</p>

<p>Trouble is, it was all of it, every word, bull. Not a single claim the patient made under hypnosis could be corroborated. Like she described a car crash that never happened, for instance. Also in her fantasies she was an only child but in real life she had sisters.</p>

<p>A lie can make it halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on, of course, so people read the book and thought it was factual. That it was 100% fraudulent didn&#39;t come out until later, by which time a lot of people were convinced there was this epidemic of Satanism going on.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the whole story. Literally everything else about Satanic ritual abuse follows on from the one false account. No actual evidence of it has <em>ever</em> been documented. At all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If those are convictions, then it seems law enforcement already has a handle on it.  ~100 cases over a decade is tragic, but with so many more large-scale issues out there there&#39;d have to be some evidence that there were orders of magnitude more cases going on in secret.  Given the history of baseless scaremongering around this issue (the DnD panic comes to mind, or the above cited book) that&#39;s going to be a hard sell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fear = energy. If you can&#39;t create by yourself, what is the most easy to provoke in an other to be used by you, especially in a child?</p>

<p>It does not matter what you believe or call them. It is what &quot;they&quot; believe and follow, often just as blinded as some religious and even science people follow their god. Blinded for all other , becouse of fear, ego, ignorance or indifferance.</p>

<p>If you could almost literary split a mind in two, how would you do this and why would this be usefull?</p>

<p>Could it be usefull to some to corrupt the most energetic creative beings on earth as soon as possible? And if so, would it help to create an enviroment to support this kind of corruption?</p>

<p>Could the wave of political correctness and forced split between sexes and identity be a part? Why do very young childeren suddenly need education over this? And even worse why are so many young children suddenly in need of hormone cures..?</p>

<p>Could this &quot;religious&quot; pedo stuff also be linked to pizza and/ or elsa? Could it make sence to desensitize children and make them more receptical for futher devolution of our human values? Could it be that the energy &quot;transmitted&quot; by the pedo symbols is directly interfearing with pedos who know about this shit? Could it be that it is used as a form of mk ultra or such to stimulate the pedos more and more into action?</p>

<p>Pedophilia was and is a huge problem for as long as our history is known. The time of revelation is starting to show us more and more of all this shit and how it is connected to our world. This will cause people to be angry and call for revenge, this is as intended by some and needs to be avoided by all.</p>

<p>I know it is hard to not have sad and dark feelings yourself while you learn about this stuff, but don&#39;t get stuck at those feelings, but try to give it a place until you have figured out how to deal with it best.</p>

<p>Please don&#39;t forget, there is always another side of the story. And while i do condamm pedo stuff and all people involved, i also know that some are grown into this and are miss-used and miss-led from childhood. Also many will be chantaged and threatend to keep the truth hidden.</p>

<p>So while i know all this dark will be stopped and uncoverd soon, i hope all people do realise nobody can&#39;t judge them all before we know the truths of all.</p>

<p>Justice is needed, but we can&#39;t judge yet before we know all facts, or at least as much as possible. Playing your own judge wont help anybody and will only cause more chaos.</p>

<p>I do know it will all end well and all the dark will move away for most people, but be careful while trying to wake people up to these dark facts. And please try to avoid the mental traps of fear, anger or revenge, they have helped nobody yet sofar as i know.</p>

<p>We all have build this maze we are in and some are using the power of humanity to create their desired reality through us. They are using all tech and controll methods the can think of and sadley enough pedopilia and sacrefices are a huge part of the same mess.</p>

<p>Fear and Love show us our way to this maze we are in. The truth will show you how to escape, Love will shine a ligh so you don&#39;t need to stumble too much, trust will help along the way. Your ego might be of help or create some problems ;)</p>

<p><a href="http://ra-info.org/faqs/ra-convictions/">List of Satanic Ritual Abuse convictions</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Three teenagers were convicted in the cult killings of three 8-year-old boys. Michael Wayne &#39;Damien&quot; Echols, 19, and Charles Jason Baldwin, 16, were convicted March 18, 1994, on three counts each of capitol murder. (Chicago Tribune, 1994). A jury recommended the death penalty for Echols and life in prison without pareole for Baldwin. (Sullivan, 1994). A third teenager, Jessie Lloyd Misskelley, Jr., 18, was convicted in February 1994, of one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. He is serving a prison sentence of life plus 40 years. (Beifuss, 1994)</p>

<p>Misskelley confessed to his role in the killings, telling police the murders were linked to a cult ritual that included the rape and mutilation of victims. (Chicago Tribune, 1993). West Memphis police detective Bryn Ridge testified that elements in the case pointed to the work of a satanic cult. (Sullivan, 1994).</p>

<p>Steve Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore disappeared while riding their bicycles in May 1993. Their nude bodies were found the next day in a drainage ditch. The boys had been bound, raped and beaten. (Chicago Tribune, 1993). One child had been sexually mutilated. One witness testified that one of the defendants drank the victim&#39;s blood. (Sullivan, 1994).</p>

<p>During the trial prosecutors presented evidence suggesting that Echols was a satanist. Acquaintances said Echols carried a cat&#39;s skull to school, wrote satanic poems, and claimed to worship the devil. (Chicago Tribune, 1993). During his first police interview Echols told Detective Ridge that his favorite author was Anton LaVey, author of The Satanic Bible. (Sullivan, 1994). Mental health records indicate that Echols&#39; parents expressed concern about his possible involvement in &quot;satanism or devil worship&quot; when he was hospitalized in 1992. Just four months prior to the murders a clinician noted: &quot;Damien explained that he obtains his powers by drinking blood of others.&quot; (Sullivan, 1994).</p>

<p>One item brought to the attention of police was an underground newsletter published by a cousin of Echols&#39; 16-year-old girlfriend. The 1991 edition of the Secret Order of the Undead or &quot;SOUND&quot; featured a drawing of a winged demon molesting a woman, a list of 13 songs &quot;suitable to accompany any ritualistic murder&quot; and a column instructing children on how to build a homemade land mine. (Perrusquia, 1993).&quot;</p>

There were clear lines and they were crossed again and again.

<p>The theory is flimsy as fuck and targets people like the luzzatos. I took a look at the voat pgate yesterday and saw a post of someone calling luzzatos and asking if she had kids for a pool party. It was full of people encouraging others to do the same.</p>

<p>Imagine she wasn&#39;t hosting a sex party. That she is just some woman who put up a blog cause that baby was just too damn cute. Now she has people who believe she is sexually abuing her children for sex calling her with memes. Its fucked up</p>

I want it stopped before it happens and I don&#39;t care how &quot;powerful&quot; people are. If enough people stood up to it we absolutely could make a difference to many children but the problem ultimately lies with the press - as long as the press refuse to fully expose the extent of the abuse, the public will remain ignorant to the extent abuse of their children. The people of the press really need to figure out a way to get this stuff out to the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I personally see it is that calling it &quot;Satanic&quot; is simply a catch-all term to generalise so that the layman has a general idea when he hears it. The abuse is ritualistic and occultist.

The high-level abusers practice the same or similar rituals as each other and the effect is the same or similar wherever/whenever it occurs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the Satanic Panic of the 80s was largely based on the same SRA as we&#39;re talking about today, as well as the same occult programming in music and movies that we&#39;re talking about today. Except in the case of the Satanic Panic, it was highly credited psychiatric professionals speaking out about the SRA from their own clinical experiences, and the political force of American Christianity speaking out in a loud voice against the occult programming. I don&#39;t understand how anyone could ridicule the sentiment of those days, I guess it&#39;s just a sad testament to how well public opinion has been controlled. If anything you should be mourning that the rejection of this same system had so much momentum at that time, and yet it was still completely shut down like nothing even happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that&#39;s by design. It sounds way too crazy to be true. I think that&#39;s part of the deception....that Bill Cosby, &#39;even if you tell anyone, they&#39;ll never believe you.&#39;</p>

<p>After researching it, I believe that satanic panic in the 80s was real, and was just successfully covered up (partly because people would rather not believe that it actually occurs.)</p>

<p>The False Memory Foundation was set up to &#39;explain&#39; kids that had SRA memories. Thing is — and I learned about this in college in a psych class about memory, from an annoyed teacher that never once mentioned SRA — that&#39;s not a thing. Doesn&#39;t happen. Memory can be changed with suggestion, but completely false memories can&#39;t &#39;be implanted&#39;.</p>

<p>If you look at the cases that are being brought to light today, there are &#39;accuser advocate&#39; legal firms and organizations that I believe serve the same purpose as the false-memory syndrome org. They show up when abuse is made public and attempt to discredit the victims. Just the fact that these organizations exist is very spurious to me. If you dig into this deeper, you may come to feel as I and many others do, that this is a real problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct. But there are also divisions inside both paths. </p>

<p>As for the &quot;Do not harm young children,&quot; commandment, it all depends one the interpretation of what &quot;harm&quot; means. Abused children are often told what&#39;s being done to them is out of &quot;love,&quot; and I&#39;m not just blaming satanists for that.</p>

<p>I&#39;d cut the satanists more slack if they ended the SRA stuff. I&#39;m a Christian and I&#39;m constantly pointing out the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church, which continues to shield and, in my opinion, cultivate child sexual abusers. I have worked to helped promote the #ChurchToo movement, which has largely been ignored by the media. </p>

<p>I am doing what I can to clean up this horror inside my faith. I hope there are satanists doing the same on their side, but I see no evidence of it, but instead denials that even exists, which is bullshit. </p>

<p>Terrible people are drawn to positions of power, but they get worse and worse. Perhaps that&#39;s because they are gaining the power through the worship of entities who encourage this vile behavior. </p>

<p>Throughout history you see these same practices being done by people all over the world. The Canaanites, Babylonians, Central Americans, the list never ends. They all performed human sacrifice in the belief they&#39;d retain or gain more power. When paired with the absolute fact they did, in fact, retain/gain power, the logical conclusion is that these sacrifices worked for them. </p>

Also, if you study &#39;perverse&#39; psychic structures (sadist, masochist, pederast, etc.), you&#39;ll find they often flock to institutions like Law and Religion, and they have no compunction being decietful or duplicitous because they follow &#39;their own law&#39;, often alligning themselves with social law to give their own law legitimacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, what church we talking? Catholicism, probably not. But there&#39;s plenty of insane little offshoot churches that are run by lunatics. Look up the mormon polygamist cults in Northern AZ/Utah (Warren Jeffs and the FLDS), look up Bob Enyart&#39;s Denver Bible School in CO, who bomb abortion clinics and have a hit list out there on Abortion doctors.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not out of the realm of possibility those people are also involved in abusing children, and it&#39;s not out of the realm of possibility they ascribe to &#39;alternative&#39; ideologies that justify their pedo urges. Just like simple people can get swept up in a charismatic preacher&#39;s christian ideology, it&#39;s not out of the realm of possibility there&#39;s other simple people that can get swept up in some &#39;satanic&#39; ideology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First you have to expose it with irrefutable evidence. The term ‘Satanic abuse’ gets thrown around a lot but despite the scares the link is never proven. On the other hand lots of abuse is perpetrated and covered up by ‘mainstream’ religious groups. It’s a power dynamic, the same way it exists in the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>Child abuse and child abuse tourism are very real (I won’t call it child sex tourism – it’s abuse, plain and simple). These are causes worth fighting for because these kids don’t have a voice. There were stories of some evil abusers doing things that sounded to horrific to be real. Then Peter Gillespie was arrested and it turned out the stories were real. That was also the first time I saw the term pedo-sadism and the fact there’s enough of it that they had to give it a name is depressing as hell.</p>

<p>I don’t know how you’d fight it as a concerned citizen. Thailand used to be bad for it and people like Andrew Vachss supported the ‘Don’t buy Thai (and tell ‘em all why)’ campaign. As a lawyer and writer who focuses exclusively on child protection his site is probably a good starting point.</p>

<p>It there though?  And is it confirmed?  Because I&#39;ve been following these claims for 20+ years and, honestly, I haven&#39;t seen many confirmed cases at all.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re being downvoted. It&#39;s pretty true actually. </p>

<p>And according to the Satanic Bible and the 11 Satanic Rules of the Earth, #9 states: Do not harm young children. </p>

<p>Whether someone believes in atheistic or theistic Satanism, the running theme throughout is mind your business, do what&#39;s best for you, and don&#39;t do anything without consent. Of course people are going to associate all kinds of nefarious shit with it, but the people that do things like that to children are first and foremost sick individuals, regardless of their religious affiliations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, what church we talking? Catholicism, probably not. But there&#39;s plenty of insane little offshoot churches that are run by lunatics. Look up the mormon polygamist cults in Northern AZ/Utah (Warren Jeffs and the FLDS), look up Bob Enyart&#39;s Denver Bible School in CO, who bomb abortion clinics and have a hit list out there on Abortion doctors.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not out of the realm of possibility those people are also involved in abusing children, and it&#39;s not out of the realm of possibility they ascribe to &#39;alternative&#39; ideologies that justify their pedo urges. Just like simple people can get swept up in a charismatic preacher&#39;s christian ideology, it&#39;s not out of the realm of possibility there&#39;s other simple people that can get swept up in some &#39;satanic&#39; ideology.</p>

<p>The question is if he did it out of selflessness to take these people down or if he just did it to build his empire.</p>
