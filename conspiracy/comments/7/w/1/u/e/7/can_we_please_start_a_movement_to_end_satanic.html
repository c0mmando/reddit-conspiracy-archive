       Something has to been done. I know alot of things are being uncovered but it needs to be something that can get the common person on board with uncovering and exposing it all for what it is. To many people are turning a blind eye when it's all right in our faces. Needs to be something that doesn't make them think "oh that's just a crazy conspiracy". This is real and it needs to be stopped. T-shirts, Facebook page, hashtag, stickers. Let me know any ideas you may have. Maybe like a organization or something to start and promote in a simple way how sick this is but in a subtle manner.

       Well see, thing is it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       just a crazy conspiracy. The "Satanic ritual child abuse" thing all started in 1980 with a book called
       <em>
        Michelle Remembers.
       </em>
       It was written by a Canadian psychiatrist about one of his patients. The psychiatrist hypnotized his patient and she "recovered" memories that had been "lost." This went on for hundreds of hours of sessions. During that time the patient told stories about being subject to Satanic rituals, including witnessing the summoning of Satan himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trouble is, it was all of it, every word, bull. Not a single claim the patient made under hypnosis could be corroborated. Like she described a car crash that never happened, for instance. Also in her fantasies she was an only child but in real life she had sisters.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lie can make it halfway around the world before the truth gets its boots on, of course, so people read the book and thought it was factual. That it was 100% fraudulent didn't come out until later, by which time a lot of people were convinced there was this epidemic of Satanism going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the whole story. Literally everything else about Satanic ritual abuse follows on from the one false account. No actual evidence of it has
       <em>
        ever
       </em>
       been documented. At all.

       If those are convictions, then it seems law enforcement already has a handle on it.  ~100 cases over a decade is tragic, but with so many more large-scale issues out there there'd have to be some evidence that there were orders of magnitude more cases going on in secret.  Given the history of baseless scaremongering around this issue (the DnD panic comes to mind, or the above cited book) that's going to be a hard sell.

       So does pedophilia automatically come with satanism?  That's not a connection I'd thought to make, but those links seem to have allegations of satanism sprinkled throughout the pedo stuff.  I guess someone sick enough to set up a pedo ring isn't going to have qualms about satanic stuff, that still just seems an unexpected association.

       Sexually abusing children is pretty much the most evil thing imaginable. So, yeah, I'd say it's inherently Satanic, if you believe Satan exists.

       I don't, but it certainly makes sense they'd go together.  I think the satanism stuff, particularly the emphasis on rituals, makes it sound absurd enough to push me to discount the entire thing...which makes it perfectly plausible such a cult would include ridiculous enough rituals that any whistleblower would be hard to believe for the average normie.

       Fear = energy. If you can't create by yourself, what is the most easy to provoke in an other to be used by you, especially in a child?
      </p>
      <p>
       It does not matter what you believe or call them. It is what "they" believe and follow, often just as blinded as some religious and even science people follow their god. Blinded for all other , becouse of fear, ego, ignorance or indifferance.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you could almost literary split a mind in two, how would you do this and why would this be usefull?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could it be usefull to some to corrupt the most energetic creative beings on earth as soon as possible? And if so, would it help to create an enviroment to support this kind of corruption?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could the wave of political correctness and forced split between sexes and identity be a part? Why do very young childeren suddenly need education over this? And even worse why are so many young children suddenly in need of hormone cures..?
      </p>
      <p>
       Could this "religious" pedo stuff also be linked to pizza and/ or elsa? Could it make sence to desensitize children and make them more receptical for futher devolution of our human values? Could it be that the energy "transmitted" by the pedo symbols is directly interfearing with pedos who know about this shit? Could it be that it is used as a form of mk ultra or such to stimulate the pedos more and more into action?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pedophilia was and is a huge problem for as long as our history is known. The time of revelation is starting to show us more and more of all this shit and how it is connected to our world. This will cause people to be angry and call for revenge, this is as intended by some and needs to be avoided by all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it is hard to not have sad and dark feelings yourself while you learn about this stuff, but don't get stuck at those feelings, but try to give it a place until you have figured out how to deal with it best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't forget, there is always another side of the story. And while i do condamm pedo stuff and all people involved, i also know that some are grown into this and are miss-used and miss-led from childhood. Also many will be chantaged and threatend to keep the truth hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while i know all this dark will be stopped and uncoverd soon, i hope all people do realise nobody can't judge them all before we know the truths of all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Justice is needed, but we can't judge yet before we know all facts, or at least as much as possible. Playing your own judge wont help anybody and will only cause more chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know it will all end well and all the dark will move away for most people, but be careful while trying to wake people up to these dark facts. And please try to avoid the mental traps of fear, anger or revenge, they have helped nobody yet sofar as i know.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have build this maze we are in and some are using the power of humanity to create their desired reality through us. They are using all tech and controll methods the can think of and sadley enough pedopilia and sacrefices are a huge part of the same mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fear and Love show us our way to this maze we are in. The truth will show you how to escape, Love will shine a ligh so you don't need to stumble too much, trust will help along the way. Your ego might be of help or create some problems ;)

       this case also turned out to be bunk. Not that I'd expect you to know that, seeing how you linked to an unsourced youtube clip.

       <a href="http://ra-info.org/faqs/ra-convictions/">
        List of Satanic Ritual Abuse convictions
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       "Three teenagers were convicted in the cult killings of three 8-year-old boys. Michael Wayne 'Damien" Echols, 19, and Charles Jason Baldwin, 16, were convicted March 18, 1994, on three counts each of capitol murder. (Chicago Tribune, 1994). A jury recommended the death penalty for Echols and life in prison without pareole for Baldwin. (Sullivan, 1994). A third teenager, Jessie Lloyd Misskelley, Jr., 18, was convicted in February 1994, of one count of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. He is serving a prison sentence of life plus 40 years. (Beifuss, 1994)
      </p>
      <p>
       Misskelley confessed to his role in the killings, telling police the murders were linked to a cult ritual that included the rape and mutilation of victims. (Chicago Tribune, 1993). West Memphis police detective Bryn Ridge testified that elements in the case pointed to the work of a satanic cult. (Sullivan, 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       Steve Branch, Christopher Byers and Michael Moore disappeared while riding their bicycles in May 1993. Their nude bodies were found the next day in a drainage ditch. The boys had been bound, raped and beaten. (Chicago Tribune, 1993). One child had been sexually mutilated. One witness testified that one of the defendants drank the victim's blood. (Sullivan, 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       During the trial prosecutors presented evidence suggesting that Echols was a satanist. Acquaintances said Echols carried a cat's skull to school, wrote satanic poems, and claimed to worship the devil. (Chicago Tribune, 1993). During his first police interview Echols told Detective Ridge that his favorite author was Anton LaVey, author of The Satanic Bible. (Sullivan, 1994). Mental health records indicate that Echols' parents expressed concern about his possible involvement in "satanism or devil worship" when he was hospitalized in 1992. Just four months prior to the murders a clinician noted: "Damien explained that he obtains his powers by drinking blood of others." (Sullivan, 1994).
      </p>
      <p>
       One item brought to the attention of police was an underground newsletter published by a cousin of Echols' 16-year-old girlfriend. The 1991 edition of the Secret Order of the Undead or "SOUND" featured a drawing of a winged demon molesting a woman, a list of 13 songs "suitable to accompany any ritualistic murder" and a column instructing children on how to build a homemade land mine. (Perrusquia, 1993)."

       Basically you want to start a group that is "actually" good, not fake good or claiming to be good.

       Make it an inpenetrable fortress that can't be compromised. I'm sure if it gets popular quick it will still be able to influence. That's all that matters.. if it gets shut down just start another one.

       Because that sub doxxed ppl with tenuous links to public figures.  That crowd was also filled with ppl inciting criminal behavior. There were clear lines and they were crossed again and again. You could make the argument that the doxxing and comments along the lines of "someone should kill that pizza shop owner" were coming from black blocs...I wouldn't but you could.

       The theory is flimsy as fuck and targets people like the luzzatos. I took a look at the voat pgate yesterday and saw a post of someone calling luzzatos and asking if she had kids for a pool party. It was full of people encouraging others to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine she wasn't hosting a sex party. That she is just some woman who put up a blog cause that baby was just too damn cute. Now she has people who believe she is sexually abuing her children for sex calling her with memes. Its fucked up

       More than that, they are preventing people from taking the idea of elite abuse of children seriously, resulting in this shit going on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ample evidence of elite sexual abuse of children. Actual real evidence, not pictures and obvious jokes from social media taken out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elite abuse if children is happening, the evidence supports this. But PG is a delusional group think fantasy LARP that is getting more kids murderfucked.

       Sorry about negative criticism only.  I'm still on the fence about how widespread Satanism is, and it's honestly not that high on my conspiracies-to-investigate list.  That said, if it is such a prevalent thing, then I don't think much good is to be done by spreading word in such conventional, commercial manners.  Unfortunately, I don't have much advice than to try convincing everyone else around you and hoping at least a couple of them flip to your side before you get ostracized for good.

       Hashtags and T-shirts don't seem to change anything for even mainstream movements, they just end up being tools to ride the wave of other people's misery.  Not saying the OP is looking to exploit a niche market - I just don't see the suggested approach going anywhere.

       That said, I don't really have much of a better suggestion.  There's got to be some better way of getting people aware and involved with things on a deeper level than virtue signalling, but I'm not sure what it would be.

       If you seriously want to help children I would suggest something more concrete. Maybe the Big Brother Big Sister program? There are hurting children all over your area.

       THANK YOU. It's amazing how many people on here proselytize about Pizzagate and the horrors of SRA and yet, when faced with an actual opportunity to enact change - like gaining a social work degree, working with children's welfare programs in their area, etc. - they scoff at the idea. Complaining about some conspiracy from behind the safety and comfort of your computer screen does nothing. Absolutely nothing. You want to see a world where children are safe, taken care of, not exploited? Go out and make that world.

       But lets say hypothetically that you're right... and that part of that organization is corrupt... that wouldn't negate the positive work you could do for kids in such an organization. Plus you'd get the added benefit of being closer to the problems causing vulnerable kids being taken advantage of... meaning you would have more information and tools to fight actual abuse.

       With all due respect, what you are suggesting is simply to band-aid over the problem, which is frankly not good enough for me. I want it stopped before it happens and I don't care how "powerful" people are. If enough people stood up to it we absolutely could make a difference to many children but the problem ultimately lies with the press - as long as the press refuse to fully expose the extent of the abuse, the public will remain ignorant to the extent abuse of their children. The people of the press really need to figure out a way to get this stuff out to the masses.

       The way I personally see it is that calling it "Satanic" is simply a catch-all term to generalise so that the layman has a general idea when he hears it. The abuse is ritualistic and occultist. Whether it's all metaphorical and for show, or whether there's literally supernatural forces at work doesn't matter in description, because to the observer it all looks the same. The high-level abusers practice the same or similar rituals as each other and the effect is the same or similar wherever/whenever it occurs.

       Fair, that's understandable. It's a loaded term, and people interpret it differently depending on their amount of exposure to the topic. Just gotta remember that sometimes your own interpretation might not be what the other person is actually trying to say. I can apply that to my own interpretation too. I don't know if op actually means Satanic, or if he's just using it as a catch-all term, but based on my own research and exposure that's the general interpretation I usually take when the topic is brought up.

       the Satanic Panic of the 80s was largely based on the same SRA as we're talking about today, as well as the same occult programming in music and movies that we're talking about today. Except in the case of the Satanic Panic, it was highly credited psychiatric professionals speaking out about the SRA from their own clinical experiences, and the political force of American Christianity speaking out in a loud voice against the occult programming. I don't understand how anyone could ridicule the sentiment of those days, I guess it's just a sad testament to how well public opinion has been controlled. If anything you should be mourning that the rejection of this same system had so much momentum at that time, and yet it was still completely shut down like nothing even happened.

       I believe that's by design. It sounds way too crazy to be true. I think that's part of the deception....that Bill Cosby, 'even if you tell anyone, they'll never believe you.'
      </p>
      <p>
       After researching it, I believe that satanic panic in the 80s was real, and was just successfully covered up (partly because people would rather not believe that it actually occurs.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The False Memory Foundation was set up to 'explain' kids that had SRA memories. Thing is — and I learned about this in college in a psych class about memory, from an annoyed teacher that never once mentioned SRA — that's not a thing. Doesn't happen. Memory can be changed with suggestion, but completely false memories can't 'be implanted'.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the cases that are being brought to light today, there are 'accuser advocate' legal firms and organizations that I believe serve the same purpose as the false-memory syndrome org. They show up when abuse is made public and attempt to discredit the victims. Just the fact that these organizations exist is very spurious to me. If you dig into this deeper, you may come to feel as I and many others do, that this is a real problem.

       Just to clarify - are you referring to the list published by the "Believe the Children" organization? The same list that references a majority of cases that have since been debunked with major "perpetrators" exonerated?
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is saying that child abuse in these cases didn't occur...just that the claims of satanic ritual abuse were either exaggerated, debunked or never connected to actual evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's some really, really great academic resources on the concept of satanic ritual abuse and its root in moral panic. I would suggest you check those out before you believe things written willy-nilly on the internet.

       I don't know why you're being downvoted. It's pretty true actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       And according to the Satanic Bible and the 11 Satanic Rules of the Earth, #9 states: Do not harm young children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether someone believes in atheistic or theistic Satanism, the running theme throughout is mind your business, do what's best for you, and don't do anything without consent. Of course people are going to associate all kinds of nefarious shit with it, but the people that do things like that to children are first and foremost sick individuals, regardless of their religious affiliations.

       Correct. But there are also divisions inside both paths.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "Do not harm young children," commandment, it all depends one the interpretation of what "harm" means. Abused children are often told what's being done to them is out of "love," and I'm not just blaming satanists for that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd cut the satanists more slack if they ended the SRA stuff. I'm a Christian and I'm constantly pointing out the hypocrisy of the Catholic Church, which continues to shield and, in my opinion, cultivate child sexual abusers. I have worked to helped promote the #ChurchToo movement, which has largely been ignored by the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am doing what I can to clean up this horror inside my faith. I hope there are satanists doing the same on their side, but I see no evidence of it, but instead denials that even exists, which is bullshit.

       Just because he's called something different now doesn't mean he (and his forces) aren't doing the same things they've always been doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terrible people are drawn to positions of power, but they get worse and worse. Perhaps that's because they are gaining the power through the worship of entities who encourage this vile behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throughout history you see these same practices being done by people all over the world. The Canaanites, Babylonians, Central Americans, the list never ends. They all performed human sacrifice in the belief they'd retain or gain more power. When paired with the absolute fact they did, in fact, retain/gain power, the logical conclusion is that these sacrifices worked for them.

       Look up Bob Enyart. Also, if you study 'perverse' psychic structures (sadist, masochist, pederast, etc.), you'll find they often flock to institutions like Law and Religion, and they have no compunction being decietful or duplicitous because they follow 'their own law', often alligning themselves with social law to give their own law legitimacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a great essay on 'Perverse' vs 'Neurotic' structures vis a vi Lacan:

       Holy shit why is it neon green. 
But I agree. These people do flock to places of power. Across the board. My argument was that there’s not a group of “satanist” infiltrating the church. It’s always been run by scumbags.

       Well, what church we talking? Catholicism, probably not. But there's plenty of insane little offshoot churches that are run by lunatics. Look up the mormon polygamist cults in Northern AZ/Utah (Warren Jeffs and the FLDS), look up Bob Enyart's Denver Bible School in CO, who bomb abortion clinics and have a hit list out there on Abortion doctors.

       It's not out of the realm of possibility those people are also involved in abusing children, and it's not out of the realm of possibility they ascribe to 'alternative' ideologies that justify their pedo urges. Just like simple people can get swept up in a charismatic preacher's christian ideology, it's not out of the realm of possibility there's other simple people that can get swept up in some 'satanic' ideology.

       That's one of the things these SRA researchers believe that I don't....looking at the profile of pedo-sadists, they're essentially just psychopaths. I believe Donald Trump fits the mold for one of these types of people. He probably fucked Ivanka, and he's already got a rape charge against him from a 13 year old, flew with Epstein, etc.

       I believe Donald Trump was being groomed to be one of these people; I think he instead chose to learn how to rub shoulders with these people without incriminating himself in their actions.

       The question is if he did it out of selflessness to take these people down or if he just did it to build his empire.

       First you have to expose it with irrefutable evidence. The term ‘Satanic abuse’ gets thrown around a lot but despite the scares the link is never proven. On the other hand lots of abuse is perpetrated and covered up by ‘mainstream’ religious groups. It’s a power dynamic, the same way it exists in the entertainment industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       Child abuse and child abuse tourism are very real (I won’t call it child sex tourism – it’s abuse, plain and simple). These are causes worth fighting for because these kids don’t have a voice. There were stories of some evil abusers doing things that sounded to horrific to be real. Then Peter Gillespie was arrested and it turned out the stories were real. That was also the first time I saw the term pedo-sadism and the fact there’s enough of it that they had to give it a name is depressing as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t know how you’d fight it as a concerned citizen. Thailand used to be bad for it and people like Andrew Vachss supported the ‘Don’t buy Thai (and tell ‘em all why)’ campaign. As a lawyer and writer who focuses exclusively on child protection his site is probably a good starting point.

       Okay, this is where I am on this now, if you're coming in here and trying to troll and talk crap then you are obviously a chill defending satanic child ritualistic abuse. There's literally so much proof of it and if you can't do your own research and see it then you shouldn't be on this sub. It's all confirmed.

       It there though?  And is it confirmed?  Because I've been following these claims for 20+ years and, honestly, I haven't seen many confirmed cases at all.  It would be great if you could share some of your resources.  Because the only resources I've found have been second-hand claims that, when fleshed out, tended to be wildly exaggerated.

       This looks interesting, I'll definitely check it out after work (because it appears to be one of those rabbit holes I'll spend hours on).

       No worries! It's a rabbit hole I've been balls deep in for the past week.
      </p>
      <p>
       I too have heard about this stuff for a long time, and I'd literally always dismissed it until I dove down this rabbit-hole. There's definitely some question of unreliable narrators, but I think I've uncovered enough unrelated cases that fit the same pattern that lends credibility to their claims.

       Get involved in a SRA ministry, and spread the word about it. Until the public not only knows about it, but believes it, it will be business as usual for the cabal as it has been for millennia.

       Perhaps is the church didn’t manufacture entities to elicit fear and control the masses, crazy people wouldn’t embrace the idea  and run with it. This universe is so much more than ridiculous Christian ideas molded over thousands of years of conspiracy.

       I don't know why you're being downvoted. It's pretty true actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       And according to the Satanic Bible and the 11 Satanic Rules of the Earth, #9 states: Do not harm young children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether someone believes in atheistic or theistic Satanism, the running theme throughout is mind your business, do what's best for you, and don't do anything without consent. Of course people are going to associate all kinds of nefarious shit with it, but the people that do things like that to children are first and foremost sick individuals, regardless of their religious affiliations.

       Well, what church we talking? Catholicism, probably not. But there's plenty of insane little offshoot churches that are run by lunatics. Look up the mormon polygamist cults in Northern AZ/Utah (Warren Jeffs and the FLDS), look up Bob Enyart's Denver Bible School in CO, who bomb abortion clinics and have a hit list out there on Abortion doctors.

       It's not out of the realm of possibility those people are also involved in abusing children, and it's not out of the realm of possibility they ascribe to 'alternative' ideologies that justify their pedo urges. Just like simple people can get swept up in a charismatic preacher's christian ideology, it's not out of the realm of possibility there's other simple people that can get swept up in some 'satanic' ideology.

       I believe Donald Trump was being groomed to be one of these people; I think he instead chose to learn how to rub shoulders with these people without incriminating himself in their actions.

       The question is if he did it out of selflessness to take these people down or if he just did it to build his empire.
