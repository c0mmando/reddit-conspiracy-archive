<p>The first picture that comes up on this looks like something in South America or Europe. It&#39;s literally just a complex of pyramids.

    <div class="md"><p>I think the truth can surely be in the middle. If these cultures learned from each other, it doesn&#39;t need to imply that there was a single global culture... Just that each culture happened to have learned from the ones next door.</p>

<p>All that said, while there&#39;s certainly some assumptions made in the traditional timeline, the general jist of things is that South American monument builders were active from the late BCs to 1000 AD or so, the middle American from roughly 500-1500, and the North American from maybe 800-1200 AD.</p>

<p>In South America, around the likes of Machu Picchu, some claim that the most cleanly fitted stones are actually the oldest, and that the newer are more &quot;primitive&quot;, and not the other way around.</p>

<p>In fact, their own mythology talks of heavenly beings coming down to help build these wonders, and later leaving.</p>

<p>My guess is that whether that&#39;s true or not, there was some knowledge in those early cultures that was lost, and sorely missed. Hence the eventual human sacrifice... Which may not have been an original cultural facet, but appropriated later to try to recover what was lost.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious if the North American mound builders weren&#39;t migrants from the south. Searching for the lost knowledge of old. Where they went there were poor or no quarries, so they built with dirt. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m on to anything here, but it&#39;s a thought that&#39;s been on my mind.</p>
