       "Quick question...what's an adjuvant?"
      </p>
      <p>
       In concert, they said, "what's a what?"  Not 1 of the 10 had ever heard of such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just goes to show ya...these anti-choice vaccine proponents are anything but scientists...they're bootlickers.  Worshipers of authority.  Nothing more.  They're the opposite of scientists.  They're brainless drones who justify their ignorance with statements like, "You don't need to know what an adjuvant is to have an opinion about the worthiness and value of vaccines."  Indeed, mighty bootlicker, indeed.

       Edit: Notice the strong downvote brigading on this post...lol.  They don't like it when their anti-science reality is exposed.  No comments, no rebuttals...just downvotes by the dozen.

       Aluminum nanoparticles that are there to help stimulate the immune response to the pathogen being injected, allegedly to help build immunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is these aluminum particles are taken up by macrophages, which are unable to digest them, so they then carry them throughout the body and eventually pass the blood brain barrier, contaminating the brain with aluminum, which causes inflammation. The inflammation attracts more macrophages, also contaminated with aluminum, leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation.

       Yep. And because they say vaccines are inherently safe, they do very few long term toxicity studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       " Experimental evidence also shows that simultaneous administration of as little as two to three immune adjuvants can overcome genetic resistance to autoimmunity. In some developed countries, by the time children are 4 to 6 years old, they will have received a total of 126 antigenic compounds along with high amounts of aluminum (Al) adjuvants through routine vaccinations. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, safety assessments for vaccines have often not included appropriate toxicity studies because vaccines have not been viewed as inherently toxic."

       Adjuvants may be added to a vaccine to modify the immune response by boosting it, such as to give a higher amount of antibodies and a longer-lasting protection, thus minimizing the amount of injected foreign material.

       My buddy since high school (long time ago) total swallows the official story of 911.
      </p>
      <p>
       The day it happened I doubted that planes alone caused the collapses

       He won't even engage in discussion. Mocks me and ridicules any attempt to show him reality.

       There may be a correlation there.

       A similar attitude is towards smoking. Since they have banned it in most public places people feel they can shit on smokers now. Loudly.

       I think people like to hang on to anything that makes them feel superior over others. Even if it's wrong.

       To stare "vaccines are fine" is meaningless. All vaccines are not fine. Many have been pulled from the shelves. And some get shipped to other countries where they aren't banned yet.

       That's hard to disagree with. Unfortunately, most people don't argue from a sound and logical position. There's plenty of science that supports the idea that vaccinces are safe. And most of the time any science that doesn't fit the anti-vax thing is dismissed or ignored.

       You don't understand the significance of a structural integrity failing at temperatures FAR BELOW melting points.

       The fuel was literally jet fuel. Except apparently you don't understand that temperatures can still get quite hot while still producing smoke. You realize even lava fires cause smoke?

       You understand that temperature can change significantly depending on position.

Vaccines: What Your Doctors Know and Don’t Know
JENNIFER HUTCHINSON RECENT ARTICLES TOP STORIES
By  Jennifer Hutchinson /   July 31, 2012
      </p>
      <p>
       What did your doctor learn about vaccines in medical school?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you ever wonder what doctors know about the dozens of vaccines they inject into your children? What they learn in medical school about vaccines? And after they graduate? Who controls what they are taught? My research has been quite an eye-opener.
      </p>
      <p>
       WHAT DOCTORS LEARN IN SCHOOL …
First question: What do doctors actually learn in medical school about vaccines? Here’s what several have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Suzanne Humphries:
      </p>
      <p>
       “We learn that vaccines need to be given on schedule. We are indoctrinated with the mantra that ‘vaccines are safe and effective’—neither of which is true. Doctors today are given extensive training on how to talk to ‘hesitant’ parents—how to frighten them by vastly inflating the risks during natural infection. …on the necessity of twisting parents’ arms to conform, or fire them from their practices. Doctors are trained that NOTHING bad should be said about any vaccine, period.” [1]
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Bob Sears:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Doctors learn a lot about diseases in medical school, but we learn very little about vaccines. … We don’t review the research ourselves. We never learn what goes into making vaccines or how their safety is studied. So, when patients want a little more information about shots, all we can really say as doctors is that the diseases are bad and the shots are good.” [2]
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Larry Palevsky:
      </p>
      <p>
       “I was taught that vaccines were completely safe and completely effective. But I kept seeing that my experience … in using and reading about vaccines, and hearing what parents were saying about vaccines were very different from what I was taught … When I look at the studies that the AAP and the CDC put out, saying that there’s no correlation between vaccination and autism or vaccinations and asthma, I have to say that the studies just don’t hold up to the scientific standards.” [3]

       It pretty sad that we have to go to medical school these days to be able to know if what we’re being sold or prescribed is real or a scam, helpful or harmful. The dribble they push on the news is ever changing and contradicts itself every few years.

       Most birth vaccines specifically are fine. MMR has some questionable effects in regards to a prevalence in children needing speech therapy after MMR shots, other than that, a lot less deaths from mumps, measles, and rubella than without the vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       The bigger issue is with shit like the "flu shot",
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFrvqInWWHc">
        Watch this if your interested
       </a>
       , basically, flu shots are basically useless, statistically only help severely immune compromised individuals, setup by merck executives who worked for CDC and stuff and made it a normal thing, 5 billion dollar business, etc etc.

       Thank you.  I wished they had body weight and age for toxicity levels.  The whole schedule and everything is shady in my opinion.  I believe in vaccines just not the additives used or schedule. Thanks for this post.

       House mate of mine missed most of her childhood vaccines. Anyway she decided to catch up and the doctors put her on the paediatric schedule. Ie the kiddies shots. Anyway she had to stop after getting very ill with super high temperature and a full body rash.

       This starts a slippery slope proving OP's point about people who are at all skeptical of the flu shot being immediately dismissed. They're not allowed to have any I'll effects? It has to be a "coincidence." Can't that be said of all side-effects then?

Spent a week in the hospital, every test you can imagine (CT, spinal tap, bloodwork), many of them multiple times a day. Not fun folks, do not recommend

       My cousin got that.  She still has residual issues like she needs to wear a leg brace and she has bad days.  She was not good for a while there.  Needed a trachiotomy and machines to breath.  Couldn't move or talk.  She was a private chef for rich peoole on private boats.  She had been at sea for months, but they had stopped in NY for a few days.  She got sick her first night docked in NY.  Within hours her legs stopped working and then her whole body a little after that.  Spent like a year in NY before she was well enough to be moved home.  She is unable to work her dream job and travel the world doing it like she did.   It was and is terrible

       I was told the first night what could have happened if they hadn't caught it when they did and reading up on it was nothing short of terrifying. Fatigue and pain levels were extremely high for the first 6 months; when I finally got back to work I had to switch from floor to cashier so I could sit down. Needless to say I appreciate to my core just how lucky I was.

       My heart goes out to your cousin. Life can be so unbelievably cruel. Not that it means anything, but she's got an internet stranger in her corner. Hoping/wishing/praying for joy, fulfillment and good health. All the best

       Not sick, at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is not with adjuvants when in regards to the flu vaccine, the issue is with the virology of influenza and its mutagenicity.
      </p>

       When you give someone a flu vaccine for a strain that is dominant that year, it could lead to higher mutagenicity, especially if the strain within the vaccine is of a lower respiratory influenza, and you also get attacked by a secondary lower respiratory influenza infection from another strain, this will lead to high mutagenicity, especially considering you have introduced dead components of another influenza, that although may be dead by itself, some of the proteinous structures and components could still be salvagable by the secondary attacking influenza leading to much worse complications, pneumonia, etc.

       This is becoming a consistent trend, I don't even need to talk about the adjuvants, I am all about the science.

       Next you will tell me filamentous borrelial dermatitis is real, I remember when I was trying to educate people about that, the guy who knows absolutely nothing trying to tell me what?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want you to listen to me, if you consider accurate, thorough science to be a negative thing as indicated within your comment, I feel bad for you, I honestly do.

       It is your choice, as a parent, to decide what you think is best. Sadly this day and age doctors are lazy, they want to get people in and out so they can get through as many people as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       These leads to laziness, like giving the MMR shot all at once instead of properly spacing it out, that doctor thinks: "one and done, don't come back" then if you come back they are at a loss for words because they actually just fucked up, could lose medical licensing, etc, and I am sure at this point legislation has been introduced to protect medical licensing when this type of shit happens with vaccines specifically.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is the lack of knowledge people are given in this day and age.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have provided the full MMR vaccine ingredient list here with all its side effects, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a lot of issues with it, and your right about overall mortality, as there is nothing me and you can go off of that states a difference either positively or negatively of overall mortality in regards to vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.
      </p>
      <p>
       With mumps and measles making a comeback within the last decade or 2, I think vaccinating for these separately is still a good idea and protects children overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest thing is, they are trying to reduce deaths, and reduce instances of encephalitis and pneumonia that lead to long term health issues if they infant even survives.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there would show a better overall mortality within vaccinated populations, I don't think it would be massively extraordinary, but I believe it would be a higher by a measurable amount, the only thing is, this specific paragraph is all speculation, as there is nothing in regards to overall mortality in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to your last question, just remember this, your child may still develop measles and mumps after receiving the vaccines, but I can tell you 100% that the symptoms, and the further complications, are much lower in the vaccinated children than unvaccinated. If you know (they go to school, its going to happen) they are going to come into contact with this viruses/bacteria, then the best course of action is to take preventative measures, IF you believe when or if your child comes into contact with them, they will develop a severe reaction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe they should simply be spaced out appropriately, the problem is with laziness and time consumption in regards to doctors, they see it as taking too long, they want the lazy way out, etc.

       That's the problem to me, is it isn't a choice. Every doctor in my town refuses to see their patients without them getting a flu shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kids were being denied their mandatory shots for school, until the flu shot was allowed to be given. It was ridiculous. This should never be allowed to go so far. They are taking away the choice by hyping up how good it is and hiding the risks causing a panic, which all serves to make someone a ton of money.

       Except for YOU CANT vaccinate for them separately. I did tons of research while pregnant with my son and found out that the vaccine companies stopped making MMR separately because people would not follow through on getting them all and the drug companies decided to stop making them independently around 2013. I'm sure the fact that they can charge for having all 3 vaccines in one helps their bottom line along with making sure people are getting fully vaccinated. My son who is now 2, is vaccinated but we spaced them out every 3 months instead of all at once. It's hard to know what the right thing to do is as a parent these days....

       Most birth vaccines are out of control in number, some are unnecessary (Hep B), some are not as risky as the disease (mmr, chicken pox). some are not a high risk of exposure, and they all load immature body systems with several very toxic ingredients, and I’m not even talking about the microbe.

       “In the United States, measles is generally a benign, short-term viral infection; 99.99% of measles cases fully recover,” said Dr. Miller. “As it has NOT been proven that the MMR vaccine is safer than measles, there is INSUFFICIENT evidence to demonstrate that mandatory measles mass vaccination results in a net public health benefit in the United States.”
      </p>
      <p>
       “There is a five-fold higher risk of seizures from the MMR vaccine than seizures from measles, and a significant portion of MMR-vaccine seizures cause permanent harm.”

       He's an engineer. He's a scientist in the same way a medical doctor is.  He doesn't do science, but he's learned some of the discoveries brought about by people who do science to be able to apply it to real world systems. That said, he's pretty science illiterate which is why he stopped posting on Twitter, real scientists were telling him he was wrong about shit. I wish different fields had different science spokespeople instead of Niel Degrass Tyson trying to educate people on GMO's because "well he's a scientist". Can we get a famous Biochemist on TV?

       There's never been a study that demonstrates the "science" behind and efficacy of vaccines is true, i.e. there's no proof that injecting dead or damaged viruses or bacteria directly into the bloodstream provides any immunity from those phages. Tell them that too.

       There is proof that catching the measles, for example, gives lifelong immunity.  I'm open to technology that capitalizes on this effect without having to actually suffer the sickness.  Problem is, today, we don't have anything like that on the market.

       Correct, and no one is really sure how/why that lifelong immunity works. There's also studies that show childhood diseases bolster immunity across the board, including cancer resistance.

        In the USA in 1960, two virologists discovered that both polio vaccines were contaminated with the SV 40 virus which causes cancer in animals as well as changes in human cell tissue cultures. Millions of children had been injected with these vaccines

       I know there were problems with the initial polio vaccine. It's been changed and no one gets polio anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       In b4 sanitation - its almost been eradicated world wide due to vaccination.

       My grandmother's sister, who had polio from the age of 6. She spent a large amount of time at a children's home, because my great-grandmother had 8 other children to care for and they were poor farmers. Even though my family was quite poor, my aunt received treatment for polio and she successfully went to college, had a child (my cousin who is now in her 40s and healthy), and lived to 65. She passed away a few years ago after living a full life. She passed away from complications due to pneumonia - nothing polio-related, btw. Yes she was tiny (4'9) and had a hunchback but polio did nothing to stop her living her life to the fullest... she was the most jovial and funniest person I have still ever met to this day.

       My wife was vaccinated against whooping cough. She got full blown whooping cough and was hospitalized as a child for 3 months. My mom got the MMR vaccine, and got full blown measles. Risk acceptance should be managed by the parents. If you aren't putting your kids in school or daycare and they will have minimal exposure to the viruses, then delayed vaccination schedule or no vaccinations may be for you. People in rural areas are also at significantly lower risk for diseases.

       Lol "worthless degrees they hand out at university". Omg you are a sad sad little person. Did you even read those things you just posted? I'm a charlatan because I extensively studied biochemistry, physics, and math? Do you have any idea how to calculate mathematical models of molecular systems using partial differential equations or affine and projective geometry? Any extensive study in thermodynamics, techniques in theoretical physics, quantum mechanics? What about organic chemistry, cellular biology, clinical microbiology, structure and function of biomacromolecules? Just a random sampling of my courses I completed and continue to tutor for money. Yea what a waste of time. Especially all the real world experience I have applying that knowledge working in my research lab working on microtubule biophysics. That M.S. I'm working on and eventual Ph.D. is gonna look really dumb compared to a plumber. I bet you could easily explain to me why all the well proven and predictive things I have learned and use in the real world are actually wrong.

       Why is that embarrassing? How do you think people dress in a research lab? (Hint: it's usually jeans and a shirt, like what I wear anyway) I'm also still in grad school but hey at least I get paid to teach undergrad courses. BTW I think your math is off. Average master plumber makes $48,000/yr and the top %10 make $79,000/yr. Average salary for someone with a graduate degree in Biophysics is around $100,000/year and the top earners make over $200,000/year.

       i once worked for a very smart man, who went to one of the best universities for his field of study
      </p>
      <p>
       one day i admitted to him that i didn't quite understand something (actually what i had just learned completely turned my previous understanding upside down)
      </p>
      <p>
       so he politely explained what was going on, and then i understood a little better
      </p>
      <p>
       then he proceeds to tell me that he only learned 5% of what he needed to know to do his job at the university, and the rest he had to learn on the job
      </p>
      <p>
       then he goes on to say that he was so desperate for a job when he applied for this one, that he would have accepted anything, even a janitor job sweeping floors
      </p>
      <p>
       i guess at some level he knew he was in a saturated field where people like him become disposable

       There is a high demand for people with graduate degrees in Biochemistry/Molecular Biology/Biophysics.  Definitely not a saturated field.  I've already worked several paid positions at prestigious research institutions (WHOI and MBL to name a couple) so that will definitely give me a leg up in the job market once I finish grad school.  Dunno what you learned about electricity that makes you think I don't know what it is/how it works.  I can tell you definitively, though I'm not an electrical engineer, I have taken courses on Electricity and Magnetism and performed experiments to test the foundations of our understanding of the phenomena.  They all performed as expected. As for what I've learned/am learning in school, it definitely informs everything I do in my current position in my research lab.  I certainly learn more specific or complicated applications of general principals when working in the lab but without the foundation knowledge from classes on the subject I would be absolutely lost.  For instance, when I have to clone and purify a specific protein with a specific tag that I want to use in an assay, I might be able to simply follow the protocol like a recipe, but I would have no idea about the underlying mechanisms by which the protocol worked.  I would have no idea what to try and fix if something went wrong.  I would have no idea how to interpret certain errors or how to modify the protocol under different conditions.  These are all things that other's who work in the lab will not help you with because they have time consuming work, they are struggling to get their assays to work correctly, and that is stuff that I should already know before even stepping foot in the lab.  What was your boss's field?  What degrees did he get? Also, can you tell me what the real deal with electricity is?  I'm very curious now.

       Hopefully.  End game is be the PI in my own University lab someday but pursuing work as a professor with a research lab in academia is... well the road to working way harder than you get paid, especially if I'm trying to devote my research to probing mysteries not traditionally, immediately, or easily understood as profitable. I probably won't make half as much someone who decided to just go for their M.S. and instead go into private industry managing a pharma lab or something.  I can't deny my purpose though, research and teaching.

       I found my calling about 10 years ago when I got promoted to run the department I’d worked in for like 15 years previous.
      </p>
      <p>
       But a big part of that ‘calling’ is working with interns — we have a program with the local university and I probably get 6-8 in the fall and spring semesters and 3-4 in the summer. They’re my little ‘army’ and I’ve helped several get a big step up in where/what salary they start their careers, and helped a bunch who were less gifted at leastget a job out of college working somewhere under good people from whom they can learn.

       uhh hate to tell you this but your first link is about, "The objective of this study was to estimate the numbers of CRS and ASD cases

       </strong>
       by rubella vaccination in the United States from 2001 through 2010." And they state in the results, "we estimate that a minimum of 830 ASD cases and a maximum of 6225 ASD cases were prevented."

      <p>
       They determine that there is a link between three (though the third SNP has statistical support than the other two) SNPs and the listed AEs. This determination along with the functions of both SNPs is listed in their discussion but makes no determination of the extremity of symptoms due to the vaccination. In summary, this study is a long way from supporting your basis that vaccines cause autism (because it only suggests that certain symptoms correlate with the existence of certain variations of certain genes), and directly opposes your stance on academia's ability to determine liability.

       So some lesson from fourth grade was wrong so all of academia is useless? This usage as "evidence" is what I mean by lacking in a logical argument. The article does nothing to determine the prevalence of the lesson in education, nor does a specific historical inaccuracy have anything to do with biological, medical, or statistical analysis. In fact it actually opposes your position by laying the blame of the inaccuracy at the feet of two specific authors who were incorrect (

       Lets list how wrong this person is:
      </p>
      <p>
       (First things he claims weren't taught) Vocational training, internships, and other job training classes are offered in high school and up. Same with financial literacy. Social studies and poli sci classes do cover the voting process and many states do try to make voting as easy as possible (though interference with this is also a common enough). Gym and health classes are a national requirement from elementary school. Once again social studies and other current event classes are commonly available in high school at the latest (also covers legal statutes). Secondary languages are mandatory in most states.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Now how things that were taught aren't useful) Dissection is a part of biological courses due to its reinforcement of multiple systems with specific purposes interacting to forma more complex mechanism. Shakespeare classics are taught due to its importance in western culture and empathetic characters (e.g. they explicit motivations with the use of monologues and the use of the comedy/tragedy/history theme). Isotopic and biological basis are important in combating the ignorant theories like demons in the body. Historical literacy helps the understanding of cause and effect, he specifically mentions Henry VIII and his marriages as political importance. Optics is not commonly expanded due to its niche importance, but once again as a part of a larger scientific curriculum to understanding how the world work and the ability to determine phenomena from those basic rules. He mentions cursive just before an affidavit despite cursive's commonality at the time being an official usage. Mathematics is similar to the scientific curriculum with only one of its parts being the ability to understand how one can extrapolate answers from incomplete data. I assume he's talking about the hippocratic theory and is again part of teaching the populace about the larger understandable basis of cause and effect with observable factors. Which ironically he directly mentions its importance in the next line about effective vs ineffective medicine which the theory and its iterative usage learns from. Basic arithmetic is a useful skill, the prevalence of smartphones is irrelevant due to the people that don't have access to those devices are likely to need the skill anyways.

       'Eradicated' means gone. As in gone gone. I was talking about diseases that might come back because people stop vaccinating, and these diseases get a chance again. So you're really boosting my argument here: antivaxxers are sabotaging eradication of dangerous diseases.

       What do you think, people back around 1800 thought, when they created the first vaccine? "Let's lull people into autism. I have just this bullshit 'smallpox vaccine' to do it. Perfect for the job." Or perhaps they had the best interest of their patients in mind, like perhaps they still do?

       As you can see it’s a matter of risk factors and personal vulnerabilities. Vaccines need to be more custom in their application. Not everyone is at the same risk for the same diseases. Not everyone will react as badly to a vaccine as another person. Not all vaccines are associated with the the same level of severe effects as another. The cookie cutter formula we have is a huge disservice to everyone. It’s lazy. They are not as safe or as effective as advertised. That’s the point: informed consent, not necessary doing away with vaccines. You should realize having safe and effective vaccines is to your benefit and your child’s benefit.  Why would there be any objection to an independent safety commission?  If all is safe, then there is nothing to worry about, and you can shut the antivaxxers up.

       Compared to the people who died of complications resulting from vaccine injuries. We haven't seen that study yet. I look forward to the vaxed vs unvaxed study that examines total mortality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh wait, the DPT vaccine has had a vaxed vs unvaxed study done on it and it from memory I think it showed total mortality in the vaxed population to be something like three times higher than in the un vaxxed population. Of course the study has been 'debunked' and is 'flawed'. It is a shame though that the pro vax usual suspects seem to be unable to do a study themselves that shows the results they want.

       Exactly. It's because if you make that choice you are forced to defend it so you really need to know your facts. Unlike pro-vaccine people (which is most people) who apparently don't need to know much about what they're injecting their kids with.

       Vaccines are addressing the wrong side of the problem. Strengthen the body and you will be immune. You don't need to fight the disease. You need to understand how to support the bodies ability to fight the disease with intelligent eating (ie. eating differently depending on digestive strength, season, time of day, etc).

       The body immunizes itself. We don't need technology to stay healthy. I'd rather have a stronger version of the virus than a weaker version INJECTED into me. Since when does the body ever get injected a virus? This bypasses the whole immune system. Makes no sense. I haven't gotten a vaccine in years and have had no issues. I know kids that have never had vaccines and are like gods I'm their intellectual and physical ability.

       Vaccines are about giving you a neutered version of the virus, while still making sure it shares features with the deadly, functional strains of the virus. This allows you body learn how to recognize the deadly, functional version ASAP to prevent it from progressing to the point of symptoms, or even being contagious. This works well for some viruses, like polio, because the virus doesn't change shape often enough to work around a vaccinated population. Other viruses, like the flu or hiv, change their structure rapidly enough that it's impossible to vaccinate against (for now). These viruses also have a lot of hosts so they have even more opportunity to evolve around vaccinated people.

       Survived bias? No I have learned to listen to my body. Most people eat when they are not hungry or eat the wrong types of food at the wrong times. Thus their digestion is weakened and their body becomes weak. Injecting a virus, neutered or not, is completely invasive. Anyways the viruses are not the problem. The problem is a weak diet to due to ignorance of proper eating and lifestyle habits.

       You obviously didn't read my post. It's injecting a weak virus vs natural l processing a full strength one through the bodies defenses. Injecting directly BYPASSES the immune system. Even if it's a weak virus, THATS INCREDIBLY stupid.

       Reads as if you’d rather have a full strength polio strain injected into you then a weak version. But hey, go inhale some polio virus then. Or why not go expose yourself to Ebola virus. I’m sure you’d be okay as long as you “eat the right thing at the right time.

       Dude the polio virus is for the most part dormant in those who carry it, even those not vaccinated against it. It has NOTHING to do with the vaccine. Weak bodies become affected, not infected bodies. This whole vaccine theory is a big story they indoctrinated us into during school. Natural herbs and detox methods are much more effective (and thus less profitable) if done in a preventative way according to the time, place, and circumstance.

       Considering the vast majority of people who are infected with polio don't show any symptoms whatsoever, I'd question the validity of your claim.

       Sometimes simple facts are enough for common sense. most people see that billions of vaccines were administered and several diseases eradicated without noticeable downsides. Thus they use common sense.
      </p>

       Flat-earthers likely have also so more knowledge about some stuff related to there theory. For normal people just watching the stars is enough.

       There’s a simple solution that should make everyone happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eliminate the Vaccine Court and make Big Pharma libel for their vaccines. The Vaccine Court (US Taxpayers) has paid out over $3.5 Billion dollars in damages for Vaccine related injuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       No mandatory vaccinations because it supersedes our rights to informed consent.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        permission granted in the knowledge of the possible consequences, typically that which is given by a patient to a doctor for treatment with full knowledge of the possible risks and benefits.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       How do you grant permission when it’s mandatory?
      </p>
      <p>
       Those two would be a good start. I think if we make BigPharma libel for the damage their vaccines cause, they will do a better job making them safe.

       i think this type of thinking is widespread because the system is rigged to facilitate widespread arrested development.  lots of us never grow up, but stay children internally, watching cartoons, playing video games, living with their parents and fearing any reponsibility.  they realize the world is a scary place, but the nanny state and the system appears as a safehouse.  all this resembles herd mentality, but i think at its core its a childlike, underdeveloped personality, where we are too afraid to engage with the world and let the 'adults' make the decisions for us.

       When Merck was trying to get Gardasil approved, the company went so far as to design several experiments using an aluminum adjuvant injection as the EXPERIMENTAL CONTROL for adverse reactions!
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012805/full">
        http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD012805/full
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       More than 10 years has passed since the systematic review by Jefferson and colleagues, new adjuvants are being introduced continuously, and FDA and WHO do not require genotoxicity or cardiotoxicity studies of new aluminium adjuvants (WHO 2014a; FDA 2015). Lately, symptoms following HPV vaccination have been suspected of being caused by the addition of aluminium adjuvant (Tomljenovic 2011; Lee 2012; Poddighe 2014; Brinth 2015a; Gruber 2015; Martinez-Lavin 2015). A recent animal study by Inbar and colleagues managed to spark further controversy by demonstrating behavioral abnormalities in mice administered the aluminium-containing HPV vaccine Gardasil (Inbar 2016a). Compared to previous animal studies on HPV vaccines, the authors included two control groups: one where mice were administered aluminium adjuvant alone and another with placebo without adjuvant (Inbar 2016a). Inbar and colleagues concluded that Gardasil via both its aluminium adjuvant and HPV antigens can trigger neuro-inflammation and autoimmune reactions, leading to behavioural changes in mice (Inbar 2016a). Upon submission to a peer-reviewed journal, the paper was accepted with revisions, and published. However, it was soon withdrawn by the editor (Inbar 2016), only to be published in a competing journal shortly thereafter (Inbar 2016a). The initial withdrawal was allegedly due to "unsound scientific results"; an assertion which was not supported by the final publisher.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory that aluminium adjuvant is responsible for symptoms following HPV vaccination is impossible to refute or prove based on the current data. Aluminium adjuvant has been administered to both experimental and control group in the vast majority of randomised clinical trials on HPV vaccines, thus masking its potentially harmful effects (Exley 2011). Clinical trials designed to administer vaccine adjuvants to the experimental group as well as the placebo group do, de facto, not compare an intervention against a true placebo, and therefore, do not adequately assess safety (Exley 2011). Indeed, aluminium adjuvants, new or old, should be evaluated for benefits and harms on their own merits.

       You don't need to know what an adjuvant is to have an opinion about the worthiness and value of vaccines. You don't need to know what a catalytic converter does to feel that driving a car is worthwhile.

       One of the cooks I used to work with liked fucking with new people by sending them to the basemen for cans of steam.  We didn’t have a basement and, well, I’m sure you can guess whether or not we had cans of steam.

       There is a strong movement to shame anti-vaxxers though and many of the people mocking them the loudest don't even believe there is any risk involved with vaccinations as if they are perfectly safe and would NEVER hurt you.  I think the truth is there is risk, but the risk of the virus itself usually outweighs this risk of the vaccine itself, or so they decide.  If you think about it a little it makes sense that there would be incentive to hide or play down the risks of vaccines by professionals because they know if they indicate there is any kind of risk then many people may start not getting vaccines and ultimately lead to massive outbreak of potentially deadly virus.  It makes it a decision of concealing risk vs. potential deadly outbreak, sort of like the moral dilemma with the split in the train tracks with 1 person on one side and a group of people on the other side where they have to pick whether the group or the person gets hit by the unstoppable train.

       ‘Downplaying risks’ is the opposite of
       <em>
        informed consent
       </em>
       and it is unethical, unprofessional and fraudulent.  Since when do professionals get to decide ppl are too stupid to make decisions regarding their own lives by LYING to them?  So then, risks are not studied, not minimized, not acknowledged, not prevented, not improved. Ppl get stupider and sicker and more overwhelmed. Forget they had a question.

       I was honestly just commenting on what I think happens and why it makes sense that it would happen that way. If it were up to me all data on all risks would be presented backed up by studies and people could make their own choice. However we don't live in a society that believes people are smart enough to make there own choices which should be blatantly obvious to everyone. As a libertarian this is not how I think it should be though at the same time I can see why it would be.

       It’s very presumptuous, not to mention arrogant, to assume ppl are too stupid.  If they are, fix the educational system, stop injecting aluminum so they have learning disabilities, and don’t accept gov has right to trample over ppl’s rights when the constitution forbids it.  You are not understanding the betrayal of a profession sworn to ‘first do no harm.’  Doctor is accountable to deliver the best care to
       <em>
        his patient,
       </em>
       not society as a whole, not the cdc, and not gov. This goes for nurses as well, their professional priority is to protect patient’s interest and safety. They are being neutralized from doing so by many unethical influences. It is not a good time for healthcare in America.

       Just to clarify again I am, IN NO WAY, justifying these actions IF this is what takes place.  I can just see the possible moral dilemma and imaging why it could be possible.  I mean look at society.  They obviously collectively agree that we, as individuals, are not capable of making our own decisions when it comes to our health/safety.  Mandatory health insurance, mandatory seat belts, prohibited herbs, the list of examples goes on and on.

       Yes I understand you are just pointing out the situation as it stands and not condoning it. But what I don’t see is your objection to fact these ppl give themselves illegal and unethical powers over citizens’ rights.  Most ppl still believe their docs, cdc, gov is acting for their best interest and can’t conceive they are blatantly being deceived about what the risks of vaccines really are, the lack of scientific safety basis for recommendations, and general sloppiness in research and quality control. Inexcusable and unforgivable.  Did not mean to bash on you personally.

       This is exactly the point that anti vaxxers contest. By stating this here as a fact without acknowledging the arguments against this so called fact you have massively missed the point of this whole issue. Congratulations. You have done your duty in the service of spreading ignorance today.

       You talk about a diverse and educated group of ppl and make totally unsupported statements.  Do you know scientific studies are largely unreliable?  This has been found in a large number of studies reviewed, more than half.  Do you know if a study does not support corporate agenda, it is not reported?  50 studies show no benefit, but one does, fda only hears about the one.  You may want to rethink your faith on corporate funded studies and captured regulatory agencies. The info is out that they are all compromised.

       Wow, that’s a simplistic defection. I thought you could talk on more scientific terms. Vaccines alone have not delivered us from disease. If you think you can say that based on scientific studies, you’d be wrong.  The outbreaks you see of mumps lately are due to vaccine
       <em>
        failure
       </em>
       , not unvaccinated kids. Shoot’em up with more brain-frying vaccines!  That’s your cdc answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Choice:  have a viral illness with remote chance of serious complications? 
OR
Get a  vaccine that may or
       <em>
        may not
       </em>
       work,
that will only work for a few years,
that will impede your immune system from acquiring natural, long lasting immunity,
that will cause you to shed the virus, infecting ppl around you, 
that contains debris and heavy metals due to poor production quality controls, 
that will increase your risk of chronic illness, mental illness and learning disabilities, and even death,
that contains known dangerous neurotoxic ingredients that will persist in your body, even your brain,
that your gov, doctor, fda and cdc collude to keep you uninformed about.

       It's an additive that affects the immunological response to the vaccine (ie. Stimulating T-Cells vs. B-Cells) depending on what the vaccine is trying to accomplish. My guess is you have done no research beyond your antivaxx confirmation biased YouTube circle jerks.  I've read plenty of peer reviewed papers on vaccine efficacy and I've studied the natural biological mechanisms vaccines use to create immunity. Actually studied. My B.S. was in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. Now's where you say you won't "defer to authority" while in the same breath you will defer to the authority of the infintesimally small number of antivaxx doctors who have everything to gain from pitiful rubes who believe them.

       The authority argument is the biggest piece of contradictory nonsense I have ever heard. Anyone that uses that argument literally cannot cite ANY sources, except for ones they generate COMPLETELY independently. By that logic, only research you do yourself, u/naturalproducer, is citable by to confirm your argument.

       Alum is avidly uptaken when injected and results in accumulation in brain
      </p>
      <p>
       “Safety concerns largely depend on the long biopersistence time inherent to this adjuvant, which may be related to its quick withdrawal from the interstitial fluid by avid cellular uptake; and the capacity of adjuvant particles to migrate and slowly accumulate in lymphoid organs and the brain, a phenomenon documented in animal models and resulting from MCP1/CCL2-dependant translocation of adjuvant-loaded monocyte-lineage cells (Trojan horse phenomenon). These novel insights strongly suggest that serious re-evaluation of long-term aluminum adjuvant phamacokinetics and safety should be carried out.”

       I'll admit this is the first I've heard of adjuvant's. I'm certainly no expert on them. A quick search (seriously no digging) says they boost your immune response while providing no immunity themselves. I'm also seeing that some types can keep antigens around longer to help vaccines. Others just cause a stronger immune response directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I not sure why lack of knowledge about adjuvants make your pro vaccine coworkers "bootlickers". The ones that keep the antigen around longer only really seem helpful for vaccines as this is in no way helpful for a live virus. The ones boost your immune response directly could have use, but they only would have killed you faster if you had the

       The spanish flu was deadly because it caused a person's immune system to kill them. It killed mostly healthy people in their prime, and left the young/elderly.

       There was a big problem with soldiers coming home from Iraq having terrible symptoms, which some researchers tried to link to adjuvants in a vaccine.  Squalene is a wonderful supplement taken orally, but injected directly as an adjuvant, it provoked an immune response that can be disabling, as the body will then attack similar compounds which are found in the human body.  It creates an autoimmune disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway that's one adjuvant problem I remember.

       Can we talk about delayed vaccinations spread out vs a barrage of them at one time?  I have seen kids get very ill with the latest schedules.  Some get effected some don’t we know that.

       The authority argument is the biggest piece of contradictory nonsense I have ever heard. Anyone that uses that argument literally cannot cite ANY sources, except for ones they generate COMPLETELY independently. By that logic, only research you do yourself, u/naturalproducer, is citable by to confirm your argument.

       Good for you for having the courage to talk about this irl. I do too. We need to speak up. The pro vaccine bullies we encounter on line are not what you will generally encounter irl when you talk about this. IRL people are very amenable to the idea that (shock horror) pharmaceutical companies might use their annual multi million dollar marketing budgets to systematically down play the risks of currently accepted vaccination practices.

       Just like all anti-vaxxers are big brains with advanced medical and scientific knowldege. /s Perhaps it's a surprise, but there are plenty of people who support vaccinations that have done their own research and came to a conclusion different from yours.

       Lucija Tomljenovic and Christopher Shaw's studies have plenty of detractors. Which makes their conclusions are, at the very least, controversial.  And the paper OP refers to "Aluminum in brain tissue" uses a Tomljenovic and Shaw paper as a reference:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Paediatric vaccines that include an aluminium adjuvant are an indirect measure of infant exposure to aluminium and their burgeoning use has been directly correlated with increasing prevalence of ASD [11].
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is not proven. Here's a piece refuting the conclusions in the study OP refers to:

       I find it pretty galling that OP, who didn't present much in the way of science (and didn't present ANY science when they first wrote the post) calling others anti-science.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to decide for themselves which science is better. But they also need to make sure they look at lots of sources not just ones that might fit what they already think.

       That was because he used the scientific method and his detractors didn't. Pretty sure the scientists of today talking about Vaccines (which is well established science) are using the method. There is a point where continuing to doubt something doesn't make you an outside the box free thinker who's ahead of your time and you just become an unreasonable idiot. And you're comparing yourself to Galileo? Someone thinks highly of themselves...

       Aluminum doesn't stop being a neurotoxin just because you put it in a vial and slap a "vaccine" label on it.  That's a fact.  Offer vaccines without the toxic adjuvants and watch the "anti-vax" movement dissolve overnight.

       But I'm curious though... When you heroically called out all those people at the office, did you present them with your degree in immunology or virology? Or did you just hit them with some antivaxxx buzzword that you found online?

       I think it's funny. Now that you guys have finally let go of the mercury argument (or rather, it was destroyed), you are grasping onto aluminum.

       You were right to bring up the Galileo comparison. You're just not Galileo. Like his detractors, you don't understand the science, and you are afraid of what you don't understand, so you vilify and demonize it.

       So you're just going to gloss over the fact that you are citing work that has been debunked due to the outright falsification of data? And then you want me to prove why the overwhelming consensus of science is right, and your disproven conspiracy theory is wrong?
      </p>

       That's not how this works. You made the claim that the aluminum adjuvants in vaccines are dangerous. Now, you get to prove that claim.

       I feel the best eye opener is a discussion about the CDC recommended recombinant flu vaccine. I ask my doctor about it every time I go in, and it breaks down my nurse's brainless blurb about how important getting a flu shot is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it not interesting they would rather prescribe Tamiflu after getting symptoms than working a little to get the most effective vaccine?

       Just some flu vaccine facts
      </p>
      <p>
       Flu vaccine makes flu more life threatening with only 10% chance of even providing any protection.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/21880755/">

       Flu Vaccination hampers the development of virus-specific CD8(+) T cell responses.  (Natural immune response is suppressed. )
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20614424/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20614424/
       </a>
       Flu vaccine studies reviewed and found it provided—
“... modest time off work and had no effect on hospital admissions or complication rates. Inactivated vaccines caused local harms and an estimated 1.6 additional cases of Guillain-Barré Syndrome per million vaccinations. The harms evidence base is limited.”
      </p>
      <p>

       Those who were vaccinated for flu were 5x more likely to get sick of flu or other infections.

       Vaccinated ppl who got the flu had higher than usual virus ‘shedding’, so they could the spread flu by JUST breathing around others, not the usual sneezing/coughing required.

       This does not even address the very substantial  risks of ‘adjuvants’. Flu vaccine multi-dose still contains mercury (Thimerosal). All the others contain Aluminum.  Adjuvants are ingredients in the vaccine to enhance immune response to the microbe.

       also, veterinarians are hip to adjuvants and lately I've heard they try to avoid them when possible.  they give vaccinations in limbs rather than shoulders/hips, now, since vaccination location has high correlation with cancerous tumors.  Easier to amputate a paw than a shoulder.

       Aluminum could do whatever to the brain, doesn’t matter. If you know
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       , and I mean
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       , about basic chemistry, you know that chemicals behave differently when combined with other chemicals
      </p>
      <p>
       Like table salt. Table salt is 50 percent sodium, and 50 percent chloride. Chloride is incredibly deadly even in very small amounts, and sodium is so volatile that it can
       <em>
        explode
       </em>
       if you even spill it. But you put sodium and chloride together? They make ordinary, harmless table salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, all those “crazy chemicals” you hear about in vaccines (most of which are unfounded) don’t mean ANYTHING. Educate yourself

       Yep. And because they say vaccines are inherently safe, they do very few long term toxicity studies.
      </p>
      <p>
       " Experimental evidence also shows that simultaneous administration of as little as two to three immune adjuvants can overcome genetic resistance to autoimmunity. In some developed countries, by the time children are 4 to 6 years old, they will have received a total of 126 antigenic compounds along with high amounts of aluminum (Al) adjuvants through routine vaccinations. According to the US Food and Drug Administration, safety assessments for vaccines have often not included appropriate toxicity studies because vaccines have not been viewed as inherently toxic."

He doesn't do science, but he's learned some of the discoveries brought about by people who do science to be able to apply it to real world systems. That said, he's pretty science illiterate which is why he stopped posting on Twitter, real scientists were telling him he was wrong about shit. I wish different fields had different science spokespeople instead of Niel Degrass Tyson trying to educate people on GMO's because "well he's a scientist". Can we get a famous Biochemist on TV?

       Dude the polio virus is for the most part dormant in those who carry it, even those not vaccinated against it. It has NOTHING to do with the vaccine. Weak bodies become affected, not infected bodies. This whole vaccine theory is a big story they indoctrinated us into during school. Natural herbs and detox methods are much more effective (and thus less profitable) if done in a preventative way according to the time, place, and circumstance.

       Why is that embarrassing? How do you think people dress in a research lab? (Hint: it's usually jeans and a shirt, like what I wear anyway) I'm also still in grad school but hey at least I get paid to teach undergrad courses. BTW I think your math is off. Average master plumber makes $48,000/yr and the top %10 make $79,000/yr. Average salary for someone with a graduate degree in Biophysics is around $100,000/year and the top earners make over $200,000/year.

       Yes I understand you are just pointing out the situation as it stands and not condoning it. But what I don’t see is your objection to fact these ppl give themselves illegal and unethical powers over citizens’ rights.  Most ppl still believe their docs, cdc, gov is acting for their best interest and can’t conceive they are blatantly being deceived about what the risks of vaccines really are, the lack of scientific safety basis for recommendations, and general sloppiness in research and quality control. Inexcusable and unforgivable.  Did not mean to bash on you personally.

       Its called having a family medical history. I was born with asthma but not heart disease, theres a chance I
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       develop a heart problem or even cancer. In the end its not like you can blame vaccines for hereditary diseases that you may or may not have from birth or develop later on.

       I'm sure there's at least one scientist who buys into that shit. You can always find some loony to back something no matter how bat-shit it is.
