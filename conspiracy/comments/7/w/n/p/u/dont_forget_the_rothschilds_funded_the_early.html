       Well, killing lots of Jews was a necessary "sacrifice" to the people who funded the Nazis and orchestrated WWII (Rothschilds, etc). It then gave the "Elders" the worldwide sympathy they needed to steal the lands of Palestine and create the illegitmate state of "Israel".

       Actually, the owner of Domino's Pizza works with Legatus. An equally powerful group of financial elite. I'm not sure if the Rothschilds are involved though.

       Reinhardt said the the next "dead cat bounce" (financial term) would occur last week - which it did, with the DOW slipping below the 8000 mark and staying below it steadily.

       You do realize Rothschilds are Jewish, right?  It is equally, if not more likely that Zionists funded the Rothschilds and helped them gain power.  Its easier for a lot of somewhat wealthy people to make one person really wealthy than one really wealthy person funding lots of people.

       That's really semantics, people can argue Jesus wasn't a real Jew, Obama isn't black, and so on.  If you consider yourself a Jew and Jews are called upon for some reason, you'll probably answer.

       "...It is as ridiculous to call them "people of the Holy Land," as it would be to call the 54 million Chinese Moslems "Arabs." Mohammed only died in 620 A.D., and since then 54 million Chinese have accepted Islam as their religious belief. Now imagine, in China, 2,000 miles away from Arabia, from Mecca and Mohammed's birthplace. Imagine if the 54 million Chinese decided to call themselves "Arabs." You would say they were lunatics. Anyone who believes that those 54 million Chinese are Arabs must be crazy. All they did was adopt as a religious faith a belief that had its origin in Mecca, in Arabia...."

       Not all Jews are Zionists and not all Zionists are Jews. The Zionist Movement didn't really start gaining traction until the late 1800s, thats when Hebrew was revived as a spoken language outside of temple so on and so forth. By that time Mayer Amschel Rothschild had long commissioned his sons to create and run central banks across Europe. So first came the House of Rotschild, in fact they were early patrons of Zionism and Israel. They donated the Knesset building and the Israeli Supreme Court Building to give you an idea.
