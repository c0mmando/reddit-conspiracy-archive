<p><a href="https://www.newdawnmagazine.com/articles/a-new-theory-for-the-great-pyramid-how-science-is-changing-our-view-of-the-past">https://www.newdawnmagazine.com/articles/a-new-theory-for-the-great-pyramid-how-science-is-changing-our-view-of-the-past</a></p>

<p><strong>Article TLDR</strong>; a hydraulic ram pump built into the base of the Great Pyramid was first used to facilitate its construction but ultimately had the purpose of generating a pulse that would resonate in the King&#39;s Chamber, which would in turn emit an electrical field in the nearby region, facilitating plant growth.</p>

<p>Now I wonder: Why isn&#39;t this the official explanation? Has this been debunked? If so, how does it fall short? If not, are there any other such working modern devices that have been built?</p>

<p>Nothing new, I know, but with building-scale 3d printers out there and popular science billionaires like Elon Musk planning on going to Mars, maybe the feat is worth being reproduced?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the frequencies generated assisted  the priests in meditations, bye raising theyre personal frequencies. they would lie in the catuche and practice astral travel, to visit higher dimensional realms. the pyramids were literal portals for those who became adept in the practice. many of the adepts  were able to physically transport themselves to other planes of existence. it was being done to obtain information. some left and never came back. it is written about in the osiris chamber. of course those are all egyptian myths. all the images of bird headed people and others are renditions of what they saw in theyre travels. and were said to be helpers in the underworld. the underworld wasn&#39;t actually below us like a hell or heaven.......it was a place in between realms.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hmm good point.</p>

<p>When did these annual floodings stop, though. Currently there aren&#39;t any, right?</p>

<p>It may be that they weren&#39;t around when the pyramids were built - or that the builders foresaw that they&#39;d stop. After all, the pyramids seem to have been meant to last a very long time.</p>

<p>(Hmm but then why build something that will only be needed later, and expect the pyramids to &quot;work&quot; without maintenance or instructions, when clearly they would currently be needed but are &quot;out-of-order&quot;...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. According to this article and the wikipedia entry for &quot;Flooding of the Nile&quot;, the flooding effectively stopped only because they built a dam very recently to better store the incoming water.</p>

<p>Going back to your previous statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The annual flooding was a natural fertilizer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While that may have been true at some point, it certainly hasn&#39;t been for some time now. Here are the numbers I could find:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Sahara began changing from a savannah to a desert. The climates changes in the Sahara occurred in two episodes---the first 6,700 to 5,500 years ago and the second 4,000 to 3,600 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="http://factsanddetails.com/world/cat56/sub364/item1962.html">http://factsanddetails.com/world/cat56/sub364/item1962.html</a>)</p>

<p>ie roughly 4700BC to 3500BC and 2000BC to 1600BC</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the Great Pyramid of Giza [...] was built [...] over a 10 to 20-year period concluding around 2560 BC.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza</a>)</p>

<p>Hmm, so foreseeing (or experiencing the start of) the &quot;second episode&quot; could have triggered construction of the pyramids. (Assuming of course plant growth is the purpose of the pyramids.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The misuse of pyramids and technology of that age caused earthquakes and floods, possibly on a global scale.  The Hopi story about the Third World details a war.  There might have been large scale changes to the nature of human consciousness (fall of man) coincident with that disaster.  Most of the top-level foolishness and malevolence we see today is motivated by yearning for that world instead of leaving those things in the past.  Some just can&#39;t let go, and no cost is too great for them in the pursuit of this insanity.</p>

<p>Oh I wholeheartedly admit that we don&#39;t know (as long as we ignore the current mainstream&#39;s view of things). I&#39;m just wondering where exactly does the science behind this theory fail to deliver.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s an important question to ask because depending on the answer, it would mean at the very least a rework of history, and at best a powerful settlement or land fertility tool moving forward.</p>

<p>Also, if this holds true, then there might be a reason why it is being covered up behind the sarcophagus story. Maybe, let&#39;s say, this technology does more than just affect plants, but humans as well. Just a thought.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Great Pyramid itself, was both a power generator [more about it can be
found in the chapter on metaphysics], and a center for final stage spiritual initiation
for the Children of the Law of One. Its great hall was once lined with the painted
tablets, depicting the stages of spiritual development and initiation that were later
to become the Major Arcana of the Tarot. The humanimals were treated in other
pyramids - the various places of healing and consciousness raising, that were built
in that area. They were released from enough bondage there, so that they were at
least  capable  of  finding  their  own  freedom,  their  own  way  back  to  the  One.  --  Page 82  --  <a href="http://www.vielewelten.at/pdf_en/jon%20peniel.pdf">http://www.vielewelten.at/pdf_en/jon%20peniel.pdf</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a conspiracy theory I like, not because it is plausible (it certainly ain&#39;t) but because it just has enough references to make it theoretically, somewhat at least, possible.</p>

<p>Only that the article gets a few things wrong (or very right, depending on how you see it), but lets dig in: </p>

<p>1) A great pyramid as a hydraulic ram pump might be possible only that limestone is quite probably the worst material conceivable for it as it reacts badly to acidity. So whoever engenieer the &quot;great ram pump of Giza&quot; either totally trusted the nile water or just waited for a total brakdown of his system. </p>

<p>2) skipping ahead: ploarized materials show piezoelectric effects. There are some papers out there about chances in earths electric field during earthquakes (e.g. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004JB003092/full">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2004JB003092/full</a>) so  - yeah, in principle it is possible only that you need very high stress/pressure to make it work. </p>

<p>3) Air is a really bad medium to translate vibrations to.  As funny as it sounds, in comparison to limestone, air is basically an acoustic insulator. So to make this thing work the driving mechanisms would be the vibrations of the ram pump trough the limestone itself rather than any acoustic effects.    </p>

<p>brings us to 4) The resulting EM-field would, sadly, be weak. Like, really, really, really weak. If magnitude 7 earthquakes are barely enough to influence earths magnetic fields there is little hope that any EMF would be even measurable yet able to penetrate the pyramids hull.</p>

<p>:(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh great input, I really appreciate the technical perspective. I wonder:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1) [...] limestone [...] reacts badly to acidity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since the pump is thought to have had its water input from a basin at the front entrance of the pyramid (see figure 7 at the OP&#39;s link), could it not be that they had devised and used some sort of chemical agent that would ensure a low acidity? Just like how we today regulate our backyard pools&#39; pH.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>3) Air is a really bad medium to translate vibrations to. [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hrmm perhaps then the resonance and ensuing electric field was underground and through the limestone as you are suggesting, rather than in the air?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2) [...] you need very high stress/pressure to make it work. 4) The resulting EM-field would, sadly, be weak. [...] magnitude 7 earthquakes are barely enough to influence [...]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article seems to hint both that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the Great Pyramid operating as the engine, all of the pyramids could be connected by a subtle electrical field to create a canopy of sorts thereby deflecting VLF and ELF into the surrounding fields.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as that the acoustic properties of the Grand Gallery would be that which would have allowed the &quot;granite to sing&quot;. Would it not then be somewhat different from a earthquake, however strong it may be, being that the process is a directed one? </p>

<p>What I mean is that if this generated pulse was amplified/resonated by 3 distinct processes (Grand Gallery, granite blocks, sub-pyramids), then shouldn&#39;t we expect a different result than from some &quot;random noise&quot; earthquake?</p>

<p>Not trying to contradict, just digging deep! And typo away, its the content of the post that matters :)</p>

<p>Well, ask the city of Flint ;) Is is possible? yeah, is it plausible? No.</p>

<p>The problem is that the link between acoustic and a possible EM-field is a weak one.. the guy in the linked paper applied pressures in the vicinity of 50 MPa and that is 500bar. So even if there would be a way to generate a 50Mpa pressure peak with a hydraulic ram pump the great pyramid would only have one puny electric burst and one shiny explosion in it. </p>
