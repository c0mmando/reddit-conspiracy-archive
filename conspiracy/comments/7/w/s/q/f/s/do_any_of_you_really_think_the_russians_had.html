       Yes, that’s why the republican stance on Russia became far more positive before the RNC. And also why Russia hasn’t released anything in the GOP. And why Trump refuses to follow US law and implement sanctions on Russia. It’s bexauaw the democrats are Putin’s friends!

       No it isn't. It is used in other countries as well because it provides that areas with lower populations, but often critical infrastructure such as farming, are not left out in the cold by more densely populated areas voting for their own interests.

       Now we have tyranny of the minority great. People are important empty land. If the right wants to win in more populuous places maybe they should run on a platform other than theocracy. But they have the electoral college and gerrymandered districts so they can continue to be a party of right wing extremeists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The electoral college is also supposed to act as a safe guard with the electors rejecting unqualified, corrupt, and dangerous candidates. Worked out well.

       You should have seen the map here in Chicago before Gerrymandering was stopped it was hilarious and ridiculous at the same time.
Living here my entire life I've seen the worst of the worst during elections ...from people giving out money for votes to union thugs telling you who you "are" going to vote for.

       If your truly interested into some of the circumstantial evidence look into his dealings with Felix Sater, Trump SOHO, the Florida mansion sale and Trump Panama. It would definitely seem like there is some money laundering going on with these Trump properties. To what extent I don't know.

       Number one rule of any investigation. Follow the money. The money laundering could be part of a quid pro quo to help Trump win.

       I don't care if his business dealings were shady...seems like most businessmen are.  But you say circumstantial evidence and "could be" part of quid pro quo, so I'll let it rest there.  If it is so fishy, why isn't mainstream media all over it?  Methinks they would've have run with it already if that were the case.  Unless Trump controls the media that hates him.

       <p>
        Whatever the truth of Donald Trump’s relationship with the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin, Sater is likely to end up being part of the story. He surfaced this week in leaked emails that he sent in 2015 to Trump’s lawyer, claiming he could engineer Putin’s support for a Trump Tower in Moscow and thus, somehow, a victory in the US presidential election.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       “Our boy can become president of the USA and we can engineer it,” Sater said, according to one of the emails, leaked to the New York Times. “I will get all of Putin’s team to buy in on this, I will manage this process.”

       <p>
        Sen. Ron Wyden, the committee's ranking member, on Friday requested the financial records of the sale of Trump's former estate in Palm Beach to Dmitry Rybolovlev.
Wyden's letter outlined how Donald Trump bought a 6.3-acre property in Florida for $41.35 million in 2004 and then sold that property to a company owned by the businessman four years later. The sale price to Rybolovlev more than doubled Trump's initial investment, to $95 million. The property's appraisal in 2008 fell short of that sale price by $30 million, Wyden said.

       These transactions mean buyers can hide their finances and identities and avoid legal scrutiny, according to a report by BuzzFeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       More than 1,300 Trump condos were bought by shell companies instead of people and the deals were completed without a mortgage, records of Trump's property deals show.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Treasury Department says these characteristics could mean the buyer is laundering money.
      </p>
      <p>
       The amount of money possibly being laundered, which has been calculated by BuzzFeed, totals at around $1.5 billion.

       If more important stories are going to come out about him like he claims, why doesn't he just say what they are?  And, it doesn't seem like the article states in any way what he really did from 2009 til the email sending, so that email doesn't mean much, does it?  Has Sater since benefited in any way?

       Trump won because Hillary is so off-putting and ran on a selfish platform that did not inspire voters.
      </p>
      <p>
       2016 was the election for anti-establishment vote, Trump and Bernie were the candidates that voters thought could offer that, the DNC stopped that from happening because it was 'her time'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even with mass voter fraud and electronic voting machines owned by a Clinton donor Trump was still able to win the election. Russia had nothing to do with it and was created after the Clinton camp read Saul Alinsky and decided to accuse Trump of what they themselves were doing with the assistance of the media.

       I'm guessing you believe trump claims of voter fraud even though he has given no proof? Clinton is such a Mastermind but doesn't know how the electoral college works? Grow the hell up and start using some common sense. You laid out why she lost in your first two paragraphs then completely ruin it and make yourself sound like an idiot in the last one.

       That's exactly what it was. People have been brainwashed to believe (by the media and by useful idiots, and in the case of social media, shills) that if you don't believe in the Russia narrative, it means you just love Trump! I can think the Russian collusion narrative is a bunch of shit cooked up by the DNC and their cronies, while also not supporting the dude.

I'm kind of getting the impression that being impartial and objective, without regards to party lines, is frowned upon by a particular set of users in this sub.

       No, I don't support Trump. I think he's probably going to end up getting us into a massive war, by design. I don't think anyone ends up president by accident, and I think he's controlled opposition.

       I just think that the belief that Clinton is more of a political outsider than Trump is unbelievable. I struggle to see how anyone can think that.

       The RNC publicly criticized Trump through the entire primaries, while the DNC colluded to make Clinton the candidate and to shaft Bernie.

       Ya'll people trying to defend Hillary really are oblivious to why she lost and defending the corporadem/neolibs is fixin' to screw Dems in '18 and '20.  Trump is an embarassment, but we're stuck with him because HRC was such an absolutely crap-tacular candidate.  HRC was so bad people on the far left were willing to roll the dice on a
       <strong>
        republican.
       </strong>
       Yet people still try to defend Hillary.  There's pretty major issues, like Iraq and TPP, where Trump was more in line with the far left than Hillary even before he ran.

       And about 20 more major issues where any lefty voting for him loses and semblance of credibility: Investigating the Russia 2016 connection, stopping further Russian election meddling, stopping starve the beast tactic, deregulation, more and cheaper healthcare, not playing the trickle down game, not giving rich people tax cuts, not repealing net nuetrality, strengthening unions...

       Yeah, money laundering and the likes that every corrupt career politician, including Hillary, is guilty of. You won't be seeing the same neoliberal MSM outlets talking about this shit if she was elected. If they do, the narrative they spin will further the deep state policy of demonizing and antagonizing Russia and throwing us closer and closer to a war with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is -still- no evidence that Russia had any meaningful impact in the elections.

       You see the same talking heads in the MSM spewing this bullshit but refusing to talk about how the elections are rigged from the start by corporations, MIC, Intelligencia, and wealthy families. No mention of Israel's massive pull in the US government. No mention of the the DNC's literal collusion with the HRC campaign as well as conspiring to keep Bernie from being elected.

       This is true to a degree. However, regulations are largely a trap, because the regulating agencies get captured by the businesses they are supposed to oversee. These big businesses then use these regulations to fuck smaller businesses and stifle competition. Or "regulations" are instated that actually do nothing to prevent the behavior that necessitated their creation to create a facade of control.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example is the New Deal. To start with, FDR was competely under the control of the Council on Foreign Relations. But he was portrayed as this anti-Banker, and the New Deal his magnum opus.
However, these regulations did nothing to actually fix the financial systems.

      <p>
       There was a desire for a non establishment candidate.

       Sure trump and Bernie are both not that in their way. 
But they are also that as well. Even if one is a billionaire and the other a career politician.

       Bernie marched with civil rights leaders, Trump doesn't even like minorities and wants to continue the war on drugs. Trump is VERY much in line with the Establishment and prison-industrial complex. False equivalency.

       Makes perfect sense. He spoke out against the aspects of the globalist agenda that have harmed the American pubic the most; illegal immigration and disastrous trade agreements. The globalists that own the Democrats and establishment Republicans  needed some excuse to avoid saying that the will of the people were realized, so we get the Russian boogeyman fairy tale. If you want to see a foreign country that really manipulates the US government, look at Israel.

       It's sad that society has fallen to this point. When you say Try English that in and of itself is an attack. I was obviously using English and all you can muster is an attack on my grammatical error. And then you try to say it's not an attack? That's just an idiotic statement.

       The first article is your standard CNN Trump hitpiece that attempts to exploit the fact that the averarage CNN viewer is ignorant of business. Bonds are standard debt instruments in finance and there is nothing nefarious about Trump's business using them for funding.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Atlantic, also known for its extreme left wing bias, attempts to make it appear as if holders of Trump's corporate bonds have influence over him.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Wells Fargo. JPMorgan Chase. Fidelity Investments. Prudential PLC. Vanguard Group. These are among the major financial institutions that own business debt held by Donald Trump
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Bondholders exert no influence over the debtor, unless the debtor defaults  In this case, it would be Trump's corporations, not Trump that were affected by default. Trump is personally insulated from these liabilities, except for the debt that he personally guaranteed, which by the Atlantic's own admission is less than $100M. Again, the Atlantic is attempting to portray bonds as some sinister boogeyman to its naive readers. If this were the case, we'd all be speaking Chinese because ey arecone of the largest holders of US bonds.

       The FT is behind a paywall and the last link was bad. So, in summary, you failed to provide anything other than partisan propaganda to support your claim.

       the concept that was "the United States of America" doesn't exist now (if it ever did). "America", just as the rest of the world, is just another part of the game board. the players are a lot more global and networked than "Republicans vs. Democrats"

      <p>
       After a full year of accusations. Full scale investigations from multiple agencies still haven't produced anything which you could consider solid proof. only shitloads of rhetoric 
'he said, she said, we think, we assume'
      </p>
      <p>
       A conspiracy theory that went mainstream.
But it's not even a good solid conspiracy theory to begin with....

      <p>
       Besides, Russia isn't dumb
Intervening directly will get you caught. They know that
Has Russia hacked targets in the US? surely. But only to gather information. Not to act or manipulate
      </p>
      <p>
       If Russia really wanted to destroy the US. Why even act?  Exposing yourself
      </p>
      <p>
       Gov is acting like a borderline persona with tendency to abuse substances. 
Doesn't need help, self destruction well underway for the last 20+ years

       Exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a homicide, the victim has been found by a local policemen. He calls it in
      </p>
      <p>
       By the time forensics and the corner arrive on the scene, hours have passed. By this time, there is no body to be found, neither anything indicating that there was a body at any given point. Also by this time it's unclear which police officer was first at the scene and who called it in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Days and weeks pass. They can't even find the slightest of evidence of a violent crime, let alone the murder itself. Not a single drop of blood. not even any disturbance on the concrete floor, a fine thick pristine looking layer of dust everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you still believe the by now unknown source?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because tempering leaves a trail. Maybe unable to pinpoint the one behind it but, it's damn sure someone left a trail, a few drips of blood, some bodily fluids, disturbance of the ground.
       <br/>
       Indicates the unknown by now police agent wasn't lying. He did indeed see a body, which is now gone...

       It always leave traces.  Same for hacking specially crucial machines such as voting machines use extensive logging. meaning
even the slightest disturbance of dust will be found

       If all those people still can't find even something which proofs tempering... Makes me question if they're not just chasing a ghost. It was never there

       Compared to the Russian oligarchs, the American oligarchs had far far greater motive, capability, and opportunity to influence the election. Hillary's campaign spent much more than the Trump campaign, and Hillary got all of those months of free support (including cheating) from the press, from the Internet gatekeepers, and from corporations in general. In fact, it was impossible that someone hated as much as Hillary could have beat her, until those at the top decided about 10 days before the election to go with Trump instead because Hillary had become too much of a threat to the

       No.  The entire Russia thing was first floated by Team Clinton back in May '16, about the same time Seth Rich was downloading documents to leak.  Some of us were asking why the DNC didn't accept the FBI's offer to analyze the server.  The entire OMGRSHNZ!!! narrative is a smokescreen by the people who enabled Hillary.  The neocons and corporadems don't want rank'n'file/average, small 'd', Dems dwelling on how the DNC coronated the candidate that gave the country Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even actions at the top of the Dem food chain belie the claims.  If Trump is Putin's puppet, why did over 1/3rd Dems vote to re-auth FISA,?  Why are Trump's appointees/picks getting confirmed?

       Republicans and Democrats both decided the sanctions should be imposed and made it so their decidion couldn't be vetoed. Trump signed off on it but, because he loves Russia so very much, neglected to actually sign it.

       However, he is enforcing the sanctions, despite the common narrative to the contrary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sanctions in question are to be imposed on people and businesses conducting certain sorts of transactions with Russia. Since the sanctions bill has deterred people from conducting those transactions, there is no one to sanction.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is someone you believe has violated the bill and should therefore be sanctioned, please provide that information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise we can see that Trump has both signed and enforced the sanctions law.

        Since the sanctions bill has deterred people from conducting those transactions, there is no one to sanction.

      <p>
       You actually have the balls to say "he is enforcing the sanctions" presumably by not sanctioning anyone as "there is no one to sanction."

       I have asked twice before that you please refrain from personal attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article you have provided:
      </p>
      <p>
       A State Department spokesperson said by email that the administration is "using this legislation as Congress intended to press Russia to address our concerns related to its aggression in Ukraine, interference in other nations’ domestic affairs and abuses of human rights."
      </p>
      <p>
       Potential targets of future penalties "have been put on notice, both publicly and privately, including by the highest-level State Department and other U.S. government officials where appropriate, that significant transactions with listed Russian entities will result in sanctions," the spokesperson added.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the sanctions bill is being enforced, as per the linked article, and in exactly the way I previously described.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I previously mentioned, if you believe there are entities that should be penalized and are not, feel free to share that with us here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise, the conclusion based on the information provided is that Trump is enforcing the sanctions law.

       The law wasn't to "put anyone on notice" it was to actually enforce sanctions.

       I don't know if you're being deliberately obtuse or if you're really this misinformed, but I will not be speaking with you again.

       Trump's administration even made up a list of potential targets that he, shockingly to everyone but you, took no action against at all.

       Trump had a message that resonated with many. I myself did not take him seriously for a good while and frankly thought it was a publicity stunt initially. As time went on and I did my own research I realized that wasn't the case and his agenda/message were what America needed. I will explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) People can accuse/call the man "racist" all they wish but that simply isn't the case from what I found. Wanting to secure the country, wanting to hold people responsible for their crimes (anyone), calling it issues regardless of race speak to the heart of fact superseding every other issue. For the past several decades society had come to a place where being offended or being scared you may offend someone is of greater value than speaking to an issue, speaking truth and coming together to discuss issues. Our very country was founded on the discussion of issues and coming together to form the best conclusion and that was attacked the past few decades and replaced with ridiculous identity conversation which holds absolutely no value to better serving the bottom line. Should everyone be treated equally? You're damn right. Should there become an equality plus one value attached to someone based on identity? Hell no and that has been happening at the risk of offending others and that simply cannot happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) I did not like the "grab" statement. However, I have been around sports and "locker rooms" my entire life and while I am positive few will admit they have taken part in such conversations I am positive nearly every man has whether they want to admit it or not. Granted what he said was over the norm but, still, he didn't do it, he merely said what "does" and "could" happen and therefore I couldn't hold it against him. If he had done it, a woman complained with evidence and he was convicted, then case closed but he merely stated how many women react to powerful men. Was he wrong? I don't think he was. Does that make it cool? No but it still doesn't make him wrong. Point being, I saw no reason to hold it against him.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Clinton and that ilk have effectively caused so many issues for so long now. I can write a novel on this and, if anyone wishes, will further explain but sufficed to say and to keep this precise and concise I will merely state they have caused global issues on such a massive level that her control would have been monumentally detrimental to the future of the country. It is obvious many shared my opinion on this given how the vote ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did the Russians hack our election system and peak? Probably, they have been doing it for decades in one form or another but did they alter the election? Hell no. If there was even a chance that happened the hell that would have been raised would have been biblical in nature by the left. I do personally (my own opinion) believe that Putin/Russia saw Trump as a chance to come together with a potential ally in America where as they saw Clinton as a sure fire path to war given her blaming of them for shit and her accusation constantly being flung. They probably figured that would never end and it would eventually lead to conflict so, on their end, probably felt Trump would be better for both the US and Russia. The result? Well Russia has shared intel with the US on terrorist activity and the US has shared intel with Russia on the same. No reason, at all, that the two countries can't come together for a lasting alliance as the Cold War ended and if both countries were to come together many good things could occur. I see no problem with them preferring one over the other and I have no issue with Russia and that comes from a veteran who had, at one point, every reason to not trust them. At this point, I merely see them as a potential resource and ally that America should potentially consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emotions being the driving force over logic and intellectual decision making are what gets people into trouble on a variety of issues. They see the short view and want a quick fix without recognizing the long term effects their emotions will bring. I recommend people put aside emotion, put aside the ridiculously corrupt/controlled media and do their own research. If they did they would find they have been told many lies. Trump is the best thing to happen for those illegally in country ever (yes I said EVER). Trump is the best thing to happen in terms of securing the borders/country and halting sex trafficking. Just look at what he has done since taking office - there have been 21 major busts already ("major" meaning over 50 in this case). Just look who has been exposed for REAL sex crimes/harassment of women (ie: Hollywood and the elites). He has taken the fight to the worst offenders that many had no idea even existed, how can anyone be upset about that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I repeat, I initially thought it was a joke but he earned my vote as a once independent and I feel it's safe to say I am not alone on that.

        Ben Swann did a report a couple of months ago in which he explained how the Russians tried to influence the election.

       It was a very specific incident and not an overall assessment.

       It is a fact that Twitter and Facebook found a large number of shill accounts which had been operated from Russia which were pumping out anti Clinton / pro Trump messages. How much effect that had, who knows. But they certainly tried.

       I believe Russia had some sort of effort working against both candidates, but focused more on Clinton, in order to somewhat discredit the winner and make it harder for them to lead domestically.  It's not a secret that Putin hates Clinton from her time as SecState, and like just about everyone else, I'm sure he thought she was going to win, or at least the scales tipped in her favor.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was no way Republicans were going to lose Congress, so having a split Legislative and Exec branch affects a lot of foreign policy decisions.  I'm sure if in 2013, if the Dems had the House in addition to the WH and Senate, America likely would have been a lot more involved in Syria.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah I think Russia was definitely involved in Trump's favor in 2016.  The interests are there, and it's basically the only nation on the planet that could actually get away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I think that's what swayed the election?  Maybe to
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       degree.  But, Hillary lost mostly because she ran on a platform of just continuing Obama's policies which we all saw some were good some were bad, but overall just totally average.  You need some new and exciting ideas to win, regardless of party.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest thing though, she has all of the corruption of her husband with
       <strong>
        absolutely none
       </strong>
       of the charisma.  The only people who can't see how blatantly corrupt The Clinton Foundation is has their fingers so far up their ears they can poke the back of their eyeballs.   Donald Trump was bringing Bill's (alleged I suppose) rape victims to debates, while Hillary was bringing people like Meg Whitman - former Ebay CEO and
       <em>
        Republican
       </em>
       candidate for Gov of California.  Which one of those screams "real person" to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, Donald Jr. has
       <strong>
        openly admitted
       </strong>
       to at least attempting to collude with upper class Russians.  Anyone who thinks there's
       <em>
        no chance
       </em>
       of that corruption also has their fingers in their ears.

       I think most major countries have always tried to influence other countries elections... The US certainly has. The question is why it's such a big deal now!? Maybe the influence had a larger effect than expected due to the rise in social media?.

       Hopefully we will get some answers over the next year or two, but I'm not holding my breath.

       I have always been amazed at what an unimaginative and lame story the Russia, Russia, Russia was from its beginning.  Obama admin sells Russia
       <em>
        uranium
       </em>
       , but then accuse.claim Russia was trying to sway election. Why?  They had the Dems where they wanted them already, selling out to highest bidder.

       Did Russia want Trump to win? Maybe.

      <p>
       Did they influence the election in any meaningful way? No.

       Propaganda by state actors is hardly a new thing. Also the US does it all the time. Remember the wikileak exposing US tampering in french elections?

       Not part of the club?  He's cozy with and owes millions to the biggest global banks in the world.  If anything he would be at risk of being a pawn to TPTB considering his entire life is intertwined with these people.
