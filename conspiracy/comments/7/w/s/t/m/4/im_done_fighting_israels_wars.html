<p>Those who oppose their imperialistic war will be labelled anti-Semitic (whatever that means). I&#39;m just sick of fighting their wars.</p>

<p>Side note: They literally could&#39;ve built their nation state in the middle of the US Midwest, and probably would&#39;ve been the most profitable land in America. But instead decided to build a nation state smack dab in the middle of their enemies, who occupied that land since their dispersion some 1,813 years prior.</p>

<p>What even is a Jew anymore? Truly it can only be loosely cultural, as their consistent migration and ethnic mingling could not possibly hold any dominant genetic traits present during Roman rule. German, Dutch, Polish, English, Russian etc are all considered white, yet a Jew is universally held to a differing ethnic standard.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sick of it. And I&#39;m done fighting their wars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven’t even thought of the Israeli deep state until I heard about the strike in Syria the other day.  I thought Israel was draining their swamp too?  I thought Huckabee was a good Patriot but he seems to be justifying Israel’s horrific air strike in Syria which, at first, was blamed on Pro-Assad forces.  Deep state Israel actually attacked some of our SOF teams.    Such an obvious false flag by Israel and now they are blaming it on a “rouge drone” flying in their airspace.  F*ck the deep state and the cabal!!!  They are trying to drag our US military into a proxy war with Iran!  Please, President Trump, bring all our soldiers home and let the Middle East fight their own stupid battles. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, it says pro-assad forces. Not Israel. Better read it more carefully next time mate.</p>

<p>For one, Israeli airstrikes were in the Damascus and Palmyra districts. And there is footage for proof.
Deir Ez Zor is quite very far from Palmyra.</p>

<p>Second, the report says the &quot;Pro Assad forces&quot; used artillery and tanks. Israel used neither of those, because neither its artillery nor tanks can drive hundreds of kilometers in a matter of minutes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city in all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there, and I chose no man as prince over my people Israel;but I have chosen Jerusalem that my name may be there and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.&quot;</p>

<p>The Bible is a tricky one.  Lots of room for interpretation.  I typically don&#39;t like getting in Bible debates, but I find it abundantly clear that there is a strong tie in the relationship between Christians and Jews.  Of course, not all Jews and not all Christians believe that. The variances in belief amungst each religion make the issue not so black and white, and rather touchy.  My only point it that I default to the defense of the (general) Jewish community - more so locally in this part of the world than Isreal.  </p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t know, Assyrians are closer today ethnically to Jesus (the actual real person) than the Israelites. They even spoke the same language. They were some of the first Christian groups and have been shit on for 2000 years. Hell, the US and Canada barely took any refugees in and lumped them in with Muslims. </p>

<p>Swell job following actual events from Christ&#39;s lifetime and sticking to Revelations, which is considered an Apocryphal part of the Bible by most Christian sects outside of Evangelism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Old man? I&#39;m in my thirties. War is natural to humans. There is always a battle to be fought between good and evil, it&#39;s inherent.</p>

<p>So you think it&#39;s better leave Isreal to defend itself against all sorts of enemies? It wouldn&#39;t end well for a lot of people, the the casualties of War would be exponentially greater than if we intervened. Our intervention is more of a roadblock than an offensive, we are there to prevent large scale conflict. There is a lot that I believe you don&#39;t understand about this, which is why you get a pass.</p>

<p>Yes, I would love for there to be zero conflicts that the US is a part of, but reality doesn&#39;t allow for this. The moral high ground is to say <em>I&#39;m sick of being engaged with wars</em>. Although I can fundamentally agree with that, there are other moral obligations that factor in.</p>

Cultivate virtue in the country, and it will be abundant.
Cultivate virtue in the world, and it will be universal.</p>

<p>I can admit to a lot of things that I AM, but a coward I am not. I hope you understand that attacking people is not a constructive way to go aboyt anything. All you have is a name calling hat, a supposed moral high ground, and a lack of compassion (which is ironic considering how hateful you act)</p>

<p>If you want to &quot;understand&quot; then ask questions, I&#39;ll be happy to talk about anything you want - including why I default to the defense of the Jews/Isreal - and why I believe there is obligation to do so.  </p>

<p>I would like to know, if you disagree with defending them, do you support their opposition? Or are you 100% nuetral about it? Are you a Non-interventionaliat? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care about why you fetishize Jews, I care that you think you are not a coward and yet are too afraid too fight yourself. The fact that you are happy to send kids who have no interest in fighting for Israel to die, while too scared to pick up a gun and do it yourself is the definition of cowardice. I don&#39;t care what Israel does as long as we don&#39;t have to send them money and be on the hook for their poor behavior, but since dupes like you exist who allow an environment where Americans have to do their dirty work I would rather they stop attacking their neighbors and creating settlements that make the rest of the world hate them. I support acting in the interests of Americans not Israelis.</p>

<p>&quot;I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you. I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father. They answered him, &quot;Abraham is our father.&quot; Jesus said to them, &quot;If you were Abraham&#39;s children, you would do what Abraham did. ... You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father&#39;s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies. But, because I tell the truth, you do not believe me. Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me? He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is you are not of God.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe because a majority of blame from <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> goes to &quot;THE ((JEWS))&quot; and not Israel.</p>

<p>You are right. It is important to make a distinction between &quot;the Jews&quot; <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/jewish-and/why-are-we-called-the-children-of-israel-and-not-jacob/">(aka the &quot;Children of Israel&quot;)</a> and the <em>political state of Israel</em>, and the Jewish Americans who support it (aka Jewish Zionists).</p>

<p>But is it necessarily unfair or inaccurate to make generalizations? </p>

<p>Would it be inaccurate to say <em>&quot;Americans elected Donald Trump as their President&quot;</em>?</p>

<p>If not, then saying <em>&quot;American Jews support Israel&quot;</em> would be far more accurate.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/2013/10/01/chapter-5-connection-with-and-attitudes-towards-israel/">A 2016 Pew Research poll</a> showed that the overwhelming majority of Jews <strong><em>(87%)</em></strong> in the US see &quot;Caring about Israel&quot; (the political state) as being <a href="http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/09/jew-chp5-2.png">an <em>&#39;Essential&#39;</em> or <em>&#39;Important&#39;</em> part of being Jewish.</a> Meanwhile, only 12 % said that it is not an important part of being Jewish.</p>

<p>Similarly, <strong><em>69%</em></strong> of American Jews surveyed said that they are either &#39;Very&#39; or &#39;Somewhat&#39; <a href="http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/09/jew-chp5-1.png">Emotionally attached to the political state of Israel,</a> compared to 31% who said that they are &#39;Not very&#39; or &#39;Not at all&#39; emotionally attached to Israel. </p>

<p>Also, only <strong><em>11%</em></strong> of American Jews surveyed said that the US government is <a href="http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/09/jew-chp5-9.png">&#39;Too supportive of Israel&#39;.</a>, while 31% said it is &#39;not supportive enough&#39;, and 51% said US support is &#39;About right&#39;. </p>

<p>It is also worth noting that a whopping <strong><em>40%</em></strong> of Jews polled said that <a href="http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/09/jew-chp5-3.png">they had visited Israel.</a></p>

<p>So while it is important to differentiate Jews (the ethnic group) from Israel (the Zionist state), the support for the Zionist state among non-Israeli Jews is <em>so overwhelmingly high</em> that broad statements such as &quot;Jews support Israel&quot; are not at all inaccurate.</p>

<p>These diseases have become prominent as the result of social isolation and in-group breeding for countless generations, beginning with the biblical Abraham.

<p>Modern anthropologists tell us that there is no such thing as &quot;races&quot; among humans, that <em>&quot;race is a social construct&quot;</em>.</p>

<p>They may be right, but if so, Jews are about as close to a &quot;race&quot; as it gets.

<p>What even is a Jew anymore? Truly it can only be loosely cultural, as their consistent migration and ethnic mingling could not possibly hold any dominant genetic traits present during Roman rule.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually they&#39;ve mingled so little and been so insular that jewish genetic traits are quite distinct from their peers. Specifically ashkenazi jews are the ethnic group with the highest ethnicity. This trait, along with the much more significant &#39;togetherness&#39; above all in the jewish community, the fact that they&#39;ve stuck together and supported the community for the past 3 millenia, i think is the reason that a community with a population of 10 million worldwide can hold positions of great economic, political, and media power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews control the press in the USA, so there will always be people who are gaslighted into thinking it is in our best interest to use the military to clear space for greater Israel.  Iran probobly didn&#39;t fly a drone over Israel airspace, but the Jewish media is eager to print their lies.  Iraq was destroyed for Israel and now Syria is as well, but the Russians are helping Assad resist, which is the reason Russia is the current enemy according to our media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Old Testament ‘God’ and the God Jesus spoke of are clearly not the same entity. Realizing that opened my eyes to a lot of the lies I was fed having been raised in a very strict Christian cult my whole life. I realize many atheists have good cause to reject the idea of a God for that very reason.</p>

<p>We’re tricked into thinking a God of love, mercy, and justice would have a ‘special nation’ above all others and then instruct them to murder the people who lived around them for having differing beliefs. Religion seems to have been the best way to inoculate people to spirituality. It’s truly sick how successful evil people can be at twisting good into evil. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do. I think Yahweh might have originally been a positive being but it was likely taken over by a negative group who forced things like the Ten Commandments (thou shalt NOT) which when phrased like that is almost guaranteed to have the opposite effect. I think that being or group infringed on Free Will by enforcing obedience and overall really fucked people up psychologically.</p>

<p>People should live and let live, I think normally that’s how we all want to be. When you’re raised religiously though, everyone is in each other’s business and acting holier than thou when they discover your personal “sins”. I was raised in a snitching environment where the “elders” could discipline you for stepping out of line, even disfellowshipping you forcing your friends and family to completely shun you if you didn’t believe every single thing you’re told to believe.</p>

<p>I don’t anthropomorphize God anymore and see him/her/it as a person but as a force. God is our Creator, our Universe, or maybe our Galaxy. I believe there are levels to soul evolution and humans are at the Third Density of the complete Octave. Things like animals are in the Second Density. Yahweh, Jesus, Buddha, Krishna etc. were likely Fourth or Fifth Density beings and had abilities that would make them appear to be Gods to primitive humans. I mean, what were “angels flying in mid heaven with great wings making a terrible noise”? Sounds like technology to me. </p>

<p>Life is an endless cycle and you and I and everyone and everything are each a single facet of God or the <em>Logos</em>, slowly advancing through the stages as we learn our life lessons and progress . I think we exist to experience Life in its infinite possibilities. We are all One and there is no real separation between all life, only identity. Anyway, I read and watch a lot of David Wilcock’s research if any of that resonates with you and you’re interested in that kind of thing.</p>

<p>What about the ones that come home with missing limbs? What about the ones who will spend years in therapy trying to deal with their PTSD? What about the ones who never come home? Every single person who signs up to the military is volunteering to give a limb, their sanity, or their life in a moments notice if called on to do so. How many jobs do you know that require you to sign up for that? I&#39;m guessing your job doesn&#39;t.

<p>No. Not even close. Even if I had stated above that which you are attributing to me, I would not be guilty of casting those in our military as villains. I stated that the military is a jobs program. A person can have nothing and come from nothing, barely be able to read or write, and sign a contract with an institution that will provide them with free room and board, health care, a free education at the higher learning institution of their choosing, retirement after 20 years w/pension, free travel and the privilege of seeinv the world, etc... Joining the military is the easiest way to break the cycle of poverty, crime, and lack of education that many families cope with today. A person can go from homeless to middle class in the space of ten years and provide the ground work, lay a foundation, for their families for generations to come. It is the grandest example of upward socio-economic mobility in the history of the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know man. I&#39;ve been in the IDF for 5 years, done my mandatory service plus 2 years of professional service. While I wasn&#39;t in combat duty, I have done my part and a respectable service to my country and people. From what you&#39;re saying, it doesn&#39;t seem like you were in the IDF.</p>

<p>If you were indeed in the IDF, as you claim to fight Israel&#39;s wars, you could at least tell where exactly you served. Division, brigade, battalion etc.</p>

<p>Or at least something like center, north, or south.</p>

<p>Most foreign IDF servicemen are Jewish, so it just doesn&#39;t make sense to me that other than criticizing Israel (which is okay) you find it appropriate to bash Jews as a whole (which is not okay, and as if there wasn&#39;t enough evidence of anti-Israel people overwhelmingly being simultaneously anti-semitic). </p>

<p>So as long as you&#39;re sitting on your chair at home, thousands of kilometers away from Israel, I suggest you shut up and quit talking about fighting Israel&#39;s wars, because you clearly haven&#39;t fought for anything in your life, let alone picked up a rifle.</p>

<p>It does so with literally every state. And every state that enters a war seeks international support. Without int&#39;l support you lose. </p>

<p>Also, seriously? Jewish wars? I&#39;m an atheist but I did my service in the IDF. There was nothing Jewish about these wars. And nothing Jewish about protecting my house, family, and countrymen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Usually the justification is for &quot;freedom, democracy, etc etc.&quot;</p>

<p>Never heard those. Israel always uses the same line &quot;We have the right to defend ourselves, and will defend ourselves at all costs&quot;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or in the case of Iraq, &quot;WMDs&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay which one are you referring to? The one in 1981 was actually about WMDs. But that wasn&#39;t a war. That was just a single airstrike against a French-built Iraqi nuclear reactor.</p>

<p>And the one in 2003 is completely unrelated to Israel.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Israel has no reason to fight their own wars when they can just sucker the United States into doing it for them.</p>

<p>Name one war during which the US deployed troops to aid Israel. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends what you want to do. If you don&#39;t want to join the army and you just want to get on with these 3 years of service and move on as fast as possible to civilian life, or you&#39;re just a slacker, you&#39;ll get an office job. Or some other dirty work.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re motivated to do a significant service, you&#39;ll get action. I, for one, wanted a significant service so I went on a special army program that gave me prior high education and I proceeded to serve in the air force in high grade maintenance on F-16I warplanes  as a practical engineer. An airplane can&#39;t take off without a maintenance crew&#39;s signature that it&#39;s in working order.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need combat to see the action. </p>

<p>So it all depends on what you want to do in the army. </p>

<p>Because by your logic, there is not a single military in the world that is a &quot;real fighting force&quot;, because without a wide support network, it all falls apart. </p>

<p>Wanna know how long a tank can drive without requiring maintenance? A day. Maybe a week if you&#39;re lucky. And if you don&#39;t have any specialized men who know all the work from top to bottom you can just throw the whole 6 million dollar thing into the trash because there&#39;s no way you can make it move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US hasn&#39;t taken any active role in the Israeli-related war since Israel&#39;s creation. And there is no war that might involve Israel that will be more significant than any of the wars that took place between 1948 and 1973. So I have my doubts about the US taking an active role now or in the future.</p>

<p>What even is a Jew anymore?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the root of the evil that has happened to Palestine...they are not really Jews. They are actually Zionists who use the Label &quot;Jew&quot; as cover and excuse to murder anyone who may threaten their miserable existence. They&#39;ve infiltrated US government by way of AIPAC and have taken over US foreign policy...sending young American men and women to their deaths in the Middle East. Those who come back, peace of mind destroyed lie with PTSD for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>The Israelis are the biggest cowards on the face of the earth...they bomb Palestinians, who are only armed with rocks, with their F-16&#39;s white phosphorous and 2000lb bombs...not one Zionist Jew will ever set foot in Syria or Iraq. Get ready for the false flag to be blamed on Iran...the peaceful country that makes Israelis piddle in their pants in fear. The neocons backed by Israel and its zionists will be frothing at the mouth for Americans to fight the biggest most deadly Middle Eastern war of all for cowardly Israel. Iranians and Americans will needlessly die as the Israelis party in Tel-Aviv.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree with you 100%.  I vote we give the jews Idaho.  I live in Idaho, and we have a definite shortage of jews.  The education system and tax base could use infusion of jew.  I haven&#39;t seen a synagogue for years.  What we need is a carbon-dated document that proves the jews lived in Idaho 4000 years ago.  Maybe God miraculously caused Abraham to whore it up with the natives or something.  Unfortunately, they&#39;d probably just ADD Idaho to their existing holdings, claim the entire USA as theirs, start building settlements up the street, and then shoot me.  Best they stay with the other psychos in the middle east.</p>
