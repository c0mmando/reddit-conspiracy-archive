<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/78gm5f/anna_faris_high_af_during_this_interview_with/dou32hd/">https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/78gm5f/anna_faris_high_af_during_this_interview_with/dou32hd/</a></p>

<p>A user 3 months ago time stamped the part where she says &quot;I&#39;m so high.&quot; I thought about this recently and looked it up and all the comments beneath that user was deleted. I have not found another original upload. </p>

<p>Coincidence? No.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, specifically mind control. </p>

<p>In 1985 CNN did a special report on radio frequency weapons. They hired an engineer who built an “RF Mind Interference” machine based on Soviet schematics. The machine successfully transmitted images into a CNN reporter’s mind. The stunned engineer said that, given three weeks time, he could scale up the machine to use on a whole town, causing them to do things against their better judgement, see and hear things that weren’t there, etc. <strong>The pentagon said it was too sensitive a subject to comment on.</strong> Remember, these effects were achieved by civilians over 30 years ago! One can speculate that they’ve made great advances in the past decades.</p>

I&#39;ve worked at TV stations and physical copies of everything just gets put into a &quot;filing system&quot; aka it gets tossed into an archive room with a date on it.

    <div class="md"><p>I didnt see when it originally aired. Judging by the quality of the film, my best guess would put it in the early to mid 90s. Ive seen others who claim to remember the interview say it was from 1988. </p>

<p>In the interview he was also talking about how Japan was killing the US in the markets by putting so many products into our markets and how US companies were taking major hits. He thought business and people were getting taken advantage of and it was unfair. Then some other comments and then Oprah said something along the lines of &quot;this sounds like presidential talk.. Have you thought about it? Running for president? </p>

<p>The whole clip I saw was about 10 minutes or so long. Now I can only find a 3 minute segment of that interview </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;m the same way about this stuff. It&#39;s interesting to read about but beyond that - meh. If you&#39;re ever in NYC though I have to suggest taking a tour and spending some time at the Paley Center, it&#39;s a block away from Rockefeller Center and is basically a digital museum of everything that&#39;s ever aired on TV in America. I was enthralled with all of the old Formula 1 races they had. Picture quality is, well, it&#39;s what was aired at the time I&#39;ll put it that way, it&#39;s like $15 but you can reuse your pass for like a year.</p>

<p>Considering that CNN did full day breaking news stories on Trumps &quot;Grab her by the pussy remark&quot; and hours spent on every rape claim no matter how unsubstantiated right before the election, it would seem logical that if this video existed it would have been replayed on loop for weeks before the election.

<p>Not in the slightest. If CNN wanted to actually harm Trumps campaign, they had a litany of subjects they could have focused on that would have destroyed his candidacy. They didn&#39;t want this, so they played spam to fool people like you into thinking &quot;grab her by the pussy&quot; is as bad as it gets with Trump. </p>

<p>It’s because someone took video of him on Oprah and put the text overtop of the video. The way the human brain works, you then associate the two together. Many people recall seeing him say those words on Oprah and that’s why.</p>

<p>She tried to blame it on the bi-polar medication and actually filed suit against Pfizer. The only reason I know it was Pfizer is because I watch with the subtitles on because in the episode, when they say the name of the Pharma company, the name has been removed from the voiceover. </p>
