       Everything Trump supporters bring up as bombshells dies sooo fast, honest question to any supporter willing to answer. At one point do you consider to be on the "wrong" side when they literally pile the BS on top of you over and over. Your president literally just tweeted this is the bombshell and this is it. Do you ever consider the possibility that those people who constantly lie to you and send you into the forums with utmost BS are not good people?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was zero proof the texts were related to Clinton thingy and now circumstantial shows this to be about the Russia thing which would be completely reasonable that Obama wanted to know everything. And the president of the fucking United States calls this the bombshell. Are you not sick of being the pawns of such lie factories?
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody told you Nunes will lie so heavily because he is a partisan habitual liar. You said, "no no bombshell" coming. Withing one day everybody knew he lied exactly as everybody predicted. They told you "vindicating bombshell incoming" at what point do you guys pause and reflect. I asked the same to another guy, do you guys not wonder why you get lied to so fucking often by your "side".
      </p>
      <p>
       Every fucking day complete dishonesty and you move on to the next bombshell. Is there any hard supporter here who changes his mind when he noticed how much Trump lies? Honest question...

       Read my entire text the parathesis are there on purpose. I feel people defend Trumps lies because they for some reason see themselves connected to him. If he falls they fall. So they think I assume.

       No I understand your meaning, but your wording shows at best a tone of sarcastic condescension, and at worst an unwillingness to understand really why the other is doing what they're doing. Reverting to this team mentality is dangerous and detrimental as it is, but seriously, put yourself in the shoes of who you're talking to and imagine your critic starts off presupposing that you're wrong and on the wrong "side" to boot, whatever the hell that means. I mean, where do you even go from there? It doesn't seem like you're genuinely asking a question so much as trying to make someone feel stupid, and there is plenty of that already going around.

       Yeah I would say I am not on this supposed side and explain my reasoning for the specific point I am arguing. In my comment above I
       <strong>
        <em>
         directly
        </em>
       </strong>
       address people who see themselves on a specific team. I myself think the team stuff is nonsense. But most reactions of people are most certainly the result of subconscious team mentality. That is why asked people who see themselves on Trumps team what they think about the constant lieing.

       I could certainly be more polite but I don't think sugarcoating is they way to go because this often gets interpreted as "luring" people into situation. Iam upfront I think people like OP think they are on Trumps team and I hoped one will answer how they feel about the constanst BS they get fed by the person they should look up to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I kinda see what you try to say. You think I should be more polite. This might be correct but this sub is pretty hostile so you rarely switch to "polite mode" when you write here. At least this my impression. I also think folks like OP will bring humanity down so some slighty rudeness is maybe appropriate.

       You know what is really funny?  Information hits in pieces and we are all left to either dig and come to our own conclusions or just take the word of 5 super rich guys who own the media.  Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you are not a person who digs for the truth and follows the MSM narrative. Have you noticed any trends of what usually happens when information drips from the Trump tream?
      </p>
      <p>
       They drop info making a claim but it cannot stand on its legs initially.  The hysterical MSM and it's minion social media army can easily dismiss the claim being made. They do this in a smug condescending mamner and totally miss whats going on. Everytime WH drips info and makes claims that can easily be dismissed, it allows people like Clapper Comey and many others to be caught on record saying things in opposition to WH claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then all of a sudden more drips come out and eventually people realize the WH claim was true.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the lies and spin that were being told by MSM and Politicians trying to dismissed WH are suddenly ignored. Focus and discussions shift.  However we have a nice archive of all the lies being told.  It's red pilling people I never thought would ever support Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet here you are completely oblivious and talking down to everyone like your so intelligent.  I could probably go back to your comment history and find you  dismissing FISA abuse claims by Trump a year ago.

       A text saying Obama want'ed to know everything [ apparently during the Russia meddling investigation ] is not a bombshell.

       Everything of what you said above is conjecture of you. It is just your opinion. You might be correct but there is not a single shred of evidence for this.

       Even then you would still be wrong because there is no evidence of FISA abuse. And you want to hear the smack down hammer? Trump is fine with FISA rules and guidelines since he renewed them. Not a single piece of evidence shows any "abuse". Another bombshell that did not hold up. Which guideline rule was broken? We both know you have no answer to this question.
      </p>
      <p>
       You personally have no shred of evidence that justifies your beliefes. None. You get lied to on a constant basis and have rechognised this so your brain now switched to "they are feeding lies to lure the bad people". Your brain literally accepted that this is all BS and made up an explanation so you can get around admitting you got fooled. I repeat the important part you don't have any shred of any abuse whatsover. Do I say there was none? Nope because I don't claim to know stuff I don't know. Never forget the following: You have zero evidence of what you believe in. Maybe think about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look how you got BSed in the last weeks even the fuckin president straight up spits in your face and claims the revelations today are bombshells. You know full well they are not. Why is this man in this high office straight up parroting what he sees in the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know full well all the bombshells were BS yet you stick to them.

       Along comes the Trump campaign and the corrupt FBI DOJ dems send Carter Page over to Trumps campaign - luckily for the corrupt Dems he secures a lame low end position, then goes on the FBI missions... and returns, for the FBI... at which point the FBI and DOJ write up their "get dirty Don" plan using Carter Page, their own operative, as the "lynchpin" ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter Page REMAINS UNCHARGED TO THIS DAY BECAUSE HE IS AN FBI DOJ INTEL AGENT....
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI obtained the recordings after Sporyshev attempted to recruit an FBI undercover employee (“UCE-1”), who was posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company.
      </p>
      <p>
       UCE-1 might be Carter Page. From NYTimes

      </p>
      <p>
       The court documents say that Mr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital
      </p>
      <p>
       I speculate that they didn't plan for everything to go this far. Their hubris kept them focused on only Hillary winning and still believe she did...
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let's ditch this idea that Page was a controlled FBI informant/asset. That can't work because the TARGET of the FISA warrant was Carter Page. That is, the DOJ/FBI went before a FISA judge and swore under oath that they had credible verified evidence that Carter Page was working FOR a foreign intelligence service -- they alleged that he was a spy for the Russians, with the implication that Trump hired him because of this and Trump, through Carter Page, was colluding with the Russians to defeat Hillary. That's the Government's case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did they think this? Well, according to Nunes' memo, BUT FOR the Steele Dossier, the FISA court would NOT have granted the Carter Page FISA warrant.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, the FBI was relying on the Steele Dossier for the key predicate fact that Page was a Russian Agent in the employ of Trump. Nunes' memo, backed up by the sworn testimony of Comey, states that the FBI thought the Dossier was "salacious and unverified."
      </p>
      <p>
       ShareBlue responds, BUT FISA WARRANT WAS ONLY ISSUED ON DOSSIER!
      </p>
      <p>
       Response: True, everyone admits that the FBI presented additional information to the FISA Judge, but ROSENSTEIN testified under oath that the FISA warrant would not have issue BUT FOR the inclusion of the Steele Dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       So whatever else the FBI presented to the FISA judge, it wasn't enough on its own to justify the FISA warrant. CASE FUCKING CLOSED. FBI rushed to get FISA warrant because they needed it RIGHT NOW to help Hillary Clinton win the election.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Use American Citizen as an informant to bait foreign intelligence agents.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Use FISA to surveil this citizen and use their connections to foreign intelligence agents as the probable cause for them being a spy.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       That is, the DOJ/FBI went before a FISA judge and swore under oath that they had credible verified evidence that Carter Page was working FOR a foreign intelligence service -- they alleged that he was a spy for the Russians
      </p>
      <p>
       They alleged he was a spy, when he was actually a controlled asset.
      </p>
      <p>
       They perpetrated a fraud upon the court.
      </p>
      <p>
       They perpetrated a fraud because the Title I warrant they sought and obtained is the broadest warrant available -- it allows you to look in depth into EVERY person Page had contact with.
      </p>
      <p>
       This, I suspect is what Trump is bragging about here:
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He and his team are "the great sleuth" because they managed to unravel this exceedingly devious FBI/DOJ strategy to surveil and take down Trump.

       this is just your opinion. You have no evidence for that. You don't know which facts convinced the judges. You have actually zero information of that. You are mere speculating and you are interpretating everything as best case scenario for Trump
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you said about the FISA warrant is pure conjecture on your part.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have not shown any evidence that any rules or guidelines were broken and I can proof that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell me exactly which guidlines/rules were broken and how. With evidence. You can't. Nobody has presented any such information. Everything you said is your opinion based on stuff other people told you about there opinions, right? THere is not one bit of evidence. I asked like 10 Trump supporters about that nobody was able to provide any hard facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts are the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Several judges were convinced to grant a new FISA warrant
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Which information convinced them is totally unknown
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The correctness of this information is also totally unknown to the public
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         No broken guidelines are public knowledge
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump himself who is privy to all this information has apparently added nothing to thise but smoke which suggests there was no abuse
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If there was any kind of abuse Nunes and Trump would have told you but they decided to exactly behave like the left predicted and lied about it
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Both Nunes and Trump supported FISA renewal which suggest they are fine with the guidelines which apparently were not broken which is kinda shown due to their behaviour.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       They simply again lied straight in your face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ask yourself the following, if ther was abuse why does Trump not straight up tell you and be done with it? Because there was none and they all know it that is why they didn't tell you that the FISA judges knew this was oppo research. My master question I ask so often, why do they lie so fuckin much if they are the "good guys"
      </p>
      <p>
       Be honest here, if there was abuse you don't think Trump or one of his lackeys would have blurted it out already? He lies so fuckin much and you know it.

       Yes it's my reaction because arguing with people who live in an echo chamber is a waste of time.  No matter the truth that comes out countering the baseless claims from unknown sources you people continue to run in place. I saw it with Bush supporters after Obama took office.  You wake up and listen to your talk show, visit your favorite sites subs and then watch the shitty news channels and argue your side is right on Reddit.  Sooner or later people come around but for the slow it never happens.

       I like how you said you don't argue in echo chambers but you do exaxtly that, reply after reply you argue. You just don#t substantiate your claims because you can't. Your beliefs are your brain fighting against the realisation that you were fooled. You have no evidence for anything that you believe. That is pathetic and you know it.
