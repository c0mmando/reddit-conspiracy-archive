        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>According to the Bible, god was able to <strong>verbally</strong> communicate with people through the Ark of the Covenant.  </p>

<p>Exodus 25:22 says:
<em>And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.</em></p>

<p>Notice it says <strong>from between</strong> the two cherubims.</p>

<p>It&#39;s thought that the &quot;cherubim&quot; was metallic (conductive) and looked like this, like others found in Egypt:
<a href="https://bibleapocalypse.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mercyseatandark-1024x675.jpg">https://bibleapocalypse.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/mercyseatandark-1024x675.jpg</a></p>

<p>Notice the gap between the wings of the angels.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s the theory:
If there was a high voltage running between the wings of the cherubim, the gap would create a spark, and apparently this spark would be enough to actually hear a crude AM radio signal.  No receiver is necessay, the sparks between the wings is all you would need to hear a radio signal.</p>

<p>Proof?</p>

<p>take a look at these two videos:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo9nGzIzSPw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uo9nGzIzSPw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ljeCYr6vI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9ljeCYr6vI</a></p>

<p>As you can see from the videos, when the spacing between the conductors is just right, you can actually hear the radio signal coming right out of the sparks !!</p>

<p>Could this phenomenon help explain how &quot;god&quot; was able to speak to people from between the wings ?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve heard the theory that it was an electrical conductor, but not a radio.</p>

<p>It being electrical makes sense because they had to handle and carry it a certain way. Also, there is a Bible verse about someone stumbling and falling/touching it (accidentally). The verse said the power of God killed him instantly. Well, if it was electricity, then this would make sense. He was shocked and killed.</p>

<p>I’m just gonna go out on a limb and say you might be doing some sweating carrying a solid gold or whatever ark, decked out in gold breastplates, in heavy robes, in the Middle East. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. The priests had to wear special stuff to go into the room that housed the Ark. Also, the people tied a rope around the priest&#39;s foot. The reason given was the priest had to be pure of heart (or something like that) to enter the room with the Ark. If he wasn&#39;t, then God would strike him dead. The people would pull him out by the rope.</p>

<p>This makes sense. If the priest didn&#39;t take the special precautions to enter a room with something electrical, then he would be shocked and killed.</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t the power of God, it was electricity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read a theory that it created a huge, deadly static electricity charge that could kill a lot of people around it and that it was designed so those that were using it and had the know how of how it worked, were protected from the charge.

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting stuff, assuming it can be taken at face value.  What I mean by that is there are people who say many of the stories in the Bible might have been new versions of older stories, passed down and modified to fit in line with the new religion.  The stories of the ark and the dangers it carries might be alluding to older advanced civilizations that have since disappeared, or maybe even the last remnants of those.</p>

<p>Also if you look at the idea from a standpoint of a narrative instead of it being historical, there might be more to it.  The idea of knowledge being terrible, dangerous, or somehow bad can be seen in the stories of the Garden Of Eden with the tree that got the first two kicked out.  In a general sense, the ark and those dangers could be in reference to, and reinforcing, that idea that knowledge(this time gifted by God I’d assume) is inherently dangerous except to a very select few people.  There are multiple angles that you can come at this from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Priests have been, at least from what I’ve read over the years, the traditional holders of power &amp; knowledge.  I see religion as the earliest form of both science and government, which as time went on diverged and became their own things.  Religion has always tried to hold fast to humanity, a tool meant for control and domination.  Controlling the flow of knowledge is a powerful weapon in their hands, so it would make sense they’d weave the idea into their teachings that knowledge is somehow inherently dangerous and only “the pure” should be allowed to have access to it.</p>

In Ancient Egyptian mythology the body of Osiris was torn apart and later put back into the box his body was previously taken out of, and hidden in a temple.
