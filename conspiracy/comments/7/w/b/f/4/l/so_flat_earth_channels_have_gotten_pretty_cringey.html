       I'm not a particularly dogmatic person so I sort of enjoy watching flat earth content from a distance or at least from an entertainment perspective but the last couple videos from the more popular channels like jeranism have been pretty pathetic to put it bluntly. Not that they are strangers to intellectual dishonesty or anything but this seems like they aren't even trying anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       The synopsis is just literally them watching the footage and saying stuff like "I don't know how people think this is real", I mean there's not even an attempt to bring forth any kind of theory or reason why it's fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like the difference between someone telling you they think the president is a werewolf because they've seen them howl at the moon and someone just simply telling you that they think he's a werewolf, maybe on a hunch.
      </p>
      <p>
       But still thousands and thousands of views and thumbs up so it's clear that a good chunk of the viewers are mouth breathers, as if there was any doubt

       The glitch to the scene of the car in the rocket... after it had already separated from the rocket... was kind of fucky.

       Are you talking about the one posted here the other day? The top comment seemed to be alluding to the guy recording it from a place where he paused it and looped it on his TiVo or whatever. But yea, if that is what happened, the live footage glitching out to show the car still being in the capsule, kinda suspicious

       I just explained it... During the stream they replayed the highlight footage of the car.

       ... What? The stream was live. Once the stream concluded they showed the car reveal part again.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you actually bother to watch the stream from launch to finish it makes perfect sense and doesn't require further explanation.

       That is what he's talking about. They missed the decoupling of the fairings during the actual live stream and repeated that part after the Stream was ended by the hosts.

       Wait when I watched a repeat of the launch I didn't see the fairings deploy and the reveal. Hmm maybe I missed that part during my watching.

       Nevertheless repeating the reveal after the official stream has ended is still a natural thing to do.

       The only reason this topic keeps being brought up is because none of these people have bothered to watch the stream from launch to end. It's only 12 minutes but they're too lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch the stream, after the hosts sign off they replay the footage of the car reveal. It's not a glitch, it's intentional.

       They replayed the opening of the of the rocket twice at the close of the show, it was a mistake. Shouldn't be a mystery to these flat earthers but it was a 'glitch'.

       watch it, its a bad edit, it starts with the rocket opening then cuts to different views then plays the opening again.  This wasn't presented as 'highlights' and even if it was repeating the same highlight in 30 seconds would be weird, it was a mistake.

       Personally, I'm here to gain more knowledge than i had previously, and on occasion participate in discussion (I'm a tad more talkative tonight than normally lol) but I'm not here to fight bad theory. Byzantine, superstitious concepts are not exactly a negative outside of our "fringe" community. They're silly, and yes often distract from issues of weight. But they don't hurt you, they slow you down. So does your buddy's fish story you've heard a thousand times. My guess is you don't fillet him alive, but rather force a smile, grin and bear it. That's flat earth, I'll ignore, but my time and energy will not be given to fight it, it's better spent elsewhere.

       I politely disagree. The common folk see a stupid flat earth-video and associate it with conspiracy culture. When they then see a conspiracy-oriented source that actually does have a point to make, they'll dismiss it as 'more bullshit from the place flat earthism came from'. It's all part of the psy-op to discredit us in the eyes of the public, and it's definitely a development we should resist with tooth and nail.

       So who defined "conspiracy culture" and why isn't Flat Earth allowed to be a part of it? It's arguing that a conspiracy is being committed. What other qualifications are there for a conspiracy to be considered legitimate?

       The ones who control the media define what 'conspiracy culture' entails to, aka TPTB. Even if the flath earth-movement is legitimate--whiich I don't think it is, but just presuppose with me--it is still dangerous, because it's giving TPTB such a potent control tool.

       That only makes sense if Flat Earth really was a psy op, but I don't think it is. First off, a majority of the Flat Earth posts can be attributed to people just wanting more information on the topic, but everyone here starts calling them names like shill or idiot. It just doesn't make sense to provide so much anti-FE material for the purposes of making conspiracy theorists look dumb. They already do that to themselves with countless theories. Intelligence agencies don't need to waste time submitting posts on our behalf in order to keep the FE debate going.

       What I'm saying is not that all FE-adherants are intelligence operatives or shills, but that the movement was originally started by TPTB and left to its own devices once it became large enough to be self-sustaining.

       You said it was originally started by TPTB so are you implying that they went back and time and convinced all ancient historical cultures that the world was flat? If anything has been originally started by TPTB, it is all these "scientific" theories like 1) the earth is a globe, 2) gravity keeps everything on it, and 3) it all started with a big bang. Study the people who proposed these theories and then the people who had the most influence in their propagation among scientific concepts.

       I love watching videos I disagree with just to see what other people believe. But the problem with these arguments is there is no null hypothesis, I mean after all the work that has been done there is no way to prove the Earth is round further. 
Either way love you guys no hate from me, keep pushing so we can sharpen our arguments.

       Space X has gone in and edited their Falcon heavy test flight live feed because people pointed out that the two rockets landed on the same pad. Now the feed of the two boosters is completely different. YouTube Live feed rules don’t allow this for everyone else.

       It does look like the original feed of the two boosters are the same camera... one is just off by a frame. Now the booster footage is completely different showing them land on two pads instead of one.

       With the heavy moderation and rule changes in this sub in the last 6 months, expect to see more of this shit. Look at any top post of the day. Less than a 1000 upvotes, limited comments, much of it arguments and shill accusations. This sub used to discuss things. Now, we just argue InfoWars topics.
