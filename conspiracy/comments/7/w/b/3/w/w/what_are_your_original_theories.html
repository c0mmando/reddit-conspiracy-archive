Sure, Russia&#39;s role in the geopolitical landscape is a bit nebulous as well, but not <em>nearly</em> to the same extent as the aliens&#39;, and in the Russian case we can easily fill in the gaps because human nature is so predictable.

They think they found a Loophole in avoiding God&#39;s Judgment by messing with the timeline. We are within some kind of weird Time Loop. 
This goes into all the odd things that are happening with people. Time just feels weird right now.</p>

<p>Theory 2: David Bowie&#39;s Corpse is in the Spacex Starman.</p>

<p>Theory 3: Vince McMahon or rather his bloodline will rule all sports during the Tribulation. This one requires so much explaining, but the nuts and bolts is basically deals with Rome and their love of Gladiator sports. Rome never fell by the way.</p>

<p><del>Theory</del> Fact 4: They are trying to hid God from us. This one is kinda pinnacle, because it wraps ALL other conspiracies together. Everything makes sense once you realize that this is one of their major if not THE goal.</p>

<p>Theory 5: Politics is theater. This should be obvious, but I see so many people still stuck at this point. They can&#39;t jump that hurdle. I admit I was stuck on for a few months then my eyes open.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the warnings, which come from government scientists (also responsible for the deadly low-fat fad).  I have not, of course, validated their research, nor do I have a large pool of smokers to even get anectdotal data from.</p>

<p>I knew a guy in the 80&#39;s who would fill his plate with pasta and eschew meat and fat-- to lose weight.  Just as the experts advised.   Since I know the entire society is capable of believing &quot;low fat is good&quot; simply on someone&#39;s authoritative (and wrong) say so, I assume there are other things that fall into this category.  Is smoking one of them?  I don&#39;t know.  But scientists simply announcing that it&#39;s bad for you doesn&#39;t carry the weight it used to carry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vaccine controversy in general is easy to explain I think, neither side can really argue the truth. A flu shot is bad for your child, but good for the community. It brings people into the position of suspending their protective insticts towards their children in favor of the societal interest. Individually you&#39;d profit by evading the procedure but if enough people do that it&#39;s a disaster. With our society moving further and further into the direction of atomism/individualism we can expect the number of people who ignore the societal interest to increase. The collectivist side doesn&#39;t want to tell the truth about that, they fear it. They&#39;d much rather pretend that anti-vaxxers are crazy and that there are no negative consequences whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I theorized over 10 years ago that ww1 and WW2 were an attempt to pre-arrange the world in such a way that leads to unification, and that the conspirators intended to raise three great generations. Once these three generations were the old, adult and young generations of the Earth a day of declaration would come to declare a new form of order. A Big Push would be enacted, to sweep away the multitude, and shortly thereafter, a war greater than those of the 20th century would sweep the entire planet. The winner would have military hegemony of the entire planet (nobody really wanted to share all along).</p>

<p>The last baby born of the Sunshine Generation was the last day of 2015 (debated). At the end of 2015 what happened? The Bataclan caused an event in France that erupted a spew of justifications for governments to encroach on the liberties of their citizens. The next war is between Nations and their own people, with weapons of war that do not need operators. In 2017 the UK commissioned a Battleship that has no humans and 3d prints drones right out the back. Humans have been replaced. It was the plan all along!</p>

I just can&#39;t find anything about the commission of a new huge UK ship (other than the Queen Elizabeth), but they did make an autonomous &quot;blade runner&quot; style speed boat. The US made an autonomous sub hunting vessel.
So I suppose I should admit, that it seems likely, I thought a future concept was a current thing, because I mixed up a few news stories. Thanks for making me look back into that. Either way this stuff is happening. It may not have happened yet, it seems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s mine thats going to grind some gears: </p>

<p>using the Sumerians as a guide and companion to the Bible, Jesus was a virgin birth. Mary was artificially inseminated by the Annunaki scientist God who is credited with being man&#39;s creator by mixing his personal DNA with a primitive hominid from earth. His name is  Enki/Lucifer. Mary gave birth to the son of God and Jesus later was known as the light bearer, the same exact name given to Lucifer. There are no coincidences.  Enki/Lucifer gave Jesus &quot;enhanced&quot; DNA which allowed him to perform miracles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Quantum timelines and conscious timeline traversing, both on an individual and on a mass scale.<br/>
There are infinite timelines existing on top of one another, and through conscious choice we have the ability to transverse timelines. For example, when faced with ultimatum choices between A or B, we pick one path and then when looking back it appears as though that was the path we were on the whole time and that the other path was never a part of reality (that&#39;s relativity, Holmes!). Like quantum phenomena, all possibilities exist simultaneously at respective probabilities until your conscious action solidifies some possibility into reality, thus collapsing the probability wave function. Until you come into contact with the specific information that certifies one reality over another, all exist in in holographic potential.<br/>
TPTB are aware of this mechanic and since the majority of normal people are unaware then tptb are using methods like mass programming via media (film, TV, music, news), and manipulation of physical reality (haarp, CERN) to control the masses and solidify a mass reality in the way they want it in this timeline and all local surrounding timelines, so even if individuals try to &quot;escape&quot; this timeline then they still end up in another local timeline that falls under that same control, only with negligible minor differences.<br/>
However, since all realities exist simultaneously until the information has been acquired by the conscious individual (oneself) then I manifest my reality regardless. So I take it upon myself to seek out and act on the information which solidifies a reality in which everyone is aware of this and that everyone will be able to have control of their own lives, live positively, and the power structure is not an evil one, as opposed to one where most people are unaware, and their lives and actions are being subconsciously programmed by an evil elite. This is already in effect as a mass awakening is happening piece by piece. Everyone is becoming aware that authority is meaningless and we manifest our own reality. I&#39;m transversing timelines into one where the masses are in control of themselves, rather than being controlled by a minority. It&#39;ll be a lifelong endeavour to get to the ideal I currently envision (since I can&#39;t jump from timeline A to timeline Z in one step - I have to go from A to B, then from B I can get to C, and so forth), but this is only one life of infinite, so time isn&#39;t really an issue. Life is just a game.  An MMORPG.<br/>
So with all that in mind, choose to make your reality one in which you can manifest your dreams. Seek out the information that allows for it, act on it, and persist in solidifying it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My current original conspiracy theory is that Trump was recruited by Generals (and other shadowy individuals) to pull off the greatest caper in history. The backdrop of the situation is that the New World Order crowd has been running amuck, destabilizing governments, staging fake revolutions and killing leaders (to steal the billions they have in Swiss bank accounts. See: Saddam Hussein and Khadaffi as two prominent examples of deposed leaders who cash just magically vanished). </p>

<p>This is the real goal of the George Soros/color revolution methodology. These are merely bank heists on a monumental scale.</p>

<p>The only problem is that you leave these regions in smoking ruins afterward.</p>

<p>As the New World Order crowd started to plan a collapse of the United States (and the subsequent stripmining of the nation), certain bands of generals and military leaders (who&#39;ve been privy to the Atlanticist Banking Grid&#39;s activities in other nations) drew a hard line. They resented the coming collapse of their nation, and looked on in disgust as they saw the youth being radicalized. Turned into &quot;social justice warriors,&quot; brainwashed with Leninist phrases and Marxist propaganda. All in anticipation of the coming collapse.</p>

<p>In Antony Sutton&#39;s &quot;Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution&quot; he documents how Western financiers destabilized the Constitutionalist Kerensky government and bankrolled age Bolsheviks. Why? Because Kerensy was democratic, and competent. The Bolsheviks were seen as a better choice because they were incompetent, and intent to murdering every &quot;bourgeois&quot; person who knew how to run a factory or how to maintain a business. (These, after all, were &quot;the privileged people who should all be mass-murdered). In the wake of killing all the competent people, Russia would be a backward mess. And this is what the financiers wanted. They wanted incompetent leadership. They wanted chaos. Frenzy. </p>

<p>In that atmosphere, they could come in and stripmine the place. </p>

<p>They have declassified memes where they straight-up say that the Bolsheviks are perfect because &quot;they&#39;re dedicated to destroying the whole social order&quot;.</p>

<p>By doing that you get the chaos that the monopoly capitalists wanted for their &quot;disaster capitalism&quot; methodology.</p>

<p>Fast-foward to the present: The Generals were seeing the same methodology used in the West. The same radicalization encouraged by the media outlets and academic institutions funded by these people.</p>

<p>They saw what was coming.</p>

<p>So they decided to head it off.</p>

<p>Trump was recruited to help them discredit &quot;globalism&quot; (which was the mask of the New World Order crowd). By recovering some of America&#39;s sovereignty, they would stave off the planned collapse. But more than that: They would do to the George Soros crowd what they&#39;d long done to others. Quietly assassinate these people, and &quot;disappear&quot; their money. Use executive orders to freeze bank accounts, seize money (that would then disappear into the Generals&#39; slush fund). </p>

<p>So they&#39;d be killing two birds with one stone: Saving America, while at the same time pulling off the greatest heist in world history. </p>

<p>When bank robber Willie Sutton was asked why he robbed banks he said, &quot;Because that&#39;s where the money is.&quot;</p>

<p>Trump might be asked: &quot;Why target the Rothschilds, Soroses and company?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Because that&#39;s where the money is.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not hard. She and her buddies set up a reddit sub advertizing it the chans. Everyone piles in, it goes from 0 to 15,000 members in a few weeks.</p>

<p>They make themselves the moderators of said subreddit and install their youtube channels in the sidebar, including livestream links where they can collect donations from the faithful. The money starts to flow.</p>

<p>They abandon all moderator duties and disappear from reddit, while busily tending their profitable youtube presence. Quite a sweet little hustle.</p>

<p>Or just the very existence of a flu shot gives people the flu if they don&#39;t get the flu shot.</p>

<p>Either way it&#39;s eh...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen the warnings, which come from government scientists (also responsible for the deadly low-fat fad).  I have not, of course, validated their research, nor do I have a large pool of smokers to even get anectdotal data from.</p>

<p>I knew a guy in the 80&#39;s who would fill his plate with pasta and eschew meat and fat-- to lose weight.  Just as the experts advised.   Since I know the entire society is capable of believing &quot;low fat is good&quot; simply on someone&#39;s authoritative (and wrong) say so, I assume there are other things that fall into this category.  Is smoking one of them?  I don&#39;t know.  But scientists simply announcing that it&#39;s bad for you doesn&#39;t carry the weight it used to carry.</p>
