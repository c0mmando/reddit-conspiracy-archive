    <div class="md"><p>You know when you planned that really special night years ago with your girl, for Valentines Day? Gots to be just right, do the right things, by the right gift (diamond earrings), everything is perfect (or so you think)? Then you two get shitty drunk, fuck once and call it a night? Wasn&#39;t very romantic and the chocolate just gave her gas, and added some weight to her tummy (which she will blame you for!). That is what alien disclosure is, imo. :)</p>

<p>There are no aliens coming, imo. It&#39;s just what has been programmed in you, like De Beers and buying diamonds, chocolates, and a big ass teddy bear, for that one special night of nothing (unless you conceived a child on that night, then, that&#39;s truly majick).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A Czech man named Vit Jedlicka proclaimed the new republic between Serbia and Croatia on the western bank of the Danube on Monday and has been doing the media rounds all week. With a land area of about 2.7 square miles, Liberland would be the world’s third-smallest country, after the Vatican City and Monaco. According to its website, it has a flag, a motto (“to live and let live”), and an official language (Czech, which seems ill-advised). Jedlicka is taking applications for citizenship, though you’ll have to apply by email because there’s no post office yet. Liberlanders must be people who: </p>

<p>have respect for other people and respect the opinions of others, regardless of their race, ethnicity, orientation, or religion
have respect for private ownership which is untouchable
do not have communist, nazi or other extremist past
were not punished for past criminal offences
Still a member of the Czech Republic’s libertarian, euroskeptic Party of Free Citizens, Jedlicka says he is working on writing a constitution that “significantly limits the power of politicians so they could not interfere too much in the freedoms of the Liberland nation.”</p>

<p>2) &#39;Religitard&#39; was used because the fact that &#39;religion&#39; and religious people thinks that they have a monopoly on &#39;moral&#39; is, frankly, rediculous. Therefore the use of &#39;religitard&#39; is a very clever and suble way of reminding the reader of this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Bible doesn&#39;t teach those morals! It teaches the morals of LOVE.
Specifically, Jesus STOPPED a stoning from happening. God specifically said &quot;No, what you&#39;re doing here is wrong&quot;. </p>

<p>God does not condone rape. He does not condone slavery. Jesus specifically tells us to treat each other with love and respect, and to be like servants to other people. (humble ourselves)</p>

<p>Man, humankind, society, had been enslaving and raping people. Now, what makes more sense? For God to be like 
&quot;Hey, everyone on earth in all society, that&#39;s been doing this practice for thousands of years, it&#39;s bad, everyone stop!&quot;</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>&quot;Hey if you&#39;re going to do this vile practice, here are some rules to make it slightly less brutal&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you are self righteous then he didn&#39;t die for you.</p>

<p>Luk_5:32  I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</p>

<p>Realize what you are:</p>

<p>Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

<p>Repent of your rebellion against God and sinful nature and believe his gospel to be saved which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>That&#39;s it.  Nothing you do can save you.  No going to a building called Church, no being a super good person, no donating money, no nothing saves you but receiving the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ by repenting and believing his gospel.  Know he paid your debit in full with his blood.  He died for you personally.  Once you do this you are eternally secure and cannot lose your salvation.</p>

<p>Eph_4:30  And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Religion is just the practice of the part connecting with the whole. Most religions nowadays lack knowledge and thus they are false religions. Bhagavad Gita actually says give up ALL religion and just love the whole (God). By having this vision of love for the whole, the parts (all of us) are automatically included. Only by love for the whole can one truly act for the benefit of each part.</p>

<p>Instead of watering the leaf, you water the tree. That&#39;s what REAL religion aims to inspire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Control, our founding father&#39;s told us our government would become tyrannical, it&#39;s human nature the more you have the more you want. Money is a perfect example of it, power is 2 - 5x more intoxicating to the normal person than money is. Our constitution gives us the authority to take up arms against our government if it becomes tyrannical. ANd people must always remember this, this is a GOD GIVEN RIGHT by our founding father&#39;s. All we need is a reason to take up arms and we&#39;re legally aloud to do so by the powers invested in WE THE PEOPLE via the supreme law of this land. That&#39;s why the fed&#39;s worked so hard to give our militas a bad wrap. Because our militas protect us as in law with the constitution. They can play pretend &quot;this law and that law is the new law&#39;s and you must follow them&quot; but that&#39;s all bullshit, the constitution is the only law we have to follow if Shit hits the fan</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know when you planned that really special night years ago with your girl, for Valentines Day? Gots to be just right, do the right things, by the right gift (diamond earrings), everything is perfect (or so you think)? Then you two get shitty drunk, fuck once and call it a night? Wasn&#39;t very romantic and the chocolate just gave her gas, and added some weight to her tummy (which she will blame you for!). That is what alien disclosure is, imo. :)</p>

<p>There are no aliens coming, imo. It&#39;s just what has been programmed in you, like De Beers and buying diamonds, chocolates, and a big ass teddy bear, for that one special night of nothing (unless you conceived a child on that night, then, that&#39;s truly majick).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) &#39;Moral&#39; is built in to every species, it has nothing to do with religion. Religion usurps &#39;moral&#39; and perverts it, hence atheists possess true un-perverted &#39;moral&#39;.</p>

<p>2) &#39;Religitard&#39; was used because the fact that &#39;religion&#39; and religious people thinks that they have a monopoly on &#39;moral&#39; is, frankly, rediculous. Therefore the use of &#39;religitard&#39; is a very clever and suble way of reminding the reader of this. </p>

<p>Good enough for ya?</p>
