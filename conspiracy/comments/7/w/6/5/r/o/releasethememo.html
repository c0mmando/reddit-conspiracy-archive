       So we now have 3 days since the House voted to release the "counter memo" and we're still waiting for it to happen. Where are all of the bots that were pushing for "transparency" over the past few weeks? Too embarrassed from last week's dud?

       Nunes has 5 more memos he's prepping. Looks like the memo wars are on.

       Well it seems that Schiff purposely exposed methods and sources in order for the memo to require some redaction.  Likely the talking points for the den memo will be they redacted it because they don’t want you to know the truth.

       Gotta be honest, while I totally agree with you, I'd just as soon not repeat the flooding of the hot queue with #releasethememo spam. The Democrat counter-memo will never get the same level of traction here, so all I'm hoping is that it repudiates the Nunes memo so thoroughly that it never shows it's face outside of TD again.

       you dig into the Grassley-Graham referral? Adds a lot to the Nunes memo...there was some fuckery going on and the American people deserve to know the truth...why is that such a bad thing? If Trump truly colluded with the Russians that needs to come out too...all fuckery needs to be brought to light regardless of partisan lines.

       Yeah I mean the author of the most important “Russian Collusion” document is currently suspected of making false statements to the US and UK governments as well as the FBI, and he didn’t show up for his court appearance in London.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also planted info with a reporter whose story was then used to bolster confidence in....Steele’s own reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that these are just allegations that need to be corroborated, but they aren’t vague anonymously sourced claims. They’re concrete. If there’s corroborating evidence then those with the resources know directly where to go.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corroboration will either happen or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Trump Russia” collusion is just allegations that require Mueller to corroborate. To date, there’s no corroboration, just more allegations that make people think “he must have colluded”.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you’re going to push the collusion angle you don’t get to just dismiss the memo and Grassley’s referral out of hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean honestly, Trump could be guilty and our IC can also have been guilty of impropriety.

       The dem memo is a "No u". People are less bothered about their incessant bullshitting. Also given that nobody disputed it's release it's almost as if dems are the ones with something to hide.

       Well currently if released today its WH turnaround would still be quicker than the Nunes memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Left leaning and/or “pro collusion” individuals such as yourself have already conclusively decided and pushed that the Nunes memo is a “dud”. If the memo is a “dud”, pushing a DemMemo hashtag just wouldn’t make any sense. Why get worked up over a response to something that is a “dud”?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the Dem memo was unanimously approved and was done so without redactions. No one voted against it and is going on 20 minute tv interviews demanding it be withheld.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is in stark contrast to the Nunes memo, which was approved only on party lines and Schiff/Pelosi went in front of every camera that would have them and threw every excuse at the wall as to why it shouldn’t be released.
      </p>
      <p>
       A push to release something that is actively trying to be withheld is far different than a situation where something has been unanimously approved for release.
      </p>
      <p>
       I imagine if Trump tries to block it you very well will see DemMemo hashtag that is aggressively pushed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Nunes’ memo is a “dud” at face value then why do you even care about Schiff’s memo other than to make a post that seems to accuse everyone of being partisan when the title of your post is seemingly politically charged?

       You tell me I’m smoking something and this is your well thought out, reasoned, response.
      </p>
      <p>
       Criminal activity. Ok, that’s an allegation that requires corroboration. Mueller will either corroborate it or he won’t. The fact that you’ve made up your mind despite not seeing the results of a complicated multi year investigation speaks volumes regarding your objectivity. If he finds no evidence of collusion, would you accept his conclusions?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole bot issue is too nuanced an issue to get in an argument here. R/politics is over 7x the size of this sub. Go there and post something remotely contrary to the collusion narrative, even something from a credible MSM outlet, and see if the response to that feels organic.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an aside, if over 90% of Trump coverage from MSM outlets was negative (Harvard study), then logically any Trump “bot” would need to link to articles from non-MSM sites. The overwhelming majority of non-MSM sites have (since the election) been classified as “sympathetic to Russian” interests for daring to post positive coverage of Trump during the election. Any account whose volume indicated it was a bot was flagged as “Russian” for linking to those sites. Does that present an analysis problem to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       RT America, who had 7 pages of the ~20 Page Intelligence Community Assessment devoted to it, posted both positive and negative coverage of Trump. RT America has a show hosted by Ed Schultz, he is not “pro Trump”. Yet, RT America had to register as a foreign agent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not even saying there were no “Russian Bots”, this is just a small sample of information to maybe consider before shouting down any social media user that isn’t ready to lock up Trump before the outcome of an investigation as a “Russian bot”.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were pro Hillary bots as well. If those bots retweeted BBC articles are they “British Bots” colluding to rig an election for a pro British outcome?
      </p>
      <p>
       Misusing classified information? Like serving as an anonymous source for an article that states Carter Page is under government investigation for (allegedly) secretly meeting with Russian government officials during the campaign? Like Feinstein releasing the entire Simpson testimony without authorization? Like the countless other articles published, sourced from anonymous government officials, that offer cherry picked information that further the collusion angle?
      </p>
      <p>
       You do not get to gobble up every anonymously sourced article that deals with classified information that condemns Trump for the last 1-2 years and then outright dismiss DECLASSIFIED information that starts presenting another side of the story. Nunes’ memo will be corroborated or it won’t be, whichever one ultimately happens will tell us everything we need to know about the veracity of the claims in the memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the memo releases, the committee released Nunes’ memo to House for viewing first, then Schiff wrote his response memo, then there was a simultaneous vote wherein Nunes’ memo was released and Schiff’s was required to be made available to the House in the same manner as Nunes’. Then Schiff/Pelosi cries bloody murder over the content of Nunes’ memo. Then the Schiff memo was authorized unanimously for release (with no redactions) exactly as the committee said it would be. Should they have just released Schiff’s memo despite it not undergoing the process required for public release? You’re arguing that Schiff’s memo should’ve received preferential treatment and since it didn’t everything is a sham. The Republicans moved first, tough luck for Schiff. If it was up to Schiff we’d never receive any information related to the underlying report. They are BOTH partisan hacks. Doesn’t mean neither of them have meaningful information to offer. At least now we get to see something as they duke it out with these damn memos.

       Yeah, I do. I’ve been pretty firm throughout that I’ll take all the information I can get. I wanted to see it before and I want to see it more now. People absolutely should bitch and make noise till it’s released...now that it’s actively trying to be blocked. I’m in favor of the House overriding Trump, which they can.

       I never had a problem with Schiff’s memo, I had a problem with your tone.

       It's cool if you don't like my tone. Glad to hear you're not a blind partisan. Too much of that around here.

       It actually won't because that would be total bullshit. We only see that level of BS from Nunes and Trumpists.

       Papadopolous is not 30.  There is no way.  There's a Papadop in the high school listed for him in 1989; not 2005.  Why is everything a lie?
