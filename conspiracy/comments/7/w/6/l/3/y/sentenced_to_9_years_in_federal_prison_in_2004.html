       From 1997 to 2002 in the Manchester, New Hampshire-area (almost 5 years), I did everything I could think of in a highly-visible manner to disseminate the theories of nationally-known income tax protester Irwin Schiff. That included being interviewed many times in many different types of media and guest hosting a popular Southern New Hampshire talk radio show numerous times. During all that time, the Feds never gave me any trouble or tried to silence me. Then 9/11 occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       Immediately after 9/11 occurred, I began widely disseminating repeatedly to hundreds of elected officials, news media, pundits, law enforcement officials, reporters, etc. my belief that Zionists in the U.S. Government and Israeli Government (Mossad) had orchestrated it and blamed it on their enemies in the Middle East, Arabs and Muslims. I alleged that they did so in conjunction with their allies in the major news and opinion media. I alleged that the purpose was to dupe the United States into greatly expanding its military presence there and to wage war on some of Israel’s enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       In December of 2001 (3 months after 9/11 occurred), I was also widely disseminating the recently-deleted, 4-part Fox News exposé into Israeli spying on the United States and Israeli use of that espionage to derail law enforcement actions against Israeli Organized Crime. Fox News Channel deleted all four (4) news segments and their transcripts from its website almost immediately after the fourth segment aired.  At that time, I was also widely disseminating other information detrimental to Zionists and/or Israelis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ten (10) days later, approximately twenty (20) armed Government law enforcement agents raided my home/office in Auburn, New Hampshire and informed me that I was the target of a federal criminal investigation into violations of the internal revenue laws! I was subsequently indicted on specious income tax violations, prosecuted, convicted, and sentenced to nine (9) years in federal prison! I was released from prison in 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have published a website detailing that whole fiasco, including the transcripts of the deleted 4-part Fox News exposé. It is located at RailroadedorNot.com. For anyone interested, I have also written a book entitled “Railroaded or Not”, which is available on Amazon. My Twitter handle is @RailroadedorNot.

       He probably didn't say he broke the law because he refuses to accept that he broke the law. I'd bet folding money that "everything I could think of in a highly-visible manner to disseminate the theories of nationally-known income tax protester Irwin Schiff" included things like refusing to file a return and refusing to pay tax owed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The guy naturally calls these "specious violations" because he doesn't think they're illegal, even after having been caught, convicted and sentenced for them.

       I wont link the document, and I have redacted the name to prevent any accusations of doxxing, but OP provided a link to his website where his name is stated. From that you can find the above press release issued at the time of his conviction.

       This guy didn't just refuse to file his own tax returns, he advised and assisted others to evade taxes by filing false returns. He also committed perjury and harassed government officials.

       at the time that he was doing the right thing, therefore he shouldn't be in any trouble. He went on at some length if I remember right.

       Irwin Schiff always contended that for all of the different types of federal taxes, there is a statute imposing the tax and another statute making someone “liable” to pay the tax. Except for the income tax, that is. There is a statute imposing the income tax, but not one specifically using the word “liable” with respect to it. He contended that that meant that the income tax is not mandatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there is a statute that uses verbiage equivalent to using the word “liable.” Schiff mistakenly believed that use of the word “liable” was mandatory. He failed to realize that that is not true and that judges have more discretion than that.

       not paying taxes to a corrupt government is only logical. I am ever so careful to avoid aiding and abetting the Israeli, Saudi, and US empire. Anybody that believes we are still in a constitutional republic with democratically elected legislators is deluded.

       I fear the US justice system as much as you do. I obey the laws to the extent necesary. As i said I am very careful how i live and take care of my money. I would join with others to withold taxes until our constitutional republic is restored but on my own i would not fair well in the prison system. In the mean time I barter and use crypto not to avoid legal taxes, I pay them, I just make sure I contribute as little as possible to a system that is actively bombing poor people because rich people want them to.

       Those reasons are more about profits for a small minority than about the interests of the common citizen of the U S. I think the majority has been swindled by a few elites. Without the media control and a sleeping populace there would be much greater outcry.

       I never said that I broke any laws. I didn’t break any laws. One of the methods that prosecutors and judges have devised to ensure convictions is to convince juries that accused persons “willfully blinded themselves to the law”, which is what happened in my case.

       When I wrote my book, I believed that I was targeted for widely disseminating my belief that Zionists had orchestrated 9/11. Now I wonder if I was targeted for widely disseminating the spiked Fox News exposé. In my book, I probably should have emphasized the totality of what I had been widely disseminating rather than just the 9/11 aspect of it.

       From another thread  by OP, where he posted essenstially this same thing 9 months ago:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I went to trial without legal representation because I believed that a lawyer would not defend me properly i.e., raise the issues I wanted raised, file pre-trial motions regarding those issues, document mistakes made by the Government and the judge to be raised on appeal, etc. In other words, I believed that a lawyer would assist the Government and the judge in "railroading" me into a conviction.
       </p>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         I have no solid evidence that I was targeted to prevent me from continuing to widely disseminate my beliefs. How do I obtain such evidence and what is my recourse after obtaining it?

      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         17 counts of preparing and filing tax returns which I knew and believed to be false for myself and others. But I didn't believe that they were false.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        They were a tax return devised by Irwin Schiff to inform the IRS that it was the filer's belief that there was no law making the income tax mandatory and, therefore, no tax liability. I had been doing everything that I could think (in a highly visible manner) to promote Schiff's conclusions about his income tax research for 5 years with no problem from the IRS or the Justice Department. Until I started widely disseminating by belief about 9/11, that is.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had one count of interfering with the Gov't's collection, of which I was also not guilty but convicted anyway.

       .

       Also, this is what he did to get himself in trouble:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <blockquote>
        <p>
         17 counts of preparing and filing tax returns which I knew and believed to be false for myself and others. But I didn't believe that they were false.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        They were a tax return devised by Irwin Schiff to inform the IRS that it was the filer's belief that there was no law making the income tax mandatory and, therefore, no tax liability. I had been doing everything that I could think (in a highly visible manner) to promote Schiff's conclusions about his income tax research for 5 years with no problem from the IRS or the Justice Department. Until I started widely disseminating by belief about 9/11, that is.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had one count of interfering with the Gov't's collection, of which I was also not guilty but convicted anyway.

       I gather that the judge (and jury, if there was one) would counter that your charges were based on your ACTIONS, not your intent. You either did or did not do what you were charged with. If I “believe” that all the money in a bank should belong to me, I stil get convicted if I try to rob it.
