        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post caught my eye today:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7wgjw5/the_mystery_of_the_balochistan_sphinx/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7wgjw5/the_mystery_of_the_balochistan_sphinx/</a></p>

<p>The site looks like it could be man-made so I looked.  If it&#39;s a major site, it&#39;ll be on the Matrix Munck lays out here (the first two hours are enough)(but damn):  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nUmEbjSoHs&amp;amp;index=11&amp;amp;list=PL9YsD_AHsWbO-DTA6fOtLxQ7fBag9eJfs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nUmEbjSoHs&amp;amp;index=11&amp;amp;list=PL9YsD_AHsWbO-DTA6fOtLxQ7fBag9eJfs</a></p>

<p>Using rough numbers and eye-balling a few maps and measurements, here:  </p>

<p><a href="https://grahamhancock.com/dmisrab11/">https://grahamhancock.com/dmisrab11/</a></p>

<p>and here:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.world-mysteries.com/science/2012-and-old-equator/">http://blog.world-mysteries.com/science/2012-and-old-equator/</a></p>

<p>We get a starting point.  The Giza Sphinx is oriented 4.25 degrees south of 90 degrees.  Giza Sphinx to Mohenjo-Daro is ~2261 miles and almost exactly due east, with Mohenjo 7 miles off the line (up or down?).  Eye-balling Mohenjo to the Balochistan Sphinx, and using triangle math, Balochistan should be ~2170 miles from Giza, and about ~100 miles south of Mohenjo at an angle of ~85.75.</p>

<p>And it is!  And w/in range of the Old Equator.  But maybe the Giza Sphinx is looking right at a natural rock formation.  The line is as long at Earth is round!  </p>

<p>Balochistan is located at 34 degrees, 30m, and 59.8 seconds longitude, using the Great Pyramid as the Great Meridian, and the modern coordinates of 65 degrees, 39m, .6 sec, Hingol Nat Park.  This would not be the exact Balochistan location, but close.  </p>

<p>Since the code is degrees, 60s and 360s, I started with the code&#39;s basic 21,600 (60 x 360) and:  21600/34/30 = 59.8.  Or 34 degrees, 30m, and 59.8 sec.  I&#39;m not swift enough at computers to locate this thing exactly (if you can hit me up) or tell which way it faces.  Also if we knew the sites measurements we could likely get more relationships, as the code also relies on physical clues.</p>

<p>For reference the coordinates for Karachi (35d, 62m, 19.4s) and Hyberabad (37d, 13m, 58s) do not work out the same related to the Giza Meridian.</p>

<p>So maybe the Balochistan Sphinx is a rock formation that is on the line created by the Giza Sphinx&#39;s orientation, and just happens to encode that point on that line with the code&#39;s basic math?  </p>

<p>My guess is man-made.  </p>

<p>Here is <a href="https://imgur.com/uuoFf2d">the line from Giza to Mohenjo-Daro</a>. Here is <a href="https://imgur.com/yMOYGEZ">a close-up of that line passing through Pakistan</a>.</p>

<p>Note that the line doesn&#39;t pass any closer to the Balochistan Sphinx in Hingol National Park than it does to any point in western Pakistan. Also, the bearing from Giza to Mohenjo-Daro is 85° 22′ 44″, which is about 9° of the orientation of the Great Sphinx of Giza that you give.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which part are you saying is not accurate?  Seems like you&#39;re saying the line from Giza to Mohenjo is not the same as the line from Giza to Hingol.</p>

<p>The line you&#39;re using to show the inaccuracies is the Old Equator, roughly Giza to Mohenjo.  AKA the &#39;B&#39; side of the triangle.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the &#39;A&#39; side I&#39;m talking about.</p>

<p>The line in the Imgurs is the &#39;B&#39; side of the triangle, Giza Sphinx to Mohenjo.  The &#39;A&#39; side runs from Giza Sphinx through Hingol.  And the &#39;C&#39; side Mohenjo to Hingol.</p>

<p>This is certainly not my area of expertise and welcome any math or mapping help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait ... you&#39;re just claiming that the three points make a triangle?</p>

<p>Any three points form a triangle unless they&#39;re all on the same line. On a sphere, it&#39;s a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SphericalTriangle.html">spherical triangle</a>.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t get what point you were trying to make.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m showing the Balochistan Sphinx is on the &#39;B&#39; line, aka the Giza Sphinx&#39;s gaze/direction it looks/faces.  </p>

<p>The triangle itself was just the method.</p>

<p>I was using a triangle to try and math my way to the answer (I have a globe at home I used a string on to eyeball the potential).  I used the Mohenjo point since it was referenced on the maps of the Old Equator, and the distances and relationships between Mohanjo and Giza (and other major sites like Nazca) are established.  </p>

<p>My rough math used a right angle triangle.  Giza to Mohenjo, then a right angle for the &#39;B&#39; angle.  The unknown point was calculated using a 4.25 degree on the &#39;C&#39; angle, which is the angle the Giza Sphinx is off the old Equator. </p>

<p>That gives us a right triangle.  The Balochistan Sphinx is on the &#39;B&#39; line of that right triangle.  This shows the Giza Sphinx is looking at the Balochistan Sphinx.  </p>

<p>The triangle isn&#39;t the point though.  I was using the math of the triangle to show the line the Giza Sphinx is looking at/on/gazing towards.  And this line happens to go over the Balochistan Sphinx.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t random.  The Giza Sphinx is pointing at the Balochistan Sphinx. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, then, what I think you&#39;re saying is that the Balochistan Sphinx is on the great circle line that extends due east from the Sphinx, which is the direction that the Sphinx is oriented.</p>

<p>Is that right?</p>

<p>If so, yes, you are correct. The <a href="https://imgur.com/SZkrBtt">last image in the imgur album</a> shows that the bearing from Giza to the Balochistan Sphinx is 90° 09′ 14″, very close to the due east line.</p>

<p>The stuff about Mohenjo-daro is irrelevant and just confused me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really understand why this is relevant though. Surely the Sphinx is looking East because that&#39;s where the Sun rises.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough about Mahenjo.  I was attempting to &quot;show my work.&quot;  I def see how it was confusing.</p>

<p>The Giza Sphinx looks east to show us which house the sun is rising in.  In theory, Giza Sphinx is a clock and it&#39;s midnight/noon is Regulus in Leo every 26k years.  </p>

<p>The relevance:  Balochistan is categorized as a natural rock formation.  I believe the math shows/proves/strongly suggests that Balochistan is man-made.  Not only that, but Balochistan is also part of the matrix of momuments across the globe that all tie into each other using Munck&#39;s code.</p>

<p>I&#39;m happy to consider each point (Sphinx looking at it.  On the code matrix) separately.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This Balochistan sphinx looks like a natural formation.  The symmetric lines are just lines of sandstones and limestone which erode a different rates.  Same deal with the &quot;steps&quot;.  Differential erosion.  You can see similar patterns all over the world where sedimentary rocks were deposited and have not be tilted or highly fractured.</p>
