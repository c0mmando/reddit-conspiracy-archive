        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Since the Tesla Falcon Heavy launch on Tuesday the deluge of anti-science, anti-space, anti-advancement on display not only on r/conspiracy but all over reddit is troubling. So troubling that I believe there is an active conspiracy afoot to discredit science, namely space science, in order to dumb down and destroy any chance for humanity to reach out into space and advance the human species.</p>

<p>Instead, these neanderthals are claiming all the space footage throughout the years from the ISS, Mir, Shuttles, to Apollo, Mercury and Russian missions <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-huF7fRlnA">are all fake</a> and they&#39;re just using &#39;wires&#39; or never went at all.</p>

<p>Hoaxes perpetrated for decades to hide... What?</p>

<p>That space doesn&#39;t exist? That for centuries the secret the elites have hidden is that the Earth is flat and we are all riding on the back of a colossus turtle?</p>

<p>Where did this anti-science, anti-humanity anger come from?</p>

<p>Is it because Musk resigned from POTUS&#39; science council?</p>

<p>The science of reaching space is all verifiable. It can&#39;t be hidden. It&#39;s math. No secrets there. It&#39;s expensive but not impossible or faked.</p>

<p>Just this week, someone posted how YES, in fact the US DID reach the moon in 1969, but NOT the way we&#39;ve been led to believe. No, even the moon landing hoax conspiracy theorists are wrong because we did land on the moon but with, it is claimed, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpZyHvr6Y2M">now-destroyed ancient alien technology</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, really.</p>

<p>When even space itself is called into question, you know a large group of backward-thinking people have an agenda, hence a conspiracy.</p>

<p>That is, without using appeals to authority or appeals to consensus, could the average person today explain how they know they are hurtling through space?</p>

<p>The obvious and honest answer is <em>no</em>, they could not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in high school algebra we did the math that shows the shape of the world. Over 500 years ago men started measuring the world 66&#39; at a time. </p>

<p>Using the mean tide as 0&#39; and off they went. In every direction for hundreds of years. This data is available still. </p>

<p>If one tries to triangulate this data over larger distances errors appear. This error disappears once spherical algebra is incorporated.</p>

<p>And the size of this sphere? Only a few percentage off of what Eratosthenes calculated 2200 years ago. </p>

<p>So actually yes a high schooler can and has done the math. </p>

<p>That said there is a wide difference in peoples high school education. </p>

<p>Some come out with a science background and others woodworking. </p>

<p>And some both. </p>

<p>Step2thejep has a website calling himself the world&#39;s leading skeptic and charges $20+/month membership. </p>

<p>In his videos he wears a black t-shirt and a rasta hat (he is an annoying australian dude) and speaks in a nasally condescending monotone. He makes fun of “normies”  and ”conspiritards”  on his site... his names for anyone that disagrees with him. I would link to some choice videos to illustrate my point but don’t want to give him views.</p>

<p>He is likely john le bon and he is here to promote his website and largely shills his website exclusively. He was getting no traction posting his links here, he got banned from cryptocurrency reddits for spamming and he got told to stop spamming this reddit by the mods so he gets into arguments and after showing his genius he will insert a link to his videos shilling his content. </p>

<p>The problem is he is an ass in addition to being a moron so he gets into fights more often than successfully promoting his content. </p>

<p>He as far as I can tell, needs to be able to see something with his own eyes to believe it true, and needs to understand the science. Since he can barely understand newtonian physics, and gets it wrong... and in general seems to be an under educated rube... he considers much to be fake. </p>

<p>As far as I can tell he believes that:</p>

<ul>
<li>all history is fake</li>
<li>atoms don&#39;t exist</li>
<li>nuclear weapons don&#39;t exist</li>
<li>Missiles cannot fly in level fluight</li>
<li>No one died on 9/11</li>
<li>Space is fake</li>
<li>The earth is not round and does not orbit the sun</li>
<li>Dinosaurs are fake</li>

<p>Okay, where in the livestream (You can watch from liftoff to a few hours after the faring separation) did the video become CGI? You keep saying its fake but offering no evidence other than &quot;Its possible to fake it&quot; </p>

<p>That logic goes with damn near everything, which again, is called solipsism. Look it up, please. </p>

<p>We can verify space exists, you havent challenged that fact yet, you just keep saying this launch is fake. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s my point. Itrs the limit of empiricism.</p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing WRONG with faith in what you are told. But its not science or evidence. </p>

<p>Therefore we should understand what can be validated by empiricism or if we need to just take the word out of faith in authority. The latter approach is typically okay as long as you trust the source. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t trust Space X. I don&#39;t know their agenda. Therefore I only accept the empirical side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well empirically we know they launched a rocket into orbit, right? </p>

<p>We all saw them launch the rocket, people were there and many many private citizens took photos and video, right? We know this to be a fact, correct or not?</p>

<p>Now the issue here is what was in the cargo hold? Is this the issue? </p>

<p>Heres a redditor that claims to have tracked whatever SpaceX released. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/7w9uy2/i_spotted_the_tesla_in_deep_space_this_morning/">https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/7w9uy2/i_spotted_the_tesla_in_deep_space_this_morning/</a></p>

<p>Whats your opinion on that? He provided all the telemetry data so you can verify if it fits observation. </p>

<p>So do you believe a rocket was launched? </p>

<p>Do you believe it made it to orbit? </p>

<p>Do you believe it made it beyond Earth orbit?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A perfectly good reason elon states as “just for fun” meanwhile he’s advertising his company. It’s a big commercial my friend. You’d understand why people say it’s fake because they have a firm belief that we don’t have technology to breach the walls above us, and that anything that’s convinced you otherwise through the years is fake proof through fake imagery and fake videos and deception. Have no idea why we believe it’s fake? Maybe put astronomical ego away for one fucking moment and saturate yourself with the ample amounts of proof out there that has proven over and over again the fuckery in astronomy and the space industry. You guys are so scared to believe astronomy could be a big deception and business to reap tax money. Seriously if you won’t see our side of things don’t go around being ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh man some of the shit you say is so ignorant. No we’re not on a turtle you moron, why not state the actually facts the anti astronomy people are trying to fight? Look man there’s an issue with all this. Science is being hated on because astronomy tainted it. Science is legit until astronomy became part of science. That’s why it comes off to science believers that FE’s don’t believe in science. Everything in science is believable until it comes to the sci-fi astronomy part. So I’ll clear it up on behalf of us who don’t believe in space. Yea it is strings, if you see what we’ve seen you’d understand. You just haven’t digged deep enough to convince yourself ISS footage is green screen / cables. Everything you see from elon is a commercial to advertise his shit or else what was the purpose of sending a car into space? He even said there’s no purpose it was just for fun. Wake up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s simple man. Thinking science is without faith is the issue. There is no way to be objective in this subjective world. And most of the time the objective studies are not objectively verified. </p>

<p>Science is just as religious as in practical use as any other philosophy or religion. It must be verified through experience.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We may never know of the video is real. How are you supposed to verify that? Even if you saw the object in space, the video could be faked. Only way to verify if the video is real is to go up to the rocket yourself. </p>

<p>Only way to verify if God exists is to go &quot;up there&quot; and see yourself. See? We live in a religious society and this video of space was the &quot;God&quot; of technology. And when people reject it, they immediately criticize. See? Religious fundamentalism. I thought science welcomed doubts. </p>

<p>The real conspiracy of this space video is the religious acceptance of it.</p>
