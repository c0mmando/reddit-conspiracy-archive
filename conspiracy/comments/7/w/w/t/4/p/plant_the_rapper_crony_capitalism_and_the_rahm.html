        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This post will be controversial due to the high profile of the figures involved. Before going any further, I want readers to understand this has nothing to do with music. If you are able to separate your personal feelings of enjoyment for the music of Chance the Rapper from the very real workings behind the scenes, you&#39;ll find some very interesting and disturbing connections.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar, Chance the Rapper has been promoted by media as an example of the success available to &quot;independent&quot; artists and musicians through free music releases and major deals with large corporations like Apple and Nestle. He rose to prominence with the &quot;mixtape&quot; Acid Rap in 2013, which featured production from many big name producers and major promotion on almost every mainstream media outlet. Chance also won a Grammy at last year&#39;s ceremony when the committee changed the criteria of eligibility to award him Best Rap Album for his third free &quot;mixtape&quot; Coloring Book, which was released in an exclusive deal with Apple Music and heavily promoted during the NBA Finals.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re wondering how an &quot;independent&quot; artist could possibly be pulling off these moves and &quot;sticking it to the machine,&quot; your skepticism is well founded. Chance is from Chicago and, as it stands, is very cozy with the leadership in the city, namely Rahm Emanuel. Much has been said about Chance&#39;s relationship to Rahm, due to the fact that his father, Ken Bennett, who was Rahm&#39;s Deputy Chief of Staff and also worked with President Barack Obama&#39;s administration.</p>

<p>Rahm&#39;s brother, Ari Emanuel, is currently CEO of William Morris Endeavor and a co-founder in major Wall St. investment firm, The Raine Group. Ari has been described many times as &quot;the most powerful agent in Hollywood&quot; and if you&#39;ve ever seen HBO&#39;s Entourage, he happens to be the real-life inspiration for the Jeremy Piven character, Ari Gold. Ari represents a vast pool of A-list Hollywood talent through William Morris and was also Donald Trump&#39;s television and film agent for years. Pictures of Ari and Trump meeting at the White House recently are easily found in a quick search.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, awhile back, free online streaming site SoundCloud was rumored to be going bankrupt and in an odd turn of events, Chance took to Twitter to announce that he &quot;made a call&quot; and &quot;saved SoundCloud.&quot; Media ran with the story, championing Chance for &quot;standing up for indies everywhere&quot; in what seemed to be a major power move. Coincidentally, Ari&#39;s Raine Group invested over $150 million in SoundCloud during the same period. Any denial of Chance&#39;s connection to Ari is purely spin and/or conjecture.</p>

<p>Another interesting fact is that Ari sits on the board of directors for major concert promoter, Live Nation. Major festivals, including South By Southwest and Lollapalooza (which is held in Chicago&#39;s Grant Park annually), are productions by a Texas-based company C3 Presents. Not only does C3 have a non-compete, exclusive contract to host Lollapalooza in Grant Park, they also happen to be major donors to the Rahm Emanuel administration. Not only that, Live Nation acquired controlling stake in C3 Presents in 2014. A Texas-based company, with an exclusive contract with the city of Chicago, donating to an Illinois Mayoral campaign; a Texas-based company that happens to be owned by a major corporation where said mayor&#39;s brother is a voting member of the board. Take a wild guess which &quot;independent&quot; hip-hop artist headlined both of these major music festivals last year, among others. If you&#39;re familiar with Chance, he regularly wears a fitted hat with a &quot;3&quot; on the front, which was rumored to be in promotion for his &quot;Coloring Book&quot; album; originally referred to as &quot;Chance 3.&quot; However, more than a year after the album&#39;s release, he continues to showcase the hat proudly.</p>

<p>The shady dealings don&#39;t stop there. Actor Dermot Mulroney, owner of Chicago club Double Door, is also a client of Ari Emanuel. Dermot Mulroney&#39;s Double Door co-owner, is the owner of another major Chicago club, Metro. These clubs mainly specialize in rock concerts but, coincidentally, did heavily publicized shows featuring Chance the Rapper early in his career. Double Door also hosted an underground, homosexual bar, Door No. 3 in their basement where parties are thrown with Satanic themes, crossdressing and rumored orgies.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Chance&#39;s manager, Pat &quot;the Manager&quot; Cororan is another piece of the puzzle that doesn&#39;t seem to fit the narrative around Chance&#39;s come-up. Pat has said he comes from a &quot;blue collar&quot; background and merely saw Chance&#39;s potential, was approached by Ken Bennett to represent Chance and, from there, built Chance&#39;s brand independently. Further investigation reveals that Pat&#39;s father is Gerald Corcoran, CEO of $4bil hedge-fund R.J. O&#39;Brien of Chicago.</p>

<p>Things get a bit darker when you dive into the history of the Emanuel family as well. Rahm &amp; Ari&#39;s father, Benjamin Emanuel, was a CIA operative member of Israeli militant group, Irgun, an organization which can also be linked to amFAR founder, Mathilde Krim, who had an unusually strong presence in Hollywood and popular music circles prior to her recent death. Not only do Rahm and Ari have family ties to the CIA, both have been accused and in some cases, sued for alleged discrimination; making them an interesting force behind supposed &quot;pro-black activist&quot; Chance the Rapper.</p>

<p>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The rabbit hole goes so much deeper when you start digging into this issue but I believe it is important to spread this information as far and wide as possible. Hollywood and pop culture are being engineered by intelligence forces, most of us know that to be true. The thing that is so damaging about a false idol such as Chance is that he promotes a wildly unrealistic view of independent art and culture. We are in a time of celebrity worship, where many young kids look at fame and the music industry, especially, as a &quot;way out.&quot; It is disingenuous and wrong to &quot;sell&quot; this ideology that a kid can come from nothing and spend their own money and years of their lives in an effort to compete with the promotion and exposure offered by multi-national, multi-billion dollar tech corporations and record labels.</p>

<p>Entertainers are, more often than not, manufactured entities. The difference in the case of Chance is, why lie about being independent? What purpose does this lie serve other than to manipulate the system and the audience? What does the future of media and culture look like if we don&#39;t tell the truth about the sources it comes from? Can we take back control of our art and music through small business-minded ownership and local support for the arts or are we doomed to be force-fed Cinderella stories from shadowy figures pretending to represent the talent and creativity of the working and lower classes?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post OP- well researched and thought out.</p>

<p>Music is so heavily controlled because of its power- the power to change minds, and in doing so to alter the base nature of reality. I consider Music to be a form of magick- an imposition of ones Will into Reality. The industry is insular and controlled and fake in order to lull the masses to sleep in a continually repeating cycle.</p>

<p>I think there are still true Independent musicians out there...Macklemore is one, imo. He was the first musician in 40 years to get a top single w/o a label in 2013 with his song Thrift Shop, but he hasn&#39;t stopped there. He created his own studio and producing company with Ryan Lewis and has continued publishing music- though I can almost guarantee you haven&#39;t heard his stuff on the radio...because he doesn&#39;t have the contracts.</p>

<p>Some songs of his I think show this:</p>

<p>In his song Jimmy Iovine Mackelmore talks about his meeting with the mogul, his rejection of the deal and setting out on his own- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJXuDGL5ooE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJXuDGL5ooE</a></p>

<p>In Wings, Macklemore talks about the corruption of the entire economic and social system- a mentality of consume, consume, consume- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAg3uMlNyHA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAg3uMlNyHA</a></p>

<p>Finally, in his song Drug Dealer, released in October of &#39;16, Macklemore sings about the Opiod epidemic, going so far as to actually name companies like Purdue and Actavis as well as congressional complicity in the crises- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYN14UfO-Uc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYN14UfO-Uc</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks man! I totally agree. Not only is it a form of &quot;magic&quot; in the spiritual sense, if you research the properties of acoustic physics, acoustic waves have physical powers as well. Resonant frequencies are a really interesting topic when you understand that objects can be affected by the reverberation of sound waves, hence why it is possible to shatter a champagne glass with the right sustained note. I can&#39;t help but think the low vibration patterns found in so much of modern hip-hop&#39;s 808 drums is responsible for lower cognitive function and depressed/lowered states of consciousness, in addition to the lyrical content being centered so much around pharmaceutical drug use. Not a bad way to &quot;hypnotize&quot; the masses at the peak of an opioid epidemic.</p>

<p>Thanks for the Macklemore links, I&#39;ve never been a fan of his particularly but I didn&#39;t realize he touched on topics like this in his non-single material. Still not sure if I buy the independence of any figures acknowledged by mainstream media, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks were onto this as well- Plato had much to say about Music, and how different sounds and frequencies can evoke different feelings. The Greeks even identified several different types of frequency and the moods they induced.</p>

<p>I hadn&#39;t considered the frequency in the rap itself as much, in combination with the lyrics...but you are absolutely right. Excellent insight.</p>

<p>Understandable :) I recommend ya give the links a listen, but if you aren&#39;t convinced that&#39;s totally cool. I believe his &quot;acceptance&quot; was given begrudgingly...an accident of the system in a moment of distraction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. I love to read about how ancient music was inspired by the movement of the planets in the solar system as observed by early astronomers. There is a reason this artform has been around since the dawn of man and used to express ideas and emotions that our languages are unable to communicate.</p>

<p>Ya know, years ago when I first got his album The Heist (the one w/ thrift Shop and 2 of the 3 songs I listed) I didn&#39;t either...it grew on me in time tho, but to each their own! Music is an incredibly personal thing, as I can tell from our exchange you already know :)</p>

<p>For sake of discussion- I feel that Macklemore and what he does stands out more when compared to artists like Katy Perry...if you listen to her song (which I will link) called Chained to the Rhythm...on the surface it seems &quot;woke&quot; but the more you listen, the more you realize it&#39;s a fake &quot;woke&quot; that pretends to be deep and sophisticated but in reality doesn&#39;t express anything...a perfectly producer crafted snake in the grass...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I&#39;ve actually heard that one before and thought the same thing, major eye rolls!

    <div class="md"><p>Just take a look at how Macklemore completely follows the mainstream neoliberal narrative.</p>

<p>Thrift shop was a hit on YouTube and then warner music picked them up.</p>

<p>Thrift shop was then immediately put all over the radio.

<p>They are independent in the way companies call their foods “natural” to make them seem healthy.</p>

<p>The only thing independent is you don’t have to sign a “label contract” but it’s essentially the same thing as a label contract.</p>

<p>It’s really kind of just straight up lie that they use to promote artists they think will benefit from seeming independent.</p>

<p>Macklemore also is a complete hypocrite.</p>

<p>He got big making fun of designer clothes and now wears ridiculously expensive fur coats and hats.</p>

<p>He basically is saying he’s a superior white liberal by making fun of black people for buying Jordans.</p>

<p>It’s basic bullshit designed to make white liberals feels superior and self righteous and he won the Grammy despite having a horrible album compared to Kendrick.</p>

<p>Just proves how much they prefer the white righteous liberal with plenty of “white guilt” to actual hip hop music from real hip hop artists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So there was a great story I read a while back, and for the life of me I couldn&#39;t find it, but it talked about the two moments music changed in the USA: the release of Frampton comes alive, and the release of itunes. These two huge shifts caused two things. 1: with Frampton, records could make so much money, that investing firms wanted to get in on individual stars, not just record companies, and 2: iTunes made it so a record didn&#39;t need to be good, only a single song. So these shifts made huge waves. We&#39;ve now reached I think a new point: investment firms don&#39;t want to invest in a record label at all. They will begin to find individual artists and support them entirely by themselves. I think you get a little lost on the weeds, but hit the major points. I would not be surprised if you start seeing entire bands or artists owned wholly by a corporation completely separate from music. There&#39;s still a shit load of money to be made, so greedy companies will find ways to make it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. Many artists, including Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins (ironically, also from Chicago) have been talking about this for years and saw the writing on the wall. Artists will soon be nothing more than shills, bought and &quot;sponsored&quot; by corporations. Chance is a perfect example, a supposed &quot;independent&quot; that seems to be striking deals everywhere else, Cheerios, Apple, Nestle, but giving the music away for free; a luxury true indies really don&#39;t have. </p>

<p>There is still cost associated with generating content and the issue is that without capital to generate content and no way for independents to monetize said content in the form of marketing, we will eventually end up with art that is nothing more than propaganda, in the sense that once a corporate brand &quot;owns&quot; the artist, that artists freedom of speech is completely void. Any content created or opinion spoken by an artist that does not conform with the perception desired by the company will be silenced and buried; which is actually easier than ever in an era where millions of songs are at consumer&#39;s fingertips. </p>

<p>I&#39;m confused as to where you believe I&#39;m &quot;lost in the weeds&quot; as every referenced connection here is thoroughly researched and easily confirmed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess my only point for lost in the weeds might be the connections to government, or the underground Satanist clubs. To me, it seems simpler than that, and way more based on moneyed interests using the label of Independence to make more money. That&#39;s all, just little side tangents that don&#39;t feel as important to me. </p>

<p>And I truly believe that there will always be good actual indie artists, because no matter what there will always be good small clubs people can play across the country. So many good musicians still support themselves entirely thru touring and performing. They don&#39;t get rich and famous, but they do fine and can do fine for a long time</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can understand your points, however, are you saying that you don&#39;t believe intelligence agencies have operatives in the entertainment field or simply that you don&#39;t believe it&#39;s the case here? </p>

<p>I also found the links to the Door No. 3 club kind of creepy, considering some of the political links involved. You can look up photos of some of the parties there and they look pretty sick and eerily reminiscent of some of the PG images that came out involving Comet Ping Pong. Again, fair to say these are outlying and unrelated issues but the trail of bread crumbs gets really weird the further you go.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, idk about the CIA, again it seems far fetched, I always assumed it simpler, more about money. And I&#39;ve been a drummer for 15 years, and we used to play at some weird goth clubs with super weird shit on the walls, and weird outfits. Literally, at one show in bowling Green Ohio, a dude came dressed as a giant baby to a goth night. College kids especially just do weird shit many times for the sake of doing weird shit. So satanic themed parties at a live music club could be way more innocuous than you think</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post, very thought out and it&#39;s likely you&#39;ve actually been to Chicago instead of posting from afar.</p>

<p>However your connections and insinuations are too far off here. I&#39;m hitting the sack for an early flight tomorrow but this caught my eye. I&#39;ll reply in the morning, but here are a few before I type it out.</p>

<p>-The C3 hat thery is dumb. Why would an Indy rapper wear the hat of a holding company that purposefully has no interest in branding?</p>

<p>-Double door and metro may be &quot;primarily rock clubs&quot; but that&#39;s just simply because there are thousands of rock bands touring and it&#39;s an iconic feature. I believe Chiraq was filmed partially at Double Door, and its had petty  money and legal issues that surely MegaCorp Inc could easily have settled. Metro has DJs and regularly has electronic music. It was big into dub step when chance performed there. The satanic cult part is Lol.</p>

<p>-Lolla has been with C3 since the 90s. In fact early criticism was that it billed itself as an alternative freak show but was just repackaged pop. Further, the price Perry pays Chicago is market, it&#39;s not controversial city admins approved Lolla, it&#39;s a huge driver of visitors during the few pleasant months outside in Chicago.</p>

<p>There&#39;s way more I&#39;m just tired. Btw was this stolen from HHH or anything similar? I&#39;d like to see responses to it from intelligent minds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So Chance got successful through industry and family connections - your point is that calling him &#39;independent&#39; is false. Agree with that premise but the entire music industry is about who you know and who will help you succeed. </p>

<p>The thing about Chance is he doesn&#39;t promote drug use, he donates money to local schools, he seems like a good dad and speaks respectfully about his ex - these all seem like positive attributes that he&#39;s putting out into the world. So he&#39;s not &quot;independent&quot; and has corporate sponsors but his image is a positive one. What&#39;s the problem?</p>

<p>The theory about 808s affecting intelligence is pretty weak. There are lots of intelligent artists who work with drum machines. The gay club thing is hardly satanic and adds little to whatever point you&#39;re making. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re concerned about negative influence why not look at the artists who promote guns, drugs and drug dealing, misogyny and bad lifestyle choices? There&#39;s an endless supply of examples to look into. Chance is almost an outlier in that world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesnt promote drug use but came up on a mixtape called Acid Rap, got it. Donates money to local schools...lol if you think that&#39;s his money. Good dad...was recently taken to court for failure to pay child support. Now, that last one isn&#39;t necessarily an indicator of what a &quot;good dad&quot; is. However, I say all this to say that a PR giant is carefully crafting an image for people like you to absolve anything done on behalf of someone you really don&#39;t know anything about personally. This is how &quot;false idols&quot; are built; in a way that convinces the masses to see them as infallible and take up their battles while they continue to exploit behind the scenes. </p>

<p>Also, you&#39;re posting on r/conspiracy. This post is quite literally about a tightly woven network of people in politics, business and entertainment <em>conspiring</em> to push a brand, the entire foundation of which is based on a lie in the form of: &quot;independent artist blows up off free music on the internet.&quot;</p>

<p>If it&#39;s not a big deal, why will nobody in major media touch it? Nothing I have presented here is theory, it can be verified with research and public record. You could just say you like the guy&#39;s music but don&#39;t pretend that the false perception being sold here isn&#39;t socially irresponsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Asking questions is fine, I&#39;m just answering them. I mention that this is a conspiracy sub merely to emphasize the fact that &quot;the point&quot; is literally to draw awareness to a conspiracy. Whether you believe it is &quot;nefarious&quot; is a matter of opinion. It&#39;s all capitalism, right? What Chance has done is no different than selling lottery tickets or working a casino. He has used a platform built by hidden ties to major corporations to tell poor people that they can do it too with just a little luck and hard work. We can argue about the ethics of snake oil sales tactics if you&#39;d like but surely that&#39;s a waste of both our time.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t comment on the quality of his music because it is irrelevant to the issue and is more likely to invite emotional backlash. I criticize the brand, the purpose behind the deliberate misinformation by his PR and the shady characters of highly questionable moral and ethical fiber that are banking on him.</p>

<p>Almost every artist in hip hop says the same thing though - &#39;you can do it, if I did it you can too.&#39; It&#39;s part of hip hop creation mythology. Is it bad when Kanye or Eminem says it? Are they all lying? I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s certainly not a message unique to Chance. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re drawing false parallels to the point that it&#39;s clear you aren&#39;t interested in facts. Everyone will believe what they want, I merely presented the facts. Eminem and Kanye will fully admit that &quot;the biz&quot; gave them their platform. They are not misrepresenting themselves as self-made, independent, homegrown artists. Also, both Em &amp; Kanye actually came up through the underground and people that followed the culture knew who both were long before any casual music fan. Although, I do know a few things about Kanye&#39;s connections through my sources and if you look into his mother&#39;s career moves, you will find CIA links as well.</p>
