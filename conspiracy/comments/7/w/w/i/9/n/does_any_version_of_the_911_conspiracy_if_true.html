    <div class="md"><p>Some were definitely asleep, others spoke out and were silenced- see the paltry few who spoke out against Afghanistan and especially Iraq. Some were directly implicated. I don&#39;t think it means we should scrap the governing system...just that those in power are corrupt and thus it doesn&#39;t function as it should. </p>

<p>The way to keep this in check is to have an educated citizenry, engaged civically, which is an essential part of a healthy, strong Republic. Our Elites, however, have been working for decades to undermine this key aspect of a Republic, so that they might dominate the masses now lulled to sleep with ignorance masked in a false sense of superiority. </p>

<p>None. At best we have seen some &#39;mourning families&#39; on the telescreen.</p>

<p>But the buildings were fell of people when they came down!</p>

<p>How do we know this? We do not. We were told this by the same people who told us it was done by Osama.</p>

<p>But we do know that lots of people worked there!</p>

<p>Again, we do not know this. We simply take the stories on faith.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What significance do you attach to your view that the death toll was lower in the towers than most people believe, in terms of the functional outcome of 9/11 in its effects on US foreign and domestic policy? Many people in this sub will be of the view that the official 9/11conspiracy theory is a lie, and it is the outcome of that lie that continues to shape the present (by which I mean wars of aggression in the Middle East)&#39;</p>

So yes,  the entire political class is implicated by going along with a lie and not questioning it.   There is no excuse for accepting the official version other than complicity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe all levels of government (any government in the world) know what each hand is doing. Thats probably the bigger issue. Add that people enter and leave roles regularly, the issue you are trying to resolve becomes even more fragmented. Throw that in with the fact that if you planned this attack, you sure as shit wouldn&#39;t keep paperwork for it, so its all hear-say and hard to bring anyone into a court... this situation will never, ever, be resolved.</p>

<p>You could run and become president, and personally oversee the investigation, and nothing would be found. As sad as it is, 9/11 will always be an official terrorist attack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The entire situation is fucked, not just 9/11. But this is the current “diplomacy” set up. All over the world things are like this, it’s why everyone feel helpless.</p>

<p>What pisses me off the most, is that we are helpless, in reality. As we are talking about it, what would/are <em>you</em> personally doing about 9/11? How far are <em>you</em> going to get in your investigation. If you rope in “higher ups” what are they going to do? The official story is the official story, we can poke holes in all of it, try and take it through the courts, bring up experts, etc etc, but what is the end result?? We all know already.</p>

<p>As I get older, the more I see this world is nothing but a game, and those who write the rules are winning. The problem is, the world has gone so far into this ‘game’ the only actions you can take are inside the ‘rules’... exactly what they intended.</p>

<p>Well for one, posting about it - reddit conspiracy has been very sparse on the core conspiracies lately - &quot;hey look over there!&quot; There are very few conspiracies that warrant the statement I made - the entire political class - those are real people - are involved in covering it up, by letting it slide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never forget the situation in Palestine is the number one reason for 9/11. That&#39;s why they chose New York and targeted Jewish buildings. The fact that the 9/11 Memorial was designed by a Jew and that the 9/11 Museum is curated by Jews is an enormous, enormous conflict of interest and let&#39;s them turn this into a &quot;we&#39;re all in this together.&quot; type of narrative instead of a &quot;Jews occupy a slave race, they deserve to be punished&quot; narrative.</p>
