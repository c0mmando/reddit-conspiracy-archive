       Like seriously, what in the ACTUAL fuck. This is the most insane about-face I've ever seen in my life. I'm all for a unified Korea and toppling the disgustingly oppressive regime that is Kim Jon Un's barbaric insanity to free the people within it's borders. And I think it's good that they appear to be a little less xenophobic lately.

       But what the fuck. They enter the Olympics, and suddenly we like them? After a year of saying how volatile they are?

       Simple, the majority of the MSM media hates Trump, and who has Trump gone after most since taking office? NK. The prettier they paint NK the more people they will convince to take NKs side and that is more fuel for them to add to the anti Trump narrative.

       What a weird lens to see things through.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the Olympics, so the media toned down the nuke and war talk for a couple weeks. Has nothing to do with spiting Trump or getting Americans to side with North Korea. With or without Trump, Americans know NK is an unstable state-size cult with nukes. How far up your own ass do you have to be to think this way?

       Disagreeing isn’t gaslighting you fucking idiot. Why is everything a scheme? Everyone who disagrees with you is gaslighting or a paid shill or a “pedophile apologist” or Satanist or siding with

       If you havent noticed over the last year, the liberal media will hate anything Trump does and support anything that goes against him. Will shining NK in a positive light do anything? None of us can really say, but they sure will try.

       But a lot of people already hate Trump and they've been hostile to NK until they were friendly at the Olympics.
      </p>
      <p>
       How would praising NK make any more people dislike Trump? Why have they only dialled back the hostility now?

       Liberal media shitting on Trump isn't some conspiracy, it's just them playing to their base. The same way Fox would shit on Obama (and still does occasionally), that's what their viewers want to hear.

       Everybody on the Norwegian cross country ski team has been diagnosed with severe asthma. The side effects of the emergency medications they are allowed to take are increased muscle development.

       There’s a difference between the NK government and the NK people.  The olympics is more about the citizens than the government.  Also, there’s always been talks about peace and reunification between NK and SK if you’ve been paying attention.

       I totally get that, but like, I'm old-ish. This is the first time NK has been mentioned in the MSM coverage. It just stinks to me. The MSM coverage that is. None of those fuckheads have an honest cell in their body. Everything is an agenda.

       Perhaps it has to do with increasing tensions in the ME...especially with the Israeli plane being shot down by Syria. It seems to me that whenever one theater goes quiet, the other is ramped up. The MSM seems to alternate from one day, one week, one month to the next on its coverage and screaming over Nkorea or the ME or Africa or any other region of conflict.

       So does the media do this to control the narrative, or do they just want to give their customers what they want? My gut says the latter, which in a way is worse.

       I was cracking up laughing last night when I walked in and my wife was excited to see the North Korean Cheerleaders.  I said, "Who???" And sat down to watch, Jesus Christ they were drooling over them.  There was some dude in the middle of them while they were cheering and clapping, during the hockey game, I think, who was trying to clap on beat, and totally failed.  Anyways, joked that poor bastard was going to die, especially saw it when he noticed the camera.

       I see you like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's selection of women.  These just cheerleaders - cigarette smoking alley women! - only a disgraceful ugly women would enter South Korea, USA!  No!  Every women in North Korea possess true beauty; prettier than them and purer; in grace from our Dear Leader; whose divine spirit is present in every child birth.

       I read it a long time ago so I can't be very specific. But there is a part in the book where the war with eastasia is done but further the goverment controls say that they were never even at war with eastasia. And everybody just eats it up. That's the qoute, "we were always at peace with eastasia." Meaning a type of groupthink or mass hypnosis where everyone just accepts the goverments line and ignores their own memories.

Boko haram, al quesadilla, taliban. New year it'll be a new group because how do you kill an ideaology that demonizes education and promotes dying.

       And that's exactly what happens.....through the MSM. The MSM as a supposedly independent entity with integrity (I have to laugh everytime I hear that) they provide a platform from which the government lies to us. We get into illegal wars. MSM apologizes for not being more diligent. Rinse and repeat. And even their own polls show that over 70% of their viewers don't trust them.

       But, try telling someone some news that hasn't been validated by the very MSM they don't trust and you're a god damned lunatic for spreading "fake news".

       I don't even tune in to news on the TV anymore unless it's a active situation that's being covered live. I do read it. I also read a lot of other news sources on the matters that are important to me. But, I'll be damned if I believe much of it.

       1984 is written in 1948.
      </p>
      <p>
       We worked with Communists against Fascists. Then we took the Fascists in for their science and technology, and all of the sudden the Communists were the enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's such a thin metaphor it amazes me it has to be explained. Then again, everyone says "It's just like 1984!" instead of realizing that he was talking about the state of the world ~70 years ago. It's that much worse than 1984.
      </p>
      <p>
       1948/1984 is about showing how you can make 2+2=5, reversing facts of history, logical, and truth.

       There are the obvious attempts at influence. But there are also more subtle attempts - things like color -  of the backdrop or clothing, the people they choose - the pitch of their voice and the speed with which they talk. The ratios - number of pro-talking heads vs anti-talking heads. I'm sure there are many more that I am not aware of...

       I want to relate something-I just happened to watch part of a movie this morning - Josie and the Pussycats. The ideas revealed there totally blew my mind. Let me explain. There is one woman villain in the movie that owns a huge media conglomerate. Her idea is to get teenagers hooked on rock music and play subliminal messages along with the music. Wow... But wait, it gets better. Before that, as I was flipping through the channels, there was a show, about women in the police, and how they do their policing. So, this black police woman stops a vehicle under the pretext that she witnessed the driver throw garbage out the window, and the guy (also black), says no, he was just adjusting the side mirror. So the female cop checks and you wouldn't guess, the dude has a warrant for not showing in court- for playing music too loud. And his girlfriend, who was riding shotgun, also had a warrant for some chickenshit charge, so she hauls them both to jail. Afterwards, she admits that the black man in fact was really adjusting his mirror and didn't throw out any trash out the car window. And she chuckles. And I am like, OMFG, they are not even trying to cover their propaganda with subliminal messages anymore, they want us to watch it and be very afraid. It was quite an epiphany. I am just curious, does anyone find a show like Cops entertaining? WTF watches that for fun?

       Whatever cop show you watched was likely staged. Cops isn't, but I've seen others that obviously are. A show about only female cops screams reality tv.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admitting he didn't throw any trash on camera not only meant the charges would be dropped, but she could be sued. Yes, this shit happens all the time, but they don't chuckle about it openly on tv after.

       I wish I had recorded the show, this happened in Cincinnati OH. But that's immaterial. What is important is that it is propaganda. Personally, I don't know anyone that would enjoy such a show, it's not entertaining in the least. Judge Judy is one thing, where at least she talks some sense, but to present such a police reality show is deceptive without mentioning that these are actors.

       The camera has actually become a social status signalling device; we are proud of paying an arm and a leg for the camera. Nobody is surprised if you buy a new cell every 12 months. I remember when pulling out a Blackberry used to be a mating call for young men; nobody owned one, unless your employer provided it, so it showed you had a good job.

       I get 1984 made some good predictions but it is fiction. Just because Big Brother in the book did something has nothing yo do with our reality. It is just something George Orwell thought of

       Yeah, you see the funny thing about this is - Every totalitarian state that has led to the deaths of countless innocent lies has been just "something someone thought of." Crock of shit, that logic is.

       I'm sure this is a fun circle jerk for you guys but is it really that strange that NK's positive moves are received positively? No one is pretending it's not a brutal dictatorship. They're just expressing hope that small positive steps like this could be a prelude to some kind of real change in the country or at least in their relations with the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story isn't that NK is good now. It's that for once they made a small step away from the brink of war. I guess if you see the world in black and white, you can't receive a story like that without feeling like your narrative is being challenged.

       You ever seen that episode of The walking dead where Carol tells the little girl to just look at the flowers before she shoots her? Can't help but think of that after reading your comment. It's easy to think that everything is gonna be just hunky dory when you smile and pay attention to the pretty little flowers.

       While I agree with that, it's quite dangerous thing to beat the drum of "regime change" when all too often that's interpreted as the USA topping the leadership of another country.  Which has happened A LOT!  Not just Iraq but many countries have been "toppled"

       Yeah the US doesn't exactly have a very good track record going for it. Also why the fuck isn't everyone insanely pissed off about Bush lying to the entire world about Iraq? Like, am I the only one who remembers this? Mother fucker sold a war, a million people died, and it was on completely false pretenses. How is he not in prison? Like what in the actual fuck. Instead he's being paraded around on the god damned Ellen show like he's some wacky old uncle. What the fuck.

       You're not the only one....I remember all that and how one of the most trusted people in the government Colin Powell was essentially used to "sell the war" to the American People, Congress and the UN.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I bring up the WMDs that never materialized and how Iraq was never tied to 9/11 and that we never should have invaded, people just say "yeah but Saddam was a bad dude and had to go" like it's nothing and move on.  I mean 15 fucking years of non-stop war and how many times have we had to "retake Faluga" 2, 3 or are we up to 4 now?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think people are just numb to it now and the press is more than willing to ignore the atrocities or at the least, downplay them.

       Such a simple way to filter through the shit. I do the exact same thing and just figure it's safe to assume it's all lies. Then I don't have to expend any energy figured out what's legit and what isn't. If it comes from one of the big six corps that own all the media it's just safe to assume it's not only false, but done maliciously to serve their ends.

       The stories of starving Koreans are from before Kim Jong - un succeeded to power and put the corrupt military brass in it's place. During the big parade on Thursday, the army vehicles were flying big banners of the KWP showing who the new boss is. The coup you want already took place, behind the scenes, but it resulted in a stronger North Korea. The TV doesn't say much about your own military corruption like [the Fat Leonard Scandal](

       I don't think this "about-face" is anywhere near as dramatic as you're describing. Moves toward peace with South Korea, as well as PR moves at the Olympics, have been well-received by the media. That's about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this is a good thing, but it's hardly a dramatic shift in narrative, nor does it negate the past 25 years of (justifiably) negative stories about NK.

       There was also a small shift when Un first took power as he did some slightly progressive things like allowing women to wear pants etc.

       I think a re unified Korea is a much more achievable thing than say, peace in the middle east, so people tend to get their hopes up a bit.

       I see the reunited Korea as inevitable, eventually North Korea sucumbs to years and years of famine, and their population nosedives. Their country is unsustainable, and I personally am of the opinion that North Korea's nuclear program is being delayed by their scientists who A) dont want to fail B) dont necessairly want to succeed because their leader will use it and C) like having food and relative comfort for themselves and thrir family

       Reunification is also inevitable because the general public on both sides want it. The importance of family and a group mentality in the Korean (and other Asian countries) culture is something hard for Westerns to comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t completely understand it myself. But every South Korean I’ve talked to - young or old - stands by the idea that their family is on the other side of the DMZ.

       Many families were quite literally divided by the dmz. There was a story a couple years ago when they had that brief period where the rules were relaxed for a few days, and some brothers got to see each other for the first time in decades

       I watched a video on youtube where a dude walked around SK cities asking youth if they wanted reunification, most of them did not know what it was referencing. Grated this video is probably edited heavily it did also show a few that knew what he was talking about. After seeing many of video of people in the US asked simple questions on the streets and seeing how stupid our general population is I would not be surprised if SK has also been working at dumbing down their general population also.

       That's just it. Rather than continue with the saber rattling they've toned it down and are playing nice with South Korea (for now at least). Honest or not, it at least signals some intent to cool things down which is why the criticism has died down some.

       Honestly I would prefer the US continues to look like an asshole. We should remain an asshole toward North Korea until this whole thing (including the concentration camps, assassinations, launching missiles over Japan, murdering families of those who escape, murdering tourists, etc) is sorted out.

       "Toned it down" by enslaving their own people and forcing some to dress up in matching, cute outfits and paraded around at a hockey game? Threatening their families and their next three generations with rape, starvation and slave labour is "toning it down".

As a member of the politbupolitburoro she helps rule that country. She is complicit in the terror state, gulags,  torture, starvation and murder of her own citizens. Its disgraceful

       exactly this.  Media isn't being super warm to NK, just writing happy stories about two countries not trying to kill each other for the first time in almost 70 years.  Hell, do we not desperately want the NK/SK conflict to finally resolve?  Is anyone happy that a nuclear armed country is run by a maniac with no checks and balances?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think OP is suggesting this is anti-Trump; I dont think it is. 
 Trump was anti-NK a year ago and the media was demonizing them then.  This is just... for once we're talking peace.  The story is better, and they're reporting the story (holy shit who knew?)

       He has a point though, it was all North Korea is bad and lately there hasn't been much bitch slapping. Just before the Olympics I saw some rhetoric hit the news about stuff Kim was saying, but then just flowers from our media now.

       You seem too ready to down play the MSM, who never do anything without some agenda, as just something that happened and that's about it. Usually they are either feeding talking points, covering over something else, releasing false information (to later in edited with true information without republishing or announcing an error).

       If you had watched the closing ceremonies at the Sochi Olympics, they did not play the South Korean national anthem to honour the next host country. They played the Arirang, the traditional anthem of all Korea. The unified Korea team was always on the agenda.

       I am conflicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand.... WW2 Germany and Jews and all that.... it is happening right now in N.Korea.  These people they are idolizing are running the program.  N.Korea regularly chooses famine over military spending.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have a 3 generation policy.  If you do something wrong 3 generations of your family are punished along side you.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand though.... N.Korea does not appear to be going away soon enough.  The entire world has been waiting for there government to be overthrown for decades now.  The N.K government is doing an excellent job of staying in power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Short of military action - which carries with it a very heavy civilian price tag - I just don't see them going away.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the points of the Olympics has always been that you find a way for governments who are not getting along to have friendly sporting contests.  Get them into a room together and force them to say nice things about each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have always thought this is a good idea.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the media using this as an opportunity to draw circles and arrows around Kim and label him a butcher would be counterproductive.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do find it creepy to idolize his family.  I think my preference would be to ignore him.
      </p>
      <p>
       'Oh look, there is Kim - now back to Mens Downhill!'.

       I see fatty kim reunifying Korea, I see the saber rattling and nuke tests as him establishing a position of strength to negotiate from. Both sides want reunification, but none of their neighbors do, it would be like the reunification of Germany - one side has the industrial capacity and the other has manpower. It would really change the economic competition dynamic for all of East Asia..

       I agree with this. When NK tries to be good, why not cover it? I mean we already know the shitty stuff about NK, its all anybody thinks of when they talk about NK. what IS news, however, is when they actually behave like part of the Earth community

       I have to agree with this.  Going further, the media is probably giving north korea soft, if not favorable coverage to ease tensions, particularly because the south koreans are terrified that the north is going to do something batshit insane during the olympics.  Everyone in the world wants to get through the next 18 days without a war.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this isn't to say the media is not in bed with the government.  they are, and this could be some kind of state department initiative to spin NK positively, to keep everything copacetic.

       Yeah, it's the Olympics. The media, especially recently (like last 30 years) has treated this as an event to put aside politics and come together as the world. Of course, to many in this sub, this change of tone during the Olympics is about something else, simply ignoring that this "coincidentally" happened during the Olympics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, after reading the articles that a lot of this is referencing, all of what I have read (and I could have missed something) has talked about how this is
       <em>
        actually
       </em>
       just PR by North Korea (like how sending the sister was a counter to Ivanka).
      </p>
      <p>
       However, what I have seen is a lot of the alt media misrepresenting what the main stream media is saying in order to make it look like they are praising NK, to step up their attacks against them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish some of the members of this sub would give the same critical eye they put towards the MSM to the alt media as well.

       When my partner was in school he was a trouble maker. He decided to be good for a few weeks and the principal gave him a brand new skate board in front of the entire school for good behaviour. I was at the same school and justifiably pissed off as we're other students. I was good all the time but didn't get a skate board. He went back to being a shit head not long after that.

Yea, they are terrible, but we prop up terrible governments all the time. They (us, China, south korea, Japan, ect) dont want to deal with Nk uneducated and possibly brainwashed/violent and def malnourished and likely in need of special schooling and medical treatment.

       I've had long conversations with a former principle about this topic. There were two main things I learned from my conversations with them. One was that the "bad kids" "needed" the attention more than the "good kids." In fact, they related a story to me where one of their "good students," speaking on behalf of the other "good kids," complained to them that the "bad kids" were getting more attention, to which this person replied along the lines of, "yes, but after you've been labeled the bad kid, and have begun to internalize that label, you do need that sort of attention, whereas the good kids [like you, Suzy] have the privilege of not having to live with that label."
      </p>
      <p>
       The other lesson I learned is that principals have basically [innocently] weaponized young women against men. This person told me that before they integrated women into the school, the boys were kind of a nightmare, but with young women around, everything changes, especially their behavior. Now, they're constantly conscious of the young women around. In other words, young women really don't need young men around to be well behaved (at that middle to high school age), but they are a godsend for boys' schools, and could be considered sensibly necessary in helping to maintain order.

       Giving "bad kids" attention when they're good, and even rewarding that good behavior, is the right response. Punishment for bad behavior alone isn't going to change a person.

       All I know about the Olympics is that Canada wins at Hockey and that brown people can run way faster than white people. Also, why is curling an Olympic event? That's like the golf of the Olympics.

       EH. Is Russia being kicked out, but their athletes still competing, not a totally political move?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just have a hard time believing that Russia is a) the only ones doping and b) the only ones dumb enough to get caught.

       Well, the Russian Government set up a system that allowed their Country's athletes to dope, and therefore giving them a huge advantage. Others may have tried to dope but got caught due to the Olympic Committee's strict anti-doping testing and policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So really, Russia deserved to be banned because if they never got caught, they would have never said anything about it. It was a political move, but deservedly so. They still allow the athletes to compete, break records, win gold, etc... But Russia the country doesn't deserve to take part in the games because of their deception.

       I see where this seems odd but I think there are a few things one must consider:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         The demonizing has always been towards the leader and upper government, we have
         <em>
          never
         </em>
         had any reason to be against the
         <em>
          people
         </em>
         of North Korea; they are the victims.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         It could be that it is well known Kim Jung Un is basically a petulant child and despite the ultra-high stakes game he is playing, he is more swayed by his image than anything else.  Maybe it is positive reinforcement.  He has been mocked and demonized in Western media all the time, and he has total control over the information inNorth Korea where he tries to make people thing the rest of the world is evil and wants to kill them.  Being nice now serves two purposes:  to show him when he comes to the table he gets
         <em>
          good
         </em>
         coverage and, two, to take the chance while his people are outside of his containment zone that the West
         <em>
          does not hate them or want to kill them
         </em>
         . (This is probably the most important part!)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The media loves to get points for praising anything that isn’t Western culture, it is a form of racism:  if they praise something overtly, it is a backhanded and condescending insult if you read between the lines... they
         <em>
          need
         </em>
         praise.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       It’s simply that Trump told Pence to maintain a hard face and basically don’t give those bastards an inch because they neither deserve it or earned it. No the MSM have yet another reason to hate the president. “US reaction was cold in the face of unity and peace in Korea”. Gonna be the headline you see or might already be out there idk.

       Korean unification has been a goal for a long time and has little to nothing to do with Donald Trump. I believe we will see unification in our lifetime.

       Y’all are so insecure that people can’t take a minute to praise NK and SK being unified at the Olympics for the first time like ever without thinking it’s a direct insult to Trump. Get over yourselves and his dumb ass. The Korean Peninsula trying to not constantly be on the brink of nuclear war is clearly a jab at President Trump.

       Considering that people who hate on CNN think that Obama was “basically a terrorist muslim” I think we’re going to have to state it better than that.

       they’re never saying “we like nk now”. i think (i’d like to think) this narrative is more about the people of both countries are coming together, not the politics. the people are the ones who are most negatively impacted, especially in nk and not only does that go along with the overall olympics narrative but the US eats that up ...and   of course it also pads the ratings.

       Shit, I welcome any cooling of tensions in this insane fucking world (although I'm not so naive as to think that's what this really is). I think a lot of what we think we know (i.e. what we're
       <em>
        told
       </em>
       ) about DPRK is probably hysterically sensationalized bullshit. I'm sure they have their share of problems there, but I've learned over the years not to trust boogeyman stories about other countries (especially when coming to me from sources like CNN, FOX, MSNBC, etc). There always seems to be an ulterior motive there and a complete lack of scruples regarding accurate fact-reporting.

       This is pretty easy.  The only real obstacle to a unified Korea is the leadership in North Korea.  The NK regime knows that every passing day means that there model of govt. is not sustainable.  Information gets in...people get out.  You cannot maintain this forever.  They also  know that what is best is to reunify and jump on the money train that is S Korea.  The Korean people also want reunification.  They have a shared history, and this isn't totally unlike Germany being split after WWII.  So, US Executive office is not super on board, as we saw with Pence not standing, or applauding or showing any respect...but, the media is rewarding behavior that we want to see repeated.  Efforts to bridge the gap lead to "hey, great job.  We know you're still a vicious little dictator, but we like this.".  If he tests another nuke, the tone will reflect that, as well.

       Prior to Kim Jong Un's succession people were starving in North Korea. The military leaders were taking all the food supplies and selling rice to China at a discount. Kim staged a palace coup against the military, put the Korean Workers' Party back in charge, unlocked the food warehouses, instituted free enterprise farmers markets, and got the economy moving again despite crushing sanctions.

       Your media tells you to hate him. Your President tries to sabotage the Olympics with threats of war, Then the North Koreans make a show of good faith by sending their President and Kim's sister to the  opening ceremonies.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are they supposed to do. Not cover the Olympic games? Trump missed his chance to boycott the games, so he sent Pence to piss on the rug instead. If that wasn't enough for you, turn off your TV.

       Malcolm Turnbull: “They have a long habit of ratcheting up their militarisation and then going into a lull for a while, trying to persuade people they are changing their ways, changing nothing, and then ratcheting up again,” the Prime Minister said at Narashino Japanese Self-Defence Force base out of Tokyo. “We need to maintain the pressure of the strong economic sanctions.”

Use the Olympic games to look like they're building ties with SK and promoting unification, when all they're doing is stopping and invasion from the west and east as no one is going to invade or attempt to stop a country that's "extending the olive branch of peace". I'm not really into conspiracies i just lurk here every now and again. This is a clever move by NK though and as much as people paint Kim Jong Un as a stupid little fat man, he clearly know's what he's doing or at least the people he works with do.

       I see everything on the MSM about NK as total bullshit. Just propaganda and fear-mongering, making us think another war is coming, nuclear annihilation, blah blah blah.... They're all working together to make things work for them, (1%) and not us. (Rest of Earth's populace)

       Now that much we're in agreement on. It blows my mind that people still watch the god damned news as if it's anything less that a 100% 24/7 propaganda machine. And I say this for all stations. I don't trust any of them. Fuck political affiliation. My affiliation is to the truth, and to the people around me.

       The olympics make shit weird. When they came to Vancouver all the homelesa people were given fuck-off one way tickets out of town. Had to hide the problem. I imagine this is similar. Too much money wrapped up in these. Cities don't always recover well after

       It's the Olympics, time to promote peace and cooperation amongst all countries.  There is a bit of excitement because the North/South combined as a single team indicating there could possibly be a progress in the talks between the two, but for the most part the Olympics tries to leave politics out of it.

       Unrelenting hate wears out its impact. Look at it like a movie. If we just hate, hate, hate, that isn't much of a plot. But if we start to get along it sets things up for something to go horribly wrong. "I knew you were a no good dirty...!"

       On a completely separate note, this reminded me of playing Civ and getting nuked by Gandhi in the end game. I know it's off topic but I laugh my ass off every time I think about it. I wasn't even the only one to get nuked by Gandhi. Plenty of us have.

       I'd prefer that the USA actually puts up or shuts up when it comes to North Korea. Solve the fucking problem or don't talk about it. Kim Jong Un has repeatedly attempted to build missiles to strike against his enemies, but the whole world is just looking on as if it's no big deal. "Oh, just that kooky gook again." His entire country is a shithole, why is nothing being done?

       Information is more freely available, and, despite what old fucks will tell you about the Internet making us communicate less, the human race has never communicated more. On the whole, people are actually getting more tired of the corruption because it's been more and more apparent. People speak up and get arrested, which leads to more people speaking up. They can't arrest us all.

       Ctrl+F: Diplomacy
      </p>
      <p>
       Not a single result.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how diplomacy works: praise where necessary, scold where necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       By uniting under a single flag, watching events together, having delegations meeting etc this is how you bring about a warming of relations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Praising them for doing the right thing, when they do the right thing, is EXACTLY what needs to happen: it can be conducive to improving relations.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't deny, negate, or diminish their previous scold-worthy actions. But it can help to reduce them in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm aware while all this has been going on Kim Jong-un held a military parade, so they're not quite ready to drop the belligerence just yet and reunite Korea. However, marginal gains in diplomacy are to be celebrated, because they can add up to larger ones.

       And if all others accepted the lie which the Party imposed -if all records told the same tale — then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'Who controls the past,' ran the Party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the present controls the past.' And yet the past, though of its nature alterable, never had been altered. Whatever was true now was true from everlasting to everlasting. It was quite simple. All that was needed was an unending series of victories over your own memory. 'Reality control', they called it: in Newspeak, 'doublethink'.

       You know what I'd really enjoy? A world where we just sort of realized that we're all in this shitfest together, and kind of worked towards the benefit of everyone. I mean don't get me wrong, I'm a human, and I wanna have nice things and toys and shit. But like, how much do I really need? Do I need a fucking Ferrari? That car can go faster than is even legal. Like why the fuck did we even make a car that costs 500 grand which we can't even "legally" use.

       We buy into false narratives that pit us against each other with alarming ease. That makes us controllable. Women are afraid of men, Men are afraid of women, whites are afraid of blacks, blacks are afraid of police, police is afraid of blacks and the media feeds the flames.

       The trump admin is a big scary shit talking dude from brooklyn. Idk if its a safe way to navigate foreign policy but it appears to have worked without actual war for north korea.... Now, if the trump admin was trying to actually prevent war, thats another question... Its also possible that kim jon il was already planning on trying to unify korea. It was all propoganda in both directions.

       Solid observation. In regards to North Korea, I generally think Vice is a shit source of anything (They used to be cool when I was a kid. Sex drugs and rock and roll) but their documentary on North Korea seemed legit to me. If you haven't seen it, youtube it. It's pretty interesting. I don't trust Vice for much else these days though. (They used to be so cool.)

       ppl who are wired into the control matrix hook, line, and , sinker are like fish with very limited memories. they dont have a continuous timeline perspective, meaning they believe whatever is in front of them at the time is what they believe. This goes for social phenomena too.

       haven't you heard? you don't follow Q?
NK is a CIA black op/black pawn and has been for 60+ years. War is a banker scam utilizing dark CIA forces/ops to creat wars/enemies using the Main Stream Media to advertise the war and bolster public support (we pay for the wars / bankers profit from wars)
Trump/Q/seal team? took out 2 Cia black ops communication centers in Asia that were controlling NK/CIA handlers... Trump/Un send VP/Sister to keep FF false flag nuke event at Olympics from ever happening... Deep state is being taken down/dissmantled and NK was never the enemy.. the CIA, Rothschild banking empire, and the globalists moving us toward a one world government were the enemy.. and that enemy is headed to Guantanemo now.

       It’s Realpolitik.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is really the first step into a reconciliation with NK, or better yet, unification with the South, then the MSM needs to undo most of the demonising it’s done over the past few years so that the transition to the world stage is as smooth as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, there’s an argument to be made that seeming open to NK and praising their decision to work with the South to represent Korea as a whole in the games, might make the NK administration more open to idea, simply because you’re more likely to join a group that you think might tolerate you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, if NK returns to normalcy after the Olympics, it’s not skin off the media outlet’s noses. They can play it up like the media being fooled by NK’s facade and the general population will slip right back into the previous narrative over NK, depending on which outlet they consume the most.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s nothing sinister.

       I don't see any about face or change of opinion regarding NK at all. I see people dropping political rivalries during an international sporting event to promote good sportsmanship and friendly competition. Its an extremely positive thing and something that American culture could use a lot more of tbh.

       When Trump v. Kim flares up again (as it undoubtedly will), the MSM wants to be in the position to pick a side, depending on the circumstances. They will either be able to demonize both Trump and Kim, or just Trump, depending on the circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Kim commits overt acts of aggression, the MSM can demonize both. If Kim performs acts passive aggression (e.g. stonewalling the UN, military drills in contested seas, etc.), the MSM can attack whatever response Trump makes.

       I was very confused by this too OP, when the regime change occurred and Kim Jung Un took over I figured everyone was going to talk about peace, because if we just offered him court side tickets for pretty much any NBA  in exchange for peace he's be in. I can't figure out why it's bragging time about the easiest peace talks in history. That fat bastard love American culture so much haha.

       I have though about this alpt myself and he ONLY reason it would make any type of sense is if it is some psy op to cause issues between kim and his sister. With his massive ego I am sure he would much rather the West be fawning all over him and it will probably piss him off that his sister has gotten so much attention. Maybe he will see it as a potential threat to his rule.
      </p>
      <p>
       We know MSM works close with the intelligence community so I can see this being a distinct possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Otherwise it really doesn't make any sense.  I live in Cincinnati where Otto was taken when he came home and I have heard horror stories about how he was treated from people that worked close to him. No American media outlet should be praising a country that tortured and murdered one of our own.

       A lot weird about NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Up until Trump got elected, NK was a buffoonish dictatorship that can't even get a rocket to crash in the ocean properly. Trump gets elected, all of a sudden they're a nuclear power that can hit 3/4s of the planet with nuclear warheads.
      </p>
      <p>
       NK is a complete black hole of information and the two Koreas absolute mortal to the end.... but they'll share an Olympic team. Really?
      </p>
      <p>
       Every photo or video of Kim and his generals looks like it was thrown together by a high school theater group. The uniforms look ridiculous, the backgrounds, the rooms, the buildings, all look like a ridiculous high school theater level construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The press releases and the announcements from NK look ridiculous. The video from their supposed govt TV looks like kindergarten level bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what 's going on in NK, but that buffoon and his father and grandfather are just actors in a bad soap opera. They are the false face of something entirely different than what they are claimed to be.

       Peace and love is better than hate. We don't need to invade a country to free its people. There's a Spartacus in every situation and the people will eventually revolt. What we need to do is stop putting people in categories like enemies/friends.

       Probably because the Olympics isn’t the place to bring up any of that? Am I crazy or would you want the announcers to say “Welcome to day 5 of the 2018 Winter Olympics! Here come the North Koreans who have been causing political unrest with many nations with its nuclear testing and threats. They also have a famine that’s been going on for years and without humanitarian aid many more would’ve died from starvation.”

      <p>
       “And here come the Canadians, they have a good chance at the gold in this event”

       It’s just their job to report and announce on the Olympics.

       We don't have a problem with the North Korean people (in this case North Korean Athletes). We have a problem with the Kim Jong Un regime. No one is suddenly praising Kim Jong Un. We're cheering Olympic competitors, and specifically the fact that they walked in as a unified Korea.

       North Korea has been a Favorite distraction of the MSM.  With the Olympics, the peace brigade is about in full force. A Narrative will be pushed and praised for the Next month in the idea of Solidarity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next month we will return to form and spit on each other.  If we are lucky the Koreans will come to a Peace accord, but the US is not going to allow that Because we want our Foothold on the Continent and no other place will afford us that luxury.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL DR.  This is a smokescreen we will push a war agenda starting March 1st.

       Maybe the problem isn't msm but the actual problem is the people like you who can't compartmentalize shit that's comes out of the news. You can praise them for being reasonable while also criticise them for being a bunch of punks the past year. It isn't that difficult to do lol

       Most likely they want us to keep funding them so they will kill us. Who knows, even tho they look insane they still have an agenda, they're just scared and dont know how to react because they've never had this many people catch them in lies and call them on their bullshit so they feel really awkward sitting there lying to us and they know that we don't believe it. Maybe acting crazy is a way for the people on the fence to say "No way these people are nuts no way they are smart enough to pull off a big conspiracy" or something.

       They have nukes now and that merits respect from all nations. The idea is that by trying to include them in games and in the media in a positive way, it will eventually lead to more talking and most likely dismantling the shit show that is going on in NK.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other alternative, which you seem to favor, is the continuation of belittling NK, thus making them get pissed off enough to start a nuclear war. And this time around it won't be like Ww2, almost everyone has recognized that since there are so many nukes, one going off will initiate a cascade of nukes from all around the world, that it will be the end of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, accepting them now and changing them through integration is really the only thing they everyone should be doing.

       From what I gather, their unity for these olympics with south korea is what is being applauded, not their human rights track record.

       What does a dictator gain by entering the olympics? Is it to just show off how much control he has? Is it a time to negotiate in secret? What would the possible motivations be?

       Have you ever had a conversation with someone who escaped from North Korea? Because I have. It isn't exactly Disney Land over there. Thankfully the youth are beginning to realize this and things seems to be slowly changing. Hopefully anyways.

       They weren't praising Un, they were just laughing at trump. At no point no one was saying "you know what, these NK guys are alright". Now you guys blowing Russia because they helped trump is very real and well documented.
