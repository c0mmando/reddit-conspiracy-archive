        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>“Dear Pro-vaxxer,
I honestly don’t know why I’m writing this, because it’s likely that it won’t make any difference to you. You’ll skim over the first few sentences, roll your eyes, and skip to the comments to bash me for my ignorance. You’ll type a few words into google, reassure yourself with the first results you see, and stay in your peaceful cocoon of ignorance. I can’t blame you, really.  Most of us spent part or most of our lives in that very same cozy cocoon. We supported vaccination 110% and vowed to vaccinate our own children. We rolled our eyes at so-called “anti-vaxxers” and their blind following of some debunked theory about vaccines and autism. We believed in herd immunity and did our part to protect those who couldn’t protect themselves. And mostly, we didn’t think much about it at all. We just grew up knowing it was helpful and good and didn’t really question it. Until we did. </p>

<p>For some, it took a personal experience with vaccine injury to initiate interest in the topic; for others, perhaps the birth of a child, or a recommendation from a friend, or a gut feeling, even. But once we started to look at ALL of the science and research about the immune system, vaccines, their safety, and their efficacy, it became quickly evident that there was so much more to this debate than meets the eye. </p>

<p>We are not stupid. We are not crazy. We are not gullible. We do not get our information from Jenny McCarthy or Internet memes. We are intelligent, educated individuals from all walks of life. We understand how to analyze research and how to discern &quot;junk science&quot; from real science. We have devoted hundreds of hours of our lives to reading books, pouring over peer-reviewed articles and studies, and listening to the testimony of scientists, doctors, and researchers. And we are not backing down because the science is on. our. side. </p>

<p>We are asking you, begging you, to open your eyes. To notice and acknowledge the corruption and conflicts of interest that occur among the CDC, FDA, and pharmaceutical industry. We are praying for you to open a vaccine insert, to read and research the ingredients yourselves, and to investigate how vaccine safety studies are conducted (spoiler alert: there’s no true placebo control). We are asking you to learn about glutathione and the MTFHR gene mutation, about heavy metal toxicity and the blood-brain barrier, about vaccine-induced encephalitis, about the Vaccine Event Reporting System and the Vaccine Injury Act of 1986.  We want you to listen to the whistleblower scientists within the CDC and pharmaceutical industry who are telling us about the fraud and deceit happening behind closed doors- the falsified studies, the fabricated numbers, the closed-door meetings. We want you to research the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the field of medicine and medical education, the media, and the government regulating agencies. There is so much more to this topic than you could ever imagine, and we are desperately trying to get you to just open your eyes. To open your mind to the possibility that maybe there is a little more to the story than you&#39;ve been told. Because we can’t possibly sum it up for you in one comment, or one post, or even with one book or one documentary.  The vaccine issue is an extremely multi-faceted one, and you must be willing to do a good deal of open-minded research to even begin to see the big picture.</p>

<p>We probably come on a little strong at times. Maybe we even seem crazy. But we&#39;re not crazy; we&#39;re passionate. We&#39;re incredibly passionate because of what is at stake. This is not about pro-vax or anti-vax. This is not about autism or one doctor’s crazy idea or an irrational fear of “chemicals”. This is about the health and livelihood of our children.<br/>
Vaccine safety should be of the utmost importance to every parent and public health official, and the door should absolutely never, EVER be closed to discussion about the safety and efficacy of something that affects nearly every child in the country (and the fact that it IS should be an automatic red flag… if a product is completely safe, completely effective, and completely necessary, then there is no reason to fear discussion or debate.)</p>

<p>We are not afraid of the measles or the mumps or the chicken pox because we understand these diseases and how the immune system works. And while we pray that our children don’t get sick, when they do, we do not panic because we know their immune systems are capable of handling it. We breastfeed our babies, eat healthy diets, and supplement where nutrients are lacking. We understand that our bodies can and do heal themselves when they are properly nurtured and cared for, and we put great effort into giving our bodies and our children’s bodies what they need to naturally fight off, and acquire immunity from, sickness and disease. Our children are healthy, happy, and strong. They get sick less often and recover more quickly than their vaccinated peers. They have lower rates of auto-immune disease, cancer, and chronic illness. They do not endanger their peers because they are not vaccinated; in fact, it is much more likely that their vaccinated peers would expose them to the live viruses they carry for weeks or even months after inoculation. When our children are sick, they show symptoms, and we keep them home as any responsible parent should. </p>

<p>We fight this fight not just for our own children, but for yours. When we share something, we share it in hopes that maybe you will be inspired to do some research of your own. We endure public ridicule, are likened to child-abusers, and are aliented from friends and family because we cannot in good conscience sit idly by knowing what we know.</p>

<p>So please, do us a favor. We are absolutely not asking you to stop vaccinating yourself or your children. But, for the sake of your health and your child’s health, please just look a little deeper into the topic. Be willing to look at both sides of the research before making up your mind which science is the “right” science to believe in. Be willing to look beyond CNN or The Huffington Post for an answer to your questions, and be able to discern between hype and fact (on BOTH sides of the debate). All we want is for parents to have true informed consent- to know and understand the potential risks, benefits, and side effects of ANY medication or medical procedure before agreeing to it, and to have the right to decline if/when the benefits do not outweigh the risks. There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all medical intervention, so let’s stop pretending that size, gender, and genetic make-up have no bearing on how an individual might be affected… and let’s start taking responsibility to make decisions for our own children instead of allowing them to be dictated by a less-than-perfect government agency.</p>

<p>We’re here if you need us. </p>

<p>Love,
The Ex-Vaxxers”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it all comes down to cognitive dissonance doesn&#39;t it?. Its a shame that people react as if they are being attacked simply because they have a different opinion than others. They attack those that go against their believes even without looking or understanding what they bring to the table. They just stick their heads back into the sand.</p>

<p>Ad hominem attacks to those that go against the mainstream view mean nothing. Truth is truth no matter where it comes from or who says it, and its out there for those who want to find it.</p>

<p>Are you curious enough?.</p>

<p>A new study conducted by Jennifer Reich, a researcher at the University of Colorado Denver, shows that the reasons why children may not be fully vaccinated depends on the class privilege of their mothers.</p>

<p>Published in Gender &amp; Society, a top-ranked journal in Gender Studies and Sociology field, Reich’s research shows that unvaccinated or under-vaccinated children from higher income backgrounds, with parents who are higher educated, have parents who intentionally choose to refuse or delay vaccinations out of a belief that they are protecting their children.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://clinicalnews.org/2014/08/29/highly-educated-parents-more-likely-not-to-vaccinate-their-children/">https://clinicalnews.org/2014/08/29/highly-educated-parents-more-likely-not-to-vaccinate-their-children/</a></p>

<p>Well there goes the whole &quot;people who don&#39;t vaccinate their kids are stupid&quot; argument. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although it is exaggerated, are we not the creators of disease? Our advancements in technology has created nothing but poisoning of our world. That’s why people get sick, that’s why we have doctors. But is there ever a cure for anything? No. It’s only medication to keep you healthy cause curing you wouldn’t make them money. It’s like batteries. We have the tech to make batteries last forever (exaggerating but for a very very long time) but why would we? When we can make more money making them die faster and have consumers buy more? The world is consumerism. The United States is a business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To begin with? A (few) earlier publication(s) (on the subject of immunoinnoculation) would be nice.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In which no fear mongering tactiques such as <a href="https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/6275/is-margarine-one-molecule-away-from-plastic">&#39;margarine is one molecule different from plastic and shares ingredients with paint!&#39;</a> - Which is only true if you consider the fact that Humans and Chimpanzees <a href="https://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/human-origins-and-cultural-halls/anne-and-bernard-spitzer-hall-of-human-origins/understanding-our-past/dna-comparing-humans-and-chimps/">share a surprising 98.8 %</a> of DNA to mean that Humans are 98% Chimpanzee.</p></li>
<li><p>In fact, I would want the article I read on the very <em>subject</em> of the dangers of vaccination, to be found inside a paper copy of one of any independent medical periodicals, or at least have a physical copy in one - rather than trust <em>any</em> source on the Internet. Hell, <em>I</em> can claim to be a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FO0kRE5OTZI"><em>doctor and a special agent</em> with a PH.D. in <strong>Kicking-Your-Ass</strong></a> - and there&#39;s only a handfull of people who could refute that claim, since they actually know me off-line.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I could continue writing, but there&#39;s this guy filming me while I&#39;m trying to have breakfast. And that stupid rooster got loose in the house.</p>

<p>And I believe my point is clear, or can at least be gleaned from what I&#39;ve said so far.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no interest in a public back-and-forth. If you are a staunch anti-vaxxer, then none of the sources I could cite from my end will seem credible to you, and vice versa.</p>

<p>The burden of proof does lay with you, or with me. Nor is this a matter of right and wrong. This is a matter of public health and though it may make me a sheeple, I prefer to adhere to the general consensus. </p>

<p>Considering in <em>years</em> the anti-vaxer movement hasn&#39;t been able to <em>change</em> the general consensus, despite &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of backers (and don&#39;t come whining about Big Pharma keeping them down - If there are so many and they are so organized, trample the offices of Big Pharma.) - I will <em>remain</em> with the general consensus precisely <em>because</em> I have not been convinced of my being wrong.</p>

<p>Anti-vaxxer proof consists largely of obvious fear-mongering and directly interplaying with the sense of <em>faillure</em> many parents will at all cost <em>try to avoid</em> - <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/kwxq3w/parents-are-giving-their-children-bleach-enemas-to-cure-them-of-autism-311"><strong>at all costs</strong></a> even up to and including harming them <em>directly</em> - and every shred of evidence to support anti-vaxxer theory has been either debunked, or wasn&#39;t worth debunking in the first place. But it&#39;s evidence that might strike fear in the heart of Jane AmIDoingTHisRight Doe - and rely on the methods of gossip and word-of-mouth among the scared to spread...</p>

<p>... The anti-vaxxer movement is, in fact, a mnemetic virus in itself. Just like the Flat-Earth movement, but that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother cup of tea.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t <em>care</em> about right or wrong or competing.

<p>This is true for some diseases and not for others. For example, sanitation and plumbing wiped out polio. Polio is spread through fecal material. The &quot;polio&quot; outbreak was actually the result of DDT poisoning at the time. Then they changed the diagnostic criteria for polio right after the vaccine came out. So polio diagnoses went down, and acute flaccid paralysis diagnoses went up. </p>

<p>Measles is a more effective vaccine because it&#39;s live. You might still have titres to it, although I did not when I got checked. Thing is, measles was harmless by the time they started vaccinating for it. (Amazing what nutrition and child labor laws will do for childhood survival!) It was a common childhood illness, much like chicken pox was when you and I were growing up. People took their kids to measles parties. The Brady Bunch and Flintstones had episodes about it. I&#39;d take measles over the MMR shot any day, but that&#39;s because I know the adverse reaction risk. </p>

<p>It is not a competition to whom can post more links. It&#39;s a safety issues. All vaccines MUST be proven safe. Even ONE source that shows a threat to public safety must be investigated and independently proven safe. </p>
