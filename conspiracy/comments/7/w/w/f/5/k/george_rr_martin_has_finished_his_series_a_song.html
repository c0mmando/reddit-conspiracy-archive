<p>Book readers will still purchase the books when tv series ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Posted this on your first submission:</p>

<p>I think GRRM has shown, through the course of his 25+ year writing of ASOIAF that he always takes time to write his material. He was taking 5 years in between books back in the 90&#39;s. I believe I read somewhere that HBO was already told the ending by GRRM in the event that he dies, and the show has already somewhat diverged from the books, though the broad picture remains the same.</p>

<p>I guess I just don&#39;t think HBO and GRRM have to strike a deal like that...HBO already said there will be only one more season of GoT, and GRRM has been working on his final book (though he has suggested he might need 2 to finish it) for several years. What you suggest isn&#39;t impossible but based on GRRM&#39;s writing timetable and what HBO has already stated, I don&#39;t think that the release of the book and release of the show are necessarily spoilers for one another. I mean- the first 5 seasons were written on books that had already been released and the plot &quot;known&quot;.</p>

<p>Interesting idea nonetheless tho, OP.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With time death even may die. We can&#39;t discount Lovecraft&#39;s influence on the series and how the setting&#39;s early lore mirrors both the mythos &amp; the current action in the latest entry in the series.</p>

<p>There are so many ways this could go, but personally I think it&#39;ll be Elder Gods v Old Ones with humans, dragons, and whitewalkers teaming up to survive the chaos as the stars become right again. Hella shoggoths gon&#39; be comin&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wish I could believe this, I really do but... just no. If even one of the two books was publishable it would be rushed out with ubelievable fanfare as soon as humanly possible. We are going to be waiting for the best part of two years for the show to air so now would be an ideal time to maintain interest in the series. Many casual show watchers will forget all about GoT such is the wait. The book readers on the other hand have been waiting for seven years (?) and would cross mountains to pick up a copy. There is no way a publishing company would hold back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I, for one, hope that when GRRM releases the rest of ASOIAF, it is in direct contrast and contempt of the HBO Series. I hope that while the show ends on its positive &quot;good guys&quot; narrative, the book ends up with all of your favorite characters getting slaughtered. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>Well, it&#39;d be Kubrick-esque (see: &#39;The Shining&#39; and &#39;2001: A Space Odyssee&#39;), dissonant, and a big ole &#39;Fuck You&#39; to people who would rather watch TV than read. </p>

<p>Keep in mind, I loved the books, and the show lives up to pretty much all of the mental images I had while reading - Just, you know, kinda hope that GRRM retakes his position of Alpha-nerd, instead of famecuck.</p>

<p>...For all of us fantasy-losers out there, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I&#39;m looking forward to the book more than the show. There is no way the SJWs will allow anyone (on the show) but Dany to become queen which kind of kills the suspense.</p>

<p>Hopefully the book can be allowed to have more freedom as GRRM can at least say that he started the series before lynch mobs in geek culture were a thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stopped reading very early in book 4 (AFFC) when I skimmed ahead and saw that there was no Arya in it. It kind of annoyed me so I decided to stop reading it and re-read the whole thing again once GRRM finished up the series....13 years later...</p>

<p>One of my personal pet peaves are incomplete epic fantasies. It started, for me, with Robert Jordan and waiting for him to get done  with Wheel of Time.</p>
