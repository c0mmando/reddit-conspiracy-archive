        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People are worried about him, many have reached out to him and received no response. Prior to <a href="https://youtu.be/fQeAjYc_6gI">the last video he posted</a> on 12/9/17, he had been uploading videos on a regular basis and was communicating with his viewers. While it is possible that he decided to suddenly stop making videos of his own accord, for whatever reason, I feel that it&#39;s unlikely he would do that without some kind of warning. I think he would at least let people know that he would no longer be uploading content so they wouldn&#39;t be worried about his safety.  He was very passionate about this topic so I don&#39;t think he all of a sudden lost interest in it. Unfortunately no one seems to have known his name so there is not much to go on in terms of being able to investigate what happened. For anyone researching and posting content about pedophile rings or any other similar kinds of things, I definitely understand wanting to post anonymously but I think it would be wise to get to know other researchers a little so that in case something like this happens there are people who can help investigate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That depends entirely on the outcome of his &quot;punishment&quot;. I&#39;ll bet if someone killed his family he&#39;d regret ever talking about it. If the only thing that happened was that he was banned from YouTube, then maybe you&#39;d be right. I don&#39;t think anything criminal happened to this guy, I bet it&#39;s just a personal problem or a possible legal battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They could be in the process of doing that right now. DMCA takedowns aren&#39;t instant. He could possibly have been killed, and he could possibly be just sick or injured, and he could also possibly be in legal trouble. None of these situations have any actual evidence though, so it&#39;s all just conjecture. It&#39;s certainly suspicious based on what he was investigating and reporting on though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason I think it is the most suspicious is because he told his viewers to comment, rate, subscribe and share his last video and gave no indication the he was slowing down or anything, and prior to his last video he was regularly uploading videos, several each week, and communicating with people who left him comments. Seems very uncharacteristic  of him to just suddenly stop and give no answer in regards to the concerns that many of his fans have for his safety his safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I totally get all that, and you&#39;re right, it does seem uncharacteristic, but I just don&#39;t think you should jump to conclusions just yet. Keeping an open mind will stop you from collecting evidence to match it to your theory, rather than building a theory on the evidence itself. Oftentimes people will get stuck on a certain line of thinking and overlook certain things because it doesn&#39;t match their theory.  </p>

<p>I do think it warrants further investigation though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I understand that it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that he just hasn&#39;t felt like logging in to YouTube..... however, I find that to be <em>Extremely Unlikely</em> in his case. He had 242 videos and almost 12,000 subscribers. He was uploading a few videos a week and he was passionate about what he was researching. He gave no indication that he was going to take a break for a while. Even if he didn&#39;t log in to YouTube, YouTube sends messages to your e-mail account when a comment is left or if someone sends you a private message! People tried to message him on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2364899">voat</a> as well, and no one was able to get a hold of him there either.</p>

You used to be able to see both upvote and downvote counts on comments, but Reddit removed that feature over a year ago (possibly more).

However, if a comment has been upvoted and downvoted a lot, you&#39;ll see a small cross next to the upvote count that indicates &quot;controversial&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizzagate is not a bullshit conspiracy theory, no matter how much you might hate it because it involves the Clintons and was extremely damaging to her presidential run (I can tell that you hate Trump so much so I&#39;m sure you wish she had won), it&#39;s real. Look into the Laura Silsby connection, she was rescued by Bill Clinton after she was arrested trying to smuggle 33 children out of Haiti. This absolutely happened, it&#39;s not up for debate. Monica Peterson was murdered while researching child trafficking in Haiti. Other researchers, such as the hacker who found child pornography on the protected section of the the Comet Ping Pong website, has been gang stalked, threatened and had his equipment destroyed (listen at 16:00 to <a href="https://youtu.be/HTRewHDOr90">this interview</a> and you can also see proof that officer Marcus Stevens of the D.C. Police confirmed receipt of the reporting of child pornography on the Conet Ping Pong website) </p>

And then you jumped on that other commenter with your, “You don’t get to decide what conspiracy is defined as”. Like, there are definitions for words and you don’t get to just interpret everything in your own personal way so that you can never be wrong. </p>

<p>Speaking of gatekeeping, are you expecting me to prove to you that I meet your criteria of a conspiracy theorist and therefore have the privilege to post here? That’s quite a 180 you pulled from accusing me of gatekeeping. </p>

<p>was aggressive in the least. I also don&#39;t feel that I react aggressively to the regular user. I read many more comments than I ever get the nerve to respond to. Like I mentioned, it&#39;s only when I feel there is a real disregard for logical train of thought and scientific method or a clear example of willful ignorance that I speak up. </p>

<p>On that point your first comment towards me was accusing me of being a gatekeeper and digging through my post history for something to attack other than my comment. Not to mention the use of &quot;Lol.&quot; and &quot;Bro&quot; in your comment. Which of these sounds more hostile to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a valid reason to be concerned, the conversation is being derailed by people like you who are coming up with every reason under the sun as to why he is probably fine and just taking a break from YouTube and for some reason decided to ignore all of the comments that are asking him if he&#39;s ok. Now in your comment here you claimed that his latest video &quot;started a lot of controversy and drew a lot of heat&quot; and it&#39;s for that reason that he might have wanted to &quot;chill for a bit&quot;. I countered that by citing the almost immaculate upvote to downvote ratio which hardly ever happens on YouTube videos and I will add that there is not a single negative comment posted in the comment thread on YouTube as of now. Since then, you&#39;ve changed your statement to the general subject matter he was covering was controversial, along with mentioning the false flag shooting at Comet Ping Pong featuring the actor Edgar Maddison Welch where he shot a computer in a closet, of all things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one knows his name so we don&#39;t know whether his friends or family don&#39;t know where he is. However, the fact that he hasn&#39;t responded to anyone who has been asking if he is okay and telling him that they are worried about him in the comments section of his videos is cause for concern. If you look in his previous videos, he responded to the comments so to all of a sudden be ignoring all of his viewers who are worried about him doesn&#39;t seem like something he would do if he was in fact safe and sound.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I understand that it&#39;s <em>possible</em> that he just hasn&#39;t felt like logging in to YouTube..... however, I find that to be <em>Extremely Unlikely</em> in his case. He had 242 videos and almost 12,000 subscribers. He was uploading a few videos a week and he was passionate about what he was researching. He gave no indication that he was going to take a break for a while. Even if he didn&#39;t log in to YouTube, YouTube sends messages to your e-mail account when a comment is left or if someone sends you a private message! People tried to message him on <a href="https://voat.co/v/pizzagate/2364899">voat</a> as well, and no one was able to get a hold of him there either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just wouldn’t read into it what you have. That doesn’t make me right and you wrong or vice-versa.</p>

<p>But I can think of two communities where I was VERY active for a few years each, posted even daily on both, and just ... moved on. I’m in touch with exactly one person from those two fairly large communities and that’s because, before I left, he invited me to join his fantasy football league, haha.</p>

<p>Peoples lives change. Or they step in front of a bus or contract cancer or meet a girl/boyfriend or whatever. </p>

<p>I’m just saying someone dropping out like that doesn’t mean foul play. If they are alive and want to be in contact, they will be. But if they freely choose to move on and don’t want to be ‘found’ (I presume they live a physical life and not just an online one) then that’s their right and they don’t owe anyone anything. They don’t have to say “I’ve stopped posting” or “Thanks for your concern but I’ve started a new chapter in my life” or anything like that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming that is his real voice it is very identifiable. Was he trying to be anonymous? If he is implying that these police were pedophiles because they were associating with a pedophile it&#39;s not hard to imagine he was identified and threatened.

The other thing is that he made a channel about pizzagate when it was a hot topic. Now most people have moved on. Whatever whatever about that but the last story had nothing to do with pizzagate.

<blockquote>
<p>On March 24, three weeks after the news first broke that state Rep. Justin Harris (R-West Fork) and his wife, Marsha, gave their two adopted daughters in 2013 to a family where one of them was later sexually assaulted, Rep. Harris returned to Twitter. Normally an active presence on social media, Harris had shuttered his feed the first week of March in response to an onslaught of unwanted attention as the Arkansas Times report revealing the &quot;rehoming&quot; of the girls, ages 3 and 5 at the time, was picked up by national and international media outlets.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>He and his wife adopt two children, give them away to a pedo and say that it&#39;s because they were possessed. Of course he&#39;s a bible thumper.  There is a very suspicious case that no one in theie right mind could believe. Actual children, actual molestation, and all that&#39;s lacking is proof that he did this intentionally, but I believe he did because his story is ridiculous.<br/>
Of course he is a Christian Republican so maybe it&#39;s not as good a story as &quot;Satanic&quot; Democrats. </p>

And yes, about Africa and not letting people use condoms, it&#39;s ridiculous. And you probably know about<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/world/asia/mother-teresa-critic.html"> Mother Teresa.</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over hundreds of hours of research, much of it cataloged in a book he published in 2003, Dr. Chatterjee said he found a “cult of suffering” in homes run by Mother Teresa’s organization, the Missionaries of Charity, with children tied to beds and little to comfort dying patients but aspirin.
He and others said that Mother Teresa took her adherence to frugality and simplicity in her work to extremes, allowing practices like the reuse of hypodermic needles and tolerating primitive facilities that required patients to defecate in front of one another.  </p>

But yes, I also am aware about the laws where they will ask for all sorts of identifying information for anyone who wants to visit a porn site. It&#39;s just a way to track/monitor people and control the Internet. Lots of sites that are not porn sites do feature some adult content and I imagine they will have to censor themselves or lose traffic. I mean they will have to be careful not to provide any content that will put them on the list where they have to collect the info.<br/>
Privatizing is big here, too, especially prisons for profits, and prison labor.<br/>
Anyway sort of back on topic, what they need to do is find out who approved Jimmy Savile to be so close to the royals. I would think with the level of security they have it would be impossible that they didn&#39;t know about him when so many people did. And things like that are what make me think that Arkansas senator was part of some ring and knew exactly what he was doing.   </p>
