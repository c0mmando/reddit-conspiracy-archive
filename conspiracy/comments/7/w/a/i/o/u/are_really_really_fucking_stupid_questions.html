       I ask this because I've just spotted some dumb shit about Paul McCartney being replaced by a body double and I almost unsubscribed, then it occurred to me that may be the whole point of such posts. But I'm just - not - sure.

       That's all relative though. I don't see why we should turn away a Paul truther- perhaps they believe that this plays further into the media manipulation and control by the Elites? The power of record companies and the mass magick that is music itself?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, I wouldn't really spend time in such a thread, but it's far better than some of the
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       derailment I see around here all the time. Just today there were posts of bad driving videos, a "poof" conspiracy from fairly odd parents, etc. At least the Paul post had some actual effort behind it, and I could see the connection to overarching conspiracies, even if OP didn't explain it that way.
      </p>

       That said- rather than unsub how about you browse by /new? It's by far the best way to view the sub, and it lets you set the tone of discussion as it's ground zero in the fight against the shills.

       Hey man, I love that Paul McCarty Conspiracy theory. It’s harmless and fun to speculate on.

       I think the more likely scenario is that the Deep State activates one of their MKUltra assassins and murdered John Lennon.

       IIRC, the main theory revolves around his manager having the most to gain from his death.  But the things evolved following revealed interest of COINTELPRO with Hendrix.  For the record, these aren't the sources from which I learned of this.  This idea has been around for a while:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Describing the night of Jeffrey's confession, Mr Wright wrote: "I can still hear that conversation, see the man I'd known for so much of my life, his face pale, hand clutching at his glass in sudden rage."
       </p>
       <p>
        Wright claims Jeffrey told him: "I had to do it, Tappy. You understand, don't you? I had to do it. You know damn well what I'm talking about.
       </p>
       <p>
        "I was in London the night of Jimi's death and together with some old friends... we went round to Monika's hotel room, got a handful of pills and stuffed them into his mouth... then poured a few bottles of red wine deep into his windpipe.
       </p>
       <p>
        "I had to do it. Jimi was worth much more to me dead than alive. That son of a bitch was going to leave me. If I lost him, I'd lose everything."
       </p>
       <p>
        John Bannister, the surgeon who dealt with Hendrix at hospital, has said he was convinced the star had drowned in red wine, despite having very little alcohol in his bloodstream.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There were many people who were believed to benefit from Hendrix’s removal. The COINTELPRO or Counter Intelligence Program designed by the FBI was aimed at eliminating subversive behavior within the country. Hendrix appearance at “subversive” benefits resulted in the FBI opening a dossier on him, and his ability to motivate masses were seen by COINTELPRO as less than innocuous. Hendrix connection to manager Mike Jeffery only furthered his surveillance by the FBI. Jeffery had on numerous occasions alluded to being connected to underground organizations. He was in the process of building a recording studio in a part of New York which was primarily mob controlled. In addition, Cynthia McKinney, US House Representative and Green Party nominee for President of the United States in 2008, has pinned Hendrix’s murder on a government plot to eradicate such leaders. Moreover, Hendrix had publically called upon the Black Panther party to go to Washington, DC and shoot the place up.
       </p>
       <p>
        The web of unsavory individuals and circumstances surrounding Hendrix raises even more questions about his death. It was reported that Mike Jeffery was intent on manipulating Hendrix’s life as well as siphoning his money into his own offshore bank accounts. There is also a mention of a million dollar life insurance policy covering Hendrix and listing Jeffery as the beneficiary. Although Jeffery was in Spain during Hendrix’s death, conspiracy theorists speculate that he may have had a part in it.

       He was a powerful black artist who was anti-war and if you listen to his "Live at Berkeley" that came out a few years back, he was getting more political onstage.
       <br/>
       But he might also have been murdered to steal his publishing. There was an article about it in Guitar World maybe ten years ago with some questions raised about the circumstances of his death.

       Eh, deep state favored conservatives in 1980 and Lennon was a Reagan supporter, maybe even a closeted conservative at the time.

       I think there is greater complexity to the shill strategy, and one of the new ideas is to push the angle of “non political” conspiracy, both to mislead the forum and waste the time of members, and to delegitimize it in the eyes of others by specifically pushing ridiculous, unfounded garbage like that avril lavigne shitpost.

- memo stance 1, 2, or 3 
- Elon musk stance 1, 2 , or 3 
- Obama is a piece of shit I hope 1, 2 or 3 happens

       Yeah ok but now it isn't and instead its pizzagate and some interview with a girl from the UK that if you do a little research is complete fucking garbage.

       I get political conspiracies are very important, likewise the human trafficking going on around the world seemingly sanctioned by world governments. But a lot of these posts arn't really about discussing the actual problems but about rubbing shit on whatever party you are against. And if anybody DARES to argue with the OP (whatever side of the isle) they are ridiculed and then called bots or shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really you think the sub looks good with 100s of posts with shit like "SMOKING GUN" "BLOWN WIDE OPEN" then links to some hyper partisan website? I'll tell you it doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a bot or a paid for shill. I'm not American and I enjoyed the post. Dude took more than the 30 seconds devoted to many of these "important" political posts which just end up being a utube link with a pretty crappy SS. People in the comments had a chill time. I don't think anyone really took it seriously but it was interesting and different. Most importantly people could actually have a conversation and discuss without being called a shill or a bot.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if I an organic user thought it was amusing and worth 5 min of time to read what makes you think no other users also found it worth their 5 min and an upvote?

       Nor even joking, but I've read some pretty compelling shit suggesting that Jerry Garcia was a CIA operative. A Paul Mccartney body double isnt sucb an unreasonable prospect. Think about A. how much money the beatles generated. If Paul wanted to call it quits, why not just kill him and replace him. then B. The type of people he used to run elbows with and whos elbows those lead to. Case in point &gt;&gt; Jimmy Saville, iirc one of the sex pistols was quoted back in the day referencing saville and how he wasnt allowed to say anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything is possible man, add money and influence to that equation and youve got opportunities most people can't fathom, like superstar dopplegangers.
      </p>
      <p>
       dont forget, if paul mccartney was murdered and replaced with a doppleganger, that is exactly how theyd want you to respond.

       I don't know, something that enlightens people about fraudulent behaviour that is being conducted and is affecting people today. The term 'conspiracy theorist' already carries enough negative weight without having to add more to it by suggesting Paul McCartney was replaced by a body double. It's like the flat earth thing you get lumped in with the moment you raise questions about 9/11. Just embarrassing dead weight that confirms the doubts most people have about those who frequent such a site as this. Fuck it though, I don't give that much a fuck, just asking to pass the time.

       That's true. But the OP is just talking about reading the posts himself. What harm could come of reading something?

       It seemed to have gone from a discussion board of the classic conspiracies. Not nearly as political today, although there was a lot here about the federal reserve, 9/11, Rothschild, illuminati, if you consider that political.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing like today. It turned into a kind of libertarian news sub with a lot more current event posts. This could have been in reponce to r/pol completely selling out among all of the reddit drama during the Pao era.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then something happened after Pao. I guess it could have to do with all of the attention from Pizzagate. This sub had the spotlight turned on us and it was the first time our community was essentially referenced by tptb irl. That lead right into the early days of the election shilling, the dawn of T_D. A lot of the ex-r/pol guys went over there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we're here - conspricay inception. Everything's a damn conspiracy which is a conspiracy in itself and I have no idea who's who anymore. It's almost like we're the battle ground between T_D and r/pol.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know is the progression and change has accelerated to a pace so fast that I have to think this sub is going to crack at some point soon. Actually I feel the same about the whole country, as if r/conspiracy exemplifies the state of the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always had a feeling the shit was going to hit the fan in my lifetime which is what eventually  drew me to this sub. Ironically just as this sub is finally turning to complete shit more and more every day, the feeling that our county is just around the corner from something big is obvious. It could be next week or month, but I won't give more than 2 years.

       Has anybody here seen my old friend John? Can you tell me where he's gone..? 
He freed a lot of people, seems the good they die young.
 Abraham Lincoln , Martin Luther King. JFK. A good song by Dion
Around the same time as"Fake Paul"and Jimmy you could count Jim Morrison and Janis Joplin..
Through in Keith Moon and Randy Rhoades. 
Beatles went with Crowleys rule of reversal as well as Led Zepplin. Poor Brian Wilson spent a couple years tripling harder than Howard Hughes ....

       There's genuinely topics of weight discussed here every day. The default understanding of what's basically a chat room is that it's a bunch of nobody's posting horse shit. So, why not inject some more dung, more putrid than the organic dung to help that idea survive? Yes a few users here have good info to provide, and others lack foundation. Easy prey for invested interests to muddy the waters under the shroud of anonymity

       Seems a fair question, as opposed to questions about whether Avril Levene or Paul McCartney were replaced by body doubles. That's right up there with flat earth thinking and just turns people away from a site that might otherwise offer valuable insights into things that actually matter.

       Use your votes. I think the Paul McCartney story is entertaining. One problem here is that people think there is some battle that can be won in this sub. If you feel that there is a battle being fought I can understand it. I know we're all being watched more, losing privacy. I know that the goal of GMO's is to control the food supply though patents and ownership of the growing process. I believe this and many other "crazy" things. But what I'm saying is those things happen outside all around us.  No argument won in this sub is going to change it. You can take conspiracies as seriously as you like but "the map is not the territory," and this sub is not where the "battle" will be fought. It's to exchange info, have conversations, and once in a while have some fun with a story about fake Paul McCartney. But you're free to downvote if you're salty, or just keep scrolling, or make your own post.

       Aged 7or 8 looking at two images of Paul McCartney one on his solo album cover and one of a beetles album cover, they're not the same I remember thinking it then at the time and not once more till a couple of years ago, there is something noticeably different in the shape of the face, hairline and eyes. I'm not fully convinced of a death being covered up. Maybe it's just plastic surgery or make up but I know at the time there was a difference that just seemed striking to me, my favourite song throughout my childhood was meat loaf life is a lemon I knew the song was special to me and having not listened to it in 20 years all the lyrics became alive, it's like a part of me that couldn't understand but still knew what's up.

       Reddit, with millions of active eyeballs on it, is understandably considered a potential influence on public opinion. With that comes virtually every PR firm, consumer corporate PR department,  political action committee, and anybody with enough money and hubris to want to control what people think,  with all their sock puppet representation in tow to support numerous agendas; viral advertising, manufactured consent, manufactured polarization/obfuscation, political narrative creation and support, and personal and corporate public relations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is not to mention the legion of trolls who marvel at the fact they can post absurd question or statements then sit back and watch people wrestle with them as a source of amusement.

       Yes. By placing the valid conspiracies in an environment surrounded by ridiculous made-up fake conspiracy theories, the media can label whatever story they want as conspiracy theory and thus they try to control the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the entire purpose of coming up with the term "conspiracy theory". To have a way to summarily dismiss any information that doesn't go with the globalist narrative.

       This is r/conspiracy.

       I've only been here for the past couple of months, but from what I've heard, this subreddit is supposed to be open to ALL conspiracies. Am I wrong in this assumption? I've heard that this used to be the place to get high and talk about aliens, but it's entirely shifted towards political things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand your skepticism, but you should be more open minded and remember that this is r/conspiracy, and what he posted was, in fact, a conspiracy.

       You have like 10 other posts on the front page, why point one innocent conspiracy that is popular? the thing is keeping the discussion alive with a wide array of subjects.

       One day I will post my final theory, UFO's are actually computers from the future traveling back in time making sure no one interferes with the creation of AI while we bomb each other.

       No it doesn’t. Anymore than this thread does.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone posts about something I think is ridiculous or that I’m completely tired of, I don’t look at another post on an entirely different subject and say “Nah, I didn’t like Thread A so I give Thread B less credibility.”

       If you leave, you leave. But someone else might leave because this place has become polluted with non-stop politics and they might rather explore other conspiracies.

       Well it's a matter of how conspiracy theorists get lumped together into one ridiculous bundle. I believe 9/11 was an inside job for example, and because of this a once close friend considers me as akin to a flat earther. It's sad but true, people as a whole lump anyone who considers a conspiracy theory, no matter how credible, as related to every other conspiracy theory, no matter how absurd.

       That happens irregardless of “fun” conspiracy theories like Elvis being alive or Paul McCartney dying and being replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people follow the narrative. Give them something concrete and credible — with 9/11, for instance, it’s in the report that the (former?) Saudi director of civil aviation (as in AIRPLANES) was one of the first people who happened to befriend two of the (I’ll say ‘alleged’ to avoid a tangent) perps when they arrived in the U.S.; they couldn’t deny it because there’s video of them all at a party; the Saudi aviation guy was allowed to go back after cursory investigation/questioning, allowing a potentially incredible lead to fly off the radar; the question being WHY? — and a few will be intrigued to start looking deeper themselves. And some won’t.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I don’t see how a ‘conspiracy theory’ that, say, Batman was/is real and based on a true person or that X-Men like mutants walk the earth, being kept off this sub is going to make someone believe, in your case, that 9/11 was an inside job. Because someone else is going to post an implausible theory about the Illuminati or the Freemasons or what have you.

       I agree, it doesn't matter whether you're deemed ridiculous by association with the Paul is dead guy, the lizard people....people, or some flat earth numbskulls, I was just picking an example to pose a question, namely, are questions like this planted to aid in the already miserably poor reputation that we conspiracy theorists enjoy? Basically because stories like the 'Paul is dead' seem so far out there, bat-shit stupid, that I find it hard to believe anybody actually considers them.
