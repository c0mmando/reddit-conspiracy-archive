       It is my opinion that factions within the US government have had zero-point/anti-gravity devices since AT LEAST WW2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom Line: The US wanted to (convincingly) show up the Russians -- and the world. The rocket launches were legit, but no astronauts were inside.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, Neil Armstrong (along with the "Apollo Lander") were safely transported to the moon on a much larger, zeropoint cargo ship. The Apollo Lander was lowered by cable (and raised by cable) to simulate landing (and subsequent "lunar liftoff").
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, "splashdown" did also occure -- definitely wanted to make sure those pinko commies saw a capsule on their radars! But no one was ever in the modules. The modules were empty -- released from the cargo ship in space. And then astronauts would simply appear for press conferences -- only to describe the dramatic experiences (but also in the form on a limited hangout -- yes, they go to the moon.... just not using really big firecrackers and gold-leafed moon buggies).
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the US sent people to the moon. (And Mars. And other solar systems.) They want you to know they have superior technology -- but they don't want you know just HOW superior. (They want to think they got there on a rocket fueled by "fossils". Nooooooope.)

       Is all of Tesla's work being stolen upon his death by those in power enough evidence? Especially when it is because of him that we have pretty much any technology you can name, yet we learn about everyone BUT him in school?

       Some, pertaining to his patents.  He was THE true genius, far and away superior than anyone else. Most of his work was taken and hidden, obviously. Some even think einstein was a shill "mad zany scientist" character to put people on a different track.

       Don't know on that. It's out of my league. But there is a force that pulls us toward the ground. Or the ground is moving up as a flat earther would say. The effect is the same to me.

       No flat earther thinks the ground moves up. That is retarded Flat Earth Theory disinfo. There is a reason that is the first thing that comes up on Google.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earthers believe in the simple laws of density and buoyancy. Anything more dense than air falls. Anything less dense than air rises. Anything denser than water sinks. Anything less dense than water floats.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are things that float not subject to gravity? Please explain when gravity applies and when it does not apply and please show me the research that shows that the mass of an object can be used to attract the mass of another object.

       To the indoctrinated, if gravity didn't exist we'd float off into space. The cosmology that we are taught in school and are even exposed to before we reach year 5 is that we live on a ball in a vacuum called space. Once you break through the understanding that what you know was put there by so called authority then you will start to unlearn what you have learned. Education is not knowledge but part of the programming, all entertainment programming follows the same information that we are constantly feed throughout our entire lives. The system is a prison of comfort and the majority love their prison because it feeds them, entertains them, tells them what they can and can not do, tells them what is possible and what is not possible. It's the largest prison system you'll never see unless you wake up from the dream that we have all been put in since birth.

       I think you have the right of it. The US space program is fishy in a lot of ways, but people here are thinking in the wrong way. They assume that the green screens, wires, and harnesses signify that we donâ€™t actually have the technology. Truth is that shit is the front to cover the tech thatâ€™s actually out there. Look at the amount of dark money out there. Trillions. Whereâ€™s that going you think?

       but what if we're being held hostage by our own leaders and its not that the aliens want to "invade" and take over like buzz said... but the aliens want to free us from our enslavement instead?

       This is all just speculation. Might be fun, but you have literally no way of knowing that there was an alternate moon program.

       They wanted to show up the Russians so instead of showing off their zero-point anti gravity machines they launched an aluminum tube full of combustible fuel into orbit and then flew their advanced tech up there and pretended they did it in a comparatively stone age machine.
