       So..... Videos of somebody having their head smashed in with a pickaxe are okay. But if you wanna photoshop a celeb onto a big ol pair of Titties..... Fuck you I guess?
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit modified the rules to prohibit many subreddits like r/deepfakes, due to them basically being fake celeb porn. Reddit pretty much said “Hey. No fake porn or stories of unauthorized real people, or children. (Good on them for the children part, fucking sickos) You aren’t allowed to fantasize over them. That’s weird.” Good point Reddit, however. After you step back and look at it...
      </p>
      <p>
       On Reddit, places like R/Nomorals exist. A place where you can see people make fun of everything from people hit by trains, to dead babies. So that shits okay, but my masturbation fantasies aren’t? Also, earlier I mentioned fucked up child Fantasy, well
      </p>
      <p>
       THE FUCKING AGEPLAY PAGES ARE STILL UP? THEY ARE LEGITIMATELY JUST PEOPLE PRETENDING TO BE LITTLE KIDS. I REPEAT. TALKING ABOUT LITTLE KID TITTIES IS OKAY. HOWEVER, POSTING PICTURES OF KIM KARDASHIANS FACE ON PORNO TITTIES, DESPITE THE FACT SHE HAS BARED THOSE FUCKERS PLENTY OF TIMES IS ILLEGAL.  I just want to know what’s going on here. Why is this abusive mod still allowed. Why is fake titties bad and dead people good. Why. Why. Why. Please tell me.

       Wouldn’t it make more sense to factor in harm done to a person? Like, pretending to be a kid and role playing is gross, unnerving, and feels morally wrong but it’s being done by two consenting adults in this case. Whereas, even if Kim Kardashian has willingly posted her nude body on the internet before, slapping her face almost indistinguishably on another body that is in the middle of a much more lewd act is using her likeness in a way she never consented to.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems kind of obvious why one is prohibited.

       There's nothing illegal about using a public figures likeness as long as you are not captialising on it.  Reddit banned deepfakes because reddit would technicaly be making money off of them.

       Somehow I doubt that’s the only scenario that would be illegal. If you were to use someone’s likeness in a picture of them eating babies and disseminated the image, even if it was free, I feel like they could take legal action to get you to stop.

       This isn't an issue of moral relativism. Two adult weirdos talking to each other hurts or affects nobody. 
Faking a picture of an actual person can hurt or adversely affect that person. How is this hard to understand?

       The dead people over fake titties is easy - the U.S. has always been prudish about sex but fine with violence. A bare breast or a few curse words will get your movie a R rating but watching people get killed left and right is fine with Parental Guidance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest of it isn't consistent, though. If they were just using the "child porn is not a victim-less crime" argument, they wouldn't have included the stuff about artwork. If they're going the "we don't want any of that content" route then they need to step the fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       My personal guess is that anything beyond actual live child porn is going to be ignored but the rule is there for them to take quick action if the MSM picks up on it.

       It's only confusing if you look at it as a moral decision. Even if you believe that the leaders of Reddit are pro-expression, that doesn't mean they'll sacrifice their business for it. They see deepfakes and the like as an open door for negative press and endless lawsuits, so they ban it, and that's all there is to it.
