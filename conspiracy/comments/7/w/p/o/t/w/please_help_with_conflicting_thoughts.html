        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’m a very curious person and I like to look at both sides of an argument when I do some research on whichever topic I get interested in. I’m not a conspiracy theorist however I am a very skeptic person.</p>

<p>I cannot help but look at Flat Earth content. Most of the FE community disparages the Moon Landing, NASA and SpaceX.</p>

<p>99% of me believes the Earth isn’t flat and that it’s such a ridiculous thought. But the other 1% has me doubting the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We are indoctrinated with the globe Earth which automatically creates a bias even when trying to look at things objectively</p></li>
<li><p>The FE content makes some valid points when you sift through all the absurdity (Flight paths, lack of circumnavigation data, etc..)</p></li>
<li><p>There is no conclusive way for an individual like me to verify that Earth is in fact round and be 100% sure (forget all the theories, the only way to 100% with absolute certainty verify it is if I was to fly far enough away from it and see it with my own eyes or if I somehow was able to rig up a weather balloon and flew high enough to capture footage and relay it down but unfortunately that’s not possible)</p></li>
<li><p>Government involvement in everything space related. SpaceX from what I understand mostly only executes government contracts which makes me believe there’s some shady stuff going on there. A lot of “what ifs”. Example, what if all the space programs are simply a way to funnel public money out to an elite group?</p></li>
<li><p>Is Elon just a government puppet that sold his soul also to get all this funding to save his failing companies at an early stage? </p></li>
<li><p>Then there’s double confliction, how can I believe that such large undercover operations are going on? There’s so many people involved things like this couldn’t be kept secret. You know why? Because of what Elon said himself: It looks so fake that it’s real. This exact sentence can be said about all these conspirational thoughts I have towards these subjects and that really fucks me up. It’s so unfathomable that the general population wouldn’t believe it, but it’s actually happening. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Then there’s subjects like the moon landing, mars rover, JFK murder, 9/11. It’s never ending. What is real, what isn’t.</p>

<p>I can go on and on with these doubts, but the one question I need an answer for is: </p>

<p>How can one, find the ABSOLUTE truth about such subjects and live without constant doubt. Theories don’t help, they aren’t 100% sources of truth, neither are photographs or videos since they can be CGI’d or tempered with. </p>

<p>Please don’t crucify me for this post. I just want to know how you guys approach these subjects.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

Flat Earth is there (by TPTB, imo) in order to create a &quot;with us or against us&quot; mentality, where if you question one, <em>you must believe the other.</em> However, the are many other theories that exist, and if you explore/believe those theories, you get lumped in with the Flat Earthers, all by design. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way is to educate yourself and observe for yourself as to whether the earth is flat or round. Otherwise, you&#39;re just going to have to take a side or be comfortable about it enough to accept that you don&#39;t really know. Maybe no one is right about anything.

    <div class="md"><p>That’s my exact issue. I’m unable to take a side as it makes me very uncomfortable mentally.

    <div class="md"><p>What is true today might not be true tomorrow. That&#39;s just how science is. I think we can say for certainty though that the Earth is round and who knows what else we may know about that in the future.</p>

<p>I think a big part of it for me is just seeing a future at all. You know, everyone is worried about all these conspiracies and flat earth and aliens and flashing lights and no one is really doing anything at all about simple things that are really going to make our future  bad or nonexistent and they aren&#39;t that out there or hard to believe yet no one is doing much about it and that&#39;s a real conspiracy to me above all others. That&#39;s what really wigs me out is well, I can&#39;t do anything about it and everyone else feels that way, too, and now it&#39;s all doomed. </p>

<p>Hang in there. Read some philosophy. Read on Reddit but don&#39;t get sucked in and hey, maybe even let it go of Reddit if that becomes the right move. Staying informed is good but you are probably like me and want to do more than that which is part of the anxiety and worries you are feeling. I&#39;m right there with you and if I knew what to do I&#39;d tell you. Just keep looking for the ways you can do something and teach. There are a lot of people who aren&#39;t open minded enough to talk about things like conspiracy at all but sometimes you can influence someone to think outside the box, even if in a general way, and that&#39;s good.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s better to not &quot;take a side&quot;, because at least you can realise that you simply don&#39;t have all the information so therefore you cannot come to an absolute definitive conclusion. Those who come to absolute conclusions and act so certain are usually more ignorant than they realise.<br/>
It&#39;s about staying open minded and open to the possibilities. For example, between flat earth and sphere earth: based on the evidence I&#39;ve personally seen so far I therefore currently believe that a spherical earth is far more likely than a flat earth. However, I don&#39;t <em>know</em> because I haven&#39;t personally seen the earth from space, but based on the evidence I put the probability of a flat earth much lower than the probability of a spherical one.<br/>
That being said, it&#39;s true that some flat earth arguments bring up interesting points that signal potentially fake space based missions. But why would these missions be fake in the first place? Well I don&#39;t see it as an either/or between flat and spherical earth. I see that as a distraction from the real reason: ufos, alien presence on earth and the moon, alien tech etc. I also see the whole flat earth v spherical earth debate as a distraction from other theories like hollow earth/hollow pocket earth.<br/>
Whenever something is presented as X v Y where it appears as though you have to choose one or the other, that&#39;s likely an oversimplification and/or distraction from alternative explanations closer to the truth. But also note that absolute truth is rare to come across, because it&#39;s very rare that we ever have all the information on something to be able to come to an absolute conclusion. Most &quot;truths&quot; are simply high likelihoods based on the evidence gathered that&#39;s pointed in that direction.<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain an idea without believing it.&quot;<br/>
Don&#39;t fall into the trap of thinking you have to come to absolute conclusions. Because then what happens in the future when you&#39;re presented with evidence that contradicts your perspective? Stay open. Explore <em>every</em> angle. Challenge ideas and be skeptical, sure, because that helps to either strengthen theories or find holes in them based on further analysis, but don&#39;t be dismissive and end up throwing out the baby with the bathwater.<br/>
I tend to use phrases when expressing my opinions like &quot;based on the evidence I&#39;ve personally seen so far, it appears to me as though...&quot; rather than making declarative statements like &quot;X is true&quot; or &quot;Y is false&quot;. I don&#39;t know that. I might <em>think</em> that, but I don&#39;t <em>know</em>.<br/>
&quot;The only thing I know is that I know nothing.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, let&#39;s go.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are indoctrinated with the globe Earth which automatically creates a bias even when trying to look at things objectively  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are taught. Just as you are taught to look both ways when you cross the road, or any other bit of basic info that everyone should know.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FE content makes some valid points when you sift through all the absurdity (Flight paths, lack of circumnavigation data, etc..)  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Flight paths are actually where it goes to die. Right <a href="https://www.expedia.com/lp/flights/jnb/syd/johannesburg-to-sydney">here</a> you can guy tickets for a flight from Johannesburg, South Africa to Sydney, Australia. On a round earth, that is an 8000 mile or so flight that takes you over the Indian Ocean. On a flat earth, that is a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/93KWdav.jpg">15,000+ mile flight</a> that takes you over Africa and Asia. Not only is that not where that flight takes you, but that is literally beyond the physical limits of a commercial aircraft.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no conclusive way for an individual like me to verify that Earth is in fact round and be 100% sure  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, you could buy a telescopic lens and watch things go over the horizon. You could also buy a plane ticket on a flight that goes unusually high. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmkbAql5_jU&amp;amp;">The curve is very apparent at 40,000ft.</a>  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Government involvement in everything space related. SpaceX from what I understand mostly only executes government contracts which makes me believe there’s some shady stuff going on there. A lot of “what ifs”. Example, what if all the space programs are simply a way to funnel public money out to an elite group?   </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, most things space related are extremely expensive, and there are all sorts of regulations involved.    </p>

<p>For example, rockets technically count as a special weapons technology, and thus there is all sorts of red tape with transparency, hiring, and all that shit.  </p>

<p>SpaceX does not execute mostly government contracts. Most of its flights (even more so recently) are private contracts for private satellites.  </p>

<p>&quot;What ifs&quot; are meaningless. You can always invent more &quot;what ifs&quot;.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can one, find the ABSOLUTE truth about such subjects and live without constant doubt. Theories don’t help, they aren’t 100% sources of truth, neither are photographs or videos since they can be CGI’d or tempered with.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean, you can go figure out if the earth is flat our not pretty easily.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re going to go insane if you spend your entire life worrying about every tiny little thing and whether it&#39;s true or not.</p>

<p>The horizon looks pretty flat in the main picture from the post you linked. I also watched the video amongst many other weather balloon videos trying to achieve the same goal and they unfortunately cannot go high enough. </p>

<p>That particular balloon only went 18 miles up while the theory is that you would need to be at least 62 miles up to observe the curvature of the Earth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Horizons are always FLAT.  A horizon can&#39;t be a thing other than FLAT. If a horizon wasn&#39;t flat, it wouldn&#39;t go all the way around and connect, which would make it not a horizon. A horizon is by definition flat. If you take a round orange, and slice a bit off, the edge of the slice is flat and circular, but it was made from a round orange. </p>

<p>Honestly, try to imagine a curved horizon. It&#39;s an impossibility. </p>

I recently started looking into it again and I remember all of the good points that Flat Earth arguments were making. I just watched a series on YouTube called Ball&#39;s Out Physics. It was an engineer who describes tackling the rotating earth problem and then coming to the conclusion that it is not possible according to physics. It&#39;s worth watching, especially if you have a high respect for appeals to science.</p>

I know a friend who is a really smart engineer who works for Boeing but he won&#39;t even consider the FE idea because of ego. The guy in the Ball&#39;s Out Physics show is also very intelligent but the difference between him and my friend is that he said he is very open-minded as a person and tried to disprove the Flat Earth, but found that he couldn&#39;t.

    <div class="md"><p>I know theories don&#39;t help but what if something can be two (or more) things at once and you don&#39;t have to choose? What if the Earth was both flat <em>and</em> round? If something flat and circular spins quickly enough it can be perceived as a sphere when it isn&#39;t actually. For example, you can take a quarter and spin it on a table or flat surface and there are points where it looks like a sphere and this is at very low speeds. If the Earth rotates as fast as proclaimed, then it would be feasible that it could actually be flat but appear as a globe. This could also explain the hollow Earth theory. If the Earth is flat and it spins as quickly as it does, it&#39;s possible that it would create a cylindrical or cone shaped gap in the center. I am not saying this is the case but perception would definitely play into this. </p>

<p>This right here is the problem and is the reason for the FE conspiracy in general. There are plenty of ways to scientifically prove a globe earth, and only those who don’t understand the science are left believing a flat earth is possible.</p>

<p>Look in just about any FE thread and you’ll find similar sentiments. Nearly all flat earthers for some reason think they “gotta see it with their own eyes”, and the reason is that they don’t understand the science and don’t want to take the time to learn.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You claim to call yourself a &quot;skeptic&quot;, but what exactly do you think it means to be one if not &quot;to doubt&quot; and to withhold judgement in the face of insufficient proof to unequivocally prove something one way or another <em>to your own satisfaction</em> or not recognise that the real truth about any particular proposition may not be simply be one or the other with some hypothetical bone of contention but something else, altogether? </p>

<p>If you really want to be skeptic you have to learn to live with that kind of doubt and uncertainty and recognise that it&#39;s better than believing in something that can&#39;t be completely proved because it or some part of it, more than likely happens to be wrong in some way, shape or form if not altogether wrong to begin with.</p>

<p>If you can&#39;t in all good conscience make up your mind because you&#39;re not convinced there&#39;s enough evidence to believe that something happens to be true, it&#39;s not actually going to make one bit of difference in your everyday life. It will go on just as it always has and your conscience and integrity will remain intact. So it depends on just how important you really consider those to be. It also helps to remember that the truth doesn&#39;t depend on any consensus of opinion. One person can, in fact be right about something that no one else has ever considered and it will take some doing and some time to finally convince them of it in the face of what they already decided to believe before that came along.</p>

<p>Now whether the world is flat or round, stationary and immovable or spinning 1,000 mph as it loops around the Sun at another 60,000 mph, it&#39;s still going to look exactly the same as it does to you and feel exactly the same under your feet. An experience you&#39;re entirely familiar with and all you can really trust with any degree of certainty and all you really need to when it comes right down to your everyday life and experience. </p>

<p>There is something else about that particular and peculiar debate that&#39;s rarely ever mentioned. The great astronomer Tycho Brahe believed in a geocentric model with the Earth in the centre with Sun going around it while all the other planets went around the Sun and he was able to accurately calculate and predict all of their motions and movements based on that model. </p>

<p>Upon his death, his protégé, Kepler, who had become enamoured with Copernicus&#39; idea of a heliocentric model took and applied Brahe&#39;s calculations to it and in order to make it work had to postulate that the orbits of all of the planets including the Earth had to be elliptical as they went around the Sun rather than circular around it as it circled the Earth as Brahe believed from all of his astronomical observations. </p>

<p>In short, you can use either one and you&#39;ll get exactly the same results... like two different roads can take you the very same amount of time to get you the same place. Is one of those roads really any &quot;truer&quot; or really any &quot;better&quot; to use in order to get there than the other in that case? </p>

<p>And what do we make of that no small fact that the nature and shape of Kepler&#39;s elliptical orbits could never have been arrived at without Brahe&#39;s calculations of them as being circular in his geocentric model that worked just fine in the first place? It&#39;s certainly wise to know that and equally wise to not fully commit to either. You may be told that there is more proof for Copernicus and Kepler but if you go looking for that proof you won&#39;t find it. It&#39;s a theory that works because the calculations work but so does Brahe&#39;s and they were his calculations before they were borrowed. LOL </p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is not way for you to gather direct evidence(actually seeing the curvature using your own means), however there are many indirect ways you can determine the earth is round.  Again you need to understand why the conclusions prove the result.  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FT_nzxtgXEw#t=28m38s">I would start with this.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Government involvement in everything space related. SpaceX from what I understand mostly only executes government contracts which makes me believe there’s some shady stuff going on there. A lot of “what ifs”. Example, what if all the space programs are simply a way to funnel public money out to an elite group?</p>

<p>SpaceX also launches satellites for private companies, but yes government/military have the most to gain with satellites in orbit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How can one, find the ABSOLUTE truth about such subjects and live without constant doubt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one is a tough one.  Questioning or doubting everything you are told, IMO is perfectly healthy.  In order to be sure about what you believe to be true, is to find that piece of evidence that convinces yourself, and that is pretty much all you need, just remember to keep an open mind when presented with new evidence.</p>

<p>Science reserves the right to be wrong, and that is its beauty.  It forms a conclusion based upon the current set of evidence it has at that time.  The conclusion may or may not be change when new evidence is presented.</p>

<p>Be wary of anyone or anything that has a predetermined conclusion and tries to force the evidence to fit their unchanging conclusion.</p>

<p>You also have to understand you may never know with 100% how true something especially when talking about historical events(JFK murder).  The people are NOT provided the full information, sometimes for good reason, sometimes it pure corruption.  Remember history is written by the winners not the losers, and most often it will be skewed as such.</p>

<p>Understand the differences between inductive and deductive reasoning.  While both can be useful, they are very different and can cause different conclusions.</p>

<p>One more final thing, it is very important to have a basic to advanced understanding of Math.  Most people think it is nothing but a manipulation of numbers and variables, but in reality it is the purest form of true logic.  It is THE Universal language.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>We are indoctrinated with the globe Earth which automatically creates a bias even when trying to look at things objectively</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Much in the same way we are indoctrinated that 2+2=4</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FE content makes some valid points when you sift through all the absurdity (Flight paths, lack of circumnavigation data, etc..)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ask questions and seek answers. </p>

<p>I guarantee you that an afternoon researching flight paths will show you that they make zero sense on a FE. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no conclusive way for an individual like me to verify that Earth is in fact round and be 100% sure (forget all the theories, the only way to 100% with absolute certainty verify it is if I was to fly far enough away from it and see it with my own eyes or if I somehow was able to rig up a weather balloon and flew high enough to capture footage and relay it down but unfortunately that’s not possible)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again a bit of research will tell us this isnt true. </p>

<p>You can make observations and see which model they work on. </p>

<p>For example check this site out</p>

<p><a href="https://takethisskepticalblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/how-to-disprove-the-flat-earth/">https://takethisskepticalblog.wordpress.com/2015/10/21/how-to-disprove-the-flat-earth/</a></p>

<p>It clearly shows you how to verify the shape of your planet. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Government involvement in everything space related. SpaceX from what I understand mostly only executes government contracts which makes me believe there’s some shady stuff going on there. A lot of “what ifs”. Example, what if all the space programs are simply a way to funnel public money out to an elite group?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thats a type of fallacy. Do you immediately disregard anything an authority says because they are an authority? </p>

<p>Do independent research outside of the authority. If your observations match theirs then you know it to be a truth. Just because you have the same result as a liar doesnt mean the result is bad. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is Elon just a government puppet that sold his soul also to get all this funding to save his failing companies at an early stage?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Since SpaceX lost money this quarter we know this isnt super likely. </p>

<p>tl;dr Do your own research </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the end of the day whether the earth is flat or spherical or pear shaped, it does not change the way you live on it. What deep down flat earthers are using the flat earth theory for, is to spread awareness of corruption and greed across the world and spread awareness of the crazy shit going down. Like mind control, propaganda, false flags, and CGI. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to develop a sense of explanation. I also think it is as valuable to prove the obvious as it is to discover the subtle.</p>

<p>If an upcoming Mars mission was going to be faked, would <a href="http://www.spacex.com/careers">www.spacex.com/careers</a> look like <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Gm5Hmvm.png">https://i.imgur.com/Gm5Hmvm.png</a> ?</p>

<p>If it was real, is that what you would expect?</p>

<p>An open mind that is truly seeking and a willingness to consider the view you don&#39;t want to believe as much as the one you do is a good start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Horizons are always FLAT.  A horizon can&#39;t be a thing other than FLAT. If a horizon wasn&#39;t flat, it wouldn&#39;t go all the way around and connect, which would make it not a horizon. A horizon is by definition flat. If you take a round orange, and slice a bit off, the edge of the slice is flat and circular, but it was made from a round orange. </p>

<p>Honestly, try to imagine a curved horizon. It&#39;s an impossibility. </p>
