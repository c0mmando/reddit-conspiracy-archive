<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Sam Harris, a neuroscientist and critic of religion writes, “Atheism is not a philosophy; it is not even a view of the world; it is simply an admission of the obvious. In fact, &#39;atheism&#39; is a term that should not even exist. No one needs to identify himself as a &#39;non-astrologer&#39; or a &#39;non-alchemist.&#39; We do not have words for people who doubt that Elvis is still alive or that aliens have traversed the galaxy only to molest ranchers and cattle. Atheism is nothing more than the noises reasonable people make in the presence of unjustified religious beliefs.” ― Sam Harris, Letter to a Christian Nation</p>

<p>That sounds reasonable, doesn’t it? </p>

<p><em>Alchemy</em></p>

<p>Sometime in your lifetime, you have probably heard about the ridiculousness of alchemy. According to Google, alchemy is “the medieval forerunner of chemistry, based on the supposed transformation of matter. It was concerned particularly with attempts to convert base metals into gold or to find a universal elixir.” What is wrong with that? Why was alchemy perceived as “unscientific” or “blasphemy”? No wonder many have turned to atheism. </p>

<p>Perhaps in your text books, there was a short section on alchemy, and quite simply, you moved on to the topic because it just did not fall into modern science. Your teachers did not care, and neither did you. </p>

<p>Upon further investigation, it is now clear that alchemy was not some ridiculous or superstitious form of science, but so much more. </p>

<p>In “Modern Alchemy and Occultism and the Emergence of Atomic Theory, Morrison writes, “Enlightenment attacks upon alchemy as unscientific superstition, or merely the foolish pursuit of the self-deluded, it is not clear that alchemy was scientifically and spiritually serious pursuit from antiquity to the Middle Ages, with roots in Egyptian metallurgy, Aristotelian philosophy of matter and form, and Jewish, Arabic, early Christians, and Hermetic sources.”</p>

<p>The origins of science are rooted in occultism and even “Magick.” This post is going to investigate misconceptions about the foundations of science, including alchemy, and the transition of science into modern Scientism. Further, this post will show how modern Scientism is actually linked to the occult, and how all of this really goes in cycles. There is nothing new under the sun, so to speak. This post, finally, will investigate, “magick” vs. “magic” and how you may, as I always write, may be deceived.</p>

<p>According to Morrison, “Stunning landmarks of atomic science occurred alongside the efflorescence of occultism.” </p>

<p>Whether you know it or not, the science and occult are not separate entities, and they may be linked more than ever when it comes to the modern worship of science. Perhaps the problem with modern atheism is that most fail to see the origins of science. </p>

<p><strong>The Origins of Science and Alchemy</strong></p>

<p>When most think of science, they think of logic and research. Rarely, does one today, associate science with mysticism or anything spiritual, unless we talk about quantum mechanics, but that will come later in this post. </p>

<p>Your science and history text books probably left out the fact that Isaac Newton was very interested in alchemy and the occult studies. </p>

<p>From Wikipedia:</p>

<p>“English physicist and mathematician Isaac Newton produced many works that would now be classified as occult studies. These works explored chronology, alchemy, and Biblical interpretation (especially of the Apocalypse). Newton&#39;s scientific work may have been of lesser personal importance to him, as he placed emphasis on rediscovering the occult wisdom of the ancients. In this sense, some[1] believe that any reference to a &quot;Newtonian Worldview&quot; as being purely mechanical in nature is somewhat inaccurate.”</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Newton%27s_occult_studies</a></p>

<p>In the early ages of science, alchemy and chemistry were indistinguishable. In fact, Isaac Newton  “practiced the art with a passion. Though he wrote over a million words on the subject, after his death in 1727, the Royal Society deemed that they were “not fit to be printed.” The papers were rediscovered in the middle of the twentieth century and most scholars now concede that Newton was first and foremost an alchemist.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.alchemylab.com/isaac_newton.htm">https://www.alchemylab.com/isaac_newton.htm</a></p>

<p>The point is that many of these “beloved” scientists have origins with the occult and alchemy. Is that really “science” as we understand it today? We will talk more about that later.</p>

<p>Now, what is so wrong with alchemy, you may ask? Well, according to Morrison, “Alchemy played a crucial role in the practice and beliefs of Hermetic societies, such as the now famous Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.” </p>

<p>With the wonders of the internet, we can read all about this Hermetic Order here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thenewchurchofsatan.com/docs/the%20complete%20golden%20dawn.pdf">http://www.thenewchurchofsatan.com/docs/the%20complete%20golden%20dawn.pdf</a></p>

<p>For the sake of this post though, let’s simplify. According to Google, “The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (Latin: Ordo Hermeticus Aurorae Aureae; or, more commonly, the Golden Dawn (Aurora Aurea)) was an organization devoted to the study and practice of the occult, metaphysics, and paranormal activities during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.”</p>

<p>So, we have many of the prominent founders of scientists directly influenced by the occult and this order. Isaac Newton is not alone. Here is the link to the known of alleged members:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn#Known_or_alleged_members">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermetic_Order_of_the_Golden_Dawn#Known_or_alleged_members</a></p>

<p>Let’s not forget that many of these prominent members were a part of the “Royal Society”, but that would likely be a whole other post.</p>

<p><strong>Transitions and Aleister Crowley</strong></p>

<p>Of course, the very well-known Satanist, Aleister Crowley, was a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, just as many of these “scientists” were. </p>

<p>According to Morrison, “By the 1920s, atomic physics and radio-chemistry were regularly called “modern alchemy’ in the press. 
Most ignore Crowley’s influence on modern science. In fact, most do not even know about it. I s</p>

<p>Not only was Crowley a member of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (like other scientists mentioned above), but Morrison reveals,</p>

<p>“<em>Moonchild</em> involves an experiment to incarnate the soul of a spirit being in a human baby. Crowley portrays the wedding of ancient magical practice to modern scientific canons of experimental accuracy and measurement. He explains occult phenomena, such as the existence of supernatural beings, by invoking new theories about atomic structure from particle physics.”*</p>

<p>So, believe it or not, Crowley had an influence of modern science. In fact, Morrison reveals that “the laws of magick are closely related to those of other physical sciences.”</p>

<p>It would take an entire book to explain this, so I am referencing an actual book on this matter if you are interested. All the information included in this section can be found from this source:&#39;
Morrisson, S. (2007). Modern alchemy: Occultism and the emergence of atomic theory. New York, New York: Oxford University Press.</p>

<p>To conclude, the origins of science may be more closely associated with alchemy, occultism, and even magic…</p>

<p><strong>Magic vs. Magick</strong></p>

<p>Not only are you deceived by text books, but you are likely deceived by pop culture “magicians.” When most think of magic today, they think of a card trick or “sawing a body in half” on live TV.</p>

<p>This is a problem. Now before we move on, from this point, we have to assume that “magick” hypothetically exists. What is magick?</p>

<p>“Magick, in the context of Aleister Crowley&#39;s Thelema, is a term used to show and differentiate the occult from performance magic and is defined as &quot;the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will&quot;, including both &quot;mundane&quot; acts of will as well as ritual magic. Crowley wrote that &quot;it is theoretically possible to cause in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature&quot;.[1] John Symonds and Kenneth Grant attach a deeper occult significance to this preference.[2]”
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Thelema)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Thelema)</a></p>

<p>For the purpose of this post, I am going to distinguish ‘magic’ from ‘magick’. When we think of magic, we think of performance acts that can be logically be explained. But, ‘magick’ may be real and have a deeper occult meaning.</p>

<p>Now, this post is going to get kind of strange, but I must share my experience with “magick” in this next section.</p>

<p><strong>Dimensional Jumping: Creepy Sidenote</strong></p>

<p>This is where things get weird, and I will be really surprised if this post is even read and not downvoted like crazy. There is to be a subreddit called <a href="/r/dimensionaljumping">/r/dimensionaljumping</a> that is now discontinued (I have conspiracies about that by the way…)</p>

<p>In the year 2015 I reached a level of depression I never had. I had no friends, no family, nothing. I had very little. I decided to do the “two cups method” listed on this subreddit in an attempt to gain friends. It worked.</p>

<p>I did overnight. For a year straight, I had gained friends and felt a superficial type of happiness. But here is the important part. It was superficial. It is hard to explain, but I got what I “wished” for, but it was all empty in the end.</p>

<p>Now, whether or not what came to me was due to “magick” is up to you, but I realized that this concept of “dimensional jumping” was nothing really more than magick, or an act of manipulating reality. </p>

<p>What I mean is if this was real, I somehow did manipulate my current existence, but it turned out empty.</p>

<p>I quickly posted to <a href="/r/dimensionaljumping">/r/dimensionaljumping</a> under the title similar to, “Isn’t this just magick?”</p>

<p>I was immediately downvoted, but somebody did argue with me. This was my conclusion:</p>

<p>Magick is evil because our intentions are inherently selfish.
You may here about white and black magick, but those are indistinguishable to me. Whenever we choose to participate in magick, no matter what title, our actions our inherently selfish.
Now, to think about my actions of making friends, there was a selfish intent behind it, I think. Magick is always impure because it involves selfishness.</p>

<p>This is an embarrassing segment for me to include, but I wanted to share it because I feel it is important.</p>

<p><strong>Magic vs. Magick: Pop Culture</strong></p>

<p>Now, most do not even know what dimensional jumping is, and when most think of magic, they might even think of Disney.
Disney has done a good job of desensitizing us to magic or magick. Most movies include some form of magic, after all.
There are many, many conspiracies that I cannot get into this post related to Disney, but I wanted to focus on the desensitization of magic and the association of magic with “good”. I am only talking about the Disney renditions here:</p>

<p><em>Cinderella</em> - The Fairy God Mother provides many good magical opportunities so Cinderella can find he true love and live happily ever after.</p>

<p><em>Snow White</em> - A magical kiss solves Snow White’s problem.
<em>Aladdin</em> - A magical Genie and a carpet ride helps Jasmine fall in love and solve her problems.</p>

<p><em>Beauty and the Beast</em> - Belle can only break the spell through magic.</p>

<p><em>The Little Mermaid</em> - Ariel, in a sense, sells her soul for her true love through magic. She breaks the spell.</p>

<p><em>Pinocchio</em> - This one is simply a story of magic, and through magic he becomes a real boy.</p>

<p><em>Fantasia</em> - I actually never watched this whole thing through, but is entirely based on magic.</p>

<p><em>Alice in Wonderland</em> - I can make an entire post about the occult significance of this movie if you are interested.</p>

<p><em>Peter Pan</em> - Does staying forever youthful sound magical to you?</p>

<p><em>Sleeping Beauty</em> -  Another one about the magic kiss.</p>

<p><em>Escape to Witch Mountain</em> - Does anybody remember this one being replayed constantly on Disney Channel on repeat?</p>

<p><em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em> - An occult magical adventure into darkness that most love.</p>

<p><em>Hocus Pocus</em> - Do I have to say anything here?</p>

<p><em>Pocahontas</em> You may ignore the magical elements in this move, but Grandmother Willow is a big one.</p>

<p><em>Toy Story</em> - The magic of toys coming to life</p>

<p><em>James and the Giant Peach</em> - Sadly, this is one of my favorites, but there is some dark, magical imagery here.</p>

<p>So, I have to stop here. What I am trying to show you is that magic is always painted as ‘good’ in Disney movies, and most of, if not all of us, have grown up deeply influenced by these movies. There are two options here:</p>

<p>• These movies make us think that magic is not real, and it is more a childish sort of thing.</p>

<p>• These movies make us see magic is inherently ‘good’ and we do not question anything that appears ‘magical’ in our lives.</p>

<p>I really want to consider those possiblities because magic is very rarely scene in Disney as bad.</p>

<p><strong>Modern Scientism</strong></p>

<p>Transitioning from Disney to modern Scientism is a little different, but there is one connection here. Most worship Disney and most worship modern science or scientists.</p>

<p>For many, Disney is a dream. Whether you want to take your kid to Disney Land or get married there, Disney is seen as some type of pure, magical realm that the modern citizen can access. Many have dreams of meeting their stereotypical prince or princess and getting married in a Disney-like castle. Disney has profoundly influenced our modern, magical fantasies.</p>

<p>At the same time, many have given up hope on that sort of thing. Many have given up anything spiritual or magical, and they have turned to science for the answers.</p>

<p>Today, scientists are the high priests, the Gods of society. Think about how science as scientists and scientific societies are worshipped.</p>

<p>There is literally scientific faith now:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/11/why-scientific-faith-isnt-the-same-as-religious-faith/417357/">https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/11/why-scientific-faith-isnt-the-same-as-religious-faith/417357/</a>
And there are now Satanic societies that embrace science/scientism:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/">http://www.pointofinquiry.org/peter_h_gilmore_science_and_satanism/</a></p>

<p>And the scientists themselves. Neil Degrasse Tyson says we are meaningless after all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.itworld.com/article/2714004/consumer-tech-science/science-wednesday--random-universe--life-is-meaningless.html">https://www.itworld.com/article/2714004/consumer-tech-science/science-wednesday--random-universe--life-is-meaningless.html</a></p>

<p>Now, please do not get me wrong. I am not dismissing science itself, but I am dismissing scientism: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.aaas.org/page/what-scientism">https://www.aaas.org/page/what-scientism</a></p>

<p>You can read more about it, but scientism seems to be that all is meaningless in this infinite universe. We are all one and nothing really matters.</p>

<p>Now, let’s stop for a moment. Is this related to anything else?</p>

<p><strong>Modern Scientific Occultism</strong></p>

<p>Now, here is the point. People have given up on God, but science sounds really nice and cool. What people may not be realizing is the connection between occultism and science in general.</p>

<p>Morrison writes, “The strategy of positioning an ancient wisdom as the future culmination of scientific progress was greatly intensified by some Golden Dawn members after the atomic discoveries of the century’s turn.”</p>

<p><strong>Connections</strong></p>

<p>So, how is this all connected?</p>

<p>• The foundations of science are strongly tied to the occult</p>

<p>• Modern science references those foundations in unique ways.</p>

<p>How?</p>

<p><strong>Quantum Occultism</strong></p>

<p>Have you heard the “all is one” and “all is love” and everything is “God manifesting itself into the universe?” Perhaps you are a victim of Quantum occultism.</p>

<p>Now, I am going to reference a post here, so before you debate me in the comments, read this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ov9ei/ancient_occultism_disguised_as_human_progress_and/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ov9ei/ancient_occultism_disguised_as_human_progress_and/</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, I want to say that most modern spirituality focuses on “the one” concept without bringing in the concept of evil.</p>

<p>The “we are all one” thing sounds so nice, and I agree with it to an extent. I agree with it when I say that we are all one under Christ.</p>

<p>However, the Tao and other facets of this dismiss evil. They paint good and bad as equal, and I simply do not agree.</p>

<p>We are all on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because we are asking, “Why is there evil the world?”</p>

<p>Yet these new age theories claim there is good and no evil in the world. Something seems wrong here.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Is there evil? This is my question that seems to break down modern new age/quantum occultism/religion. If there is evil, then maybe not all is “one” as these belief systems claim.</p>

<p>Deepak Chopra writes,</p>

<p>“New Age values are conscious evolution, a non-sectarian society, a non-military culture, global sharing, healing the environment, sustainable economies, self-determination, social justice, economic empowerment of the poor, love, compassion in action, going beyond religious fundamentalism, going beyond nationalism-extreme nationalism, culture.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/deepak_chopra_599964?src=t_new_age">https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/deepak_chopra_599964?src=t_new_age</a></p>

<p>Again, this dismisses the concept of evil. Evil exists, and that is why most of you are reading this post.</p>

<p>Ephesians 6:12 </p>

<p>For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places. </p>

<p>Perhaps you are being fooled by new age, one world religion, disguised as science as rationalism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, as always. In large agreement with most of it, and will just add my opinion on a couple of parts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Whether you know it or not, the science and occult are not separate entities, and they may be linked more than ever when it comes to the modern worship of science</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Psychology goes a long way towards explaining certain elements of magick- especially memetic magick.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Magick is evil because our intentions are inherently selfish. You may here about white and black magick, but those are indistinguishable to me. Whenever we choose to participate in magick, no matter what title, our actions our inherently selfish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe that magick can be dangerous, even when used for a &quot;benevolent&quot; purpose, but I don&#39;t believe that it is inherently evil. As you said- what makes magick problematic is the <em>human</em> aspect, not the magick itself. I feel that intent is important, but also target. One doesn&#39;t have to practice magick to benefit oneself, it can be done in the hopes of helping others. Of course altering the base nature of Reality is dangerous, but it can prove advantageous for others if practiced selflessly. Easier said than done, of course, but it&#39;s how I view it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most movies include some form of magic, after all. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The phrase &quot;movie magic&quot; comes to mind. I believe all movies are a form of magick- imbued with symbols both blatant and subliminal in an attempt to sway the thoughts and actions of the target audience. </p>

<p>I believe that even mundane seeming things- like a book, or music, or a symbol, can be magickal. They can be Willfully created with elements of the subconscious in an attempt to alter the subconscious state of another towards ones preferred actions. As such I believe that it can be used for ill or will, though often times for ill.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you heard the “all is one” and “all is love” and everything is “God manifesting itself into the universe?” Perhaps you are a victim of Quantum occultism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the trick with QM comes down to interperation. The Copenhagen interpertation is dominant but Einstein and De Broglie argued that QM isn&#39;t as mystical as one seems, and instead in favor of &quot;pilot wave&quot; theory which posits that QM is explainable if one had the proper information spanning the history of the Universe- impossible for a human to ascertain but possible given the correct circumstances. This demystifies QM a bit in my opinion. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the scores of books lining the shelves of New Age bookstores, there are instructions for guided meditation, creative visualizations, out of body experiences, getting in touch with your spirit guides, fortune telling by cards, crystal balls or the stars. What if Satanists reclaimed these for their own dark purposes and integrated them into rituals dedicated to the Devil, where they rightfully belong? New Agers have freely drawn upon all manner of Satanic material, adapting it to their own hypocritical purposes… But in truth, all ‘New Age’ labeling is, again, trying to play the Devil’s game without using His Infernal name. ”</p>

He didn’t even believe in Christianity so how was he a fucking satanist? The guy was ultra promiscuous which is why he was slandered by the moral authority. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crowley was definitely associated with the Occult which bears many negative connotations in many communities, but it was his self-affiliation with the title &quot;the beast&quot; as well as 666 that has allowed this image of Crowley as a Satanist to endure.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I agree, I don&#39;t think Crowley was a Satanist as most understand the term- he believe in his own religion, Thelema, do as thou wilt, and practiced magick towards that end. Still, to many, especially with Christian leanings, even this can be considered Satanic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The #s 3, 6, and 9, including 666 have had non satanic significance far before Christianity. Nothing wrong with Thelema or any other occult practice as long as you are in it for the right reason. Just like any other organized practice. I’m just tired of the Christian dominated narrative that has been pushed here for the last couple years. Christianity is one of the biggest fucking conspiracies ever conceived </p>

<p>That&#39;s what I was trying to explain...that what Crowley did can be interpreted as Satanism by various groups, even if it&#39;s not actually worshiping an idol to Satan, as most assume. Crowley has his fingers on the pulse of the modern Occult and it&#39;s important to understand him in order to understand the Occult and thus the driving ethos of the Elites. </p>

<p>This post is hitting home hard for me. I&#39;ve been researching a lot about the origins of the new age movement and the all is one and the one is all dogma, and I am certain we are being sold a pack of lies.  One cannot believe in a perfect God and also believe that all is one at the same time. All one needs to do is look around to see that this world is not perfect. </p>

<p>If you look through my post history you&#39;ll find all kinds of new age garbage. I was a great parrot. But the more I question these ideas the more they crumble. </p>

<p>Science has done an extraordinary job of removing God and then replacing God with pantheism. Through God&#39;s grace and the resurrection of Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit has lifted me up and filled my heart with love. </p>

<p>Thank you u/polkadotgirl for spreading the light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s just that I recently rediscovered zen buddhism and I feel that there is good in it, but still, it leads you to a state of servitude which can be easily exploited, like those cults that actually use buddhism for that purpose, and how it&#39;s also being used with that New Age bs.</p>

<p>The other thing that bothers me, is that buddhism is really similar to what the Secret Order believes, and wants to lead us to. All is one, we must serve to find purpose, etc...So, I&#39;m really puzzled and I&#39;m starting to feel like shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aww thanks for a genuine question. I actually used to be a Buddhist.</p>

<p>Sorry I am used to being attack.</p>

<p>My biggest problem with Buddhism is the emphasis on self. Let me explain.</p>

<p>1) In Buddhism, you get rid of the ego by meditating on the ego.</p>

<p>2) In Christ, you get rid of the ego by serving others.</p>

<p>I want to go with the latter in my life. I can expand on any of this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are right to some extent but I think you are misinterpreting Buddhisms focus on self. What I have found like many and that science is coming to finally realize is that every piece of the universe is a projection of the entire universe in of itself. That said when one meditates and focuses on healing the self, they are also healing others. Where one goes we all go. But the point of Buddhism I have found not to be focused on the self but to see past it. In fact some Buddhist monks have been so selfless as to have chants to take on people&#39;s Demons and pains for them and open up themselves to evil so no one else has to experience it.</p>

<p>Now that said I also disagree with the premise that &quot;All is one&quot; cannot be true with evil? Why must this be the case?</p>

Oneness doesn&#39;t dismiss evil or paint them as equal and reading the Tao Te Ching does not give that impression. I understand you are of a Christian subscription so you are entrenched in the dualistic perspective commonly described in Christian theology, but remember that the ultimate cause and origin is God and we all exist within God, and God exists within each of us, and that is unity at its core. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should cross pollinate your viewpoints among other crowds and see how they respond:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychonaut/comments/7n2tmv/do_good_and_evil_exist/">Do Good and Evil exist?</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychic/comments/7tyjzf/what_are_your_opinionsexperiences_on_things_like/">What are your opinions/experiences on things like Demons and hell?</a></p>

<p>Honestly there is just some confusion here about how and why we experience duality. In the end everything truly is one, because God is one. There is nothing that doesn&#39;t come from God its even nonsensical to think otherwise, even Satan and the Angels are understood to be creations of God.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re you&#39;re there is something pernicious about showing up to the plane of duality (The battlefield between good and evil for our souls) and saying &quot;oh well everything is one anyway, no big deal I&#39;ll just sit on the sidelines and not take sides&quot;. You don&#39;t transcend the battle of good and evil by ignoring it, ironically you have to completely throw yourself into it wholeheartedly. This is why the Bible literally starts with the story of how the knowledge of good and evil takes us out the garden and into this world.</p>

<p>I know you&#39;re point of view is submit to Christ or take a hike, but be aware even &quot;Eastern&quot; religion&#39;s have been smeared by this newage/materialist fake spirituality and you should check out things such as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9lKfgTuJc-0">Bhagavad Gita</a> where the characters are LITERALLY in a battlefield of good and evil. </p>

<p>The Bhagavad Gita has truth. There is a very minute percentage of people who do not need God in a way. They serve as monks, alone.</p>

<p>99 percent of us need a personal God.</p>

<p>Bhraman - universal God/consciousness. Most cannot access.</p>

<p>Krishna/Jehovah/etc. - most of us need personal fulfillment through God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, I like your post and the link between modern science and occultism is extremely interesting. In the future you may even want to mention Jeff Parsons if you get a chance if you want a really neat example of NASA and the occult being linked in an interesting way from the get go. </p>

<p>However, I think you&#39;re selling the cosmology and philosophy of Taoism more than just a little short. I guess that&#39;s sort of to be expected from someone who&#39;s gone all in on the whole Jesus saves angle, but that&#39;s my .02$</p>

<p>My own personal view could be very crudely simplified as there&#39;s good there&#39;s evil and there&#39;s Good which is it&#39;s own thing entirely and occupies a superior position to both and encompasses them in their totality, but whatever. While we&#39;re stuck down here personal view doesn&#39;t count for much until you either get a direct revelation, meaningless to anyone other than oneself, or punch your ticket and manage to get answers &#39;elsewhere&#39;(good luck relaying that information reliably back to others...).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I didn&#39;t read your entire post. I picked this post to ask my question because I thought it would be more accepting than many of the other I have seen. Since it&#39;s talking about the origins of &quot;magick&quot;.</p>

<p>I guess I picked wrong since it&#39;s a bout a &quot;magick&quot; vs &quot;science&quot; dichotomy.</p>

<p>Me and the now deleted comments talked about it before you got here. So we were right and the &quot;k&quot; really is because people are too damned damaged to be able to see the difference.</p>

<p>How people are not able to read the context clues for real and fake magic is beyond me. I don&#39;t see a reason for spelling things differently.</p>

<p>Sorry if I was presumptuous for asking a question. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really agree with your conclusions or the way you interpret certain beliefs but I Did read the whole thing.<br/>
One thing is that you say Taoists believe that good and evil are equal or that there is no evil. I think it&#39;s more that they believe that people can take actions that may be evil from some perspectives, but that there is no &quot;Evil&quot; that exists outside of the action. If I go run over kittens I don&#39;t think Taoists will respond with indifference, but they will not think that some &quot;Evil&quot; with a capital E is making me do it.<br/>
The thing is one of the big &quot;reasons&quot; atheists give for not believing in a god is that &quot;If God exists why is there such pain and suffering in the world?&quot; And the answer given is either &quot;original sin&quot; or &quot;the ruler of this world is Satan,&quot; or &quot;God works in mysterious ways and it&#39;s not for us to understand.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m not an atheist or a Christian. I believe in a higher intelligence that seems obvious to me but I don&#39;t think I can understand it well enough to try to explain it to anyone.<br/>
The dimensional jumping thing is interesting isn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t really agree that it&#39;s bad to try to focus your will on something. I think that most Christians believe in working hard and being rewarded. The difference is that they believe that what you want should be God&#39;s will or God&#39;s plan for you. Most prayers include a little clause about &quot;if it be your will.&quot;<br/>
So &quot;I&#39;m going to work overtime and put the extra money towards a down payment on a new car,&quot; isn&#39;t evil, but &quot;I&#39;m going to knock old ladies in the head and rob them so I can buy a new car,&quot; would be. I think that&#39;s how it works. Of course Christianity has many branches and they disagree on lots of things.<br/>
Anyway, I do believe in that higher consciousness in the universe, and when people ask if I believe in &quot;God&quot; I say I do. I don&#39;t specify that I might not believe in the same version they do.<br/>
I think that is the point of the story of the Tower of Babel. They wanted to build a tower to Heaven and so God made them all speak different languages. To me that&#39;s a perfect analogy for trying to discuss religious beliefs with people.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you have a blog but maybe you should and divide this into sections. There is a lot to discuss but it&#39;s almost too much to dive in to.<br/>
I was going to say I have used dimensional jumping, too but I used it for really small purposes. Once I was waiting to get paid by a client and needed the cash. It did work right away. Maybe they were going to pay me anyway. I have thought of using it for something bigger but I feel like it might have other consequences like the &quot;Tale of the Monkey&#39;s Paw.&quot;<br/>
So now that I sound completely insane... hahaha</p>

<p>The list of alleged or actual members of the hermetic order that you linked contained not a <em>single</em> scientist, the list being largely populated with authors, actors, and poets. You have not in any meaningful way established the link between the foundations of science and occultism--cherrypicking Newton is not indicative of some grand conspiracy stretching through centuries wherein scientists seek to lead people unknowingly into the mystical occult. Prior to this past century, almost all scientists (Newton included) were deeply religious, citing their belief and wonder in the Christian God and his creation as major catalysts in driving their studies. Newton is, I&#39;m sure, not alone as a scientist with interest in the occult, but you have failed to supply a single example of another foundational scientist like him. Anecdotally, his involvement with alchemy is not well hidden from the scientific world or some big secret that &quot;they&quot; don&#39;t want getting out --it&#39;s been mentioned in every single book I&#39;ve read about him (typical history of science/physics books), and quite a few of my peers are aware of his dual interests.</p>

<p>Are you claiming that there is some kind of metaphysical link between Newtonian mechanics and Newton&#39;s own study of the occult, which occurred years after publishing the <em>Principia</em>? Modern science avoids use of Newton&#39;s alchemy while retaining his mechanics much in the same way that we&#39;re able to enjoy Tchaikovsky and not molest boys, or drive Ford vehicles but not believe in eugenics. I&#39;m really seriously confused how you think Newton&#39;s interests somehow tainted his contributions to science in a metaphysically significant way.</p>

<p>Second, Disney does not only portray magic as a good thing. Quite the opposite, I&#39;d say--both heroes and villains use magic to pursue their aims. Magic is seen as something incredibly powerful above all else in Disney, but how you choose to use that power is what distinguishes the good guys from the bad guys so to speak. More often than not, the magic used by the good guys is somehow redemptive, overcoming some evil which was introduced by magic as well.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m just as disillusioned with modern Scientism as anyone else on this sib</p>

<p>I understand that, but your argument was that Disney portrays magic as a good thing.

    <div class="md"><p>My comment on your post on r/conspiracyundone copy/pasted:</p>

<p>Again, I really love this post.  :)</p>

<p>I disagree with the quote about atheism simply being an admission of the obvious.  Much of atheism is built upon theory meaning it is unproven.  Also, most are unaware of the vastness of the conspiracy of the powers that be in both power, control, and duration over thousands of years.  Knowing this opens the door to all sorts of new possibilities.</p>

<p>I liked how you pointed out how alchemy is glossed over in school.  I believe there is a reason they omit things like the fact that Issac Newton was an alchemist.  Alchemy is very closely linked with spirituality.  Not only do alchemists seek to transmute one material into another, they also try to transmute their spirit to a higher level of consciousness.  I also think alchemy is very closely linked to magick.  One example of this in pop culture is Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone.</p>

<p>The New Age movement connects ancient &quot;wisdom&quot; with modern day science.  Scientism is a popular &quot;religion&quot; in the United States as it is what public school teaches.  I think the New Age movement is alluring because it is a form of spirituality that matches well with what we were indoctrinated in school and pop culture with.</p>

<p>Socrates said himself he was a mystic.</p>

<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/%22The_School_of_Athens%22_by_Raffaello_Sanzio_da_Urbino.jpg/1200px-%22The_School_of_Athens%22_by_Raffaello_Sanzio_da_Urbino.jpg">The School of Athens by Raphael - As Above, So Below.  Plato is on the left with his right hand pointing up.</a></p>

<p>Manly P. Hall wrote that Plato attended the mystery schools.</p>

<p>&quot;The Invisible College has been described as a precursor group to the Royal Society of London.  The concept of &quot;invisible college&quot; is mentioned in German Rosicrucian pamphlets in the early 17th century.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_College">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_College</a></p>

<p>&quot;The idea of such an order, exemplified by the network of astronomers, professors, mathematicians, and natural philosophers in 16th-century Europe promoted by such men as Johannes Kepler, Georg Joachim Rheticus, John Dee and Tycho Brahe, gave rise to the Invisible College.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosicrucianism</a></p>

<p>Pythagoras was initiated into many mystery schools.</p>

<p>That is just scratching the surface.  In ancient times, only those initiated into the mysteries were taught to read and write.  They disguised esoteric meaning with an exoteric meaning for the uninitiated.</p>

<p>I am glad you brought up the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.  I almost never hear that get brought up but I think it is worth knowing about.</p>

<p>You did a great job explaining magic vs. magick for people who are new to the subject.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know the emptiest you ever felt was just three years ago.  It must have been incredibly hard for you with no friends or family there for you and dealing with your past and the pressures and emotional drain of you being a teacher.  Now you have so many people here who are your friend.  :)</p>

<p>I have never heard of the &quot;two cups method&quot;.  Of all of the things to wish for, friends...that makes me really sad.  You are such a great friend.  People have been missing out on how great of a friend you are.  I believe that the strongest friendships are made when both have their heart in the right place.  Magick is a manipulation.</p>

<p>I totally agree with you that Disney includes white and black magick concepts in their films.  Considering how much control Disney has over the media, it is definitely worth noting.  I liked your points about why you think Disney does this and its impact on us.</p>

<p>Good point and transition with how many worship Disney just as many worship science.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, scientists are the high priests, the Gods of society.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would say that they were the high priests and &quot;gods&quot; of society in the ancient past as well.  ;)</p>

<p>People are fed scientism so much that they willingly choose a belief system that tells them that everything is meaningless.  I used to be one of those people.</p>

<p>The quote that caught my attention the most was this one:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“The strategy of positioning an ancient wisdom as the future culmination of scientific progress was greatly intensified by some Golden Dawn members after the atomic discoveries of the century’s turn.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Could it be that scientism is being crafted to eventually make the ancient religions of the world come together as one?  I personally believe that there is a plan to bring about a one world religion where the religions of the world come together as one; just as the Bible foretells in my opinion.</p>

<p>I believe we were created by one, God, but we are not all God.  I also believe we have free will to choose between good or evil.</p>

<p>The Ephesians verse is a very important one for me.  Sometimes, I have to remind myself who the true enemy is.  The Bible teaches us to choose good and struggle against evil.</p>

<p>The amount of time you put into this post really shows in its content.  I thank you for devoting so much effort to it.  I hope writing it offered you some solace.  :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Polkadotgirl, I would be interested in hearing your thoughts on this subject viewed through the lens of Zoroastrianism rather than through Christianity.</p>

<p>In case you have no background in it whatsoever:</p>

<p>In Zoroastrianism, the question of &quot;Why is there evil in the world&quot; is answered: There is God and there is his opposite.  Abrahamic religions say that God is all powerful (and I think this is a bad thing, because how much grief is amplified by someone coming up and saying &quot;yeah, this misery you&#39;re experiencing?  All God&#39;s plan, suck it up pawn!&quot;).  However Zoroastrianism puts the equivalents of &quot;God&quot; and &quot;Satan&quot; as equally matched opponents who tussle it out here constantly.  Good flows from &quot;God&quot; and bad flows from &quot;Satan.&quot;</p>

<p>Zoroastrians have an almost untranslatable concept called &quot;Druj&quot; which might be summarized as &quot;doing unjust things attracts unjust things.&quot;  IMO this concept is actually testable, though it&#39;s hard to perceive because an unjust event could be perceived as good or evil-- getting a lot of pay for little investment is &quot;druj&quot; but so would be getting little pay for lots of investment.</p>

<p>Anyway... I feel that the question of &quot;why evil&quot; is answered badly in Abrahamic religions (perhaps even purposely so, in order to cause people to grow angry at God or reject order/justice in favor of nihilism).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really good question.</p>

<p>I think the problem with this is very few have experienced true evil. Once I did, I could not fathom any belief system that &quot;justified&quot; evil or as some sort of balanced system.</p>

<p>I feel the world is growing increasingly evil daily too. Christianity says that evil is bad not necessary.</p>

<p>If you really want to hear all my thoughts, I did write a post just about evil!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thought provoking post as always. Perhaps your experience with evil led you down this path to everyone having this discussion right now.</p>

<p>In regards to good and evil being equal, this may be true as say 1 and - 1 are equal in their magnitude. Two different people with the same magnitude of goodness and evil can perhaps have a similar magnitude of effect on another person.</p>

<p>I also believe that contrast is necessary, otherwise how can we tell the difference? We won&#39;t have a choice otherwise.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also been feeling off lately - try to have a good week, this will pass. </p>

<p>Somehow i don&#39;t think so, i think there is no natural evil in this 3D reality. However, there is some artificial evil that is trying to tip the natural scale a bit. And even this artificial evil is from the same source as us, so it might not be evil at all a couple dimensions up.</p>

<p>&quot;Spiritual&quot;, &quot;awake&quot;, &quot;enlightend&quot; or what ever you call it is to me not denying evil, it is recognising what it is and what role it plays in our existance on all levels of consiousness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh nice. Here&#39;s another Anton Levay quote. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;In the scores of books lining the shelves of New Age bookstores, there are instructions for guided meditation, creative visualizations, out of body experiences, getting in touch with your spirit guides, fortune telling by cards, crystal balls or the stars. What if Satanists reclaimed these for their own dark purposes and integrated them into rituals dedicated to the Devil, where they rightfully belong? New Agers have freely drawn upon all manner of Satanic material, adapting it to their own hypocritical purposes… But in truth, all ‘New Age’ labeling is, again, trying to play the Devil’s game without using His Infernal name. ”</p>
