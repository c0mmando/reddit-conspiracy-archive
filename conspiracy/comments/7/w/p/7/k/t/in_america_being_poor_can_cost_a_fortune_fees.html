       The credit scoring industry, along with banks and insurance companies, also does its part to keep the poor in poverty. Lower-income earners are more likely to have lower credit scores, which can inhibit oneâ€™s ability to purchase auto insurance, rent an apartment and even secure a job.

       Apparently this bill will allow payday lenders to skirt state consumer protection laws if they do the loans through a national bank, and can have APR's of up to 380%.  It's fucking nuts:

       Similar to the old saying "The poor pay twice". A wealthy person can afford (for example) a good pair of shoes that won't wear down and might last for years. When a poor person is living paycheck to paycheck then they have to buy the cheapest available which might only last 6 months. They don't have any wriggle room to save for quality purchases. Same thing with cars or household goods etc.

       That article is a bit misleading, but, yeah... you can thank Socialism for that. The US is a Socialist country, and has been since the creation of central economic planning via the Federal Reserve. Both "conservatives" and "liberals" in the US are Socialist, but do not even know it. The brainwashing has worked wondrously on the American people.

       Per the definition(s):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Any of various theories or systems of social organization in which the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or
        <strong>
         by a centralized government that often plans and controls the economy.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That last bit fits the US, very well, per the Federal Reserve (ie. central economic planning). If we want to go to "Marx":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The stage in Marxist-Leninist theory

        </strong>

       Last I checked, the government doesn't produce and distribute even the majority of goods in the US, much less all of them.

       Marxist/Socialism is purposely vague and double meaning, by design. Furthermore, if you need a SSN or BIN to be employed or employe, then, yes... the government dos control the production and distribution of goods in the US, via statutes, code, and regulation. It's a quasi (Frankenstein) mix of Marxism/Socialism/Fascism. The main pillar behind Marxism/Socialism is central economic planning, though. Which we have, via the Federal Reserve.

       The existence of an SSN doesn't give the government any say in what gets produced. There are laws that restrict what can be sold and how stuff can be made/sold, but that's missing the point entirely: The means of production and distribution belong to private individuals, and almost the entire market runs like that. Government contracts for instance don't mean that the government own the companies they're paying, it's strictly not government owned because they're handing the money over in exchange for already produced goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you can say the main pillar is planning all you want, but with private ownership of the means of production there can be no socialist/communist style planning, just planning that exists in a market environment.

       That doesn't mean anything unless the government forces you to make something specific. You're free to pursue whatever job you'd like, or no job at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's address the real issue though: If the government owns the means of production, someone can't just decide to start up their own business doing what they want because in a government run system, the government has ownership of everything required to properly run production. In our current system, I can start a business and purchase machinery or land I might need. Is there regulation? Sure. But (aside from certain cases) I'm not buying it from the government. The government can deny me some sort of proper certification due to meeting some standards but that's on me. What they can't do is deny me the ability to start production of something I want because it's not in their plans. And the lack of that is what should tell you we don't live under socialism, communism, or any collective ownership system.

       For one, the central govt. has very loose control and planning of the economy.  For two, "the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government" is the definition of socialism.  The centralized government might be a feature of a socialist economy, it is not, but in either case, it is not the definition.

       I am aware of that fact.  That is one aspect that the Government controls, kinda.  The Federal Reserve is as much a private enterprise as it is a Government one.  However, that's still only one aspect of the economy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Zoning laws are actually a far bigger way the Government "controls" the economy, as is regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even still, the Government doesn't tell companies how much product they're allowed to produce.  It also doesn't force companies to produce certain goods that the Government thinks is in the best interest of the citizenry.  Those are the types of contol and planning that are hallmarks of Communist countries.

       First and foremost, the US is a Corporation. Furthermore, for the rest of what you said, regulations and bail outs would like a word with you. The government does control what is produced, how much, and of what. It's not a free market. If we had a free market, I wouldn't be arrested for selling moonshine.

       No, what you're arguing for is pure capitalism, and you're arguing that the U.S. is pure socialism.  These things lie at two ends of a spectrum.  I freely admit that we have some socialist aspects to our economy, but if you look at it on the spectrum, it's far more capitalist than socialist, and it's among the most capitalist countries in the industrialized world.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for the record, pure capitalism would destroy our country as surely as pure socialism would.

       Let's imagine your pure free market.  No police.  If you want protection from thugs, gangs, etc., you have to hire private security.  Fire department only fights fires if you pay their monthly fee for access.  All paved roads are toll roads.  You see how civil society would break down, right?

       Again, the Federal Reserve is as much a private business as it is a Government agency.  And yes, the currency supply is planned by the Federal Reserve.  The currency does not make up the whole of our economy.

       Are they in major appliances? Big screen TVs? Desks and tables? These are also items rented out by the rental companies.  My point still stands, there is a huge element of peopleâ€™s ignorance of (or unwillingness to) managing money that allow these companies to exist, not just people being poor.

       Oh I wasn't disputing that point. Those companies prey on poor people who lack critical thinking skills. I was just saying that bed bugs can be found in pretty much any furniture....they're dastardly little bastards as they can lay dormant for 9+ months if they don't have a regular food source, just waiting for someone tasty to come by.

       Walmart was cashing payday checks for $5 a pop a few years ago. Also, banks (at least in my State and I think it is national) are required to cash a check issued by their bank for cash, with no fee, regardless of the amount. It usually resulted in a 20 min argument, but my friend cashed his pay checks at WellsFargo every 2 weeks for 3 years without an account.  You can also disable overdraft at banks so your card will just be declined instead of over draft.

       In WA, they can refuse to cash a check even from their bank. 
Wal-Mart will still cash your check but I think it's  $10 or 2% whatever is higher.
You can disable overdraft fees on debt purchases, credit and direct from account services like PayPal can still hit you with a fee.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why I use credit unions. No minimum balance, no minimum monthly deposit, and no monthly fees.

Sow a seed of $200 right now, all major credit cards accepted, and you will reap a bountiful harvest repayed 7 fold. Hallelujah! God wants me to have a 2nd private jet! He told me so! Hallelujah!

       Decades ago, I had a friend who worked for MC.  He said that they were constantly being tasked to come up with more ways to entice people to get credit cards.  The plan at its conception was to hook people into a bigger and bigger lifestyle (enter reality tv, etc) and then once people were inextricably sunk in debt, pull the plug.

       Parasites are numerous in our world. Usually small in size compared to their host. They stay small and hidden in or on top of the host somewhere sucking it slowly. Feeding and living from the host.
      </p>
      <p>
       In human society there are also parasites. With a big EXCEPTION. They
are not small nor are they outnumbering the hard working productive hosts they suck so hard. They are BIG, huge. They have many, many 'straws' stuck into every part of the hosts existence. They tell their hosts to keep working hard,that they are doing this to help them hosts. And because hosts are so docile and stupid (from work and worry you don't get more intelligent over time)  they continue supporting their blood sucking fat ass parasites even though they know deep down that in every aspect of their life they are constantly being fucked!

       Lifetime income and the ability to successfully navigate one's way out of poverty are strongly correlated with IQ, and I wholeheartedly believe that the current systems were designed with that in mind. One must either be of above average intelligence, or damn lucky, to escape the poverty trap.

       We just moved to a fairly wealthy  "gated community ", we do not have much money ourselfs but it was a great opportunity for us. It turns out that many services are cheaper for the residents. Just had our propane tank filled for $2.89 a gallon, outsiders of the gate it's $4.20 a gallon. Also residents get a huge discount at the local paint supply store.

       There are industries dedicated to exploiting the poor. Credit card and lending businesses, prisons, police stations, court houses, etc. It is by design.

       You're skipping the most important point though
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        in which the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Last I checked, the government doesn't produce and distribute even the majority of goods in the US, much less all of them.

       For one, the central govt. has very loose control and planning of the economy.  For two, "the means of producing and distributing goods is owned collectively or by a centralized government" is the definition of socialism.  The centralized government might be a feature of a socialist economy, it is not, but in either case, it is not the definition.

       There is no Socialism lite, as per Marx. The US is a Socialist country, which is the stepping stone from Capitalism to Communism. Basic definition.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        it's far more capitalist than socialist

       How? The currency/economy is planned centrally by the Federal Reserve. That is Socialism. Just because the US is shit, does not mean you can cry: "No true Socialism".

       If you're wealthy enough, you don't even have to pay for stuff.  Companies want you to be seen using their products.  It's cheap advertising on their part.
