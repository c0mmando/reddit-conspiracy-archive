Last time I asked you your favorite or most believable conspiracies, this I want the exact opposite. Which theory out there do you believe to have no basis in reality or fact and just find completely unbelievable? I loved the discussion everyone had last time, and I hope to see more this time around.
Thank you for your consideration once again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is some deep stuff linked to biblical texts, hyroglifics and lots of other things. But here we go. Let&#39;s begin with quantum computers. It is claimed that the only thing a quantum computer does is make contact to parralel states and universes. And that the PC itself is build up like an altar/temple. Explained here:
<a href="http://defeatingthebeast.com/quantum-computing-sciences-new-ouija-board/">http://defeatingthebeast.com/quantum-computing-sciences-new-ouija-board/</a></p>

<p>Then we go into CERN. The claim is that CERN can produce strangelets. Strangelets should be the most stably matter and all other matter is unstable and so it attracks that other matter. This would be comparable to the forming of a neutron star. Now the next thing is that it is build at Saint-Genus-Poilly which would be a differentiaded name of Appolliacum. Temple to Appollo. Romans at that time used to believe there was a gateway to the underworld there. To put 2+2 together. CERN would be made to open the portal to another dimension.</p>

<p>Then the connections with history.
 These type of events have been recorded/written about all over history. The mentionings of portals to underworlds/heavens are all over the place.</p>

<p>Im not well read into this stuff, because I just think this is way to much. You should google this stuff for yourself honestly if you&#39;re interested.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you watched any footage of space walks? They always show bubbles coming off the astronauts. It only makes sense when you consider the fact that astronauts on Earth train underwater and that what you are seeing is them doing so, but the background of the pool is replaced digitally with a CGI clip of &quot;space.&quot; It&#39;s kind of like a court trial where NASA is on the stand testifying that they&#39;ve gone to space and then the lawyer for the opposing team drills NASA about their usage of computer generated imagery and their techniques for practicing on Earth. Then the final question is, &quot;can this supposed spacewalk footage be replicated using a combination of the aforementioned tactics?&quot; NASA would stammer &quot;well...technically yes&quot; and then the lawyer says no further questions and walks away. If it&#39;s possible for them to show you manipulated images, then you should never trust what you see on a screen. Even now technology is advancing so fast that holograms can fool our actual eyes. We no longer need a hard medium to display the fakery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe those weren&#39;t filmed with the technique I described--underwater in combination with digital manipulation. If you&#39;re talking about walking on the moon, I saw a video where someone shows a pic of Buzz Aldrin on the big island of Hawaii and they superimpose the pic over a pic from the moon landing and you can see the exact same shape of the mountain range in the background. They align perfectly over one another. It&#39;s unnerving.</p>

<p>I remember some tv from the time being broadcast like this, but not the moon landing. I have a vague memory of a kid&#39;s show with a puppet dressed like a cowboy, framed on someone&#39;s tv screen and rebroadcast. </p>

<p>Lost/taped over wasn&#39;t only the moon mission, that happened a lot. You can&#39;t tape over reel-to-reel, it&#39;s like film negatives. The earliest equipment we could &quot;tape over&quot; was VCR/Beta, and that was available mid 80&#39;s(possibly sooner for tv Broadcasters). </p>

<p>One conspiracy theory which I know to be absolute baloney is that Russia is trying to &#39;interfere&#39; with elections in the USA.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the original post.  </p>

<p>You can question my intelligence all you&#39;d like but my response is quite appropriate to that post.  There&#39;s a lot more information out there which I won&#39;t quote here because you&#39;ll bring out all the clichés about sources you don&#39;t trust, etc.. </p>

<p>If you know anything about the history of the US, Britain, France, Germany, Russia nee USSR, China, etc. and their involvement in foreign elections it should come as absolutely no surprise that they attempted to have influence in this election.  Especially because Hillary Clinton seemed to have a big hard-on for Putin as he stood in her way of completely reconfiguring the oil rich countries in the Middle East.</p>

<p>Having said all this, I don&#39;t think Russia was overly successful.  I think Trump would&#39;ve won anyhow.  But to think they didn&#39;t try to influence the election is simply naive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They could have, but there’s no credible evidence they did. </p>

<p>You’re right though. Russia has certainly influenced US politics in the past; they donated $142 million to the Clinton Foundation in exchange for 20% of US uranium. And around the same time they paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for one speech. Spending petty cash on Facebook ads just doesn’t seem like their forte. </p>

<p>lig: to bind, ie ligature </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligature_(medicine)</a></p>

<p>so basically religion is &quot;to re-bind&quot; (with your creator) </p>

<p>yes organized religion has caused many problems, such as the inquisition</p>

<p>but individual spirituality is different</p>

<p>&quot;peace comes from within, do not seek it without&quot; ~ The Buddha</p>

<p>so i sought Peace, and i found God</p>

<p>and when i found God, i saw that Love is the answer</p>

<p>i know it sounds like some new-age hippie bullshit</p>

<p>as for bigotry, i have tried for many years to never use the word &quot;hate&quot;, and if i do catch myself hearing, thinking, or saying the word &quot;hate&quot; i try to stop myself and switch my mind to love</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the morning of September 11, 2001, 19 men armed with boxcutters directed by a man on dialysis in a cave fortress halfway around the world using a satellite phone and a laptop directed the most sophisticated penetration of the most heavily-defended airspace in the world, overpowering the passengers and the military combat-trained pilots on 4 commercial aircraft before flying those planes wildly off course for over an hour without being molested by a single fighter interceptor.</p>

<p>These 19 hijackers, devout religious fundamentalists who liked to drink alcohol, snort cocaine, and live with pink-haired strippers, managed to knock down 3 buildings with 2 planes in New York, while in Washington a pilot who couldn’t handle a single engine Cessna was able to fly a 757 in an 8,000 foot descending 270 degree corskscrew turn to come exactly level with the ground, hitting the Pentagon in the budget analyst office where DoD staffers were working on the mystery of the 2.3 trillion dollars that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld had announced “missing” from the Pentagon’s coffers in a press conference the day before, on September 10, 2001.</p>

<p>Luckily, the news anchors knew who did it within minutes, the pundits knew within hours, the Administration knew within the day, and the evidence literally fell into the FBI’s lap. But for some reason a bunch of crazy conspiracy theorists demanded an investigation into the greatest attack on American soil in history.</p>

<p>The investigation was delayed, underfunded, set up to fail, a conflict of interest and a cover upfrom start to finish. It was based on testimonyextracted through torture, the records of which were destroyed. It failed to mention the existence of WTC7, Able Danger, Ptech, Sibel Edmonds, OBL and the CIA, and the drills of hijacked aircraft being flown into buildings that were being simulated at the precise same time that those events were actually happening. It was lied to by the Pentagon, the CIA, the Bush Administration and as for Bush and Cheney…well, no one knows what they told it because they testified in secret, off the record, not under oath and behind closed doors. It didn’t bother to look at who funded the attacks because that question is of “little practical significance“. Still, the 9/11 Commission did brilliantly, answering all of the questions the public had (except most of the victims’ family members’ questions) and pinned blame on all the people responsible (although no one so much as lost their job), determining the attacks were “a failure of imagination” because “I don’t think anyone could envision flying airplanes into buildings ” except the Pentagon and FEMA and NORAD and the NRO.</p>

<p>The DIA destroyed 2.5 TB of data on Able Danger, but that’s OK because it probably wasn’t important.</p>

<p>The SEC destroyed their records on the investigation into the insider trading before the attacks, but that’s OK because destroying the records of the largest investigation in SEC history is just part of routine record keeping.</p>

<p>NIST has classified the data that they used for their model of WTC7’s collapse, but that’s OK because knowing how they made their model of that collapse would “jeopardize public safety“.</p>

<p>The FBI has argued that all material related to their investigation of 9/11 should be kept secret from the public, but that’s OK because the FBI probably has nothing to hide.</p>

<p>This man never existed, nor is anything he had to say worthy of your attention, and if you say otherwise you are a paranoid conspiracy theorist and deserve to be shunned by all of humanity. Likewise him, him, him, and her. (and her and her and him).</p>

<p>Osama Bin Laden lived in a cave fortress in the hills of Afghanistan, but somehow got away. Then he was hiding out in Tora Bora but somehow got away. Then he lived in Abottabad for years, taunting the most comprehensive intelligence dragnet employing the most sophisticated technology in the history of the world for 10 years, releasing video after video with complete impunity (and getting younger and younger as he did so), before finally being found in a daring SEAL team raid which wasn’t recorded on video, in which he didn’t resist or use his wife as a human shield, and in which these crack special forces operatives panicked and killed this unarmed man, supposedly the best source of intelligence about those dastardly terrorists on the planet. Then they dumped his body in the ocean before telling anyone about it. Then a couple dozen of that team’s members died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan.</p>

<p>This is the story of 9/11, brought to you by the media which told you the hard truths about JFKand incubator babies and mobile production facilities and the rescue of Jessica Lynch.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about this story…you are a batshit, paranoid, tinfoil, dog-abusing baby-hater and will be reviled by everyone. If you love your country and/or freedom, happiness, rainbows, rock and roll, puppy dogs, apple pie and your grandma, you will never ever express doubts about any part of this story to anyone. Ever.</p>

<p>I remember some tv from the time being broadcast like this, but not the moon landing. I have a vague memory of a kid&#39;s show with a puppet dressed like a cowboy, framed on someone&#39;s tv screen and rebroadcast. </p>

<p>Lost/taped over wasn&#39;t only the moon mission, that happened a lot. You can&#39;t tape over reel-to-reel, it&#39;s like film negatives. The earliest equipment we could &quot;tape over&quot; was VCR/Beta, and that was available mid 80&#39;s(possibly sooner for tv Broadcasters). </p>
