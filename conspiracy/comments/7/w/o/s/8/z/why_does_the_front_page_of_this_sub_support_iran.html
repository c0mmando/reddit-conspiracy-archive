I really just wanted to ask the above question.  The front page of this sub is claiming Israel attacked Syria.  But what they really did was respond to an Iran drone over Golan Heights.  So i&#39;m just writing this part because it is not optional &amp; people here feel I have a low IQ so i dont want to let these people down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I look at it this way.  There are fucked upelite Israeli&#39;s that US democrats support.  Then there are the fucked up elite group of Israeli&#39;s that US republicans support.  They are constantly bickering over how best to keep Israel as a strategic port to extract oil from the middle east.  They ensure the area is destabalized so they have an excuse to be there to get the oil.  They fucked up really bad decades ago when progressivism was spreading through the middle east. They effectively sent several generations of people back to the dark ages &amp; these people just want to be left alone &amp; do not give 1 fuck if you cant extract 1 drop of oil from their country so you can drive your cars.  The Israeli&#39;s want to live life in Israel like we do in the US &amp; these people the CIA fucked dont care for that shit so much.  They want the freedom to stone people to death &amp; publicly behead them.  They are very different from us we are partially responsible for creating this monster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok but the USA has basically oil independent and even exports oil now. So I’m going to vehemently disagree that this is some oil thing, which always seems to be the conspiracy argument. Saudi Arabia is one of our staunchest allies. We import more oil from Canada than anywhere else. And like I said, we ship out oil now, so this whole “we’re doing it for the oil” argument doesn’t make any sense </p>
