    <div class="md"><p>Each social media platform is a form of privately owned communication channels. You don&#39;t have to use their service but they have every right to filter what is on their platform. (Make your own)</p>

<p>I have yet to see mass censorship on a college campus and both myself and my younger brother attend colleges. More than likely this &quot;censorship&quot; is simply the speaker not getting correct permission to use the college as a platform. It&#39;s really easy to get a license to speak on college grounds and say literally any bullshit you want out of a megaphone.</p>

<p>Freedom of speech ONLY protects you from the government infringing on your right to free speech. Anything outside of that is consequentialist and if you get beat down for spewing random garbage in the street, or on a college campus then that is your problem, maybe find a better audience?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um... They have canceled milo and Ben Shapiro, and Ann Coulter have all had their events shut down due to &quot;security concerns&quot; at MULTIPLE campuses, among many other prominent and non prominent conservative voices. Dan Kleve is being threatened with expulsion from SNHU for simply attending the Charlottesville rally.</p>

<p>These are just a few examples. So either you&#39;re a fucking liar trying to push forward an agenda or you&#39;re severely uninformed.</p>

<p>Also, no you can&#39;t just &quot;go elsewhere&quot; when it comes to social media. Not if you want to be heard. There is currently no viable alternative to Facebook. Even GAB isn&#39;t a viable alternative to twitter. Even Voat isn&#39;t viable alternative to reddit. Social Media has become the new Town Square where information and ideas are exchanged. Censorship has the same effect when private companies do it as the government doing it.</p>

<p>You are completely dishonest and you know it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those campuses are free for all &quot;safe spaces&quot; for people to say whatever they want. Those speakers are known to be inflammatory. If some liberal asshole antifa wanted to speak in front of your house would you want them there?</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say censorship on these platforms is a good thing, that&#39;s the way the law works. Go look at the restrictions on free speech and you&#39;ll find quite clearly that these instances don&#39;t fall under protection. Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be allowed to stop them.</p>

<p>Oh? You realize that it&#39;s public property, right? They should lose 100% of all tax funds, but you don&#39;t agree with that either do you? You just care about your agenda and you don&#39;t really support free speech at all. </p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what you insinuated in your first paragraph </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they are in violation of the law. Not once have I said that. Do I think ir should be a violation of the law? Yes. Absolutely. When a huge fraction of the nation uses a service free speech needs to be protected,especially when that service is an IPO. </p>

<p>I clearly outlined it in my post. Unless you think private billion dollars companies can&#39;t be involved in conspiracies. </p>

<p>Can&#39;t do that on social media though of they don&#39;t want it, amirite? </p>

<p>But you agree with restrictions of speech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would you need these platform that you disagree with to push your agenda? It&#39;s called good ole fashioned foot work. Grass roots movement. You claim they are terrible yet continue to use their service?</p>

<p>Currently the colleges don&#39;t allow these speakers and are publically funded and the speakers aren&#39;t protected by free speech, you yourself offered they should have their funding pulled. So you are equally in cahoots with the idea of pulling their funding, nice attempt at deflection though.</p>

<p>I have other beliefs on why we shouldn&#39;t have publicly funded schools.</p>
