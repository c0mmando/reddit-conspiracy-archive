Surely our new found nationalistic fervor will triumph, return to us to our previous glory and lead us to greatness. Here’s to a new thousand year realm. Mein Trumph! Sieg heil!

       I imagine that was the response in the 1930’s as well.  Surely history will never repeat itself. Witness how we no longer go to war on false pretenses and how a select few elites determine public policy.  I am so glad those human foibles have been exorcised.

       Trump is no Hitler. The institutions of the Republic- as far as allowing a dictator to rise- are still sound. The real danger rests in the attacks on the Office of the Presidency itself by a 4th estate out for blood and a power hungry Deep State seeking to reassert its dominance. I'm not a Trump supporter but I am a supporter of the Office of the Presidency and this Russia BS is nothing but an attack on the institution itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we allow Trump to be driven out of office on lies and innuendos, it will permanently damage the Office itself and could be used against someone who I do actually support- and as such it must be fought against.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said- those who ignore the past are doomed to repeat it. This is why the study of history, and especially of Western Civilization itself, is utterly important. This is also why the concept of the West has been so heavily demonized and why schools and Universities no longer teach Western Civ as a mandatory or cohesive unit.

       Trump was elected in a Constitutionally sound election- and is constrained by both the Legislature and the Courts. He has made no Hitleresque moves to destroy the balance of power among the branches of government. The similarities are surface at best. This country has always been Nationalistic, it's part of the American ethos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quit buying into the hype thinking Trump is the next Hitler. Do you honestly think he wont hold elections in 2020? Do you think the Army would support him, or the common people, if he did such a thing? Do you forget there are more guns than people in this country? Calm down- there will be no coup on Trumps part. At worst he remains President until 2024 and is then peacefully transitioned out of power as has been done since 1796.

       Trump isn't going to gas anyone. He's not going to become dictator. Calm the fuck down- you are buying into everything they want you to buy into and being a perfect little drone for TPTB. Instead of focusing on the real issues, you pretend Trump is
       <em>
        actually Hitler
       </em>
       . What a fucking joke.

       You really do believe Trump is going to become Hitler...LOL. You keep on pretending that's the bigger issue and not the destruction of the Office of the Presidency by outside forces, the looming economic crises, the hollowed out middle class, and the overall fractious state of the Republic.

       Your point is to compare Hitler and Trump in order to invoke the imagery of Hitler and bind that thought to Trump. It was a pathetic attempt and the proof of this is your backpedalling, which you are doing now.

       Hitler blamed the Jews for wrecking their economy.
Trump blames the Mexicans for the same.

Trump has blamed opposition parties for all that ails America.

       Hitler blamed the Jews for losing WW1 and claimed that they were racially inferior, conniving backstabbers who needed to be dealt with. Trump simply says Mexicans are taking American jobs- while I don't believe illegal immigrants are anywhere near the problem Trump says they are, he is nowhere near Hitler in his thoughts on Mexicans.

       Hitler was right when talking about treaties- Versailles was an unfair peace that guaranteed another conflict would arise. And again- American nationalism is a part of the national ethos- we've always been proud of our country, and every president has echoed these jingoistic sentiments.

       I've heard you...and you are so utterly wrong its hilarious. You draw feeble surface comparisons between one of histories worst dictators and pretend Trump is anywhere close.

       Trump isn't Hitler. He won't seize power. He wont throw anyone in camps...it's very ignorant to claim he is like Hitler just because he has a veneer of Nationalism painted about himself. There is oh so much more needed. Trump is a symptom of the collapsing Republic- a desperate call to the night. He won't become a dictator though...people voted him in based on policies, which when they fail will expose him.

      <p>
       And Trump is nothing like Hitler, though you pretend he is. Trump is constrained by the actual balance of power of the branches of the US government and by elections, which will be held in 2020 and again in 2024. Trump will never become another Hitler, you need to take a step back from this panicked worldview you inhabit.

       The distinguishing feature of Hitler's reign was not nationalism.  It was genocide and an overly bellicose approach to international politics.  There have been and will continue to be nationalistic politicians from time to time.

       I am not a Trump supporter but to classify him with Hitler is to have an enormous misunderstanding of history and operates to debase your viewpoint.

       So by your argument Duterte, Castro, Farage, Erdogan, and many others are also Hitlers.  Basically anyone who is anti-globalism is a Hitler.

       You said that the defining feature of Hitler's reign was that he was nationalistic.  You say that Trump is Hitleresque because he is nationalistic.  These other leaders are also nationalistic, ergo, they are Hitleresque.

       It wouldn’t matter. You seem convinced that history will never repeat based on the fact you are unable to see it. Do you really think banners will held up for you stating “hey, this has happened before” or is it up to you to see parallels ?   I assume you think most Germans were evil idiots. That is beyond simplistic.
I suppose you think most Americans were the same for supporting idiotic wars in Iraq and Afghanistan? Yet they did. It is the exact same thing. Repeating.

       Nice strawmen...but it shows how weak your arguments actually are. No- I don't believe germans were evil idiots, and I don't believe Americans were for supporting Iraq and Afghanistan- both were duped. But that doesn't make Trump Hitler, not anything fucking close. You need to calm down and take a look at History that you so arrogantly claim to understand...you don't have a clue.

       If you think that's propaganda...well, you should just go back to watching the approved MSM narrative of events and settle back down into the stew as it boils. I'm not a Trump supporter, my comments and submissions attest to that, but I can see the BS being perpetrated against him and it's laughable. Unfortunate that you don't...though you gave me a good chuckle in calling me a peddler of propaganda! lol.
