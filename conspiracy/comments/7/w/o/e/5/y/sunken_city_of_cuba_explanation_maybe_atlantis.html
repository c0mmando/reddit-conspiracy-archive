        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So the sunken city off the Cuban coast had me thinking. Noone has had a great explanation of how this got 650m underwater. The only reasoning that I heard was that it must have been built before the Gulf of Mexico basin was breached and filled with water placing the city at hundreds of thousands of years ago. I feel that this is a bit too rediculous so I looked into it a bit farther.</p>

<p>I think that the city could have been above water as early as around 12000BC. Now here is my explanation.</p>

<p>At the end of the ice age we saw a ~400 feet increase in sea level,  this makes us only have to account for about 1600ft difference. However, look at the North American tectonic plate:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Plate</a></p>

<p>Where is the city? Floating right on the southern most edge of the tectonic plate. Now keep this in top of mind. </p>

<p>When the Ice age was going down, there was a 2mile thick sheet of ice around the center of the plate. When it melted, it caused what i&#39;s known as the post-glacial rebound:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound</a></p>

<p>This caused the depressed portion of the plate to rebound upward after the melting. Now, think back to what I said earlier. The city was on the edge of the plate. Think about what happens when you have a semi-rigid piece of foam on water. You push down the middle and the edges pop out of the water. I think this is exactly what happened. I think the mass of the ice sheet depressed the center of the plate which lifted the outer edge upwards.</p>

<p>Keeping this in mind, think about the location specified for Atlantis. It was due west of the straight of gibralter. It wasn&#39;t as far as the Americas, but was several days travel. What if this also explains the sinking of Atlantis. If the edge was 1-2000 feet higher  (Mid-Atlantic ridge??). This could cause several more islands to surface.</p>

<p>What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>love how on the wikipage says it estimates that only about 50,000 years ago is when water was low enough for this location to have been above water. Then ends with &quot;these structures are out of time and place&quot;; which is why these were discovered in 2001 and nothing new (from what i can find) has been released yet. truly a mystery and more out of place than Gobleki Tepi. Wonder if the area is off limits</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I really enjoyed this post. The post-glacial rebound of the areas your talking about is about 1.5-2mm per year, which means the Cuban area has sunk about 70-80ft since the ice-age impacts. Couple this with the lower water level and you around 500-600ft, so nowhere near the 650-750m that is claimed of the underwater Cuban city. The last time that the water level was low enough to support this particular city being above water was 50,000 years ago. Either scientists are way off in determining the impact of the last ice age meteors, and that city did exist 12000 years ago and was Atlantis, or they&#39;re right and we are clueless because we do not know a lot about what happened 50k years ago.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s the city in Cuba, Silves in Portugal, and Gunung Padang that could be Atlantis too. Looking at some of the data from what you linked, the plates have sunk a lot more in areas like the Pacific Ocean near Japan and Australia. Those islands are no doubt the home of lost civilizations wiped out by the impacts and the water increase. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that it does slow as it reaches a flat equilibrium, and that is accounted for because it is an average measurement from 12000bc to now not a measurement of how it moves yearly today.</p>
