       Time of death: 1200 hours on 10/02. This seems very odd. Also the autopsy wasn't done for 4 days after the shooting. According to google, most autopsies are done within 24 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have a lot of issues in the LVMPD prelim report, seen here:

      <ol>
       <li>
        "Campos heard
what he described as automatic gunfire coming from the area of room 32-135 and realized he
had been shot in the left calf. He took cover in the alcove of rooms 32-122 and 32-124 and
utilized both his cellular phone and radio to notify his dispatch he was shot. Security Officer
Campos advised he was shot with a BB or pellet gun. While waiting for other security personnel
to arrive Security Officer Campos continued to hear gunfire coming from the room.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This was on page 6. Does getting shot by an AR15 at somewhat close range feel like getting hit by a pellet gun? I don't think so
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        "A second explosive breach was
utilized to gain access to room 32-134 through the connecting doors. Immediately after the
breach a SWAT officer negligently discharged his rifle. Officers cleared room 32-134 finding
several rifles in the room."
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       This is on page 7. Does this door (
       <a href="https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-01-20_1413.png">
        https://www.activistpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-01-20_1413.png
       </a>
       ) look like it was breached with an explosive? I don't think so
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        "Paddock committed no crimes leading up to the October 1st mass shooting. All the
weapons he purchased to include all the ammunition, were purchased legally. This
includes all the purchases Paddock made at gun stores as well as online purchases."
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Page 52. So why was Douglas Haig arrested for selling ammo to Paddock, if it was all done legally?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a lot of problems with this prelim report, but these are the main things.

       Getting shot hurts. When you get hurt, adrenaline starts flowing so you won't know how much pain you really are in. 
Then he looked down and probably saw a very small entrance wound.

      <p>
       I agree with everything else you said, but someone thinking they got shot by a pellet gun, but really an ar-15 isnt surprising.

       there was also this on page 52:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Security Officer Campos was not shot with a BB gun but rather sustained a gunshot
wound from one of the rounds fired by Paddock down the hallway of the 100 wing on the
32nd floor. Security Officer Campos did in fact have a pre-planned vacation to Mexico to
go visit his father and Security Officer Campos asked law enforcement for permission to
make this trip."
      </p>
      <p>
       So even after the adrenaline calmed down. He was still able to go on vacation to mexico after suffering from an AR15 wound. The police/fbi let a key witness, to the biggest mass shooting in american history, leave the county

       I would assume they have at least 4 or 5 different shifts (3 8-hour shifts per day x 7 days a week is 21 8-hour shifts per week), and each shift would could have at least a dozen people for a casino and hotel of that size. I'd say you're looking of a total security crew of at least 50 people but possibly far more. If they never shared shifts, it wouldn't seem that implausible that this unnamed other security guard wouldn't have heard of Campos.

       Paddock's AR15 shoots a .223 bullet.  Same diameter as a .22 pellet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the door absorbed the gas shock from the muzzle blast, making Campos think that he'd been hit with a pellet?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it true that exit wounds are most often of a diameter greater than the entrance wound?  Did the bullet that hit Campos travel inside of his body or did it exit immediately opposite of where it entered?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if Campos based his "pellet gun" comment off of the wound he received, he'd have to be deaf to ignore the sound of an AR15 fired at close range.  Especially being in the line of fire, where the sound blast would travel.

       Not that my opinion matters but I hunt varmints with a .223 rifle and any game you shoot within 10-20" may or may not have an exit wound larger than the entrance wound so long as you don't hit any bone which would cause tumbling or ricocheting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reason being the bullet is traveling to fast 2,000-3,000+ FPS at that range and the target is not "meaty" enough to slow down the bullet..

       Paddock didn't break any laws by buying the ammunition, Haig broke the law by planning on producing Incendiary/tracer and RAUFOSS rounds. The ones he sold Paddock were from US military armory and procured through gun shows which is very very shady.

       When it comes to official paperwork you're not dead until a doctor pronounces you dead. Might not have to wait for the autopsy, but if you're not rushed to a trauma center it's not unreasonable for it to take until the following day for the pronouncement to be made.

       Reading the report, it seems he was taking an antihistamine, an anti-insomnia medication, and valium or something similar. If the report is accurate, the drugs in his system don't suggest MKULTRA or anything. Strangely, he had stopped taking the diazepams/benzodiazepines by the time of the shooting (wasn't found in his blood, only urine). If I were going to go out like he did, I'd want to be on happy pills while I was doing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the time of death wasn't specifically tested. The toe tag just said: 1200 hours on 10-2-17. I doubt that means that he was still alive until then. More likely, they didn't let the medical examiner look at the body until noon the next day after the shooting. I wonder why they wouldn't let the medical examiner see the body until ~14 hours had passed?
