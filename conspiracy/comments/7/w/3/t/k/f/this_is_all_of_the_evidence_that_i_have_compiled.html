        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been sitting on all this for a while now.</p>

<p><strong>Perhaps you have heard stories in the mainstream media contemplating the massive changes that have taken place over the course of Avril Ramona Lavigne&#39;s career, which officially began with the hit song</strong> <strong><em>Complicated</em></strong> <strong>in 2002.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The story goes that Avril had been on her first major tour in support of her smash debut album</strong> <strong><em>Let Go</em></strong> <strong>when she was suddenly informed of her grandfather passing. As the story goes, Lavigne was extremely unhappy with the newfound pressures of fame. One of the major breaking points that led to her decision to kill herself</strong> <strong><em>(whether this was a voluntary act or not is debatable)</em></strong> <strong>was an incident where she was ambushed by the paparazzi vying to take her picture in the middle of a small cramped environment</strong> <strong><em>(supposedly an underground subway)</em></strong> <strong>which led her to realize that fame was a trap. She managed to get away unscathed thanks to the help of her bandmate, Evan Taubenfeld, but had been supposedly psychologically scarred by the incident. The story goes that Avril ended up hanging herself while she was in the middle of recording her follow-up album,</strong> <strong><em>Under My Skin.</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Considering that she had ended up being the biggest star of the year when she debuted in 2002, her label was desperate to let the success of her fledgling career continue. It was then that they resorted to the old playbook of replacing Avril Lavigne with an imposter (the way Paul McCartney had been replaced by William Shepherd (stage name Billy Pepper) who was frontman of the band Billy Pepper &amp; The Pepperpots in 1966) in order to continue her legacy. Just as with The Beatles, Avril&#39;s music endured a drastic overhaul in order to fit more in the style with of the new impostor so as to make her feel more comfortable playing her new role. Whereas The Beatles music became more complex with the release of 1967&#39;s</strong> <strong><em>Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club,</em></strong> <strong>Avril&#39;s music became decidedly more cheerful and immature with the release of 2007&#39;s</strong> <strong><em>The Best Damn Thing</em></strong> <strong>and its lead single</strong> <strong><em>Girlfriend.</em></strong></p>

<p>All this information was stumbled upon either by accident, or information was fed to the Avril fanbase from the illuminati (under the pretense of a hoax) from one of her international fansites. In any case, death by hanging always signs of illuminati ritual sacrifice. Robin Williams, Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington all died by &quot;hanging&quot; as well. </p>

<p>There are several ways to know this isn&#39;t the same Avril Lavigne:
- First a comparison pic between Avril&#39;s typical look from the beginning career to Melissa, the girl who portrays her today: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/EsEZNYR.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/EsEZNYR.jpg</a></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Her voice has gotten higher over the years. Never heard of puberty causing a person&#39;s voice to turn higher than before. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>2002:</strong> <a href="https://youtu.be/2axL4T3R2ak?t=56">https://youtu.be/2axL4T3R2ak?t=56</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>2011:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YobX6aQFahU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YobX6aQFahU</a> <em>(Even when she attempts to hit the low notes she can&#39;t get her voice to go as deep as &quot;she&quot; was able to when she was a teenager)</em></p></li>
<li><p>&quot;Avril&quot; once did a photoshoot around 2007 with the word Melissa written on her hand: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/bqV5tv3.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/bqV5tv3.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>Her ears are completely different. Ears are like fingerprints, everybody&#39;s is unique. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/w51CnzO.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/w51CnzO.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>Her teeth have caps now. The original Avril has a snagtooth on her left canine which is pretty noticeable. The new Avril does kind of look like she has it but it&#39;s drastically reduced and her crowns are always shiny now, indicating that it&#39;s not her real teeth.</p></li>
<li><p>Her moles &amp; birthmarks have disappeared: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9oecmUF.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/9oecmUF.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>She never ages anymore. The original Avril had terrible skin with big red pimples breaking out everywhere. This new Avril hasn&#39;t aged a day in 10 years and her skin has a synthetic waxy look. On the other hand, here is how the real Avril Lavigne looked with problem skin:
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/8AUPvVp.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/8AUPvVp.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>And here is how the real Avril Lavigne looked without makeup on circa 2002/2003: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CWvMfil.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/CWvMfil.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>Her handwriting changed between 2004 - 2006. Her original handwriting: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/dtQoVFG.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/dtQoVFG.jpg</a>. New handwriting (which has been used since at least her third album onwards): <a href="http://i.imgur.com/r02pls7.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/r02pls7.jpg</a></p></li>
<li><p>The original Avril wouldn&#39;t be caught dead lipsynching. She used to trash Britney Spears all the time for doing it in 2002. This new Avril lip-synchs all the time and fools her fans into thinking it&#39;s live, which is worse than Britney, who lip-synchs but is upfront about it without recording new vocals to fake sounding live. As you can see in this performance, Avril makes a mistake at 02:34 and accidentally says the word &quot;thinking&quot; directly into the microphone but no sound comes out.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uPka1pCSH4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uPka1pCSH4</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Once you become familiar with stuff like this, including the &quot;Paul McCartney Died In 1966&quot; evidence, it becomes so easy to pinpoint all the signs that indicate an imposter. It&#39;s so obvious that all the things people say Avril is a hypocrite for is actually because it&#39;s a completely different person playing her now. In fact, nothing about Avril&#39;s past history makes sense either. She just so happened to be called up to sing along at a Shania Twain concert, one of her first concerts ever? She just happened to go to California and booked a meeting with LA Reid and got to sing in front of him? Please. These things don&#39;t just &quot;happen&quot;. It seems to me that she was groomed for this from the beginning and replaced when they decided to change her image and mock her fans who bought into it.</strong></p>

<p>Why go through such a massive effort for barely any gain? You&#39;d have to pay off every one of her family and friends and associates to play along. If this was your daugher vor friend, would you? For how much? How long?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She was the biggest star on Earth the year before she killed herself, with a brand new career that had the potential to make millions. Nobody knew yet what her future had in store for her.

That&#39;s a nice amount of sales but not even close to Britney. Especially not in the time she allegedly killed herself.

    <div class="md"><p>I meant she was biggest star on Earth the year of her debut. Dying the year later subsequently would have prematurely ended the bullet-train. Britney didn&#39;t sell 78 million album <em>(frankly I&#39;m sure it&#39;s higher)</em> in just 1 year. Avril showed great potential for only 1 year of experience under her belt.

<p>Do you even read my comment? I clearly stated &quot;total&quot; (selling 78 million in a year is fucking unreal) and i&#39;m not just pulling these numbers out of my ass. Okay nevermind seems like you are not much into sale numbers.<br/>
The thing is Avril never topped any worldwide chart.<br/>
Britney&#39;s first record at the age of 17 &quot;baby one more time&quot; was breaking records. While Avril&#39;s first album was nowhere near to break any records. Is my point clear now? </p>

If it was not clear enough:<br/>
 My point was to eliminate the following argument : &quot;<em>She was the biggest star on Earth</em>&quot; and I did, backed up with numbers and facts.<br/>
If it was too complicated for you then I&#39;m not surprised, juding by your tone and lack of reading ability I did not expect much from you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they reported she died after only 1 album, what would there really be to purchase? Let Go would have sold even more, yes, but she would be quickly forgotten as a 1-album wonder. If they released the second album, it would have been a blip. They certainly wouldn&#39;t have been able to stretch it out to 15 years worth of sales like they have with this current set-up. Also, Avril&#39;s fanbase was - and still contains - lots of young people who would have been traumatized to hear that the girl they just started becoming fans of killed herself.</p>

<p>I presume you&#39;re talking about the ones without makeup? That&#39;s all there is tbh. We are looking at a very small timeframe when you consider it. Avril blew up in mid-2002 and died sometime around late 2003, max. The person who filmed the videos for the Under My Skin era was already Melissa Vandella. The point I was trying to make with the no-makeup pictures is that Avril never had perfect skin, while Melissa barely even has a clogged pore.</p>

<p>But Avril was a teenager in 2002. Acne often clears up on its own as people enter their 20s. </p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible that through trial and error, Avril found a skin-care routine that works for her. </p>

<p>When you’re born your ear is fully formed. The lobe descends a little, but overall it stays the same.</p>

<p>Pretty sure ears grow from birth to adulthood. This implies that they grow to scale, but some researchers in that article even cast doubt on the stability of the markers, citing iris breakdown with age. </p>

<p>Lol what a bullshit. Everyone with advanced photoshop skills can make an image like this, give the same proper lights, shadows, and values to make it look real. You can not analyze an image then say &quot;it&#39;s not photoshopped&quot;.<br/>
Also her moles and ears and other facial features changed because she went under plastic surgery just like the rest of the Hollywood whores.<br/>
The reason why she allegedly killed herself is varies feom website to website. I was already reading like six variations of this story, really nothing more than urban legend. Paul McCartney on the other hand was replaced for real but there were reasons to do so.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes - answering as a vocalist, this was the first point I wanted to make about the post</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had difficulty maintaining my higher range over the years, but I don&#39;t train for it. I&#39;ve worked hard to deepen my voice, and it takes just as much effort. Do our voices lower naturally? Sure, but not by that much. Puberty also wouldn&#39;t have been a factor as Avril was likely done by the time she hit mainstream</p>

<p>Also, the lower that I train, the less focused I am on higher notes - I would assume this would work the opposite way, as well. If she&#39;s not actively maintaining her lower range and is focused on the higher notes, it&#39;ll wear down over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Happy to help:) the boot guy you responded to cracked me up. &quot;Never heard of it going in the other direction&quot; like wut. We&#39;re talking about singing, not speaking tones - and a girl, ffs! Of course men&#39;s voices drop considerably, on average, but girls usually don&#39;t change much. </p>

<p>For the record, my old high school teacher was male and could sing higher than most of the girls, as well as match the baratones. He worked hard for that and helped me a lot. Guys are apparently more likely to have wider ranges, though, while girls do struggle to hit lower octaves. For reference, the guy from guns n roses (or acdc, can&#39;t remember.. they sound the same to me) can sing 8 fucking octaves. I think guys on average can do about 4 or 5, while girls are usually around 3</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah just FYI this is a fun theory and all, but it originated at a site called Avril Esta Morta. It lays out the whole theory, but because it&#39;s written in Spanish a lot of people missed the point --- the person who came up with the theory says it&#39;s just an experiment to see if they can make a story go viral. So it&#39;s fake ... purposely fake. But most people missed that part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good summary, but what&#39;s the conspiracy? That record companies manufactured an identity to sell albums, concert tickets, and merch. In this case, with a different persona, instead of the real Avril.</p>

<p>Ok. They&#39;d would also have manufactured a fake Avril from the real Avril.</p>

<p>If the real Avril is dead, who controls her likeness and image? Her estate or her record company?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting! I&#39;d like to add a few points to consider and share some thoughts. </p>

<p>• Typically, women gain deeper voices as they age. This is just a biological fact for a majority of women. It doesn&#39;t mean much, but it&#39;s something to keep in mind.</p>

<p>• Ears can&#39;t be surgically altered (the lobe can, but not the cartilage). This was the main piece of evidence in the Paul versus Faul debate, and it was one of the pieces of evidence that proved that &quot;Paul McCartney&quot; was no longer who he was claiming to be. So it&#39;s an interesting thing to point out. <a href="http://hugequestions.com/Eric/TFC/FromOthers/Paul-McCartney-Italian.html">Evidence for irrefutable Paul versus Faul evidence by well known Italian forensic experts, because I know someone will be interested in it or ask to see a source.</a> </p>

<p>• Birth marks and the like can be edited out in photoshop, and seeing as Avril is a celebrity, this seems more likely. If you can find unedited photos (such as candid fan photos) with missing birth marks and such, it&#39;d strengthen your theory a lot more.</p>

<p>• I do think it&#39;s interesting that she can&#39;t hit many of the lower notes she used to hit. She always had that edgy vibe and she pulled off a lower, sightly gravelly type of voice effortlessly. Typically people will have a harder time hitting high notes if their voice is naturally lower; I&#39;ve never heard of anyone with a low voice become so high that they can&#39;t hit lower notes anymore. It happened in SUCH a short time too, in about two years total. So none of the usual excuses (&quot;She&#39;s not a teen anymore she&#39;s in her thirty&#39;s!!&quot;) explain this adequately. It&#39;s odd, but whatever. </p>

<p>All in all, I really like this theory and I really want to believe in it (as morbid as it is). I&#39;ve researched it in the past though and I didn&#39;t find a ton of compelling evidence, and the person who created the theory actually admitted that it was a hoax to prove how gullible people are. I guess you could consider that maybe he was &quot;forced&quot; by Avril&#39;s management to say that, but really that&#39;d be a stretch, y&#39;know? </p>

<p>What I do find extremely interesting is the total change in mannerisms, demeanor, speech patterns, tone of voice (much deeper), and personality between her second and third album. There&#39;s a huge, noticeable difference. Yeah, people change, I get that. But generally people have core mannerisms that stay with them throughout life, and she seems to have lost all of them. In the interviews when she&#39;s been asked about this conspiracy theory, she gets extremely anxious and awkward. It&#39;s like she&#39;s playing a character or something and she&#39;s over-acting. It&#39;s hard to explain. If I can manage to dig up any of those interviews, I&#39;ll come back and edit this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We did though. William Shepherd from Billy Pepper &amp; The Pepperpots was a famous musician who got his start before The Beatles hit the big time. In fact, he was supposed to tour the USA as well, but it never worked out. And the fact that The Beatles named the album Sargeant Pepper is just too big of a callback to ignore imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>“perhaps the most imaginative interpretation of an image on the cover of Sgt. Pepper. If you hold a mirror across the middle of the words “LONELY HEARTS” written across the center of the bass drum, you will see “IONEIX HE&lt;&gt;DIE”. When arranged as “I ONE IX HE &lt;&gt; DIE,” this image suggests the date (11-9, or November 9, 1966) that Paul died, as the diamond between the words “HE” and “DIE” points directly at Paul. One problem with this interpretation is that the British write dates as day-month-year rather than the American month-day-year, which would make this date September 11th rather than November 9th. You could read this, then, as “1 ONE 1 X”, meaning that one of the four is gone, and then the “HE DIE” points to Paul as the missing Beatle.”</p>

<p>imo Howard knows it’s Hicks. he is talking to Alex in a similar manner to how he’d interview “marge schott”; ie setting them up for the punchline, although with Alex it’s less obviously a crank.  </p>

<p>Ex-longtime obsessive stern listener I picked up on it immediately when I listened to it with this “theory” in mind.  I’m convinced Howard is part of the propaganda arm of some ideology, I’m just not ready to name which one, but they don’t have americans interests in mind. It may be more benign than that, but prob not?</p>

Either way, I can contribute this nugget although I have no way of backing it up: Apparently (at least in the early days) she would never perform anywhere without her soundguy. This was because he would do live pitch correction for her. I was a working musician from around 2000-2010 and I had a sound engineer friend who told me this. He told me that gossip like this tends to travel in the &quot;live crew&quot; world. But it wasn&#39;t so much about Avril, it was all about how this soundguy was a wizard with an auto tuner. He played it like an instrument almost.</p>

<p>Hee ears look exactly the same. Perhaps you are unable to determine that different lighting makes things look different? But all the same features are there, if anything, the photo of the ears is completely damming to your argument.</p>

<p>The handwriting is a clear case of the difference between writing quickly for yourself and wrong something clearly that you plan to photograph and expect others to be able to read.</p>

<p>Shin blemishes are easily photocopied and can disappear with a tan (notice she is tan in one photo and pale in the other). </p>

<p>Her voice? Puberty? Uh Idk if you realize this, but puberty doesn&#39;t happen when you&#39;re 20... we never heard her voice before puberty and summers often lose range as they age. Completely normal.</p>

<p>I think you should get out more and find a student woman to obsess over. Maybe one that will obsess you back?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very interesting post! Have definitely heard of the Avril Lavigne double conspiracy, but not in this much detail. My one question for OP is this: wouldn&#39;t <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avril_Lavigne#cite_note-okmetcalfe-261">Avril&#39;s boyfriend</a>, Sum 41&#39;s lead singer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deryck_Whibley">Deryck Whibley</a>, notice if his girlfriend was replaced by someone else? They had been friends since she was 17, so 2001ish, and reportedly started dating in 2003 when she was 19, and married in 2006. Presumably if Avril had killed herself somewhere around 2003, and the timeline you propose is true, then Deryck knew the real Avril, and married the fake Avril. I&#39;m just not buying that he wouldn&#39;t realize his girlfriend was a completely different person a year later. And I don&#39;t know why he would play along with a secret that big if he did know, what would the incentive for him be? By the time they got married in 2006, both of their careers were on the decline, they weren&#39;t even really A-listers by then. I could see getting blackmailed to keep it a secret, but why get married and stay married for 3 years? It just doesn&#39;t add up when you start to analyze her relationships with family and friends in the 2001-2003 time period. </p>

<p>I have no idea on timeframes, just spit balling. This whole thing is silly but interesting. And I&#39;d never heard the McCartney one before today so that was worth it alone. I just don&#39;t pay much attention to the celeb world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, she has had 2 husbands by this point. First Deryck then Chad Kroger from Nickelback. Both lasted a very short amount of time. When they replaced Paul McCartney with an impostor, the new guy remained with Jane Asher for 1 year following the death in order to keep up appearances and their relationship went from red-hot to frosty cold. For a couple that everybody thought was going to get married, they couldn&#39;t seem to get rid of each other fast enough beyond that allotted time. So that sounds to me like a contractual obligation so that she would keep quiet. After that, the new Paul basically went MIA for a long period of time until a magazine reporter tracked him down and did a cover issue. So if we look at that pattern, what happened with Avril? Well, she had two very brief marriages, and up until recently she has disappeared for quite a while and kept a low profile too. It just so happened that she was silently dealing with Lyme Disease during this period of absence. It all sounds like very fishy excuses if you ask me, and what&#39;s more telling is that it pretty much fits the same pattern as Paul McCartney.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I’m not following at all. 3 years is not a short marriage stint especially in the celebrity world. Also what does her marriage to nickelback dude have to do with anything? If she was replaced in 2003, nickleback has nothing to do with this. Emmy question is based on your timeline Deryck knew both Avril’s was friends with one and married the other, there is no way he didn’t know they were different, so why did he stay silent. Also she did not keep a low profile whatsoever in the mid 2000s look back at all the celebrity gossip mags... I’m sorry but this timeline just doesn’t add up.</p>

I was a huge SUM 41 fan, still am really, but weren&#39;t her and SUM41&#39;s front man Derek married at one point?

    <div class="md"><p>Your timeline is a bit off. Deryck and Avril were friends since 2001. They started dating in 2003 and got married in 2006. There were rumors they were together before 2003 but Deryck also had a brief fling with Paris Hilton in 2003 that could have made things weird between them. If Avril killed herself in 2003, that means Deryck knew the real Avril and then married the fake Avril. It seems so unbelievably unlikely that he wouldn&#39;t notice any difference between her in 2001-2002 and then in 2003. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly my point. He would have had to know what was going on. Everything you said was dead on. I wonder what he would say about it today. Clearly he had to have known. If my fiance&#39; was someone else, even if that person looked like her, I would know immediately. So that was what I was trying to say, he had knowledge she was gone and went along with the hoax it looks like.</p>

A hit debut album is more than just a collection of songs, it&#39;s pretty much the Big Bang for a brand new pop career. One that could earn money for decades if handled properly. I can see why they would choose to make a farce continue if she died so early on when there was so much $$$$ to be made in the future.</p>

Question on the ear image- the comment in it mentions that the illuminati have to tell us what they&#39;re doing for karmic purposes. I see them dropping hints to the truth all the time but it&#39;s cloaked in disinformation. Do you have any links about this practice and the reasoning behind it?

You have to go deeper if you want this to be a real conspiracy.  I&#39;d say starting with family background on both girls is the way to start, but I doubt that&#39;ll lead anywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this simple enough. Avril Ramona Lavigne - Born  09/27/84 -
She recorded that album in Los Angeles - United Recording
6050 Sunset Blvd, Hollywood, CA 90028. Realeased May 19th, 
2004. She spent her time between that studio and the Malibu studio of Raine Maida, Don Gilmore, and Butch Walker. Who helped co-write, and produce that album to completion.
A coroner check of deaths during the 2003-2004 years show nothing, and her hometown of Belleville, Canada. 
For any insurances to pay off for the artist, or their backers, there must be a death certificate. There is also another check that can be made in insurance indexes, and nothing is found.</p>

<p>She is alive, and nothing you listed in your stuff up there is jot out of the norm for a signed artist to go through. She is not Michael Jackson level popular, and her career has not been the greatest in the later years. </p>

<p>You also know that the Paul McCartney thing is not real as well I hope. </p>

<p>Also...the earth is not flat.</p>

<p>Nice try though.</p>

<p>They replaced her in 2003/2004 back when she was still at the peak of her career and still had endless possibilities in front of her. Those possibilities diminished over time, but back during her first era the world was her oyster. Losing that would have meant losing out on millions stretched out over time.</p>

I always default to &quot;why would they go to the trouble of replacing a manufactured pop star, who are generally disposable and whose careers have limited shelf live?&quot; in response to the argument that she was replaced, but I will say that you wrote this extremely well, and did a tremendous job of assembling your evidence in a digestible and organized fashion.

    <div class="md"><p>I get that you think people should mock anybody who believes in things like this. I don’t see conspiracy theories in quite the same way though.</p>

<p>Like I think people like David Icke are really the only people who understand how to use the internet to tell stories. It’s kinds of like they use existing material, whether that’s books, real locations, photographs etc and create a new narrative that fits over the existing world, kind of like a primitive augmented reality.</p>

<p>In Don Quixote, the character thought he was a knight because he read romance fiction and so saw a windmill as being a giant knight wielding a sword. At uni I studied an artist called Janet Cardiff who did audio walks where she overlaid a story over the existing location. </p>

<p>The reason that conspiracy theories are popular is because they’re the only people who are creating anything interesting in terms of a narrative that encompasses all media, real life and real locations. </p>

<p>It’s creative to take some strands and graft a narrative over existing material. There are some people who believe in it wholeheartedly and some who find the ideas interesting. These are different from the more plausible theories of an alternate history that hasn’t been widely written about.</p>

<p>In terms of political conspiracies, is it absurd to think the people with money want to introduce policies to help keep their money and power? There’s enough written in their own books that say they believe they are superior minds and so should craft the way forward for the masses as the masses can be easily controlled. You can read papers on Google Scholar that are pretty upfront (once you get passed the academic jargon) on what the elites plan to introduce in the next 20-30 years. You can either choose to believe it’s nonsense or believe that the think tanks are genuine</p>

<p>Do you believe in any conspiracy theories?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Celebrity clones is a possibility, but I don&#39;t put much stock in the &quot;Faul McCartney&quot; theory. McCartney&#39;s song-writing is distinct, and the same style and craft can be heard even on his weaker solo albums. Their music became more complex, reflecting the other bands at the times, and the influence of psychedelics.</p>

<p>However, there is heavy Occult and Intelligence leanings in the Music industry since at least the days of the Laurel Canyon scene. The real secret is that these entertainment puppets are under trauma-based mind control and have multiple personalities, as seen in Britney Spears, Katy Perry, etc. The photo of two Avrils looks like it could easily be photo-shopped, since there doesn&#39;t seem to be any others.</p>

Besides, the entertainment industry is just like any other. They make investments in their artists and since tragedy sells, she would have made the investment worthy. Engaging in a conspiracy to replace a flash in the pan popstar would require a ton of investment and likely isn&#39;t worth the effort. She hasn&#39;t made a blip since what her second album?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your evidence is fairly terrible. Ill go over 2 that stood out the most.</p>

<p>A picture that fans and not a credible organization have determined that it wasn&#39;t photoshopped? That&#39;s conjecture. Not hard evidence. You don&#39;t even link where you got this opinion. So it&#39;s really just your opinion of an opinion. </p>

<p>Physical imperfections are constantly being removed by the rich and famous have you not seen E!? A change in look doesn&#39;t equate to a different person. Hollywood as a place is obsessed with plastic surgery. We have tv shows both reality TV and fictional about this phenomenon. Michael Jackson anyone?</p>

<p>Also you dilute your argument when you include other actors who are dead by <em>similar</em> (and I use that word loosely) circumstances but are very clearly dead and not being cloned (Robin williams). As that is your entire premise it undermines everything you wrote.</p>

<p>Avril lavigne was a skinny girl. Like, very thin. </p>

<p>Anyone who is up to date on the fappening (c:) will remember avril was available, she was REALLY hot, like, there was one were she is this yellow/gold bikini and she is just literally flawless. </p>

<p>Although, most celebrities and popstars etc will focus on their health when they can, she seemed structurally different than the avril lavigne that I saw growing up. </p>

I only have some questions as an outsider looking into a window of a strangers house. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>why didn&#39;t her family say anything? Like if their daughter committed suicide, then wouldn&#39;t her family call out the imposter?</p></li>
<li><p>I have a good idea of the Illuminati... But why replace a popstar or rock star that died? If you wanted the perfect entertainment slave to brainwash the viewers or to brainwash them, then you can get any other person. That&#39;s what they do?

    <div class="md"><p>The showstopper for me is the Original had a family and life. When she became a pop star, it was probably the biggest news in her hometown. </p>

<p>If she died and people knew, then the whole town would be vocal about the swap. Thier friend died, it&#39;s the biggest news, bit there is a fake girl pretending? It&#39;s be all over the news.</p>

<p>If she died and it was a secret, sure the family could be paid off. But are they supposed to pretend she is still alive? What about at weddings and birthdays?</p>

<p>Point is, these are real people with real lives, who a lot of people know. Doesn&#39;t seem practical. Better, the value of an artists works skyrockets when they die, so that would be a smarter payday, right? Interesting post and well-written though!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I am convinced it&#39;s false. There is no difference in his voice that couldn&#39;t be attributed up to stylistic choices or a heavy smoker ageing. His songwriting talent could not have been replicated. Lennon wasn&#39;t talented enough (IMO) to fill the gaps and his style was too different from Paul&#39;s. If Lennon did fill the gaps, does he seem like the kind of guy that would want to share credit with an impostor of his dead friend? George Harrison had been basically begging to get more songs on the records at that point. Would he have been OK with an impostor who didn&#39;t do any of the legwork to make them famous get more songs on a record than him? The Beatles were satisfied to go their separate ways four years after his supposed death. Why go through all that effort for just 4 more years together? Paul&#39;s death would have made them SO MUCH MONEY and at that point the band was exhausted and George and John were feeling strained by the pressures of working with each other as it is. </p>

<p>The photos aren&#39;t the least bit convincing because perspectives can answer for all of the supposed differences. Look at this picture of Paul in 1964 compared to more recently. <a href="https://thoseconspiracyguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/paul-is-dead-title.jpg">https://thoseconspiracyguys.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/paul-is-dead-title.jpg</a></p>

<p>These aren&#39;t the same man? I simply don&#39;t believe the Beatles would have been able to successfully find a songwriter who arguably was more talented than Paul, looked exactly like him, and who would be willing to live as someone else (in other words get no credit for themselves) for 5 decades of music and success after Paul&#39;s supposed death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watched video. Thanks. I ASSUMED (when you assume you make an ASS out of U M E) the video would be pro ONE Paul and not 2 diff ones. But listening to the song with an open heart you can FEEL that if it&#39;s by the 2nd new paul it is a plaintive cry, a beautiful hymn to FREEDOM which he traded to be new Paul. Thank you. I almost cried. I think what ultimately convinced me really was the new Paul&#39;s autobiography Billy&#39;s Back. Expensive but totally worth the read. It&#39;s his story disguised as fiction. Absolutely fascinating and rang true for the most part. Thank you again.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for posting this. I used to be a huge Avril Lavigne fan as a kid. This is 100% not her IMO. I always thought something was off when that album came out and I thought wow she looks so different. Then I heard about this conspiracy theory a few months ago and it all made sense. That album was just not &quot;her&quot; and it&#39;s obvious to me. </p>

<p>For people who didn&#39;t listen to her music before the change, I can see how it wouldn&#39;t be as obvious and how you would need to see more proof to believe it. The original Avril wouldn&#39;t dress or act like this, she had more of a goth/skater boy style and was more emotional in her music. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I never heard of this conspiracy before now but used to be a fan back in the day. I always wondered why she went to shit after 2003. Now it all makes sense that she died though this isn&#39;t the only explanation.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is a case of the <strong>Mandela effect</strong>, this is Avril Lavigne but from a parallel universe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So everyone saying this is a good post isn&#39;t a conspiracy regular right? This has to be a shill post upvoted to discredit this sub even more?</p>

<p>The first pic is clearly photoshopped, and another user posted the original. Second those ears are exactly the same, they are just older and less flush,  ears typically change tone do with temperature or even medical reasons. </p>

<p>Second the moles/ is a a low res photo that only highlights 3 small blemishes that disappeared. One type of freckle appears when the skin is exposed to sun in summer, and this type fades during winter months.  You should see my skin in the summer vs the winter. </p>

<p>Third, people&#39;s skin breaks out, specially when they are younger and typically acne subsides or goes away into adulthood. </p>

<p>Forth, Are you for real comparing marker hand writing to 4 words of pen writing? The damn R in Chorus is clearly the same. I have changing handwriting as well, and you need a lot of words to compare. </p>

<p>Fuck this post is incredibly stupid as fuck. But that&#39;s why it&#39;s being upvoted, got to discredit this sub.</p>

<p>As an amateur singer, I do have one thing to say: one&#39;s vocal range can change over the course of one&#39;s life, either going higher or lower, and not just due to puberty. Personally, my voice has increased in the higher ranges but lost some in the lower. 
I am only an amateur voice student and I also don&#39;t know much in the ways of scientific research on this topic, so what I shared is just from personal experience, hearsay, and instruction from my professional teachers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Although I don&#39;t believe this theory, in the case where it is true, wouldn&#39;t it be more appropriate that after all the incidents where she found incredible pressure from the public she just decided to phase herself out of the scene. Then her record label needing and trying to profit off of the situation got a double while the real her lived out her life.</p>

<p>Idk both sound far fetched to me but I think her commiting suicide is less likely, only because her family would speak out against it, whereas with this they might not as long as they know she&#39;s safe.</p>

<p>Also what relevance would the illuminati even hold here, why would a bunch of incredibly rich and powerful people care about some pop singer, makes more sense if it was her recording label and not the illuminati.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vocal range issue is definitely not convincing. Singers can increase their range with training and practice, but that range is never going to go beyond what the singer can naturally do. I can sing a really high pitch, but it&#39;s difficult to do, and the timbre is really terrible and unpleasant. Training would make it so that I could hit that high note more easily, consistently, and with better clarity but I wouldn&#39;t be able to extend beyond what&#39;s natural. She likely trained after becoming famous to reach the high end of her range and its very possible that the low end of her range was already developed and practiced and couldn&#39;t naturally be brought lower. Also, her style became more pop-oriented, which a lot of times prefers high-pitched singing rather than low. The Paul McCartney conspiracy is a total fraud. Don&#39;t use that as a basis for a new conspiracy it will gain no traction that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In 7th grade back in 1982, we had a substitute teacher who arrived with Beatles album covers and gave a presentation about how Paul McCartney had died and had been replaced.  That was the first time I was exposed to a conspiracy theory.  I remember that the entire class loved it.  Telling friends about this teacher, I learned that he was doing this presentation in every class he subbed for.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read everything i did...you may change your mind. This was an MI5 operation...john George and ringo went along w it, still traumatized over Paul&#39;s death. Look, i am NOT here to convince you, or anyone. I would still like to believe the old paul is the same paul. But if you search obsessively over a year or 2 like i did...and read and watched EVERYTHING you could get your hands on...well the forensics, in my opinion, cannot be argued with. And a voice expert concluded there were 3 pauls, original, the one now, and an interim. And you can do a LOT with photos and audio. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the bottom line. I hate HRC with a passion. Never met the woman. She could be CGI for all i know. Does the hatred hurt me? Probably. I would do well to get over it. </p>

<p>In the same way it makes no diff in the overall scheme of things to believe either way about paul. Either way, it&#39;s either him or it&#39;s not and it doesn&#39;t, or shouldn&#39;t affect your life unless you let it. Like i did. Husband thinks I&#39;m nuts. He may have a point. A part of me wishes i had never delved into all this stuff and still believed old paul is same paul as now. </p>

My voice started out really low in my teens but with the help of a professional vocal coach I now have a much higher singing voice.

I worked in book publishing and everyone was duped by this crazy story -- this woman wrote books as a man who had been abused, sexually assaulted, and worked as a prostitute. She had her sister-in-law appear in public as the &quot;author,&quot; &quot;JT Leroy&quot; in a wig, sunglasses, and basically a costume, and refused to talk to anyone because of &quot;shyness.&quot; This shit went on for years until NYMag exposed them.

I do want to thank you for posting something other than politics, these kind of conspiracy theories are the ones I want to read about. Not boring old bullshit about trump or clinton, which can be seen in any other sub.</p>

<p>As for Avril looking different, it could just be due to ageing. I know that you mentioned that she hasn&#39;t aged much, but she is young and she isn&#39;t going to get wrinkles for quite a while. Peoples faces do change over the course of 10-15 years, even when they take good care of themselves. </p>

<p>I do think you are on the right track with looking into the music industry though. </p>

<p>So let me get this straight. A girl named &quot;Melissa&quot; replaces &quot;Avril.&quot;</p>

<p>Why the hell would she put &quot;Melissa&quot; on her hand for a photoshoot? To fuel the conspiracy? As a secret clue for detectives? Would her handlers allow that if true?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won a contest in December 2002 to meet Avril at a radio station at z95.3 in Vancouver.  I first heard her in the spring of that year and also attended a free concert z95.3 put on in July 2002. I went alone and was pretty embarrassed to be honest! Anyway late that year z95 put on a contest to meet her, and I’d developed a crush on her so I thought what the hell, I’ll enter. I, along with several others, won the opportunity to meet her at the radio station. I think this was early January 2003, and I went with my cousin. We arrived and after a delay they announced Avril was sick with the flu and could not perform. Everyone was disappointed but they assured us they’d reschedule. It was still fun, they fed us and toured us all around the station and gave us all kinds of swag.</p>

<p>They did reschedule for April iirc, and this time my friend and I went over. We ate some banana bread that had an ounce of weed cooked into it and we got really high. We were definitely out of place, dressed in our baggy pants, timberlands, gold chains, and such, and they took us along with all the moms and young girls into this little room where Avril and her guitarist were set up. They started playing Skater Boi and after 15-20s both of them burst into laughter and my friend and I were convinced they were laughing at us. We stank like weed, were dressed like rappers, and were obviously out of place. They composed themselves and started again.</p>

<p>After that song the radio host/DJ asked the little crowd which song they wanted to hear next. All the girls said one song but Avril was like uh... no we’re going to do I’m with you. The DJ livened up the crowd with a “on the count of three yell out which song you want Avril to play!” And everyone yelled out the song she didn’t want to play. She was very uncomfortable and it was apparent to me that she did not know how to play said song and her and her guitarist just said ok 1,2,3,4 and started playing I’m with You. </p>

<p>Then the DJ interviewed her and she was giving such terrible answers. Asked where she gets her style from, and who her heroes are. She just gave non-answers. I had drawn this really cool picture for her and was going to present it to her but right after the interview she hopped up and booked it out the back door, I just had a “oh that sucks” attitude but all those young fans wanted autographs and such.</p>

<p>Anyway, the weed finally wore off, we got drunk and went to the concert later that night. I was able to get the drawing to her by giving it to Theo from the band Gob and then that was it for what my sister dubbed my obsession with Avril Lavigne. </p>

<p>I do think something was very weird with her behaviour at the radio studio! Maybe it wasn’t the original her and she only knew how to play a couple songs on the guitar. Because at that free show the year before I recall she played all of the songs.</p>

<p>TLDR:
I was obsessed with Avril and went to her first concert, then won a contest to meet her which was mysteriously cancelled, and then saw her and she couldn’t play a song on the guitar from her album and also couldn’t answer questions about herself.</p>

<p>(the way Paul McCartney had been replaced by William Shepherd (stage name Billy Pepper) who was frontman of the band Billy Pepper &amp; The Pepperpots in 1966) in order to continue her legacy. Just as with The Beatles, Avril&#39;s music endured a drastic overhaul in order to fit more in the style with of the new impostor so as to make her feel more comfortable playing her new role. Whereas The Beatles music became more complex with the release of 1967&#39;s Sgt. Pepper&#39;s Lonely Hearts Club, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Blow that shit out bro, In 1966-67 they started experimenting with drugs (weed, LSD, ect) and started playing their own things, hence why Sgt Peppers is so different. Frankly I dont give 2 shits about Avril, but don&#39;t fuck with the Beatles. Oh and the illuminati, really? That&#39;s the exact moment you lost me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we should look at this as a one off story. Maybe this one is fake. Maybe the Paul McCartney theories are fake. 
  I personally think that many individuals with careers as public figures are involved with replacements of their &quot;character.&quot;
   I&#39;m not an expert by any means but from what I understand, in the legal form, you could technically sell or transfer your &quot;public persona.&quot; This could give someone the ability to retire or disappear from public life but still collect royalties from their legally owned &quot;persona&quot;.
   This could answer why we see so many celebrities dying at very specific ages (it&#39;s just the legal way to retire and still collect $) It doesn&#39;t have to involve some voodoo of clones or anything. It could be as simple as hiring a famous impersonator 
   As a side note, I think Eminem has recently been replaced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If she was depressed about fame and hated the paparazzi for what they did to her, and she was determined to kill herself... why not do it in a way that hit back at her perceived enemies? She could have done it in a way that was a big &quot;fuck you - look what you did to me&quot; to the paparazzi and music industry.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think her record label would go to all of this effort just to continue &quot;her&quot; career if in fact she killed herself. Actually, she might have even been more valuable to them if she was dead. A lot of musicians die in their prime, from suicide or otherwise, and it generally makes them more popular than ever.</p>

<p>Interesting post though. I like these detailed ones.</p>

Britney didn&#39;t sell 78 million album <em>(frankly I&#39;m sure it&#39;s higher)</em> in just 1 year. Avril showed great potential for only 1 year of experience under her belt. She was undoubtedly the biggest seller of 2002.</p>

<p>Remember, the family will make tons of money after the death, but for the manager, that&#39;s the end of thier meal ticket. People have done far crazier things for far, far less money.</p>
