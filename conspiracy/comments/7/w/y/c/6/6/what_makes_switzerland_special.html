       Why is it always neutral? Why is it such a big center for international governance and economics? For such a small, landlocked country it plays an extraordinarily outsized role on the world stage.

       Switzerland wasn't always neutral...they once had the reputation as the best recruitment ground for mercenaries in Europe...that's why the Vatican still has "Swiss Guards"...they were seriously that good.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until the 19th century that you see Sweden start to move towards a more neutral stance. I think part of what helps them here is their banking endeavors- they became the vault of Europe, and in doing so guaranteed that others wouldn't infringe on their borders. The borders themselves are also highly defensible- mountain passes that are heavily fortified and rigged to blow at a moments notice. Since '45 the BIS has also been based there...which guarantees Switzerlands safety.

       Furthermore, few Americans realize the Swiss 1848 constitution is copy-pasted from the US' founding document. They are called "sister republics" for this reason. Power in Switzerland is extremely decentralized; it is basically a real-life version of
       <a href="https://mises.org/library/american-classical-liberalism-0">
        Lew Rockwell's daydream.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference is Switzerland's civil war didn't result in the same centralization of power as the American one did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Swiss are
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       covetous of their sovereignty. Their whole history is basically resisting against the ruling aristocratic families beyond the mountains, in Italy, France, Austria, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more firearms per inhabitant in Switzerland than anywhere else in the world, including Afghanistan and the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not discounting the Templars' theory ... I'm searching Swiss folklore for indications of this. For the time being I haven't found anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       But keep one thing in mind: you don't eat where you shit. It would make sense for the global central planners to come live in Switzerland, establish their multilateral institutions and international corporations, send their kids to school, etc. Because it is a small bastion of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that freedom is due (imo) to the rugged, armed-to-the-teeth Appenzeller who will defend his valley with his life, rather than the central planners themselves.

       Itâ€™s the neutrality that makes it special. Every major country in the world has money there and anyone who was foolish enough to attack em would be nuked to hell by the rest of the globe. Plus itâ€™s a very nice looking place imo

        Swiss Neutrality has its origins in the Vienna Congress of 1815 when the European powers after having defeated Napoleon agreed that it was sensible to have a neutral Switzerland in their midst. France and Austria originally planned for Switzerland to become a satellite state while Prussia wanted to integrate it in the German Bund. Because there were so many plans and so many competing interests, these powers ultimately agreed for Switzerland to remain neutral and thus the modern legal concept of state neutrality was born.
       </p>

       basically it was chosen by the greater nations to be a neutral zone.

       Neutrality means they refuse any foreign troop on their territory. To this day, it is a severe offense, if you are a foreign service member, to be wearing your uniform while in Switzerland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Neutrality doesn't mean pacifism. The Swiss army's mission statement is to defend the country's neutrality. They call this principle
       <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/armed-neutrality/29289102">
        "armed neutrality"
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       So they would understandibly shoot down any foreign warplane intruding in its skies, and imprison foreign soldiers fleeing in Switzerland (regardless of nationality).
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the conditions of detention were inhumane, and there is no excuse for that.

       Switzerland is the home of the Templars and Pharaonic/Black Nobility bloodlines. It is TPTB's banking HQ, and where true shot callers reside (along with the world's gold). The power structure of TPTB, imo, is Vatican-&gt;Switzerland-&gt;City of London-&gt;District of Columbia.

       Remember that if all roads lead to Rome, they carry on from there directly to Tel Aviv. After all,
       <a href="http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12909-rothschild">
        the Rothschilds are "guardians of the Papal treasure".

       There is deep-seated judeoskepticism in Switzerland, especially in the countryside; most importantly, there is huge reluctance towards
       <em>
        political power
       </em>
       in general. The average Swiss will recoil in horror at the idea of being governed beyond his valley, let alone from abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Swiss history (and that of its cantons) is basically one big fight against ruling aristocratic families in Austria, Italy, France - the Lombards, Savoie, Habsburg (who succeeded in governing part of the country for a while), etc.

       Few Americans realize the Swiss 1848 constitution is copy-pasted from the US' founding document.
       <a href="http://www.theswisscenter.org/sister-republics">
        They are called
       </a>
       "sister republics" for this reason. Power in Switzerland is extremely decentralized; it is basically a real-life version of
       <a href="https://mises.org/library/american-classical-liberalism-0">
        Lew Rockwell's daydream.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference is Switzerland's civil war didn't result in the same centralization of power as the American one did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Swiss are
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       covetous of their sovereignty. Their whole history is basically resisting against the ruling aristocratic families beyond the mountains, in Italy, France, Austria, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more firearms per inhabitant in Switzerland than anywhere else in the world, including Afghanistan and the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not discounting the Templars' theory ... I'm searching Swiss folklore for indications of this. For the time being I haven't found anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       But keep one thing in mind: you don't eat where you shit. It would make sense for the global central planners to come live in Switzerland, establish their multilateral institutions and international corporations, send their kids to school, etc. Because it is a small bastion of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that freedom is due (imo) to the rugged, armed-to-the-teeth Appenzeller who will defend his valley with his life, rather than the central planners themselves.

       its kinda a papal state, at the core of the holy roman empire, surrounded by not only vassal states of italy, france, germany and austria, but also the alps, jura and other mountain ranges, is an ideal spot to defend and to stash riches.
       <br/>
       home to its institutions, cultural artifacts, ideologies, home to many of the black nobilty families and proxies servicing them.  it was and still is a breeding ground of nwo, globalist doctrines, institutions, operative groups and ideologies (olympic committe and other international sport orgs, the precursor of the united nations, ideologies like zionism, fascism, communism).

       satanism and its derivatives (occultism, magick, secret orders) thrives since times immemoriam and is being reinvented and injected into the international stream of consciousness continously (like h. r. gieger of alien fame). it is of course mostly known as the home of private banking where the elites keep some of their wealth  and the bank of international settlements in basel the financial capstone of the world.
       <br/>
       its easy to see that the elites made switzerland their home and their original homes of venice, lombardia, bavaria, austria etc are all at an arms reach, its a cushy sweet spot.  they not only want a tranquil, private, effortless life for themselves, but also a place that facilitates their covert  operation, cooperation in the world and switzerland is ideal.

       National Redoubt (Switzerland) is a defensive plan adopted by the country in the 19th century that uses the Alps as a roadblock to any invasion. The plan allowed for fortification of the Alpine region and this plan was continued post-WW2 as the threat of a Soviet invasion was high.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Swiss military has wired the entire mountains and infrastructure, such as roads and bridges, to blow up in case of any invasion so the invading party will have to waste time and energy in finding proper entry routes into the country.Additionally, many tunnels, bunkers and fortresses have been built inside the mountains that are able to house a complete division of the army, thus acting as suitable points from where the military can efficiently bleed the invaders dry through a battle of attrition.

       The whole 'always neutral' thing is a national romantic 'fake history' thing that was really popular to make in the 19th century.

       Not to much except for the fact that they are the true cabal of the world when everyone is screaming it's the jews. When it's not true look at who guards the Pope,who financed Germany in both world wars.  And the fact that they have not been in any of the world wars even though they were right in the middle of it kinda makes ya wonder huh.

       Furthermore, few Americans realize the Swiss 1848 constitution is copy-pasted from the US' founding document. They are called "sister republics" for this reason. Power in Switzerland is extremely decentralized; it is basically a real-life version of
       <a href="https://mises.org/library/american-classical-liberalism-0">
        Lew Rockwell's daydream.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference is Switzerland's civil war didn't result in the same centralization of power as the American one did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Swiss are
       <em>
        extremely
       </em>
       covetous of their sovereignty. Their whole history is basically resisting against the ruling aristocratic families beyond the mountains, in Italy, France, Austria, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are more firearms per inhabitant in Switzerland than anywhere else in the world, including Afghanistan and the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not discounting the Templars' theory ... I'm searching Swiss folklore for indications of this. For the time being I haven't found anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       But keep one thing in mind: you don't eat where you shit. It would make sense for the global central planners to come live in Switzerland, establish their multilateral institutions and international corporations, send their kids to school, etc. Because it is a small bastion of freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that freedom is due (imo) to the rugged, armed-to-the-teeth Appenzeller who will defend his valley with his life, rather than the central planners themselves.
