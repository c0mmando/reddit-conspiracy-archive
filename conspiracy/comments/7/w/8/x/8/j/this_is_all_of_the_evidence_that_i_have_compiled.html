       Here is all the evidence I have compiled on Paul McCartney being replaced by a double.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an important motive for the intelligence agencies replacing him.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Paul wants to do music for JFK documentary
      </h1>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Mark Lane said Paul wanted to write the score for the movie, “Rush to Judgment.” Lane’s book raised many questions about the official story of the JFK assassination. If Paul had been involved, many more people would have seen the movie. The more people who questioned the official story, the harder it would have been for the powers that be to keep the lie alive. I think the Elite panicked when they found out Paul wanted to be involved in exposing the truth. I think they decided Paul could not be allowed to write the score.
       </p>
       <p>
        The LA press conference was Faul’s debut as “Paul McCartney.” The press conference was very odd. Reporters made mention of doubles, John and Faul made cryptic remarks about not being the real deals

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of evidence that he has been replaced:
      </p>
      <h1>
       His long time girlfriend spoke of an awful betrayal
      </h1>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Something so awful happened. Someone I’d loved for a long time I found out had betrayed me immensely. And I don’t mean infidelity or anything like that. Like, beyond belief. People don’t want to know what the truth is because they could never ever handle it. They would be too devastated.”
       </p>

       Skull differences that can only be explained by doubles
      </h1>
      <p>
       There are differences in the skull, palate etc. which cannot be explained due to ageing. The analysis was undertaken by experts who were initially skeptical of Paul being replaced.

      <h1>
       DNA doesn't match
      </h1>
      <p>
       There are court cases where children of Paul McCartney have sued for child support and the DNA test suggests either the children are lying, or Paul has been replaced with a genetically different person.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In 1962, when the Beatles were living in Hamburg, Germany and still unknown to most people, Paul McCartney had a brief affair with a German woman named Erika Wohlers. She gave birth to a daughter, Bettina, in December 1962, which was during the time the Beatles were starting to become famous. The Beatles soon left Germany, and McCartney abandoned Erica. Around 1967 McCartney agreed to pay 30,000 deutsche marks to support Bettina, but he was not admitting to being her father, even though she claims her German birth certificate identifies him as her father!
       </p>
       <p>
        Once Bettina became an adult, she asked a German court to have McCartney recognize her as his natural daughter. McCartney had to submit to a DNA test, and the test showed that he was not her father. Interestingly, based on an autograph signed by McCartney, together with some photos taken for the occasion, Bettina accused the person who took that DNA test of being a substitute for Paul, not the real Paul McCartney! The autograph, for instance, was signed by somebody right-handed (Paul was left-handed).
       </p>

      <p>
       Do you believe Paul McCartney was replaced? What other evidence is there?

       He grew the moustache to hide the scar from when he crashed his moped. That's one of the things people use to disprove the PAID stuff, because he got the scar in 1965 and still had it in 1967 (and for the rest of his life)

       It would be very difficult to exactly replicate that scar because he got it by tearing his lip open when he crashed his moped and then having a drunk doctor stitch him up because he didn't want to go to hospital, then it healed wrong and very slowly. For a while it was very swolen and looked like
       <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-72nuwgxma4o/UI0Rpozki-I/AAAAAAAAAEs/A0ahzYQgStA/s1600/paperback+chippy.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       until it healed into that scar which went inwards instead of stuck out. It would be near impossible to give someone an identical scar in the space of about a week when the first one took months to end up looking like that. There's no period in 66 or 67 when his scar looks swollen or changes in any way, and there's thousands of pictures and videos of him during that time.

       According to Quincy Jones recent revelations the double wasn't that talented.  I think he said Paul was terrible.  Not as bad as Ringo, who was sent to a pub while a session drummer nailed his part, but bad.

       Well, music is largely subjective, but I've been playing / writing / composing for 30 years, so I think my opinion is as valid as anybody's.

       What about Paul McCartney's solo work do you like?  I mean,
       <em>
        Live and Let Die

       was fucking brilliant, but the rest of his (pop) work is mostly forgettable and generic.  What songs in particular do you like?

       I do like Band on the Run, but Lennon definitely had a handful more decent songs. I feel like Harrison is heavily underrated though.. I had just discovered Wah-Wah recently and had that on repeat for a good hour or so.

       GnR (original lineup) ruined rock music until grunge came along in response and exposed to us just how shameful we had become - worshipping mega-ego drug / sex addicts wearing make-up, hairspray, and thrusting their crotches at the camera. We had gone so far into the rabbit hole of ego diarrhea that the response genre was to literally be covered in filth and sing about rape.

       While it's true they were at their best together, McCartney was the better talent. Better vocal range, wider range of vocal tonality, broader ability as an instrumentalist (which made his writing contributions more substantial, particularly in his bassline writing), broader range of themes in lyrics and music, got deeper into production and was overall more creative from a production standpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best Beatles songs are mostly the McCartney-led ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, my favorite Beatles might be A Day in the Life, since it perfectly showcases the brilliance of their respective styles.

       I disagree. The sax lick at the end of Jet is the opposite of presumptuous, it was an artist being an artist in an unexpected or unconventional manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not doing anything worthwhile then maybe abandonment of convention is presumptuous,  but if hundred bands are influenced by you and copy what you did differently because it affected them... Then you are a literal trendsetter.

       Pretty sure Quincy Jones is off his rocker because he signed Jacob Collier a few years ago and it fractured his psyche a little bit. He's still trying to make sense of his life.

       Peggy Lipton writes about her affair with Paul in her book. She doesn't say he "treated her terribly." She basically says he was sleeping with lots of women in the 60s (duh), she was one of them, she wanted to marry him, and he didn't want to marry her.
      </p>
      <p>
       And Quincy Jones, on his Facebook page a month ago, talked about going to a Stella McCartney fashion event and seeing Paul there, too. Quincy described the McCartneys as "family" and talked about how their kids grew up together. There was no bad blood between Quincy and Paul -- well, maybe after Quincy's dumb comment there is. ;)

       whoa whoa whoa, now I agree the Faul evidence is compelling, and you forgot Mal Evans, George calling him Faul, Revolution 9 backwards, a bunch of shit from post Beatle era; but I must inject myself immediately at this: what world is Ringo or Paul weak?! Ringo was the best drummer in Liverpool, a seasoned pro, and despite being the reason most drummers played match grip instead of traditional back then, his tempos, beats and understanding of feel as well as fills are widely recognized. Plus, he's frigging Ringo. Received the most fan mail, was the abassador of LA through the 70's, and speaking as both a drummer and as someone who has met him, he's the shit. No one else could play "Girl" or "In My Life" or any other of the Beatle catalog like him. His ability to play to the song and his fills which start on the left hand (despite being on a right kit-a tricky and unique style) make his parts on "Strawberry Fields" or "A Day In The Life" especially complex, depite their simplistic sound. 
As far as Paul (Discounting post Revolver songs), he played guitar, piano, drums, bass (which he is IMHO the gold standard as far as rock bassists are concerned. His lines are without equal in theor melodic, complexity and nuance), he wrote "I'll Follow the Sun" at 16, dreampt "Yesterday" and "Yellow Submarine" and wrote songs like "Michelle", "For No One", "We Can Work It Out", "I've Just Seen A Face" and on and on and on...I mean, he's the guy who PUSHED Lennon's genius and in the early years (63-66)Lennon's work ethic. NOW, the case for Faul is also mnade with Lennon's drop in productivity and leadership after 66/67, but if Faul is real, then The BEatles were lucky enough to have Paul McCartney AND Faul who was Paul, on steroids. On top of Lennon, Harrison, Starkey, 192 songs in 7 years, over 1.4 BILLION units sold and the reason most music anyone enjoys in any genre exists, between the innovations with 5th Beatle George Martin in the studio (I mean, Sgt Pepper was on a fucking 4 Track!) and the catalog....BEATLES.GOAT. Not even debatable.

       The whole Paul is dead thing is really beyond ridiculous. Where do find another left handed multi instrument virtuoso that can sing like Paul, play like Paul, write like Paul and look like him! Common already.  I recently watched him in concert a few rows back and it is the man himself still rocking after all these years.

       there are oddities re Faul, but the boys are known to be pranksters....Seen Macca 4 times, friends with Abe Laboriel Jr and his tech so, pretty insane viewing...He's the biggest alive, no doubt. Has written more #1 hits than any other human. Still commands your attention. When he goes, he'll get the dap he really deserves...Im a Lennon guy, but Macca has some of the best...Ram is one of my faves, and Michelle is my favorite Beatle tune this week. lol

       I think Lennon may have been marginally the best songwriter in the duo. Harrison brilliant as well of course. I watched a YouTube thing where they asked some huge number of musicians who was the better writer out John or Paul. Many said equal, but I totalled the definite votes and the result was John by a small margin.

       Quincy didnt mention a double, get real. The beatles were never considered virtuosos by anyone, they were songwriters. As a musician, there is no way you could play me a recording of someone else and convince me it was mccartney. I know what he sounds like, vocally, lyrically, and compositionally. There is no double.

        "The only thing I couldn't cure myself of was being left-handed. I do everything with my left hand, and no matter how I try I can't change the habit.

       <p>
        Here is Paul himself, in his own words and before his alleged death, telling us that he is a devout leftie and that everything he does is with his left hand.  Why is it then that in spite of this, there are a number of occurances after 1966 where Paul is picking up and/or holding objects with his right hand?
       </p>
       <p>
        There is an unusual scene in the Anthology 7 video / DVD where Paul is shown playing guitar right handed. The particular scene can be found approximately 50 minutes in where Paul is talking about writing the song 'I Will'. This particular song is playing as the scenes are shown. Of course we have to ask why Paul is playing right-handed here. According to the story, Paul's replacement William Campbell was a right-handed guitar play who had to learn how to play left-handed for public appearences.

       Left handed guitars were and still are more rare and expensive...just look at hendrix, who flipped his strat upside down. Paul probably had to learn right handed to begin with.

       He said he can play passably the other way around because everyone elses guitars have always been right handed:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I had to learn backwards. I can play right-handed guitar a bit, just enough for at parties. Hopefully, by that point everyone is drunk when I pick it up, because otherwise they're going to catch me. But I could do that, and the guys obviously wouldn't let me restring it. Certainly, they wouldn't let me gouge out their nuts. And at a party, you only want to play it for 15 or 30 minutes or so, and by the time you've goofed up their guitar and you hand it back to them, they've got to string it back again, and it's silly. So I had to learn upside down. It's funny: John learned upside down, too, because of me-because mine was the only other guitar around for him, if he broke a string or didn't have his. That's more unusual; left-handed guys can nearly always play a straight guitar. Actually, Robbie is very accomplished that way. He can do both. He can actually play pretty well: [in a stage voice] Dirty swine! The rest of us can just play passably, but he's actually pretty good the wrong way around.

       It's naive to take something he said as a joke in a teen magazine seriously, of course he used his right hand as well as his left.

       That's his opinion.

       I'm sure a higher percentage of people think the Beatles were talented.   The millions of albums they sold and all the number one songs they had would seem to support my statement.

       Just because the Beatles performed those songs does not neccessarily mean they were made by the band itself even if they are credited for them.
       <br/>
       Chart hits are usually "engineered" by record companies. If you don't believe it you can chase the white rabbit down the hole.

       most of that was before 1966 and 5 years into the British Invasion. they’d written all those albums by then. we’re talking Sargent pepper and onward, which if you’re a Beatles fan is an obvious shift in musical direction. they reinvented themselves after the India trip

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After the mid-1970s disclosures from the Rockefeller Commission about how much academic research into LSD had been funded or monitored by the CIA, some leading figures from the 1960s counterculture began reassessing what role the CIA may have played in the formation of their movement.  The first major public statements in the 1970s by countercultural figures to speculate on the relationship between the CIA and LSD occurred at an October 1977 conference at the University of California, Santa Cruz titled LSD: A Generation Later.  Allen Ginsberg, who compared the conference to an acidhead "class reunion," said, "Am I, Allen Ginsberg, the product of one of the CIA's lamentable, ill-advised, or triumphantly successful experiments in mind control?  Had they by conscious plan or inadvertent Pandora's Box, let loose the whole LSD fad on the U.S. &amp; the World?"
       </p>
       <p>
        LSD guru Tim Leary, who was also at the conference, addressed questions about the LSD/CIA issue with much more mischievious intent.  Leary said, "The LSD movement was started by CIA.  I wouldn't be here now without the foresight of the CIA scientists.  It was no accident. It was all planned and scripted by Central Intelligence, and I'm all in favor of Central Intelligence."

       Revolver was the beginning of their psychedelic music and that was 1966. She said she said, tomorrow never knows, love you to, I'm only sleeping etc are an obvious move away from what they were doing before. Then pepper and MMT took that further, then they went to India and came back with a double albums worth of songs that were more classic rock again.

       He called out the mob for killing JFK. That's probably PART true, but hardly all of it. McCartney was hardly a horrible musician, and it came out today that McC was romantically involved with Peggy Lipton, who later married Jones, and that Jones has always hated him for getting there first. He shits on Michael Jackson, who made Jones more famous than anybody, he claims he fucked Ivanka Trump when he was in his 70s and she was in her early 20s, etc. and so on.

       Jack Rubenstein was a liason between jewish mobsters, Sam Giancana, and various low-lvl mobsters JFK and Hoover couldn't reach directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rubenstein claims to have been the victim of a plot to kill him, while he was in prison, and did indeed die from fast-moving form of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rubenstein can't be shown to have worked for anyone in specific, so my guess is he was just another CIA asset Bush had control over.

       At that point, the Beatles only recorded studio albums. So without live performances, you can’t necessarily prove he played on the tracks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only live performance Fake Paul could have played at was on top of Apple records for their farewell, with the audience in the street.

      <p>
       I’m fairly neutral on this subject but these are all interesting topics. I just think the emotions that I’ve seen McCartney display towards their early years to be authentic.

       I don’t buy the theory but its stuff like reverse messages in songs and hidden symbols in album covers etc that is cool to me. Paul is the only one not wearing shows on the cover of Abbey Road, the license plate on car says 28IF - he would have been 28 if he were alive 😁

       So the intelligence services made the Beatles put a message in a song backwards just so people think Paul is dead but it's only there to discredit the real evidence of them who actually killed him. Gotcha. Makes no sense really. It's the same Paul. Dude still rocks shows. It actually might be 100% impossible to find another musician who looks exactly like him and can play every instrument at the highest of levels

       What about 90% looks like him and they do plastic surgery on 5% and don't care about the other 5% differences?

       Ok and the musical ability? So you then had to first off find someone who looks exactly like him, then on top of that, that person has to have top tier music ability? Ehhhhh. It's a fun one to believe in but it didn't happen I'm sorry to tell ya

       Oh my haha. And how many are as good as Elvis was? Paul was also miles above Elvis in every way as a musician. He played every instrument at the highest level and had one of the most distinct voices of all time. The odds are literally so slim it's impossible I'm sorry.

       I think you're vastly overestimating Paul's musical ability. He played in a pop band, and wasn't exactly a technical wizard. Beatles songs are super simple, even if iconic.

       Oh boy, this is a personal favorite conspiracy of mine. In fact, this was really the first conspiracy I ever got into and wasted many hours of my preteen years studying it. Anyways, I do not believe Paul McCartney died. Although his appearance does change drastically throughout the late 60s, there are still key elements that match, especially all the subconscious ticks he retains in interviews that you simply can't teach a double.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that the clues and symbols put into their music and album covers were deliberate and they stemmed from a harmless infatuation with the occult

       I don't have the exact timeline down but the time between Paul's death and the first filmed appearance of the "double" is very small, a month or less IIRC. Being able to find someone who looks and sounds like him, and is able to mimic the same subconscious ticks in such a short amount of time is impossible.

       This video compares an interview of Paul from August 1966 to one in January 1967. Depending on which version of the rumor you believe, there is only 3-5 months between his supposed death and the Jan. 1967 interview. Listen to the way he speaks in these interviews, watch how he moves his head when talking and how he uses his hands when speaking. This is obviously the same guy. How is it possible, in a space of 3-5 months, to find a person who looks identical to Paul, sounds exactly like Paul, get him to abandon his old life, take care of any loose ends involving friends, family and anyone else who might have known him (because he certainly would have been a local celebrity for his more than striking resemblance to one of the most popular musicians on the planet) and train him to mimic all the subtle ticks the old Paul had. Don't forget all the time you have to factor in for recording and writing music, which this newbie must have been exceptionally talented in if one of the first songs he records with the group is Penny Lane, released in February 1967.
      </p>
      <p>
       When looking at the timeline, I simply see no possible point where a double could have entered the picture.

       There were Paul McCartney look alike competitions. The intel agencies could have planned it for months.

       How do you know subconcsious ticks can't be programmed in using hypnosis etc?

       Get an interview BEFORE 1966 and you would have a point. Otherwise you are comparing Faul with Faul lol.

       The look alike competitions are mentioned a lot, but no one ever seems to have a source to prove any were held.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can get into the weeds and talk about whether or not his death was planned out but I think its pointless as you can't offer up any conclusive proof of that claim. I don't deny that the CIA could easily program people, but I don't think they could program in the musical abilities and whimsical creativity needed to compose a song like Penny Lane, which came out less than a year after Paul's supposed death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when do you believe Paul died? The most common dates are either September 11th or November 9th 1966, depending on if you use the U.S or British date system to decipher the hidden message on the Sgt Pepper drum. So yeah, the August 1966 interview would be the original Paul.

       REALITY: Such a contest was actually held, co-sponsored by an American teen magazine (perhaps "Tiger Beat"?) and Dick Clark of the TV show "American Bandstand". The winner of this 1965 contest was Keith Allison, who had a brief brush with fame on teen shows such as "Where The Action Is" and apparently later joined Paul Revere and the Raiders, circa 1966. The real Paul
       <em>
        does
       </em>

       Also, when do you believe Paul died? The most common dates are either September 11th or November 9th 1966, depending on if you use the U.S or British date system to decipher the hidden message on the Sgt Pepper drum. So yeah, the August 1966 interview would be the original Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know when he died but the article I linked said they were talking about doubles (the beatles and reporters) in August therefore I think you should be comparing pre 1965 interviews and post 1967 interviews.

       Besides the fact that Keith looks nothing like the person in the interview I linked, the guy seems to have had a life past 1966, recording music and playing in other bands. No chance at all he is the double.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the dates, I'm going solely off the story one can derive from the clues present in the music and albums, which would point you towards those two days in late 1966. Also, your link actually debunks all the common arguments of the PID crowd pretty well, so I don't know what you're trying to achieve from posting it.

       Did you forget that YOU brought up the competitions first? If that is how you believe a double was found, why do you immediately discredit the one and only competition known to have happened? Anyways, you still haven't hit on how the conspirators would go about getting the double to join the plot and taking care of the many, many loose ends that would exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you, it is dumb and yet its the foundation this entire conspiracy is built upon, so why do you continue to believe it?

      <p>
       I've already given you the reasons why I believe the timeline simply doesn't work for a double to enter the picture, now can you explain to me how songs like Penny Lane can be written and recorded by some random double they found off the streets?

       who wouldn't feel superior to a guy who believes in nonsense. i am supposed to respect someone even if they are blatantly ignorant? the answer is no. if you make moronic claims and defend said moronic claims, you deserve to be treated you like you're less. no one takes you seriously, at all. thats just the truth.

       “When Paul died, we all panicked!” claims Ringo, obviously very emotional. “We didn’t know what to do, and Brian Epstein, our manager, suggested that we hire Billy Shears as a temporary solution. It was supposed to last only a week or two, but time went by and nobody seemed to notice, so we kept playing along. Billy turned out to be a pretty good musician and he was able to perform almost better than Paul. The only problem was that he couldn’t get along with John, at all.”

       So he was killed because he was a JFK truther but the government knew  he would make a lot of money on royalties.  So in order to keep this "cash cow" they found a perfect stand in to keep the money train rolling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fyi,  all the money Paul has made in his entire career don't amount to much of anything for the government.  The effort required to pull this off wouldn't justify the return.

       Are you sure? Remember to the agents who control the operation they make diddly squat from their Government salary ... if Paul paid them millions through overpaying for art he bought off them or something it'd be a big deal to them.

       Handlers like that are the Government. Politicians are being blackmailed for pedophilia hence there is no oversight of the CIA. You remember what happened to the last guy who tried messing with the CIA right (Kennedy)?

       So MJ did get a replacement clone?  I guess there weren't any impersonators available./s
      </p>
      <p>
       MJ did own 50% of the publishing rights to the Beatles catalog.  Sony owned the other 50% with the option to purchase 25% of MJ's half at any time.  They had this option since they helped him avoid bankruptcy.
      </p>
      <p>
       After MJ died Sony exercised the option to purchase the 25% of MJ's 50%.  They also negotiated with MJ's estate to purchase the other 25% of the 50.  So now Sony owns 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you either think Sony killed MJ or that Sony did it for the government?  Sounds logical./s

       I know right. Wonder if the mass hysteria at the concerts was created through EMR mind control or something.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A key element in the creation of America’s drug counterculture was “The Grateful Dead,” a rock band that passed out LSD to people attending its concerts in the 1960’s. At their concerts listeners were encouraged to take LSD and to “tune in, turn on, and drop out.” An expression that instructed the LSD takers to abandon the modern world and join what McKenna coined the “archaic revival.”
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a recording of Dr. Timothy Leary actually describing the retrograde culture that those who dropped out would participate in:
. In this talk, Leary, Alan Watts, Alan Ginsberg, Gary Snyder and Allen Cohen describe how those that “tune in, turn on, drop out” would abandon modern culture and return to the status of a peasant.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         It is important to note that marketing and PR expert Marshal McLuhan, who had a strong influence on Leary and later McKenna, is the one who actually developed the expression “Tune in, turn on, and drop out”:
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        In a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was "given to him" by Marshall McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary added that McLuhan "was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, “Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,” to the tune of a Pepsi commercial. Then he started going, “Tune in, turn on, and drop out.”[14]
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         It is also notable that two individuals associated with the Grateful Dead were once employees of the CIA’s MK-ULTRA program--band member and lyricist Robert Hunter [15], and author Ken Kesey[16] whose “Merry Pranksters” were often at the Grateful Dead shows promoting LSD use to the “Deadheads.” Kesey’s novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest promoted the archaic revival by concluding with a heroic American Indian escaping from modern tyranny and returning to a primitive culture. Furthermore, Grateful Dead song writer John Perry Barlow, in 2002, admitted in a Forbes magazine interview ironically titled “Why Spy?” that he spent time at CIA headquarters at Langley.[17]

       "Beatlmania" was largely contrived though; their record label hired busloads of girls to come scream for The Beatles. McCartney wasn't a threat to the system anymore than Lennon was a political threat. They always played ball and helped to promote the New Age, wrote the psychedelic soundtrack for CIA drugs, and promoted Crowleyean morals of sexual liberation free from Christian influence. Lennon's death is still very suspicious, and like all hippy music, The Beatles have a strong occult influence.

       100% agree. Sounds like the killer was a victim of voice of god weapons turning him into an assassin.

       It’s interesting, but where is the evidence for William Campbell existing before and ceasing to exist after Paul died?
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot find any credible photos of him not being Paul. The only one I could find it is immediately discernible that his chin I’d different to “faul” with a slant to his right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, it could by surgery, but that’s the only thing available.

       If I was looking into this seriously I would approach it from the position of assuming it being true and finding ways to debunk it.

       What about gait - walking stride length style and arm swing? How about comparisons of guitar technique  and the theory of right vs left hand dominance? Does he use right handed ness post 67 in his movies and music videos.

       The CIA analysis technique looks at both hypothesis over a number of pieces of evidence. They have free ebooks on this let me know if you are interested.

       I don't believe this stuff really. But it really tickles the brain and is fun to entertain the idea, like ufos or Bigfoot. it's refreshing to see some more borderline fiction conspiracies posted here, as this is the type of stuff that got me interested in the first place.

       William Campbell is the supposed double. Aka Billy Shears. Considering this is a conspiracy you’re putting forward it’s something you really should know. I just checked the wiki for the Paul is dead theory and his name is there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven’t got any interest in looking further into it because I think it’s implausible for the CIA to go to go to such great lengths with a British act based on Britain performing under a British label to replace Paul when the band had already replaced Pete Best with Ringo, plus the evidence suggested is circumstantial at best.
      </p>

       DNA is he said she said, then the test came out negative, end of story. We only know what was said, not what happened or who her mother was seeing at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ears should only be inspected along the top and the even then his ears appear consistent in the photos I have seen. Another thing to consider is that the ears and nose continue to grow throughout our lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, I appreciate the offer and hope you enjoy the endeavour. It was a fun read for me, like the Avril Lavigne theory, even if I concluded a different outcome to yourself.

       I'm sure the CIA came up with that. It's called controlling the opposition by introducing fake info.

       I don’t find Stalin’s double implausible. Stalin and Dadaev is a well known and accepted case of literal body double, but that’s not replacement. Churchill used a body double to represent him in the U.K. when he went to Africa to meet Stalin and FDR in Africa. He didn’t stay in the U.K. and send his double to meet Stalin’s double.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hitler and Goebbels had doubles, too.  These are all well known cases of political decoys.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a completely different situation. T here is a huge difference between world leaders having someone pretend to be them for security/secrecy and a foreigner being killed and replaced in entirety... by the CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you think Dadaev was a CIA plant, of course. That’s a truly mind boggling proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the CIA were to replace a Beatle to stop subversive speech, why not Lennon over McCartney?

       I just read a much more plausible, if still, long shot theory that MI5 replaces Paul to prevent mass suicides by fans. But even that theory plays with dates, suggesting that the passenger of Paul’s crash was Heather Mills, who married McCartney in 2002. Problem with that being that Heather Mills was born two years after the crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Ringo comes out publicly and says it’s true, then I would seriously consider it, but as things currently stand there is nothing remotely solid about the theory, not least the progression of McCartney’s song writing and subsequent post Beatles career.

       I'm sure the crash story is misdirection by the intel services. I'm sure they just strangled him in his sleep or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder what blackmail material they have on the other beatles to keep the quiet?

       I wonder why no one ever suggests that the Paul McCartney disparity may be the result of a parallel universe slip?
      </p>
      <p>
       It probably happens more than any of us care to imagine. But since McCartney is such a public figure (and so well-documented) it's just easier to track the little differences. Most of us aren't photographed and filmed as much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember when David L. Wolper did his John Lennon documentary. He'd previously done documentaries on historical figures, Presidents, actors etc. He said that he was shocked by how much more footage existed of the Beatles than of any one else.
      </p>
      <p>
       So McCartney has been photographed from every conceivable angle. Whereas your mom hasn't been. Nor your teacher. Nor your neighbor from down the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what if one of them went to sleep in one universe and woke up in another?
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd never know the difference, because the replacement (also from another universe) would be almost identical.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a woman in Spain who had a fascinating parallel universe slip experience:
       <a href="http://www.ghosttheory.com/2016/01/12/lerina-garcia-gordo-the-woman-from-a-parallel-universe">
        http://www.ghosttheory.com/2016/01/12/lerina-garcia-gordo-the-woman-from-a-parallel-universe
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also millions of people who have been caught up in the so-called Mandela Effect (which is also suggestive of this phenomenon).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the thing: As crazy as this sounds, I really
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       suspect that the two Pauls are both authentically Paul. But that, technically, they are different people. Paul pre-1966 wrote guitar-based music. Paul after-1966 wrote mostly piano-based music.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paul pre-1966 stood about 5'8'', whereas Paul after-1966 stood about 5'11'':

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Their ears don't match when you align the profiles side by side:
       <a href="http://digilander.libero.it/jamespaul/show-case/profiles.jpg">
        http://digilander.libero.it/jamespaul/show-case/profiles.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       (In the latter picture, the bottom of the ear in pre-1966 Paul falls a little below his nose; whereas in after-1966 Paul, the ear is much higher up and tilted at a different angle. The skulls are also vastly different widths in profile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short: I think that Paul II is annoyed at the "Paul is Dead" rumors because, according to him, he's ALWAYS been Paul. (And so far as he knows that's 100% true.) He just hasn't "always been Paul" here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which leads to an interesting question: If "our Paul" is now I'm Universe #2, what songs did he write over on that side post-1966 that we've never heard?

       I experienced a "Mandela Effect" episode years before the phenomenon had a name or was popularized.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had a clear memory of politician Walter Mondale dying around 2003. Then I was reading a news article and saw Mondale allegedly writing an article about Barack Obama around 2012. At first I thought it was a joke. It had to be. Mondale had died.
      </p>
      <p>
       I checked Wikipedia. And to my shock, it listed no death-date.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to my memory, Mondale died about 6 months after Senator Paul Wellstone died in a plane crash. Panicked, the DNC rushed to try and fill the seat, so they recruited former vice-president Mondale to run for the open Senatorial slot. Instead Republican Norm Coleman won. And about six months after that, Mondale died.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remembered my wife commenting, "Good thing he didn't win; he would have died anyway."
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast-forward to 2012, and I'm reading an article purportedly by Mondale. Freaked out, I test my wife. Without telling her the issue, I said "Tell me what you know about Walter Mondale."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Like what?" she asked.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Anything."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Okay, he was Jimmy Carter's vice-president."
      </p>
      <p>
       "What else?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "He ran for President against Reagan and lost."
      </p>
      <p>
       "What else?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "He ran for Paul Wellstone's seat a few years back."
      </p>
      <p>
       "And then what?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "He died. Why?"
      </p>
      <p>
       My eyes nearly started from my head. After drawing her out, and getting more details, her memories matched mine exactly. So I hadn't hallucinated it. Or misremembered.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually had back-up. Corroboration.
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife and I also have vivid memories of Billy Graham dying and watching his funeral on TV. We both remember being freaked out at all the Presidents who had attended. We had no idea how powerful he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       So imagine our shock when he turned up alive again.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was my wife's first freak-out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Both episodes happened before the "Mandela Effect" as a phrase or pop culture phenomenon came about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as much as I know the conventionalist would say, "False memory" or "Coincidental recollection," etc., I know for a fact that that's a lazy copout non-explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what I know.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I suspect that parallel universe slips happen all the time. We're just generally not aware of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just that, now that we can document stuff, it's giving us more of a basis for comparison--and then the disparities start emerging.

       Jack Rubenstein was a liason between jewish mobsters, Sam Giancana, and various low-lvl mobsters JFK and Hoover couldn't reach directly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rubenstein claims to have been the victim of a plot to kill him, while he was in prison, and did indeed die from fast-moving form of cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rubenstein can't be shown to have worked for anyone in specific, so my guess is he was just another CIA asset Bush had control over.
