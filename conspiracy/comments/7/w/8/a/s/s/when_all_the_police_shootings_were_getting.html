<p>A summer certain faction of conservatives and their co-conspirators in the nations police departments tried their damnedest to get some riots going in &quot;urban areas.&quot; </p>

<p>The BLM name  was created to use to attack any and all African American protests and demonstrations, but especially the ones they  created with their own special agent provocateurs or actual demonstrations that were seeded with the fake BLM posers. </p>

<p>I posted a photo once of a demonstration where a couple of &quot;BLM&quot; sign carriers had literally got in front of an exosting demonstration with a big fabric banner, proclaming Black Lives Matter.  </p>

<p>The name itself is created to be an irritant, which of course the creators immediately followed up with self righteous and pious murmurings, All Lives Matter, unless they are Black.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We need awareness on the issue, but media is literally the devil. They twist and mold just one story into what it&#39;s not and won&#39;t ever actually tackle the issue in it&#39;s entirety. BLM is a wonderful movement that is also pushed to the extreme by some individuals. Only those events get coverage and that one event becomes the face of the whole movement. </p>

<p>Like when they asked white protesters to stand between them and the cops but not speak bc they&#39;re voices won&#39;t convey the African American struggle fully. The media twisted that protest into &#39;BLM using white guilt to shield them from police violence&#39; or some shit. The movement knows cops will be less likely to strike or push back if white people are in the front lines and it allowed the movement to actually speak to journalists and protest peacefully. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There will never be a FUCK THE POLICE movement in the United States.  I remember watching the show Cops one time, and there was this cop trying to handle a domestic violence scene when gunfire erupted in the darkness outside.  Rather than duck and hide, this brave cop drew his weapon and runs out into the darkness toward the gunfire!  It still gives me chills thinking about it.  God bless these brave men and women who give their lives to make our society.  For their sacrifice, they deserve the best our society has to offer.</p>

<p>Really, I am not sure what you mean by fuck the police.  Perhaps you are indicating toward something along the lines of:  fuck having an authoritarian government, and those who execute it.  People can get really behind a movement like this.  The absolute execution of the law is tyranny after all, and we are moving closer and closer to it.  Fuck the absolute execution of the law!  The messengers of that tyranny (i.e. cops), however, are pawns in a game that they do not understand the rules for, just like me and you.</p>

<p>Perhaps you meant to say FUCK THE POLICE BRUTALITY?  Also, a movement most Americans would support.  However, the missive FUCK THE POLICE will never garner wide support.  Ever.  So give it up.  This is not a conspiracy, only, people tend to like having a functioning society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree:  television shows about a particular profession tend to be propaganda for that profession (as opposed to other professions).  You are short sighted, however, when you view police officers as oppressors.  They are like fingers on the arm of oppression.  You really should seek their power source if you want to comment about the true nature of subjugation, for both the prisoners and the guards are in the prison.</p>
