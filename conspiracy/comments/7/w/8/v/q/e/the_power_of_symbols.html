       I thought I'd do a write up on this because I commonly see symbols dismissed as just coincidence, or that if you don't know what they mean, they have nothing to do with you anyway. There's a reason symbols are loaded into things like music videos, movies,commercials, ads, and even kid's shows etc. Because they communicate to your subconscious and unconscious mind. You don't consciously need to know what they mean for them to have an effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an explanation of these three parts of the mind, first popularized by Freud.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://themindunleashed.com/2014/03/conscious-subconscious-unconscious-mind-work.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever wonder why corporations have logos? They don't just throw these together. A lot of time and research goes into making them.
      </p>
      <p>
       "When it comes to developing a brand, logo design is king. The power of a logo to elicit an emotional response can have a resounding effect on the way customers and potential customers view a particular product, service or company. A powerful logo may look simple but there's nothing simple about creating effective logo shapes."
      </p>
      <p>
       Be aware that the logo shapes used to portray the most visible brands in our culture have not been chosen by chance – there are some powerful psychological forces at work. In this article we'll take a look at how the informed use of shapes can be used to give your logo the desired resonance."
"Our subconscious minds respond in different ways to different logo shapes."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/logo-design/psychology-logo-shapes-8133918">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The unconscious mind comprises mental processes that are inaccessible to consciousness but that influence judgements, feelings, or behavior (Wilson, 2002). According to Freud (1915), the unconscious mind is the primary source of human behavior. Like an iceberg, the most important part of the mind is the part you cannot see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our feelings, motives and decisions are actually powerfully influenced by our past experiences, and stored in the unconscious."
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.simplypsychology.org/unconscious-mind.html">
        https://www.simplypsychology.org/unconscious-mind.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now is it starting to make some sense why logos and symbols are so important to advertisers? Because they can actually influence your feelings, judgements and behavior without you being aware. Pretty important stuff to know if you want to influence customer's spending habits to say the very least.
      </p>
      <p>
       "A primary method for making sense of the world is by interpreting its symbols. We decode meaning through images and, often without realizing, are swayed by their power."
      </p>
      <p>
       For some in depth reading:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Seeing symbols within culture may help revitalize an ancient science and place it into a modern perspective. It could help make the study of symbolism a "science of the day" rather than a "metaphysics of the night." Modern symbols might then be seen in such products of popular culture as films, television programs, music, celebrities, toys and books. The elusive "zeitgeist" or "spirit of the times" might have a direct relationship to dominant media forms and technologies. Emerging technologies such as the internet might provide a modern symbol for the "zeitgeist" of the collective unconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
       This book is an investigation of these ideas and questions. It examines the archetypal cycles and patterns which form the "context" of the "zeitgeist" and simultaneously appear in the products, or "content" of modern culture. Jung's late theory of synchronicity may have application far beyond the isolated personal instances of ESP and suggest broad correspondences between consumer culture and the collective "spirit of the times." If there is a connection between personal inner states and outward events, there might also be a connection between collective inner states and cultural products and events."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Symbolism of Popular Culture, relates the symbols of Section II with the dynamics of Section III and shows how popular culture is controlled by the dynamics of symbolism."
      </p>
      <p>
       So next time you watch a movie, a music video, or an ad as just some examples, see how much symbolism you can notice. After reading the above, do you think it's an accident? Do you think it's beyond the realm of possibility that not only can symbols influence what you buy, but influence your behavior, your emotions, your judgements, and even our culture and society as a whole? Can symbols, if used correctly, and if saturated into our society enough, actually be a powerful form of "mind control?"

       Well no, it actually starts with BS (Freudian analysis was discredited
       <em>
        ages
       </em>
       ago) and then piles on more BS on top of it. That's a classic example of a Gish gallop. You start out with something wrong, then build a whole house of cards of wrongness on top of it, so people who don't know any better think you've said something compelling. In fact, it's BS all the way down.

       If you actually understood what OP was getting at you would see. To use terms OP didn't, what he is describing is memetic magick. The manifestations of ones Will into Reality with symbolism produced from and aimed at the subconscious. This is what all advertising is, from the McDonalds arches to the Nike swoosh, it's also found in religion. Take the Cross for example- it is a complex memetic sigil that evokes a predetermined set of images, emotions, and mental states when people see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the power of symbolism. Ignore it at your own risk.

       Heh. Call it nonsense and ignore it as you wish, I've established its connections to the "real world" via advertising, which is pushed and produced on a mass scale, by both private and public institutions. This is how they program the masses. A meme is simply a cultural symbol comprised of other cultural symbols, from a word, to a book, to a company logo. Each are used to evoke particular states of mind within an individual in order to achieve a desired outcome. This is based in reality far more than you realize.

       That is not what a meme is, no. If you want to believe that a meme is
       <em>
        anything,

       go read
       <em>
        The Selfish Gene.

       What is a demon, though? What is a spirit? If one assumes that a spirit or demon is merely a physical manifestation of a state of the subconscious, used to enact ones Will into Reality, it's not hard to see how a sigil could indeed summon a "demon".

       Interesting and informative post, RPF. I know just from businesses I’ve work with that the creation of the brand logo is not just “I like this one”. A lot of time and effort goes into them, as well as money.

       Now I can expand my knowledge on the subject, thanks!

       You're welcome! It's interesting to me that people see symbols in the form of logos all around them everyday, but rarely stop to think of how and why they're used.

       And that’s one of the key elements, to involve an emotional connection and response to the logo. I’ve had the pleasure of working with a couple of people creating logos and it’s a really interesting process.

       Ahhh that's interesting. I never looked at it that way, but it makes a lot of sense. It's no surprise that it's (possibly) encoded in the confederate flag given Albert Pike's connection to the confederacy.

       Great right up.  I've been thinking about this for a minute and i think you are absolutely right. There is alot that points to this being true.

       Really makes you think about stuff like subconscious programming, social engineering ECT.    A book by itzak bentov mentions in the 50s companies figured out They could flash messages on the screen so fast you didn't recognize they appeared, but you were effected subconsciously.

       Itzhak Bentov is brilliant. I just read "Stalking the Wild Pendulum" last week. What a coincidence (or as Jung would say, a synchronicity) that you mention him.

       Yes symbols can be a very powerful form of mind control in a society that has a collective mindset, in where individuality is repressed constantly. It sort of works like how when you think about doing something, because 90% of your thinking is muscle memory or subconscious memory and 10% of thinking is  the thoughts in your head. For people you can control there subconscious collectively by associating their conscious and subcinscious to respond and feel like everyone else when presented with certain symbols. But it is not limited to just symbols. Commercials, speeches, ideas, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It works like this associate the individual with certain symbols and certain feelings so everytime you see the symbol while thinking about it you feel a certain way simultaneously.  You keep doing this constantly and eventually it will be ingrained in the individual subconsciously. So the individual will always feel that feeling before he/she even realizes their feeling that feeling or aware of the source of the emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now think about that same formula on a massive scale. So everytime the collective mind(AKA group think, sheeple, large scale mind control, mass brainwashing, etc) sees a symbol they all react the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good way to see it in action is how the mainstream media uses North Korea to associate it with fear in the collective mind. The same manner in how people were scared of Russians in the cold war, Nazi Germany, AL Qaeda, Isis, Taliban, Terrorists the list goes on. There are a number of ways to cash in on that fear, possibilities are endless.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the best way to fight against such manipulation is to take Rick Sanchez's advice, "think for yoursrlves, don't be sheep.

       This is my current interpretation on symbology:
       <br/>
       Symbols represent fundamental conscious forces, mechanics, and laws of the universe. Spiritual and occult symbology may be the most "pure" or "true to nature" of symbols, but even symbols that are invented by man and then prescribed meanings can hold genuine weight to them so long as the intention that went into their creation and use was strong.
       <br/>
       Sociology after all is applied psychology, and psychology is applied biology, biology is applied chemistry, chemistry is applied physics, physics is applied maths, and all maths arises from geometry, which is what this universe is based in. On the most basic level, the very fabric of the universe is simply conscious energy acting through vectors of force.
       <br/>
       If you create a symbol that naturally resonates with the fundamental mechanics of the universe then that symbols will generally interact with the world in the way of the mechanic that it naturally represents (for example: Circle of life = unity of all things. Yin &amp; yang = harmonisation of duality. Pentagram = self-support/strength/protection against evil). These symbols can however be co-opted, subverted, or inverted etc to change or oppose the original meaning (for example: the inverted pentagram, or the swastika). They always have impact - be it either immediately conscious, or subconscious - but generally the significance of its impact is governed by the strength of the intent in the symbols creation and use.
       <br/>
       Furthermore, if one were to create a symbol for a specific use (let's take the infamous "boy lover" spiraling blue triangle symbol for example) then for it to have an impact the creators and users would have to always apply it and attribute it to that particular use. They'd draw it on the walls when performing the darkest acts of child abuse, and stick it everywhere they go like a graffiti tag, always thinking about and acknowledging the specific meaning every time they see it. And those who had been abused would also think about those same experiences later on when they see the symbol. It may not have an immediate conscious impact on those who don't know the symbols meaning, but it would have an eventual subconscious impact with prolonged exposure. Analysing it, you could attribute certain meanings to the shape and different aspects of it. The spiraling could represent fractality and recursion, like how the abused often become abusers themselves. The triangle can be representative of the all seeing eye. The blue can be representative of boys, as opposed to how pink is to girls. Whether these attributions are intentional, subconscious, or simply synchronistic, one can only speculate.
       <br/>
       But all-in-all it just goes to show the power these symbols can have. So stay mindful when using and acknowledging symbols, and please manifest reality responsibly.

       I think people like Julian Jaynes and his theory about older civilizations possessing a bicameral mind vs the modern unicameral mind, and Marshall McCluhan's "Gutenberg Galaxy" are great primers for trying to understand what is going on right now in regards to all of this stuff. Terence McKenna takes there theories further in random talks as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, prior to the birth of the printing press we experienced and processed the world through symbolism, hearing, etc. When the printing press came along and all of it's future ramifications... we began to mentally process the world in a completely different way and it shifted our entire consciousness and fundamentally changed us as humas. McKenna postulates that the way we process TV and internet is more in line with the symbolism of the past and the unicameral mind... so one could assume we are actually in a return to this older state of mind and the unknown powers it possesses. This rabbit hole is deep, but that's a start...

       Great point! It's part of what I was alluding to in the OP. TV "programming" is very powerful. Music videos are as well.A combination of rhythmic beats with symbolism speaks to our subconscious mind in a primitive way that people are not even aware of. I've noticed they've put more and more symbolism into movies and music videos. Whatever their goal is, they seem to be ramping it up exponentially. They're not even trying to hide it or be subtle anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       But as always, most people just dismiss these things as set design or because it's "trendy" to put these symbols everywhere. Which was part of the reason I wrote this post.

       Just look at the apple logo, most people miss it.  Adam taking a bite out of the apple from the tree of knowledge.  Apple technology company.  Hmmm wonder why people always have this subconscious urge to upgrade their phone every year to the latest and greatest version
