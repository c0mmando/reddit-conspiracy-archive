       I would also like add, although not a Netflix original Person of Interest is a great show. The premise is that a super computer is tracking every American in an attempt to "defend our freedom from terrorism, domestic and foreign".  It's very thought provoking. I also learned what plausible deniability is, and that seems to be how the the government is not liable for any infringement upon the constitution, by hiring private contractors. Also a lot of CIA talk.

       If everyone asked their close friends (those few who can say anything in front of you without self-censoring) whether or not they think LHO shot Kennedy, I'd wager that virtually all of them will at least admit that the official story fucking stinks. I'd even wager that most of them would concede that there's something very strange going on with 9/11 and the official story.

       The problem is that we're taught not to venture down forbidden paths too far or else we risk becoming outcast, so people shut down the conspiracy conversation before it ever starts unless they're absolutely comfortable talking with you about anything that comes to mind unfiltered.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that I think everybody already knows what's really up, but everyone thinks they're the only one who does. Only once everyone knows that everyone knows will the general public have the confidence to ask honest questions and hear honest answers. Until then, it's just much easier to shut down any talk about things that sit squarely outside our culture's Overton window.

       Has anything changed? The foundation of this nation was hijacked and built upon a conspiracy, no one dares fuck with that. If they do, they "commit suicide".  I should be clear, this conspiracy is not being perpetrated by just one country.

       While I don't think Netflix is in the midst of a 'truth movement', it is worth noting Netflix is perhaps the only major media player not included in that infographic. The CEO and founder is also still a major shareholder. Further worth noting that Netflix is seen by Disney as a major competing threat to the likes of Disney.

       More than likely they're feeding us just enough to keep us satisfied. They know it has a wide appeal and most viewers would end up seeking it out elsewhere if not on Netflix. They have some good stuff, but nothing really too eye opening imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've actually noticed a lot of their new stuff follows the same line as everything else in the media actually. Kind of bummed me out as I was hoping they would shy away from the overly "progressive" shit.. again it's simply based on what people want to watch. They spend a lot of money, they're not interested in mass awakening, just their bottom line.

       They’ve already been a huge part of an awakening. The turn to organic foods, clean eating, education on the American food system, etc has been dramatic over the past few years. People in their late teens through their thirties watched, and currently watch, more Netflix than anything else. It seems that way, at least! I know I’ve tried vegan vegetarian lifestyles because of food docs I’ve watched there over the years. This is all anecdotal, obviously, but i look at Netflix as a return to the original big three tv channel style beginnings of tv. There are hundreds of more options now, but Netflix seems to be the one major channel everyone watches and talks about at the office.

       Veganism is an operation to make the population weak and unhealthy. Humans are carnivores (yes carnivores, not omnivores), and the consumption of a plant-based diet leads to chronic illness and deformities (most noticeably crooked teeth, tooth decay, and poor eyesight).
      </p>
      <p>
       Netflix will host just about anything if they think it'll draw customers. They have no loyalties. Which I suppose is a good thing, at the end of the day, despite some of the garbage that makes it onto the platform.

       What part of our bodies screams carnivore to you? Omnivore is not a curse man! It's a blessing! Species like us can survive better in bad times because of this ability to source energy. None of the apes are carnivores.  I recommend you look at the skulls of omnivore mammals. And see what a lowly "omnivore" has for teeth.

       I say carnivore because we
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       eat plants, but we only
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       meat. There are many carnivore species that can and do eat plants.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our bodies are pretty bad at handling most plants, though. When our ancestors ate plants, it would either be very sparingly, or they would specially prepare them (typically via soaking, fermentation, or feeding them to an herbivorous animal to partially digest before killing it and retrieving the stomach contents) to make them more nutritious and safer for consumption . Those who did not do this special preparation would get fat/soft and experience tooth decay and other chronic illnesses. Their children would grow up weak, dull, and malformed.

       The advent of agriculture is arguably the biggest factor in the evolution of human civilization. The idea that we only need to eat meat is simply false. And the idea that people who eat plant based diets are suspect to more illnesses is also false. Regardless of whether you eat meat or not, your health is dependent on the quality of your diet and exercise. If you’re eating nothing but red meat you’re not going to be any healthier than someone eating only potatoes. You need to ensure you’re getting the nutrients you need, it’s that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your bit about “those who did not do this would grow fat/soft” is a fabrication. There is no way to verify this fiction. But you can verify that America has an obesity problem and that the significant majority of those people would classify themselves as meat eaters. And that meat eating has been linked with more diseases than fruits or vegetables. Processed meats and read meats are listed as carcinogenic foods.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another important fact that people often overlook is that animals do not create protein, meat has protein because of the plants that animals eat. So in that way, protein from meat is easier to digest because it is secondhand protein. And additionally there is misinformation about how much protein one person really needs.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I’d say that most vegans/vegetarians are changing their diet as a form of protest to the horrible practices by the meat industry. If people are eating meat that has been produced humanely and isn’t being pumped full of who knows what, I don’t think there are many vegans or vegetarians who would have a problem with that. But that is not the case for the most part.

       Modern fruit is like candy because we bred it to be like candy, and it will rot your teeth like candy too. If you want an example of how most fruit used to be, try biting into a raw, unprocessed crab apple. We've made fruit easier to eat and easier to digest, but we haven't made it healthier, so eating much unprocessed fruit is still a bad idea.

       Specialty markets are great targets for buy low/sell high type schemes. &amp; it’s a great distracting issue for regular folk to divide up argue about amoungst each other. Anything to keep us from uniting is an advantageous tool.

       He also dumped Disney stock. Does that mean Disney is reporting the truth to the American people? No. He also got rid of a bunch of shares in facebook and Twitter. His investment fund dumps stocks they think won't do well in the future and buys those they foresee doing great. It is reasonable to assume Netflix is going to surge in popularity even moreso than it already has.

       Almost every single stand up comedy special on Netflix touches on vaccines, Trump, and trannies, but they want you to love vaccines and trannies, and hate Trump. Now I do hate Trump, but what I'm saying is what are the odds that a majority of Netflix original stand up comedians share the same personal beliefs or that they would share the same beliefs and include them as talking points in their show? For example, I'm not saying they are all pro vaccine, but what are the odds that they are all pro vaccines and decided to talk about it in their special? Combine that with the odds that all three of the aforementioned topics are talked about, and I would say there is a significant difference between them and any randomly selected comedian not pushing a Netflix special.

       All I'm saying is that even if someone else wrote their jokes, it'd be more likely that the content is reactionary to what's in the news and not them creating the news.

       A statistical analysis would help by taking a sample of comedy shows outside of the Netflix platform, analyze the percentage of mentions for targeted topics, then compare the results to a sample of shows from Netflix.

       Hey OP. Don't fall for the contrarian view immediately. A lot of conspiracy theorists have a tendency to believe the opposite of whatever the general public believes, regardless of the evidence. I have a tendency to do this as well and I have to stop myself from that perception all of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider Snowden. As soon as his material became public and was widely reported in the media, a lot of conspiracy theorists immediately thought "if they are showing us this, there must be a secret purpose." They don't think about the consequences of the media
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       reporting the Snowden leaks. The leaks were public, so the media had to at least pretend to be enthusiastic about their release. Otherwise an even bigger conspiracy would be revealed to average Joe: that the media is heavily controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same concept is blinding people about Netflix. They assume since Netflix gained so much in popularity, they must be showing us propaganda just like the other networks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless there is evidence that Netflix is controlled, there is the possibility that they are showing us what would otherwise be featured on the television networks had they been independent from control.

       No I agree. I think the extent to which Netflix is independent from the media conglomerates, allows them to produce content that is different and even a little controversial. Their motive would simply be money, as people are actually very interested in conspiracy theories.

       Don't get me wrong I'm not saying they are bad viewing, I've watched one of the movies and it was good, I regularly watch foreign tv shows mostly Scandinavian or French, I don't have an issue with netflix having some on. But like I said it's literally flooded, it seems like over half the new content is Korean.

       People watch Korean cinema because it’s good. Train to Busan, The Wailing, Oldboy, Snowpiercer, I Saw the Devil, all of these movies are Korean and easily surpass 90% of American cinema in terms of quality and emotion.

       tldr: ask yourself the corollary question - why didn't they plant WMDs in Iraq? It would have been so easy. This is the smoking gun showing they WANT people to distrust institutions. To have a new world order, you must utterly destroy the existing one first.

       Interesting thought. The same could be said for the anthrax attacks. Why didn't the FBI "find" the lab at the bottom of the lake? Or why didn't they "find" residue in Ivins house? Instead, they came off as totally inept, draining an entire lake looking for an underwater lab.

       Ive actually used it as a tool to red pill people. I’ll get them talking about a show and then add in things like “did you know so and so actually happened in real life” or “did you know that symbolism from the show actually means this” and they seem a lot more receptive to new information.

       Well, you named one of the reasons they are making so many docs like that: Making a Murderer. That was huge at the time. It was all over social media, mainstream, talk radio, everything.

      <p>
       And if we've learned one thing about the entertainment industry, it's that they love a sure thing. They hate to take risks. That's why you get so many sequels, prequels, reboots, and whatnot. The people in charge are unoriginal hacks, for the most part.

       One tactic is to offer perfect bait to hook in your target. When the target is in, continue to offer the bait and slowly, but surely, introduce exposure to your desired programming. Some kind of variation of bait and switch, I guess.

       Well, we know there are at least two major power factions now; one that wants to continue oil dependency and one that wants to get rid of it. Netflix is sided with the faction that wants to get rid of it.
       <br/>
       So, it's possible that, whenever they have surprisingly truthful, revealing conspiracy films, it's because members of
       <em>
        team oil
       </em>
       are the ones being exposed in the film.

       most of "Why?" answers are money.  Netflix has a tonne of capital and has a weird business model wherein their content can just vanish.  Their own content won't ever vanish, unless if the lead in that content admits to jerking off in front of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       so yes, they're producing a tonne of new content, which happens to include docs, and those happen to include a few conspiracy docs.

       To lend credibility to the "larger" actual propaganda documentaries such as those whitewashing the pro-nazi western-led coup in Ukraine(there are 3 of these now, one Oscar nominated) and the false flag regime change operation in Syria(there are several "white helmets" docs which are Netflix produced now as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway this really is why. Notice that House Of Cards S3 has a "Putin" character. It is all state propaganda. They throw a bone to the "documentary" watcher with these uncontroversial but authentic content(more or less  -- Wormwood was very one dimensional and never explored the deeper conspiracy, and I've noticed this with many newer docs, none of them have novel content), the real objective being to lure casual viewer to the actual propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are handing out OSCARS for this shit, further validating it. The entire world knows that the White Helmets ARE the terrorists, one of them couldnt even accept the Oscar because his ass was on a no fly list.. This is a domestic propaganda operation.

       Check out
       <strong>
        Philip K. Dick's electric Dreams
       </strong>
       on amazon video. Every episode is excellent. "Safe and Sound" and "Autofac" are a must watch. "Autofac" shows a dystopian future destroyed by a conglomerate just like amazon. The fact that these episodes have been actually put out by amazon shows some incredible things. right now amazon video has literally tons of fantastic conspiracy, ufo and bigfoot documentaries on streaming. We all know amazon is a
       <strong>
        NWO
       </strong>
       company, but there is someone in the streaming video area who is a good person and is putting out significant, mind blowing truth.

       Look how popular this subreddit is.  The X-Files came back for an 11th season.  I can't imagine how many conspiracy websites there are.  It's a good investment.

       Veganism is an operation to make the population weak and unhealthy. Humans are carnivores (yes carnivores, not omnivores), and the consumption of a plant-based diet leads to chronic illness and deformities (most noticeably crooked teeth, tooth decay, and poor eyesight).

       Netflix will host just about anything if they think it'll draw customers. They have no loyalties. Which I suppose is a good thing, at the end of the day, despite some of the garbage that makes it onto the platform.
