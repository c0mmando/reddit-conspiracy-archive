       I dont care where you sit on the whole russia phobia spectrum, but posting politically and propogandistically charged crap in advice animals has been happening for a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       I distinctly remember there was no politics rule on that sub, but clearly it is gone. Like every other sell out media, even reddit is going down the propaganda path. I guess the powers that control reddit, and sold out to advertising and promotions (as we have seen on front page its a lot of product placement), they like much of the media now enforce political opinions, and no sub is safe (well I imagine subs that dont have critical numbers are safe, but general subs that everyone is subbed to are not).

       Reddit has been dying for quite some time. Not numbers wise, but with its ideals. The site Aaron set out to create is long dead, and the 2016 election cycle proved it. Problem is, there seems to be little consensus on the "next" platform, so groups like this one still cling on to the fringes of the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       In time, they will come for this community as well, just as they have so many others- r/sandersforpresident, r/politics, r/wikileaks, r/pizzagate. Alexis has stated they want to go public by 2020...r/conspiracy will not be aloud to stand as is, even with the insane shilling that increases on daily basis.

       Hmmm I'm not sure it's just reddit. Twitter and Facebook are very political now. It's hard to avoid. There was a saying "never talk religion or politics at the dinner table" now politics is all anyone talks about, that common courtesy not not bringing up politics is gone. I feel it's more to do with the internet and people being able to say what they're thinking without repercussions, you didn't used to be able to do that.

       The internet and its anonymity has existed in a recognizable form for more than 20 years at this point. What we are seeing with social media platforms is manipulation assisted by the useful idiots who buy into whatever they are selling- be it products or ideas.

       You're getting down-voted hard. And the clown you're responding to is getting shilled up. It's obvious what's happening around here. You made a fair and rational response, pointing out that he didn't even respond to the issue at hand but tried to make it seem like it's totally normal and expected for people to be doing these types of things even in places where it never used to happen (the entire fucking point of the thread).

       The left is losing, and they're brigading EVERYTHING. It's not about the left vs. the right, fuck the right, it's about the free mind vs. the left. Liberalism is a cancer on this country and it's not winning, so it's shadow-banning, it's brigading, it's attempting to dominate the conversation...

       Trump is the president and certainly doesn’t do himself any favor in terms of looking like a buffoon, so people are going to make fun of him. Some of it is certainly gonna be manipulation, but some of it genuine for sure. Are you really that close minded?

       It IS totally normal for people to make fun of the President. The majority of the country hates him, so if you like him, it's probably going to seem like there's a lot of hate out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you honestly believe that there's no organic hatred for Donald Trump? People have hated him for a very long time. The fact that you think it must be some shilled and inorganic hate is pretty telling.

       It's some out-of-touch dumb-ass' first meme and it's shit. Reeks of astroturfed political bullshit from some intern doing pro bono cyber activism, or some polisci freshman who's convinced they're a comedic genius for coming up with this brainless shite.

       I don't think it qualifies as propaganda when it's just someone making a meme. It's not like it's an organized effort from a hostile foreign power to subvert democracy by altering voter rolls and influencing vulnerable people via bot farms.

       I have a product.  I have a media platform to promote said product. It is within a profit motive to exploit that media platform to boost sales and demand for that product.
      </p>
      <p>
       I bribe politicians to make laws favorable to my profit motive. It is also within my profit motive to promote favorable politicians, policies, and to order my media platforms to do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       The admins are ordered by their parent company to manipulate algorithms, give weight to certain sets of controlled narratives and groups to favor the profit motives of stake holders within the company.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit is absolutely game the same as any commercial media platform. Reddit hurting for cash is a myth and an excuse. If Reddit was hurting for cash, then why take up being an even greater content delivery network with file hosting rather than just a link aggregator and message forum? Wouldn't hosting images and video dramatically increase costs?
      </p>
      <p>
       Reddit isn't hurting for cash because the investors who own this media platform profit off controlling the narrative to steer views and bodies towards a certain narrative that fits their profit motive. That is why political bot nets are allowed to operate and why major subs seem to be a broken record.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In April 2014, the Associated Press uncovered a secret operation by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) to create a Twitter-like social media platform through cellphones to evade Havana’s strict information controls and censorship of the Internet. It was called ZunZuneo, based on Cuban slang for a hummingbird’s tweet. The plan was to build a subscriber base for the network by pushing news updates on noncontroversial topics like soccer, music, and incoming hurricanes. Once the network had a solid subscriber base, it started to introduce explicitly political material in the hopes of organizing political flash mobs and causing a “Cuban Spring.” At its height, the network had around 40,000 subscribers, none of whom were aware that ZunZuneo was funded by the United States government.

       The top comment thread is like a microcosm of what has been happening in r/conspiracy for the last year. Garbage anti-Trump content gets mysteriously upvoted to the top because anti-Trump, the top comment is neutral and expresses concern for the quality of content and how it is seeking a lowest common political denominator, and then the sub upvotes a condescending remark labling the concern as a "leak from T_D" because it doesn't tow the line of groupthink.
