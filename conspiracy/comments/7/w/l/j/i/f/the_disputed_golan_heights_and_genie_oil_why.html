        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why does Israel keep launching attacks on Syria?</p>

<p>The answer is simple. Oil. The problem is that the oil resides in the contested Golan Heights that Israel seized from Syria in the Six-Day war.</p>

<p>The oil field itself has been reported to be larger than Saudi Arabia&#39;s...if true, that&#39;s all the motive needed for Israel to find some way to justify extending their military influence farther into Syria.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/middle_east/is-there-really-more-oil-in-the-golan-heights-than-is-saudi-arabia/">https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/middle_east/is-there-really-more-oil-in-the-golan-heights-than-is-saudi-arabia/</a></p>

<p>How will Israel do this? It&#39;s very simple. Under the guise of combating Iran&#39;s increasing footprint in Syria. Why do we keep getting told by our media that Iran is the boogeyman?</p>

<p>Well, let&#39;s take a closer look at Genie Oil..the company that stands to make one hell of alot of money off this and who they have going to bat for them.</p>

<p>Strategic Advisory Board of Genie Oil
<a href="https://genieoilgas.com/about-us/strategic-advisory-board/">https://genieoilgas.com/about-us/strategic-advisory-board/</a></p>

<p>Dick Cheney?</p>

<p>Rupert Murdoch?</p>

<p>Jacob Rothschild?</p>

<p>If those three names don&#39;t get your attention, I don&#39;t know what else to say. </p>

<p>Now take a look at the other &quot;players&quot; on that advisory board...take a close look at where they served, who they served under and what policies they played key roles in implementing.</p>

<p>Time and time and time again our media try to make things so complicated when it comes to the Middle East crisis...and time and time again we find out its really about resources and who gets to profit off of them...and time and time and time again...we find out that it&#39;s the same people over and over.</p>

<p>Do we have any reason to believe that Dick Cheney, Rupert Murdoch or Jacob Rothschild would have a problem with sacrificing American lives in pursuit of profits?</p>

<p>Not too long ago I caught an interesting article coming out of The Intercept that alleges that &quot;Phase 2&quot; of Israel&#39;s land grab in Syria is being implemented. I highly recommend reading it to understand the geography of the situation better.</p>

<p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/">https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/israel-syria-safe-buffer-zone-golan-heights/</a></p>

<p>Anyways, it looks like things are about to get &quot;complicated&quot; again in the Middle East...I made this post to help un-complicate things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is true. But what does a country absolutely need to pursue such a plan? Money...and lots of it. That&#39;s why securing the Golan Heights is mandatory at this time.</p>

<p>Also of interest is the Leviathan gas field and it&#39;s partnership with Texas-based Noble Energy:</p>

<p>This will be what supplies Europe with natural gas once Israel,  Italy, Cyprus and Greece complete their underwater pipeline:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let’s talk a little bit of history since you mentioned the six day war.  As Israel came to creation, drinking WATER and waterways was far more valuable than oil as it meant survival and prosperity for Israel’s citizens. It was Egypt that decided to close the Suez Canal (an aggressive move) Syria backed Egypt militarily and therefore Israel had no choice but to defend itself. Israel basically almost tripled its size after defeating Egypt, Jordan and Syria’s military in 1967. Israel gave back land in exchange for peace but unfortunately until this day, peace with Israel is never good enough and now the notion of OIL is used as an excuse.  </p>
