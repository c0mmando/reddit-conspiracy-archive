       Hey guys,
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if I'm typing this up in the right place. But, it's been something I'm confused about generally and would wanna know your opinions..
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a note, I'm a bit of a conspirator and am way too quick to judge before accepting any type of information that comes from mass media or the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, recently, I've been coming across articles that include the med Atrazine.. which is said to be distributed in our water supply. Apparently, the side effects of Atrazine are changed genes that make you homosexual..
AKA, they did a study on some frogs and gave them some Atrazine, and the same sex frogs started doing it up in there. So, basically, Atrazine messes with your hormones and creates a hormonal imbalance that results in homosexuality?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm wondering if this drug that has been revealed to be the root cause of homosexuality was created to further the elites LGBT agenda? AKA, Atrazine was input into people's water supply to make people gay so that it could rip the common/traditional family apart, create indifference and hate in our world (amongst Heteros and homos)
      </p>
      <p>
       Or, was Atrazine a hoax? Did they just act like they added some type of meds to our water supply in order to have an excuse /lie for homosexuality? Do they not want us to know that we can sleep with both men and women?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's talk about the metaphysical take on homosexuality.. 
I've read books and articles identifying that we have a masculine and feminine energy. Which is obvious. I read that the cause of homosexuality is an energy imbalance between your feminine and masculine..
(But if that's the case, isn't there a method to balance that out..? balance your energies through chakras and meditation? And possibly just "become" straight?)
      </p>
      <p>
       Now let's take a reincarnation take on it.. I also read that the reason for homosexuality can be that your soul / energy from your past life was in a males physical form.. So, when reincarnating, you still have most of the masculine energy. Apparently, going from male to female between different lives is a pretty big transition in energies so
I guess you could say it might take more than one reincarnation for your feminine and masculine energies to balance out?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let's talk about it from the perspective of evolution and human nature / anatomy.
I read some books and articles stating that before our time, females and males would easily partake in same sex relationships.. It was in their nature. Apparently, there's significant amounts of proof from ancient Egypt that the people of those times had same sex polygamous relationships. It was a normal thing. Like as normal as opposite sex relationships. They didn't talk about it, it wasn't up for debate. (Apparently it was widely accepted because sometimes there are some feelings / reassurances that women can give to women that men can't give to women - or vice versa)
Even talking animal wise, we have so many animal species that also partake in same sex relationships.. It's normal for them as well, as in, it's in their nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let's talk about it from a psychological perspective.. I wasn't raised in the brightest of environments. I mean, it was good.. but my parents weren't great.. and the men in my family weren't great either.
Maybe, from seeing their actions and seeing how vulnerable they make women, it made me mad and made me want to be in the place of power so I and no one around me would have to feel defenseless around men again.. Would that have been enough to increase the probability of me being more into women? Can it really be a childhood trauma and have to do with my mental health?
      </p>
      <p>
       If there's nothing wrong with homosexuality, why is it so frowned upon? Why do we not have the "genitals" to support same sex relationships? Can it really be used as a tool to further the elites agenda? Are we really just misfit test puppets for the elites to experiment on us with Atrazine? Can the books and articles I read about the metaphysical and humankind be falsified (also to further the elites agenda)? Or are we all stuck in the period of some childhood trauma that made us weak and vulnerable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry if this triggers anybody or anything. I'm having issues trying to cope with this all. I feel bad for finding women more attractive and more likeable than Men. It makes me feel shitty that people can say that I'm going against society norms. It makes me feel shitty that its so normal and easy to be a heterosexual couple, but life for homosexual couples is just hard and will always be insulted and frowned on, even if the people around a homosexual couple is accepting. I've seen it first hand from people who claim their really okay with gay people, but then go on and insult them. It's like, in the end, it doesn't matter. It's not "normal" anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another question this leads me to is.. How accurate is the traditional heterosexual marriage that leads to kids and a family? Is reproducing something that is a universal law when coming to this world? Or, are these all just some man-made beliefs..?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just confused. Would love anyones insight or take on it. Thanks.

       Atrazine doesn't "turn people gay". A human's sexual orientation is determined at birth in your mothers womb. So, in other words, you are
       <em>
        born gay
       </em>
       or not. Some, specially men, never realize this which leads to a lot of unpleasant, and misunderstood, consequences. That said, there are some environmental influences that contribute to whether someone is gay. Early childhood experience is a strong one. A person's very first (whether legit or not) sexual encounter is one experience that significantly influences sexual behaviour in adult life. However, the over riding factor is birth. Atrazine has little to nothing to do with it. Just hype.
Now, why is the catholic church (and by extension the Bible) against homosexuality? I think it has to do with history. 2000 years ago there were very few people compared to today. So if a man had sex it was supposed to be for reproductive purposes. Wasting good semen on recreational sex (such as gay sex) didn't create more people. 
Yes, homosexuality was accepted, and in some cases glorified, in cultures prior to our own. The Greek Spartan soldiers took a young boy, 10 to 14 years old) as his student in life. The boy was also his homosexual lover. Today we would call that a pedophile. But between that Spartan soldier and that boy, pedophilia had nothing to do with it. It was just the natural way of things. In ancient Rome many men had a young boy/man as a sexual partner and often went out in public with him. There was no issue with this. 
So, why is homosexuality frowned on? Conformity. The powers that run the world want everyone to be the same. This is, of course impossible. But it is the goal of those that profit from us poor folk being the robots that make them rich. 
Just my two cents.

       Yeesh. Is this why these great cultures all crumbled?  Too busy raping little boys to see the impending demise in front of them?

       This implies that pedophilia is natural and that using a position of authority to make someone your sex slave is all good because it's "natural".

       You clearly see things with a closed mind. First you need to
       <em>
        read
       </em>
       what is actually printed and not what
       <em>
        you would like
       </em>
       it to say. Regarding the Spartan Soldier, I said it
       <strong>
        <em>
         WAS
        </em>
       </strong>
       the natural order. You said it
       <strong>
        <em>
         IS
        </em>
       </strong>
       . You can't change a word of my comment and then thus its meaning just because it conflicts with modern day morals. IS and WAS are two
       <em>
        different
       </em>
       words. Ancient societies crumbled because of taxation, freed and war. Not because of sexual tastes. Read you history. And, you just
       <em>
        wish
       </em>
       you had an infinite amount of semen. That is not what my comment meant.
You are a
       <strong>
        moron

       We’re talking 2300 years ago dude. Why is it surprising to you that their values were different? Are you religious? I thought religion’s purpose was to instill moral law? What’s funny I guess is that philosophers have been speaking on morality since before this time period...

       If you haven't noticed the pro pedophilia agenda being pushed by Hollywood you're not paying attention. There's nothing natural about it. History is repeating itself before our very eyes.  Enjoy the collapse.

       While it’s probable external factors can result in a person “turning” homosexual there’s pretty compelling evidence that the vast majority of homosexuals are born that way due to chemical processes in the womb gone wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a study wherein pregnant goats were injected with testosterone during a specific window of fetal development. The resulting goat offspring was homosexual in nearly every case.

       Interesting. Thanks for commenting back.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it definitely is a chemical/hormonal imbalance, but that doesn't mean it's a defect necessarily, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       In which cases would a woman who's pregnant just casually take testosterone? I don't think any mother would have knowingly do that (not that it's a bad thing, just generally speaking)
Or, what events would have to take place for the chemical processes in the womb to go wrong..?

       I don’t think the intention of that study was to claim that testosterone during fetal development is the only way to effectuate a homosexual birth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it’s just more to demonstrate the impact chemical processes “firing” incorrectly can have on fetal development.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t think hormone injections are the cause of homosexuals, I think it’s just more likely that there is a low percentage chance that genes impacting fetal development can function incorrectly during fetal development. The low probability of this gene malfunction explains why homosexuals make up only a small percentage of the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexuality is only a “defect” to the extent that same sex attraction negates the ability to procreate without the specific intention to procreate i.e. having a surrogate or using donated sperm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Absent the procreation POV, homosexuality isn’t a defect. Homosexuals would be able to live the same life as anyone else if not for societal ignorance leading prejudiced actions.

       It might’ve been sheep, it’s hard to remember exactly, my highschool biology teacher went over it as a lesson, but that was some years ago.

       I think there’s lots of other studies on the impact of pre natal hormones though. It’s all interesting stuff.

       If you read the Wikipedia on this herbicide, you wouldn't be so quick to dismiss it as just "hype"
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to give you a massive rundown because you'll probably see my comment and not care enough to take on board what I'm saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for the sake of you changing your quickly dismissed opinion on something you haven't taken the time to even Wikipedia, you should actually have a read of the Wikipedia on said herbicide.
      </p>
      <p>
       But early 2000's epa says it's Ok no harm to humans, and each time every couple of years they slowly change their tune, by 2009 the studies the epa have done show that yes this herbicide has an effect on how hormones and the reproductive system works in mice male and female.
      </p>
      <p>
       The EU has banned this herbicide as it has contaminated water and they can not prove that it doesn't have a harmful effect on humans at such levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly in the US and Australia it is highly used in pretty much all crops and agricultural. From corn to soy to sugar cane.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'll ask you this question, if you had a kid born straight and not " transgender" but started pumping them with things made in a lab that effected their reproductive and hormonal systems it wouldn't have any effect on their mental conditions later in life?
      </p>
      <p>
       And bare in mind I don't say mental condition as in if you're gay your retarded or anything like that I mean how your brain is wired.

       It logically doesn’t make sense to put it in the water supply. There would be way more gay people at this point, unless there’s also a separate biological factor in some individuals upon which the chemical would act as a catalyst.
      </p>
      <p>
       Homosexuality itself isn’t a conspiracy. People have been gay for way longer than any of us can even conceptualize. There may be a “gay agenda” in the modern world but that’s a result of the divide and conquer mechanism, influencing people to identify with groups thereby creating me versus “the other” mentalities and creating conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Throw in the fact that the major religions forbid homosexual sex between consenting adults (which leads people to automatically believe that anyone indulging in that behavior deserves to burn in hell and should probably face ridicule and/or condemnation despite the fact that God essentially told everyone to mind their own fucking business) and you have a whole separate hate mechanism at work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn’t read your whole post, but to answer the question in the title, there are surely external effects that can influence sexuality. In most cases, it’s innate. Also keep in mind that sexuality is much more fluid than you probably realize. I’d say that a surprisingly large number of people would struggle to honestly say that they identify as absolutely straight or absolutely gay. Fear of the aforementioned persecution and social conditioning tips the scale to make it seem as though fluid sexuality is less common than it is.

       As a straight dude who lived with a gay couple and who's best friend is a lesbian I couldn't agree more. I don't understand all these fucks that feel the need to find a "reason" why people are gay. Being gay is natural and you are born that way, it's not a choice. Also the "gay frogs" thing is completely unrelated. Frogs will naturally switch gender if there is a shortage of one gender, those chemicals oddly induce that reaction among them. Don't even get me started on religious people and homosexuality, that shit pisses me off to no end. I'm not religious but for people to believe there is an all loving god who creates people predetermined to go to hell for their sexual preference seems completely nuts. But then again, that's a group of people who ignorantly think it's a choice... it's 2018 people, wake up to reality and stop judging people because they like different things than you.

       A technicality, but wanted to say genes don't change. Genes determine one's traits, such as brown eyes, brown hair, etc. The DNA coded from the gene can get damaged due to environmental factors or aging (there are other processes being studied as well). So basically when a cell gets it's DNA damaged, it replicates with the bad or changed information.

       i think its much simpler. BPA increases estrogen levels. from day one, we are drinking out of bpa bottles, eating food wrapped in bpa, drinking chlorinated water. media plays a big role as its number one job is to sexualize products and then socially we are being shamed for being horny so we sit in the perfect division and i believe these reasons alone are plenty for the increase in trans people we are seeing today.

       I have struggled with these thoughts too. I commend you for spilling your heart and taking time to express your thoughts on here using many perspectives and considerate words.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was nicknamed faggot by my older stepbrother before I even knew what the word meant. He and his friends used to corner me at six years old and force me to answer for my clothing choices, my behavior and my sexuality. They would chant taunts about my shorts, because to them my shorts were too short for me not to be a faggot. I was so afraid of them that I defecated behind a TV stand when I was trying desperately to hide from them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I share the story of my childhood because it affected my psychology as I grew up and discovered feelings for the same sex. I was sexually experimentational going back to preschool but I didn't ask myself any difficult questions until I was forced by my parents to consider my preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end I let go of the argument of nature versus nurture, and I realized some things about human psychology along the way. There are men who will have sex with another whilst calling him "faggot" and then forgetting the whole experience afterwards. Or women who delve into each other's bodies to explore their sexual heights, and then go on to marry men. The sexual experience of humans in general is wide and varied, but you are right, none of what has been deemed morally 'unconventional' is not found in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still there are some that argue that homosexual desire is akin to the morbid desires of beasts. That such 'corruption' is a curse on our higher nature that makes human into animal. So where do we look when we want to both understand and elevate ourselves to acknowledge our own light and beauty?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sexuality is a term that is deep and colored with a variety of meanings. It is part of a magnetism that draws us to other souls, and its allure embodies the desire for emotional, physical and spiritual connection. Yet this is different for everyone: one man's tingling is another man's falling in love.
      </p>
      <p>
       To distill the argument I think we have to see this all in the scope of relationships. The idea of relationships is a theme of every life, but, like sexuality, every soul takes a path that is different. Do our desires in relationships directly reflect the relationship we have with ourselves?
      </p>
      <p>
       To go back to my own story, I see now in my stepbrother a boy who was searching for a relationship of domination. To him, I did not just represent a small child, I represented a misfortune and a factor of the unknown. Still, I know with everyone that I have a way of tugging on their heartstrings. So to remove my own self-pitying ego from the situation, I see my stepbrother searching for dominance over a factor of the unknown. He did a clumsy job convincing himself that he knew what I was, but his actions are reflective of his own inner approach to unsettling new forces.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is quite typical of the man to define himself against that which he is not. In other words, man finds a sense of identity by identifying and labeling an adversary or opponent. This factors in greatly when it comes to sexuality, and it shows just how important the ego is to a man's source of power and eroticism.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, we can reduce all desires to one category. Desire becomes manifest in a myriad of ways, with sexuality being one of the most irresistible and deepset of these forces. When you see a person holding strong negative opinions about homosexuality, you can see that this is a manifestation of desire: this person desires to be "right with God" or to go along with the thoughts of the group far more than they desire to make an open and intimate connection with someone of the same gender. Even this man's desire is magnetism, because he is attracted to the notion that he is separate from others. In a way he is wrapped up in his own ego and magnetized more to the thought of building structures of certainty rather than going on explorations that he might see as dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you understand what I'm saying? Talking about the complexities of all of this can get very deep and seem complicated. If I haven't helped you grasp my perception of this stuff in its logic, then I will leave you with an idea that should be clear and simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       Man cannot resist his own desires forever, without doing harm and causing inward destruction of his own soul. Desires come about and appear in a lot of different ways, so it can be a fearsome challenge to go there and learn about your heart's true nature. People most intimately struggle with their own strange desires, so this is why you have such polarized reactions to the topic of sexuality. In exploring desire, we are confronting forces that seem wild and chaotic, so of course our reaction to being shaken may look like a choice of outer relationships, but it is really more telling of our relationship with ourselves.

       So watching porn makes you gay?

      <p>
       I don't think nofap advocates thsi.

       I also know that it's wrong. Being gay makes you gay, every bit as much as being straight makes you straight.

       I’m talking about desensitization.   You start out vanilla and five years down the line you’re watching gay porn.  I don’t know if that preference goes away if you abstain though.

       I'm not going to provide information that should be obvious. Watching porn does not make you gay. You are the one making the extraordinary claim, so YOU provide the proof that it does in fact make a person gay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I decline your challenge to quit looking at porn, primarily because it's not even relevant. First you're saying that porn makes you gay and now you're saying it's addictive.

       People read the part that confirms their biases. They gloss over, and instant forget, the part that contradicts their biases. In other words selective reading. People hear other people's words this way too. that is why people are said to be "thick". Don't be insulted, this is the way the majority of people are. Remember also that these people have an IQ of between 90 and 100.

       Having a chemical that makes people gay seems silly as fuck. Do you think there is a chemical that makes guys prefer tits, and another chemical that makes them prefer ass? Do you think there is a chemical that makes people have foot fetishes? No, because people are all attracted to different things.

       It's male hormones that cause visual and olfactory attraction to the female.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider that when a female takes a hormonal contraceptive, the body knows that there is a new chemical that shouldn't be there, this causes a reaction in attempt to regain the body's proper state by expelling the chemical through all available methods; urine, sweat, saliva, feces. Males living in close proximity to these females are ripe to absorb them.
