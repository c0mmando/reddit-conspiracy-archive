That&#39;s why the can operate with relative impunity, it&#39;s like a mutually assured destruction arrangement. Also why they pick up so many a-list celeb converts - they can offer protection from the other lot. Not for free, obviously... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I might need to rewatch Stoker from this perspective. I’m a fan of the Korean director and I wasn’t too fascinated by his first American film. Does it have any mkultra symbolism? I find it particularly interesting that Nicole Kidman is cast in films such as Stoker and Eyes Wide Shut and that her deceased father just so happens to have been accused of elite paedophilia. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO Hubbard was able to get in contact with 4th frequency beings but lacked  wide experience and knowledge in the area of the universe and spirituality, so he misunderstood many things, and thus his writings don&#39;t currently make sense in the context of how the universe is constructed and who lives there. Upper level beings are not all helpful.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s a &quot;pay to play&quot; thing, upper level books cost $10,000 and up. 
Salvation, or help, however you look at it, should not be sold, rather it should be earned.</p>

<p>Also I don&#39;t believe it was intended as a religion, but they did want non-taxable status, so they sold it as a religion. Then you get upper level leaders of Scientology who warp Hubbard&#39;s original teachings and the whole mess just gets crazier and crazier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The first time I talked to this guy and his wife, we had a really good phone discussion, and then she said something about they run their business according to the business methodologies of L Ron Hubbard.  That first call, despite how well it went, I just kinda told them I wasn&#39;t interested.</p>

<p>A few years later, he called me, and asked if I was still interested in a job, and I was, so I went to his house thinking &quot;OK, I&#39;ll just see what they have to say.&quot;  As I was sitting there, I noticed a file on his desk with the label ABCD (not the real initials).  I asked him &quot;Did you get that ABCD project?&quot;  He acted surprised and said &quot;Yes, why, have you heard of it?&quot;  I said &quot;Well, yeah, I wrote it.&quot;  (This was a contract I had done and abandoned because the customer stopped paying.)  Now, there was NO WAY he didn&#39;t know I had done it, because my name was all over the code.  I started to suspect he hadn&#39;t called me out of the blue, but called because he saw my name, maybe remembered me, and wanted me to finish the project and make him money at the same time.  </p>

<p>As I was leaving, he gave me a Scientology book of some sort to borrow.  I called him the next day or so and said I wasn&#39;t interested again.  I told him I&#39;d bring the book back on Saturday morning.  When I got there no Saturday morning, no one would answer the door.  I didn&#39;t want to leave the book outside to maybe blow away or get rained on, so I opened the door and I could hear the whole family upstairs in the kitchen eating breakfast.  I just left the book on the table near the door and got out of there.   Always wondered if it was some kind of test.  I was knocking, and I could hear the doorbell, yet no one answered.</p>

<p>&quot;When the word “Scientology” began cropping up in my searches in connection with Smothermon, I delved deeper, and suddenly noticed a shocking similarity, one that was clearly not coincidental: MRT’s Freedom Ladder is an almost direct replica of Scientology’s “Life Conditions.”</p>

<p>Both include the stages, in the same descending order, of: “Normal,” “Emergency,” “Danger,” and “Non-Existence.” Then, Scientology has “Liability, while MRT has “Injury;” Scientology has “Doubt” while MRT has “Uncertainty;” and last, Scientology has “Treason” where MRT has “Disloyalty.”&quot;</p>
