       I reckon they must have proof of all the grisly shit going on behind the scenes in Hollywood /govt (see operation snow white). That's why the can operate with relative impunity, it's like a mutually assured destruction arrangement. Also why they pick up so many a-list celeb converts - they can offer protection from the other lot. Not for free, obviously...

       Agreed. Stoker was another messed up movie seeming about elite families being screwed up (starring Nicole Kidman....who seems pretty messed up herself..why is she always in creepy movies?)

       I might need to rewatch Stoker from this perspective. I’m a fan of the Korean director and I wasn’t too fascinated by his first American film. Does it have any mkultra symbolism? I find it particularly interesting that Nicole Kidman is cast in films such as Stoker and Eyes Wide Shut and that her deceased father just so happens to have been accused of elite paedophilia.

       There are some creepy scenes but I maybe confusing with another movie (rich father kills kids he was abusing with a shotgun).

       The 80s movie The Believers with Martin Sheen was on TV recently and that has a political ritual cult child sacrifice scene at the end.

       IMO Hubbard was able to get in contact with 4th frequency beings but lacked  wide experience and knowledge in the area of the universe and spirituality, so he misunderstood many things, and thus his writings don't currently make sense in the context of how the universe is constructed and who lives there. Upper level beings are not all helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's a "pay to play" thing, upper level books cost $10,000 and up. 
Salvation, or help, however you look at it, should not be sold, rather it should be earned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I don't believe it was intended as a religion, but they did want non-taxable status, so they sold it as a religion. Then you get upper level leaders of Scientology who warp Hubbard's original teachings and the whole mess just gets crazier and crazier.

       I interviewed with a Scientologist for a job. At the time, he worked out of his home running a small software company. Actually talked to him a couple of times about jobs a few years apart. Spidey senses told me to stay away.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wound up murdering one of his employees when that employees confronted him about funneling large amounts of company cash to the COS.

       The first time I talked to this guy and his wife, we had a really good phone discussion, and then she said something about they run their business according to the business methodologies of L Ron Hubbard.  That first call, despite how well it went, I just kinda told them I wasn't interested.
      </p>
      <p>
       A few years later, he called me, and asked if I was still interested in a job, and I was, so I went to his house thinking "OK, I'll just see what they have to say."  As I was sitting there, I noticed a file on his desk with the label ABCD (not the real initials).  I asked him "Did you get that ABCD project?"  He acted surprised and said "Yes, why, have you heard of it?"  I said "Well, yeah, I wrote it."  (This was a contract I had done and abandoned because the customer stopped paying.)  Now, there was NO WAY he didn't know I had done it, because my name was all over the code.  I started to suspect he hadn't called me out of the blue, but called because he saw my name, maybe remembered me, and wanted me to finish the project and make him money at the same time.

       As I was leaving, he gave me a Scientology book of some sort to borrow.  I called him the next day or so and said I wasn't interested again.  I told him I'd bring the book back on Saturday morning.  When I got there no Saturday morning, no one would answer the door.  I didn't want to leave the book outside to maybe blow away or get rained on, so I opened the door and I could hear the whole family upstairs in the kitchen eating breakfast.  I just left the book on the table near the door and got out of there.   Always wondered if it was some kind of test.  I was knocking, and I could hear the doorbell, yet no one answered.

       Nothing much to speculate. It is a money and power machine built up on BS serving the interests of those higher ups in its hirarchy.

       Give it a few hundred years and if it still exists people will protect its idiotic beliefs because "it's religion" like they do now for Islam and Christianity etc..

       Military-style group imprinting, Secret prisons, money laundering...seems a lot like the Patriotic USA doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the US infiltrated Scientology in Operation Snow White, not the reverse. Nothing exists on the Continent without consent (or payout) to the US Military, they are the biggest gang on the Continent.

       I gave $1 to a nice gentleman who came to my door for the Dianetics book back in 1970. I read it and thought it was nuts. They still send me literature to this day. I have moved to several states and many residences. I can't see how this is cost effective.

       the below is a quote from the above article
      </p>
      <p>
       "When the word “Scientology” began cropping up in my searches in connection with Smothermon, I delved deeper, and suddenly noticed a shocking similarity, one that was clearly not coincidental: MRT’s Freedom Ladder is an almost direct replica of Scientology’s “Life Conditions.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Both include the stages, in the same descending order, of: “Normal,” “Emergency,” “Danger,” and “Non-Existence.” Then, Scientology has “Liability, while MRT has “Injury;” Scientology has “Doubt” while MRT has “Uncertainty;” and last, Scientology has “Treason” where MRT has “Disloyalty.”"

       Agreed. Stoker was another messed up movie seeming about elite families being screwed up (starring Nicole Kidman....who seems pretty messed up herself..why is she always in creepy movies?)

       There are some creepy scenes but I maybe confusing with another movie (rich father kills kids he was abusing with a shotgun).
      </p>
      <p>
       The 80s movie The Believers with Martin Sheen was on TV recently and that has a political ritual cult child sacrifice scene at the end.
