       not really sure how to start it but here it goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I saw a post here that insist transgenderism is not a real concept. this one below
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see how it even got to the second page and has a positive vote.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm fairly new to the sub and looked at other post regarding transgenderism. they also look very anti-trans, with even more positive votes.

       my question is what's up with the anti-trans agenda fix here? there's nothing wrong with being transgender. it is a real phenomenon. only problem I see here would be transgender children and what not. anything beyond that seems like personal opinion.

       its a reaction to the insistence that its not true by people suffering from it, and then being called homophobic or Trans-ist  for not sharing in their delusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       its frustrating and people get fed up with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       imagine talking to a schizophrenic who is insisting their imaginary friends are real and that your just being a reality-ist by not just accepting it as fact all day and suggesting that they get some help or take medication.

       Just like the soldiers themselves in the military are not the problem, its the brainwash system that causes people to think they are defending their country and that they are "patriots", when they are in fact slaves and blood sacrifices for the elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system that is causing young children to be confused about gender is the problem. It has an agenda behind it, obviously.

       Well, to answer your question specifically, it is probably the "runoff" anger from the agenda that actually does exist. Along with the typical "division" that is pushed in general. Another factor that is exemplified purposely is the fear, the fear of anything different.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an adult, the natural right is that a person may do whatever, or whoever, they please so long as it doesn't hurt another being. A person has free will and therefore has the right to do whatever they want within the bounds of not hurting another.

       I would agree with r/VeganSavage, that since trans people often hang out with SJWs, that there is "peripheral anger" towards SJWs in general, and thus trans people by association.

       I don't care what adults do. They can take all the hormones and have all the surgeries they want. I don't even care if a teenager identifies however they want and dresses however they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       It when it gets pushed that hormone blockers and hormones are necessary for young kids, and if you disagree then you're a bigot and a transphobe, that's where the line gets drawn. There is an agenda, and it's not just about kids, though that's the worst part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is trans people are a tiny part of the population, and humans are visual. If you look like a woman, people assume youre a woman. No one cares about cross dressing either. Hell, look at hair bands in the 80's. It was cool for men to have long hairsprayed hair and wear makeup. Nobody cares. You should ask yourself why it's been turned into this gigantic movement with schools even starting mandatory education programs about gender identity for young kids, like in Canada.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one has a right to be accepted. You can't force people to accept you. No one has a right to not have their feelings hurt. Why is so much of a lot of trans people's identities dependent on whether people accept them or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a trans guy (female to male) at my work. He acts like a dude, dresses like a dude, and doesn't ever talk about the fact that he's trans. He works in shipping throwing boxes, and everyone treats him like a man. I forget he's even trans most of the time. The only time he's ever talked about it is in the interview where I hired him, and his first day he said to everyone (in a joking manner) "Hey, I'm trans, got a problem with that, then deal with it." He has no problem being accepted because he's not out rubbing everyone's faces in how much he's trans and doesn't demand acceptance. He's just a dude, and no one cares.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to ask yourself why more trans people aren't like the guy at my work.

       Wwhat qualifies as anti-trans in your mind?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have zero problem with someone wanting to transition. Whateber makes them happy as far as I'm concerned.
      </p>
      <p>
       However the first 2 posts that you give as examples dont strike me as offensive.

       <li>
        <p>
         I dont agree that trans woman should be allowed to compete against a non-trans woman. Thats just silliness.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I do think its a mental illness. And i dont think that's too offensive to say. Most of us have some issues upstairs anyway.

       You’re definitely entitled to your opinion. My opinion is that threads like those promote an echo chamber of stupidity consisting of people who don’t know the difference between words like anyway and any way claiming to know the scientific implications of transsexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       But by all means speak your mind. Better here where maybe someone can break the echo chamber and pout out how crazy these beliefs are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some research and maybe you’ll see that mental illness is at best one of many possible causes for transsexuality.

       That's literally the single most offensive thing you can say to a trans person, so no, you're wrong. It's fine if you feel that way, but to say that to a trans person is the definition of the word "offensive". You don't get to decide what offends someone else, whether you find that offense to be valid or not. That's not how that works.

       Why would i walk up and say it to a trans person? Having an opinion on something doesnt mean that I don't know how to behave on a human level.

      <blockquote>
       <p>

I'm certain some trans people would be offended by it and you're right, i dont get to decide... which is why i clearly said that
        <strong>
         I
        </strong>
        dont think it's too offensive.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If a trans person gets offended reading this, they can be assured of a polite explanation should they ask. Since i've only ever met 1 trans person, they expose me to differing points of view, to my own.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you're interested, I'm not using mental illness as an attack or put down. I just think that a disassociation comes from the mind. I dont categorize it as something that can be 'fixed' with pills. As i said in my original post, if transitioning makes someone a happier person then thats great for them. They'd have my full support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given some of the more extreme reactions to the OPs post. I'm very surprised you've decided to come at me that way, I'm offering an extremely moderate point of view and the opposition to trans people disgusts me.

       Nearly every single trans person I see on twitter lists mental illness in their bio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, "trans" is now an identity in itself,  there are a bunch of people who don't actually want to transition from/to anything, they just want to be perpetually "trans".
      </p>
      <p>
       I have full respect and no bones at all to pick with people who feel they are in the wrong body and try to transition.  On the other hand there are people who are adopting the label like it's a fashionable subculture.

       It's a very common misconception that gender is the same as sex. Sex is the biological aspects of a person (male or female, as you're well aware); gender, however, is simply the intangible ideas of societal roles (man or woman) and identities that go along with a person.

       To be technical it boils down to context. "Which one is the girl" referring to gay couples.

       Somebody can identify more as a woman and have a penis but they are still a man. Not to say if a man wants to be referred to as a woman I wouldn't respect those wishes buy they are still a man.

       The r/conspiracy hivemind has different absurd obsessions than the front page subs’ hivemind, but it’s no more rational or humane when it comes to its targets. People love to anonymously be cruel and “edgy” much more than they care to apply empathy or deductive reasoning. I find the transphobia deeply disturbing as well, I very much hope these people confine their biased views on the matter to their internet life and don’t cause physical harm to people they don’t care to view as human beings.

       Why would you care what someone does to themself though? You don’t have to do any sort of body modifications if it’s not your thing, why does it matter if someone wants to do something to themselves that you, personally, would not do? Disagreeing and vilifying are not the same thing. You can be against something and still be decent to those you disagree with.

       Please, it's way past not mattering.  Now it is all about demanding access to every space they can.  Suing to be allowed access to a shelter that excludes people with a penis?  You lose me there, sorry.

       Perhaps it is because the shelter is geared towards people with vaginas who have been violently assaulted by people with penises by using natural strength advantage to insert said penis into various orificies on woman causing immense emotional trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF you are SO narcissistic that you need to stick your lady cock into a shelter designed for terrifed and abused women, have at it.  You will see your support diminish quickly and rightfully so.

       It is not the mandate of society to validate your existence, and it is certainly not the responsibility of a rape refuge to do so.

       Just because a dude says he is a woman it does not make him a woman. If I don't play along then I'm being called transphobic and homophobic. However phobia means fear, and I don't fear these people, I just don't play along their stupid games.
       <br/>
       How about I wake up one day and tell everyone that I am Prince Harry, even though in reality i am a woman from a piss poor country. Does that mean I am really part of the royal family? Can I pick up his salary too? If you say no then you are a transphobic and attacking my individuality.
       <br/>
       See, just because I say I am this and that I can't expect people to play along.
       <br/>
       Transgenderism is a mental illness and should be treated as one. Just as you don't play along the game of imaginary friends of someone who has personality disorder, you can not expect me to call you a woman when you are a dude. Transgender people should seek professional help, and no the usual answer that says "the only solution is transition" is bullcrap since you can not cure mental illness with plastic surgery.
       <br/>
       No one gives two shits about what you are doing in your own room, but don't force others to accept your mental illness in public.
       <br/>
       Think about it.

       I don't have a problem with
       <em>
        trans-people
       </em>
       . I have a problem where teachers and parents are telling young children as young as 5, who do not have the mental capacity to understand life-long changes, that they can decide they are not the same gender. Children are highly malleable and will do anything to please a parent, even make false sex abuse charges. The targeting of children who simply don't know any better is criminal.

       If anyone  understand brain development at all, they'd know that the human brain does not mature until age 25. That means executive functions, like long-term planning, and understanding the full consequences of their choices, only develop at age 25,
       <em>
        on average
       </em>
       , and many people never get there at all.

       The much more usual thing is the other way around - parents and teachers insisting that the child is the gender one would expect from what the doctor saw between the kid's legs at birth while the kid repeatedly insists they're wrong.

       We used to think homosexuality was a mental illness and so devient that people needed to be imprisoned and chemically castrated.
Most people now see sexuality as a spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess people aren't able to accept that a tiny percentage of the seven billion are born feeling as if they are the opposite sex.
I imagine it has always been around, just not understood like it is today. Would love to know if there are any cases of transsexualism in the history books.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know trans people on both sides, and apart from them being born one sex, there is not a single feminine/masculine aspect of their personality. You would never know that they were born as the opposite sex.
Each to their own imo. Can't see how someone else living free effects me in any way.

       Dressing up as a different gender and playing make believe that you can change your gender and wanting to mutilate ones body, is the very definition of mental illness.

       How is cross dressing mental illness? That makes 0 fucking sense. We came up with the gender roles that come with identifying as a guy or a girl and that includes what each gender is supposed to wear. breaking social norms should not mean there's something wrong with you in the head.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of trans people that domt necessarily want reassignment surgery, does that mean those trans people are ill? Again, at one point people thought wanting to stick your dick in another man's ass made you mentally ill and a faggot. How are you any different?

       It's not an opinion when there are biological males competing in women's sport - even in high school where they are not even taking hormones.  It's not a harmless opinion when a teeny tiny minority is guiltign the NHS into detaching pregnancy and female reproductive issues away from being female.  IT's not a harmless opinion when a women with a penis who is a known predator screams at a rape victim  bc she had the audacity to say that natal women and trans women have different experiences and then the women's march publicly defends the woman with the penis.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly have no issue at all with transmen.  They seem to be living their lives.  I have SERIOUS issues with a move towards self ID.  I also can not stand the transwomen activists that shout at lesbians that they are transphobic because they don't want to date someone with a dick and seem to think the world revolves around them.  It tends to be these transwomen who have no dysphoria associated with their penis and also these that demand access to shelters for women that exclude transwomen who have not undergone surgery to offer refuge to females who have been raped.  What kind of narcissist DEMANDS access to a place that is dedicated to being a safe refuge from males?  Do you really need the world to validate you so much that you think your own feelings are somehow superior in that situation?  Go fuck yourself with your lady dick  &amp; go compete in female races because in reality everyone knows you have a male penis and you only won the race because you are a male.

       The reality is reddit is majority white males under 30. Everytime I bring up this topic, the homophobia flares. Then they say dumbshit like homophobia doesn't exist. I explained what drag is once and was called a pedophile and told to castrate myself.

       I am anti-trans in the sense that these individuals should be seeking immediate psychiatric care, rather than blindly condoning it and allowing people to go down that path.  These people need help.

       That post is not anti Trans, it's just true. Muscle structures differ extremely between men and women of the same body mass, giving someone born male qn advantage in most sports. This hurts equality, it does not better it.

       Sodomites are nothing new.  They are just victims of the satanic Baphomet worshiping cults that rule the world.  They want humanity to be gender-less androgynes.

       Transgenderism is a mental instability that causes the individual to hate themselves so much they go through tremendous physical corrective surgery just to be something other than they are not. Its fucked up but we live in a world where people can be who ever they want to be. Even though that saying was always used for professions and job related titles but never meant to change biology or gender or race lile these idiots think they can today.
Sorry if a soldier gets half his body blown off amd survives but has no penis, we will still call him a man. But when some Joe Jinglehimerschmit thinks we should all call him Tiffany now because he had his dick inverted into his body , that is when I say Fuck that guy.

       You’re definitely entitled to your opinion. My opinion is that threads like those promote an echo chamber of stupidity consisting of people who don’t know the difference between words like anyway and any way claiming to know the scientific implications of transsexuality.
      </p>
      <p>
       But by all means speak your mind. Better here where maybe someone can break the echo chamber and pout out how crazy these beliefs are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do some research and maybe you’ll see that mental illness is at best one of many possible causes for transsexuality.

       That's literally the single most offensive thing you can say to a trans person, so no, you're wrong. It's fine if you feel that way, but to say that to a trans person is the definition of the word "offensive". You don't get to decide what offends someone else, whether you find that offense to be valid or not. That's not how that works.

       Perhaps it is because the shelter is geared towards people with vaginas who have been violently assaulted by people with penises by using natural strength advantage to insert said penis into various orificies on woman causing immense emotional trauma.
      </p>
      <p>
       IF you are SO narcissistic that you need to stick your lady cock into a shelter designed for terrifed and abused women, have at it.  You will see your support diminish quickly and rightfully so.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not the mandate of society to validate your existence, and it is certainly not the responsibility of a rape refuge to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously?  What kind of sick pervert SUES a shelter to demand they hire them because they are a woman with a dick?
