<p>The complicity between polarising media figures and Russian stooge Assange are pretty clear now.</p>

<p>I wonder what skeletons Hannity has in his closet that Mueller will use to make him sing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/julian-assange-thought-he-was-messaging-sean-hannity-when-he-offered-news-on-democrat-investigating-trump-russia/">Here&#39;s the original &quot;Fake Hannity&quot; story.</a></p>

<p>It was after Hannity&#39;s account mysteriously disappeared. Someone made a fake Hannity account and DMed Assange. Assange mentioned having &quot;some news about Warner&quot;. That article speculates that it was about the following, though:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Less than 48 hours later, Warner made headlines claiming that the Senate intelligence committee received “end-of-the-year document dumps” that “opened a lot of new questions” about Trump and Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who knows, though? Could have been a lot of things. People keep asserting it was &quot;dirt&quot;, but it could also have been something like &quot;Warner contacted a WikiLeaks lawyer with a request regarding the Russia investigation&quot; or something like that -- that would be &quot;news&quot;, but not scandalous or surprising. The question is intriguing, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to jump to conclusions about it without more information.</p>

<p>There was no evidence reported the texts were &quot;hacked&quot;. They were turned over to Senate Intelligence Committee. Each page says &quot;USSSIC&quot; (U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence) in the footer, and Fox News reported that their source was a Republican. Could have just been leaked by someone who had access to the files turned over to the committee. I know that&#39;s not as interesting as speculating about Julian Assange, but we really don&#39;t know that he was involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point with the Steele dossier was the Nunes memo&#39;s major complaint stems from the fact that democrats paid for it, so the content is suspect.  RT had a distribution agreement to (pay Assange and) broadcast his show.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what line you would draw around Assange and his contract with RT.  Perhaps he was a &quot;contractor&quot;, or just a service provider.  In that UBER drivers are technically not employees of Uber, they still work for Uber, just like Assange worked for RT.  To my point, there&#39;s no other distribution channel for Assange&#39;s show, and it was branded with RT&#39;s logo.  </p>

<p>I may not be correct on that previous assertion, so I welcome proof that I&#39;m wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assange produced a show independently and then RT paid him to profit off of broadcasting it. Political opposition of Trump paid for the production of the dossier, introducing potential editoriial bias at its very inception. That&#39;s where I see the clear difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a blurry line, you&#39;re obviously welcome to believe Assange is not a paid RT employee.  I would disagree.</p>

<p>I also am frustrated that the Nunes memo was released as it&#39;s interfering with Mueller getting the truth and alerting those under investigation that a warrant was issued.  I don&#39;t doubt for a second that, once in the white house, the guilty parties informed themselves of every facet of the investigation that they could, but that doesn&#39;t mean Bannon knew he was possibly caught on surveillance.  His answers might have changed not knowing that, much like many of Trump officials have changed their answers as truths are revealed, and that might have guided Mueller to investigate why he would have lied about something.</p>

<p>Whatever, I&#39;m no legal expert, I expect Mueller and his team to know what they&#39;re doing far better than I do, but it&#39;s frustrating to see so much partisan obstruction preventing revealing some serious wrong doing and corruption.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay sure, Realistically I think they will find some collusion, though it may be something as minor as passing on voter data to help Russia specifically target key areas for disinformation, </p>

<p>I think they will 100% find money laundering</p>

<p>I think they will bring down alot of his appointees of money laundering / accepting bribes and especially conflict of interest ex. the Davos family. </p>

<p>I think they will get obstruction of justice.</p>

<p>And if none of that turns out too be true than I and im sure many more people will sleep better.</p>

<p>But my biggest fear is that this new narrative of &quot;the deep state&quot; is a ploy to discredit the results of the investigation, in which much of his hardcore fanbase will reject the findings of the investigation which will lead to some very ugly and possibly bloody uprisings. </p>

<p>I saw it on worldnews and pointed out that it&#39;s actually a felony offense to impersonate somebody like that, and they were essentially praising somebody who&#39;d committed a felony.  </p>

<p>Strangely enough nobody responded.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think they said anything about this warner guy.  did they?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I don&#39;t agree.  Assange doesn&#39;t often get Russian material leaked to him, citing that Russia has its own Wikileaks equivalent that their whistleblower community turns to for leaks.</p>

<p>If he were a Russian agent, he wouldn&#39;t need to be holed up in an Ecuadorian embassy.  The entire premise of your claim is ridiculous, to be honest.  And judging by your post history, it&#39;s clear you are seeking to push a narrative.</p>

<p>Btw if you do a little research you will actually find that Russkies/Trump is inaccurate.  Many of the Russian bots have nothing to do with Trump.  Many that they talk about were actially for Clinton.  So grouping Russia/Trump together is a dishonest generalization.</p>

<p>It seems the leaks, specifically the Podesta emails, are Central to the idea that &quot;the Russians hacked HRC campaign to alter the election.&quot; With Julian Assange publicly saying yes willing to testify/interview about the leaks, it seems strange Meuller would have no interest in interviewing the man responsible for the leaks</p>
