        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Imagine it is 12 pm midday in New York in late September. The world is spinning on its axis once a day, but it also circles the sun once every year. In 3 months, it will be Winter and in 6 months, it will be Spring. </p>

<p>After 3 months, the Earth would have moved a quarter turn, and after 6 months, it would be on the complete opposite side of the sun, about to experience Spring. At this time, 6 months later, it should be in the same orientation relative to the sun, but just in a different location. In other words, if NY was on the sun-facing hemisphere at 12 noon in September, why wouldn&#39;t it be facing away from the sun after being on the other side 6 months later? </p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t our local noon switch from day to night every 6 months? You could only get a day time local noon the entire year if the earth was tidally locked to the sun, but it isn&#39;t, right? </p>

<p>Before you start hurling insults and calling me a flat earth idiot, just ELI5 and answer the question. I&#39;m not here to prove anything to you. I&#39;m here to get an answer to the question only--not to settle the entire flat earth debate. Thanks for your consideration.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>O I suppose it doesn&#39;t, good point. The explanation for that is that it&#39;s a nonsensical argument. Think about it like this:</p>

<p>At 12pm midday in new york, the sun is directly overhead, ie that part of earth is facing directly towards the sun. Every 24 hours the earth rotates on its axis, so 12pm the next day that part of the earth is again facing directly towards the sun. And the next day, and the next, to any arbitrary point in the future.</p>

<p>Or more simply, time of day is caused by earth&#39;s rotation on its own axis, time of year by rotation around the sun. The two are indepedent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude. If you even read the OP, you&#39;d know he&#39;s not actually asking about seasons.</p>

<p>Of course, the axial tilt is the reason you have seasons in the Globe model. Also, the axial tilt is a satanic inversion. 90 - 23.4 = 66.6</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Axial tilt is why we have season.  Op&#39;s concerns actually have to do with the difference between a Solar day and a Sidereal day.</p>

<p>It turns out that the day we measure has less to do with the spinning of the earth, but has to do with the relative position of the sun.  As the earth rotates, it orbits the sun.  For the sun to reach the same part of the sky, the earth actually has to do slightly more than 1 rotation.  This &quot;slightly more than one rotation&quot; is what we measure as a day, but what should really be called a solar day.</p>

<p>If we want to measure the earth&#39;s rotation, we should really be looking at the background stars to measure it.  This measurement doesn&#39;t care about our orbit around the sun, we get get a better measurement of the earth&#39;s rotation.  This way gives you a sidereal day.</p>

<p>Because these two numbers aren&#39;t the same, we see OP&#39;s observation in reality.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a great explaination I found:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s how I explain this to my students. There are actually two suns in the sky. One is responsible for causing objects to cast shadows and is the daytime star we&#39;re all accustomed to observing. Let&#39;s call it the &quot;true Sun&quot; or the &quot;apparent Sun.&quot; It, in effect, governs our lives. However, it has one main problem relevant to timekeeping, and that is that its speed along the ecliptic throughout the year varies. It&#39;s average (angular) speed is about 360/365360/365 deg/day or about 0.9860.986deg/day. Now, this variation is important because if we want to use this Sun as a prime mover for timekeeping, we have to be aware of the variation. It means that an hour, which is defined as one twenty-fourth of the time it takes this Sun to go from the celestial meridian around to the celestial meridian again, varies in duration throughout the year when compared to the same interval measured with a timekeeping device that does NOT vary in rate. As for the cause of the variation, there are several factors at work here. One is the shape of Earth&#39;s orbit, which causes Earth to move at different speeds at different places in its orbit. Of course, we see this as differences in true Sun&#39;s speed along the ecliptic because we&#39;re on the moving Earth. Another is the fact that true Sun&#39;s path, the ecliptic, makes a 23.5∘23.5∘ angle with the celestial equator, which also causes seasonal variations in true Sun&#39;s speed along the celestial equator.</p>

<p>To get around these problems, astronomers invented the &quot;mean Sun&quot; for timekeeping, and it moves at a uniform rate (not a variable rate) along the celestial equator (not the ecliptic). Both it and the true Sun have the same averageangular speed, taking one year to complete one trip around the sky (in different planes, however). Being fictitious, one can&#39;t actually observe mean Sun. Nevertheless, mean Sun is the prime mover that we use for all civil timekeeping. We can track its motion relative to the celestial meridian with a mechanical (or nowadays, digital) device called a &quot;clock.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, the variations in the true Sun&#39;s motion causes it to sometimes be ahead of, sometimes lag behind, and sometimes be neck and neck with the mean Sun. This variation is called the equation of timeand can be tabulated for any date.</p>

<p>When we say &quot;noon&quot; most people think of Sun being at its highest point in the sky, which need not be the zenith, but will ALWAYS be somewhere on the celestial meridian (yes, things get weird in the arctic and antarctic regions). However, &quot;noon&quot; really only applies to true Sun&#39;s motions. We keep time by mean Sun&#39;s motions, and a mean solar clock ALWAYS reads 12:00 when mean Sun is on the meridian. This moment, except for four days of the year, does not coincide with &quot;noon&quot; as embodied by true Sun&#39;s motions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An earth&#39;s rotation - or solar day - is about 4 minutes off of 24 hours.</p>

<p>365 / 2 = 182.5 days (6 months)
182.5 x 4 = 730 minutes (difference over 6 months)
730 minutes = 12.1666... hours difference</p>

<p>So, in half a year, the &#39;noon&#39; shifts by 12 hours.</p>

In this universe that is apparently random and chaotic, what is the statistical probability that the combination of Earth&#39;s rotation and axial tilt will produce a motion such that local noon is flipped perfectly every 6 months?

<p>What do you mean by &quot;perfectly&quot; here?</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_year">leap years</a>, that some people don&#39;t even know we skip occasionally every 100 years, and even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leap_second">leap seconds</a>, that are manually added to our calendars and clocks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I meant perfect in the sense that the celestial  events happen the same no matter the year. For example, let&#39;s say I stood you in front of a tree, facing one of those holes where the owls or squirrels live. Then let&#39;s say I spun you around but then also had you walk around the tree. Assuming that your spin is constant and assuming that your rotation is constant, what is the likelihood that you end up facing the same hole-in-the-tree starting point after one rotation? What is the likelihood that you end up facing the same starting point after a hundred rotations around the tree? Now let&#39;s assume that the acceleration isn&#39;t constant, and that you&#39;re slowing down. Again, if I stop you after each complete rotation, what is the likelihood that you are facing the same starting point?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a lot less perfect that it looks.  You have to keep in mind the way we&#39;re defining days.  One of them is directly tied to the earth&#39;s rotation, the sidereal day.  However, unless you look at the stars professionally, this is a really crappy way to define a day.</p>

<p>The other way to define it is by solar noon, when the sun reaches the highest point in the sky.  For a typical person, this is a much better way to define a day.  However, it&#39;s also arbitrary.  We just decided that &quot;when the sun reaches the highest point in the sky, we&#39;ll call it noon&quot;.  This artificial way of doing things ignores that some days will be longer than others, or that it doesn&#39;t sync up with our orbital period and a number of other factors.  It&#39;s a human construct, but a useful one.</p>

If it were a sphere with x circumference, then you could say the curvature is y feet per mile squared.

<p>Atmospheric Refraction.</p>

<p>But, I&#39;m wondering - let&#39;s take the calculations the other way.  On a flat plane, <em>everything</em> should be visible, right?  Nothing should be occluded, and you should be able to look across a lake and the only thing blocking the beach would be waves?  What&#39;s the lowest floor of a building you should be able to identify?</p>

<p>This is the &quot;seems like&quot; we&#39;re trying to avoid.</p>

<p>But, let&#39;s go back to your first example.  Given a flat plane, shouldn&#39;t a Pilot be able to see all the way to Antarctica they&#39;re flying above the equator?  On a flat model earth, what prevents a person high above Florida from seeing the boot of Italy?  If it is &quot;flat as a pancake&quot; - what <em>is</em> the horizon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for moving the discussion instead of resorting to attacks. It&#39;s a good question of why we can&#39;t see far on a flat plane (assuming there is no structure or natural formation to block our view). One reason I would say is that atmospheric conditions limit our perception of how far we can see clearly. A second reason I would say is that people just don&#39;t have eyes that can see that far regardless of any environmental conditions. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure how that fits the model when you&#39;ve already identified the horizon.  If the atmosphere is blocking the rest - are you saying the horizon should be higher on our visual plane?  That&#39;s the only thing I could see about the horizon being &#39;blocked&#39; by the atmosphere.</p>

<p>Take the pilot saying it looks &#39;flat&#39; - if the atmosphere is blocking him from looking further, there should be more land, except instead the pilot sees sky instead?</p>

<p>Is there anyway to show the math of where the horizon of a flat plane would be, instead?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s why we have technology, cameras, telescopes, etc.  An alternate model would have to take into account how a telescope that can, when mounted at the top of a building, can see &quot;X&quot; far at an angle, but that same telescope at ground level cannot see &quot;X&quot; far horizontally.</p>

<p>Or let&#39;s take a laser and a receiver.  Say I&#39;m at the top of Mont Blanc in the Alps, as 15k feet above sea level, and I aim a laser down at an angle.  And I take a receiver and move it away from the base of the mountain.  When does the receiver no longer detect the laser, and why?  Compare it to a laser on a commercial airliner flying at over 30k feet above sea level.</p>

<p>Now, take this thought experiment to the pilot.  A pilot looks out his window and sees, as you call it, the horizon &quot;flat as a pancake.&quot;  How would he see it if he could see Antarctica?</p>

<p>If it is blocked due to atmospheric occlusion - what <em>is</em> the horizon he&#39;s seeing?  As in, if the atmosphere is &#39;blocking&#39; something - you would need to take that into account.</p>

<p>Maybe I can illustrate it here.</p>

<p>Sky</p>

<p>Sky</p>

<p><strong>Sky</strong></p>

<p>Land</p>

<p>Is the bold Sky entry where the occlusion begins?  As in, the land actually should end higher in the pilot&#39;s vision?</p>

<p>Sky</p>

<p>Sky</p>

<p><strong>Sky</strong> <em>Antarctica</em></p>

<p>Land</p>

<p>Such a thing should be measurable - and less about how flat is &#39;looks&#39; to a random observer.  How does the math work with that?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You keep using the pilot example, but I no longer was. I think that&#39;s why we are miscommunicating. Anyway, I guess the horizon is defined as &quot;the location where the surface of the earth and the sky appear to meet.&quot; When you&#39;re standing on the surface of the earth, the horizon appears at eye level.  When you move upward in elevation off the surface of a sphere, the horizon drops down below eye level because the sphere is curving away from you and getting further below you. However, this is not what people report seeing when they go vertically up from the surface. What they report seeing is that the point where the sky and earth appear to meet (the horizon) remains at eye level. This is only something you would expect to see if the ground below extended out as a flat plane.</p>

<p>Example: place your chin on one edge of your dining table and look across it to the other edge. At this point, with your chin resting on the table, the other edge should appear at eye level. You may or may not notice the edge itself, but the horizon (place where surface meets sky) is eye level nonetheless. Now move your head upward vertically and watch as the other edge of your table drops below your eye level. This is what you should see happen to the earth. Now let&#39;s imagine your table was so extremely long that you couldn&#39;t see the other edge of it. Try the same experiment and you&#39;ll see that as you move your head vertically off the table, the apparent edge of the table will always be at your eye level, no matter how high up you travel. This is what I meant when pilots report the ground as looking flat as a pancake. They can see as far as their humans eyes will let them, which shouldn&#39;t be possible on a globe earth.</p>

<p>I mean, how about I say pilots repeatedly report the horizon dropping below eye level, just as you would expect on a sphere.  They never report the horizon coming up to meet at eye level, except when they&#39;ve angled their vision down.

<p>The pilot?  The identified pilot says &quot;have a good day&quot; and then the video switches to a monologue recorded over different footage.</p>

<p>What supports that the monologue is actually the words of any pilot?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and you&#39;re gonna ask me things you would understand if you had watched the video.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please identify something specific here, instead of being so vague.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well fine keep your blinders on man.</p>

<p>All I ask for is actual measurements to fit a model, as opposed to &quot;seems like&quot; &quot;looks like&quot; vague handwaving.  If asking for something <em>actually</em> substantive is &#39;blinders&#39; - sure, I guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say its noon in NY. NY directly facing the sun.  In exactly 24 hours, the earth will rotate so that NY is directly facing the sun again. And so on.  The earth doesn&#39;t rotate a perfect 360 degreesin 24 hours, it rotates so that the same spot is facing the sin, despite the arc on which the earth orbits  around the sun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, not really.  Humans just defined a day as &quot;the earth&#39;s rotation such that the same spot is directly facing the sun.&quot;  They didn&#39;t include the arc of the earth around the sun in the equation at all.  Humans then divided that period of time into 24 sections which we called &quot;hours&quot;.  That&#39;s why every 24 hours, the same spot is directly facing the sun, because we just defined it that way.</p>

<p>Think of this example.  If the solar system was a clock on the wall in a room, and the sun at the center of the clock, and the earth at the 12 o&#39;clock position.   Suppose NY is perfectly facing the sun.  We can also say that NY is perfectly facing the floor of the room, right?  In 24 hours, the earth has rotated, but it&#39;s no longer perfectly facing the floor, it&#39;s still perfectly facing the sun, but it&#39;s about one degree off of perfectly facing the floor.  In six months of perfect 24-hour days, the earth would be at the 6 o&#39;clock position, and NY would <em>still</em> be facing the sun, but would be 180 degrees off from facing the floor.  That&#39;s because we defined days as how long it takes to rotate and face <em>the sun</em> again, and not how long it takes to rotate and face <em>something else</em>, in this case the floor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a huge problem with coming here for basic earth science questions.  You don&#39;t know what their qualifications are, you might be getting people who have no idea what they&#39;re talking about as some of them very obviously don&#39;t.  </p>

<p>Our local noon doesn&#39;t switch from day to night because we define a day to be &quot;the period of time between consecutive appearances of the Sun due south in the sky.&quot;  In reality the earth rotates just short of 24 hours, it&#39;s really a little over 23 hours ad 56 minutes.  That&#39;s not helpful, because like you said noon would switch eventually (if I understand what you&#39;re saying correctly, which I don&#39;t think I do.)</p>

<p>It&#39;s 24 hours for these sun cycles because while the earth is spinning on its axis, it&#39;s also orbiting the sun, meaning the position of the earth relative to the sun would cause the sun to rise at different times if we based a day on the earth&#39;s axial rotation (which we don&#39;t).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My problem with your comments begins with you use of the word &#39;spinning&#39; instead of the word &#39;rotating&#39; and your use of the word &#39;circles&#39;, and later &#39;moved&#39; instead of the word &#39;revolves&#39; and &#39;revolved&#39;.</p>

<p>Now, on to your confusion and your question.  First, you must understand that &#39;noon&#39; is a completely artificial construct which is designed specifically to keep the sun overhead at a time which is &#39;roughly&#39; halfway between sunrise and sunset.  &#39;The time of day it is&#39; on any point on the surface of planet earth has absolutely nothing to do with the revolution of the planet around the sun; it is strictly a way to divide the time it takes for the planet to rotate, and to make an adjustment for the time it takes for the planet to revolve around the sun during the period of its rotation, into a practical measurement we can make use of.  That&#39;s all it is!</p>

<p>Reality is, of course, a bit more complex than any of us understands it to be.  </p>

<p>A planet&#39;s orbit is quite complex and there are several different ways to describe how long it takes a planet to orbit the Sun. We use the word year to describe the duration of a complete orbit of the Earth around the Sun. A year is about 365.25 days long, but there are four different definitions of a year, each is slightly different in length.</p>

<p>A sidereal year is 365.256363004 days long. It describes the duration of one orbit with respect to the fixed stars.</p>

<p>The vernal equinox is the moment in time when the Sun crosses the equator heading north which occurs around 20 March.</p>

<p>A tropical year is 365.24219 days and is the time from one vernal equinox to the next.</p>

<p>A calendar year is 365.2425 days where the .2425 fraction is because of leap years and leap centuries.</p>

<p>An anomalistic year is 365.259636 days and is the time from perihelion to perihelion.</p>

<p>The reason for the difference in the year lengths of the different years is due to the fact that the Earth&#39;s orbit is constantly changing due to precession and the gravitational pull of the other planets.</p>

<p>In fact none of the planets orbit around the Sun. Actually the Sun and all of the planets orbit around the centre of mass of the solar system which is constantly moving and usually above the Sun&#39;s surface.</p>

<p>Yet, when you go beyond a few miles, in many places you can still see objects in the distance that should technically be occluded by the surface of a curving ball. I&#39;m not sure what the specific rate of declination is but hopefully you understand the point I&#39;m making.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Atmospheric Refraction.</p>

<p>But, I&#39;m wondering - let&#39;s take the calculations the other way.  On a flat plane, <em>everything</em> should be visible, right?  Nothing should be occluded, and you should be able to look across a lake and the only thing blocking the beach would be waves?  What&#39;s the lowest floor of a building you should be able to identify?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, there is footage taken by cameras without fisheye lenses that show the surface of the earth extending in all directions and rising to meet the horizon at eye level, as opposed to curving away.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, let&#39;s do the measurements and not rely on &quot;seems like.&quot;  Assuming an aperture the size of whatever camera in use is, and the height, what is the expected curvature of the earth at the edges of such footage?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even pilots describe the earth from their view as &quot;flat as a pancake.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the &quot;seems like&quot; we&#39;re trying to avoid.</p>

<p>But, let&#39;s go back to your first example.  Given a flat plane, shouldn&#39;t a Pilot be able to see all the way to Antarctica they&#39;re flying above the equator?  On a flat model earth, what prevents a person high above Florida from seeing the boot of Italy?  If it is &quot;flat as a pancake&quot; - what <em>is</em> the horizon?</p>
