       I find it strange that after threatening the world with nuclear warfare and making it clear that they do not intend to stop their nuclear program that NK is being allowed to participate in the Olympics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who made this decision?  Why is our president going along with this?  Why isn't the media questioning the decision to allow NKs into the Olympics... esp. after norovirus outbreak?  Why aren't any athletes protesting this decision or speaking out?
      </p>
      <p>
       With the way the MSM is attacking Trump for anything they can, it would seem like this would be a good opportunity for them to portray him as being soft on NK... but they're not criticizing him or the decision.  Would be interested in hearing others thoughts on this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly... are the North Koreans being drug tested?

       Yeah, pretty much.  The US actually detonated thousands of nukes when they were testing...Russia too.  NK hasn't detonated one missile. Do you really think the US is scared of a country 1/1000th its size? Come on, its another bankers war.

       North &amp; South Korea have joined forces and are participating in the Olympics as just Korea.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last Summer Olympics someone was kicked out for not shaking an opponents hand after a match. He did it for political reasons. I think it was an athlete from Egypt that didn't shake a Palistinian's hand. Could be remembering the countries wrong though.

       Politics have no place in the Olympics.

       I saw a post a couple days ago which kind of made sense.
There is speculation North Korea is a CIA controlled state...I don't know if if go that far but everything fits.
Kim Jung Un went to a cia school growing up and when you see pictures of them in different facilities it looks like their technology is from the 70s..furniture, screens computers.
And supposedly they have nuclear capabilities?....I don't think so...
I wouldn't put it past Israel and the US to pull something like that off.
