<p>Just because you don&#39;t believe in a conspiracy doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a lie. Last I checked you, nor anyone else in this sub, were not ordained the &quot;Lie&quot; Police so you can rest assured you are relieved of your imaginary duty to look for and ridicule anyone you don&#39;t agree with.

<p>First image is lacking information. Could be a cropped image from a fish eye lense, could be edited, could be a perspective problem. Actually, the pictures on there are all things frequently seen on parody websites, so now I&#39;m 99% sure you are a troll. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The reason is actually fairly simple: the starlight is overpowered by the brightness of the sun and the Earth itself. The sun is a fair bit brighter from orbit than it is from here (after all, there&#39;s no atmosphere to dampen it) and the Earth acts like a reflective mirror, much like the Moon does. It&#39;s the same reason why you can only see stars at night.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Am a photographer, can confirm. You can try to expose for the stars, but the rest of the image would just be blown highlights. 
People who don’t understand the exposure triangle should get to know how these things work.<br/>
Same way you would make a gray backdrop black in the studio. You expose for the brightness of the key light, and underexpose the  background. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s take another moment to think about this. You&#39;re a photographer, right? What do you do when one part of a photo is too bright for another part of the photo?</p>

<p>Do you throw your hands in the air and curse the impossible situation? Do give the money back to your client/employer and tell them it&#39;s impossible. </p>

<p>Do you explain to them, &quot;Sorry one part of the photo is too bright for another part of the photo, so I can&#39;t expose the photo. You really need to learn how cameras work.&quot; ?</p>

<p>Or do you reach into your bag of tricks and get the damn shot?</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing that if you&#39;ve used your camera for more than a month you&#39;re nearly always getting the damn shot.</p>

<p>To think NASA and SpaceX are both unable to overcome this simple issue of exposure is bat shit crazy. They have yet to produce a single photo of Earth and stars that was exposed for stars at all, let alone properly exposed. I&#39;d gladly settle for a blown out Earth or Moon to see the rest of the Milky way shining bright. </p>

<p>For anyone who knows nothing about photography, this don&#39;t believe this often repeated lie. There&#39;s a few ways to overcome this exposure situation before getting too creative. <a href="https://digital-photography-school.com/using-graduated-neutral-density-filters-for-landscape-photography/">Here&#39;s</a>  one way that just about every intro to photography course/book covers. </p>

<p>It&#39;s all a bunch of bullshit. </p>

<p>The Titanic movie was released in 1997. <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2125209/Youve-got-wrong-sky-How-James-Cameron-altered-night-sky-reworked-Titanic-3D-years-complaints-outspoken-astronomer.html">The stars in the original movie were wrong</a>. Not until 2012, for the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic did <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/james-cameron-re-edited-star-constellation-at-end-of-titanic-at-astrophysicists-request-2012-4">James Cameron re-edit the scene towards the end with the correct astrological constellations</a>. </p>

<p>So no, James Cameron didn&#39;t have the stars correct on the original Titanic version.</p>

Is there a video of this car leaving the spacecraft? Canopy opens-yes...then what? it&#39;s in space forever? We cant get a view from the car to show it leaving the canopy bay? Come on SpaceX we need more thrusters if we want those FlatEarthers to shut up. We need that video...just show them the car from the car view back to the canopy....just show them....then we will forever shut them up.....Loading video now....what?.....we dont have it????
