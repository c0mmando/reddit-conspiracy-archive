       Always a lot of talk on here about deep state, Rothschilds, etc.  I'm curious where you think, in a few paragraphs, we are truly at in history - whether that be in the history of the US or the history of mankind.

       Genuinely curious to hear your truths.

       I like to think we are on the cusp of a new society.  Where government is recognized for what it is. Just a group of liars selling our Liberty for money and more power, responsible for every bad thing happening around the world.  This includes every faucet of my government, as well.  Especially mine actually.  More and more people are waking up to this. We need more people to recognize how incompetent and corrupt it is. It's time to she'd these massive, grossly expensive top-down foreign entities and settle on a localized government that can't hide from its constituents in it's own foreign city.

       I believe this is a local maxima in humanity's evolution on Earth. The younger-dryas research undeniably displays evidence that humanity's peak civilization prior to 12,000 years ago was completely erased from the surface of the planet. Plato pegged Atlantis' fall around this time period and I think it's for a reason. One of the tricks being played on the consciousness of society today is that we are the greatest to have ever existed and we are the peak of humanity.

       A dumbed down society, being hidden from the advanced technology that was held so dear by those farther back than anyone would and could expect. Pyramids being hidden in plain sight, similar signs olf gods, advanced calendars, such as the ones that the Mayans put out. We have so much more, but those in "power" decide to hide it.

       We are living in the end times. Not biblical or anything like that (though maybe?) but more in terms of us being on the cusp of creating a superintelligence that will forever change what it means to be human.

       Sincerely worried that we're rapidly approaching a grand finale. Hardly anyone seems to care about the risk of nuclear war anymore. We invented world-ending weapons, were terrified for awhile someone would use them, made it through the Cold War alive by the skin of our teeth -- with more close calls than most people realize -- and have since developed an false sense of invulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that the (entirely rational and appropriate) fear has faded, we're in an unprecedentedly dangerous situation where an unpredictable, narcissistic POTUS is being constantly goaded to show how tough on Russia he really is, where any move whatsoever toward detente with Russia is portrayed as proof he's Putin's puppet. Absolutely terrifying.

       A tipping point.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're not there yet, but sometime within the relatively near future, as in 100 years or so, humanity as a whole is going to reach a point of no return where it has to decide where it needs to go to survive. This is a very vague description, but everything that has happened within the last 100+ years or so is leading up to this. The depletion of natural resources, the ever increasing wealth inequality, insurmountable debts, never-ending wars, a "connected" world that just becomes more and more divided as time goes on, loss of jobs to automation, refugee crises, etc. No matter where you stand on whatever issues, you have to realize that the direction we are heading is not sustainable long-term.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if this will happen in any of our lifetimes, but I think its bound to happen at some point. And it's going to be up to us to determine if we are going to persist or perish like civilizations before us.

       I think we are at a really critical moment. After WWII, TPTB have greatly consolidated their power. There is some infighting, but I think they have had a great level of control for some time now. They have been able to carefully tailor propaganda to the masses, with the masses being mostly compliant and unaware.

       However, this all changed with the advent of the internet. I don't think they anticipated how the internet would allow for the free flow of ideas, and it makes it significantly harder for TPTB to keep their propaganda and lies from being threatened by the truth. They've tried and, thus far, failed to control the internet. They've resorted to disgusting things like shills, which we see plenty in this very sub.

       Now, people are finally starting to wake up, and Popularism and Nationalism are spreading around the world like wildfire. Most people now see how the Globalists are fighting against the will of the people. The more people that can wake up from their propaganda-induced dream, the better chance we have of winning this war.

       We're at the last vestiges of separate nations. A couple more wars is all thats needed to get rid of any outliers and then there will be an announcement that aliens are real or some other disaster is happening and that we have to unite as a world for the human race to survive. At this point all countries will be replaced by one single federal government.

       People remain asleep because their lives are relatively comfortable, to varying degrees. There's no reason to panic when your life is pretty okay.

       But at some point its going to be in their faces and the truth will be unavoidable. I don't know when, where or how it will happen, but it
       <em>
        will
       </em>
       happen. It's easy to stick your head in the sand when life is good. That is much harder to do with an unavoidable force breathing down your neck.

       I like to envision that the elite will eventually grow impatient in their attempts to mass brainwash everyone and instead focus their attempts on catapulting our education to become a space faring civilization. That’s what I’d do if were in control at least...all their money and effort is spent to control and undermine..obviously under the guise that they fear losing control, but man, it’d be sick if we were this Star Trek species that was ever expansive and peaceful. One day we fucking make contact with a galactic federation or something and boom, we’re set forever.

       As far as the existential context we are in some kind of organized closed system, possibly a spiritual realm or computer simulation. Historically we are in the transition period period ages in the cycle, likely an iteration that resembles previous ones, an exciting time nonetheless. Currently, there is a macro shift happening in the way people connect and nations connect and the world is forming the beginnings to a global community through the internet among other technologies like cryptocurrency and social media platforms etc. The next 5-10 years will see rapid changes and likely a market or economic shift that will further alter the landscape and facilitate another transition on a material level of which I am unsure how it will play out.

       We are in a period where the average human being can not function within the modern society. Even cheap labor meat machines are being replaced by AI/Robotics. I would imagine we will see a push to reduce the population, not because it's unsustainable, but because surplus people are irrelevant. Following trends of history, this change will be violent instead of peaceful/gradual.
