<p>I suspect this technology has long been available, held off until the right political climate to use it was achieved.</p>

<p>I also suspect it&#39;ll soon be rolled out to a great many <em>more</em> places, regardless of how successful or otherwise this &#39;trial&#39; is. Airports, train stations, bus stations, entrances to monuments, major bridges, schools, malls, houses of worship, major highways. Eventually, maybe, your local deli, the dog park ... the list goes on.</p>

<p>I further suspect a collection of undeleted &#39;background testing data&#39; willl be gathered. Just for the purposes of &#39;configuration,&#39; of course.</p>

<p>And how convenient when they&#39;ll be able to link our faces to our bank accounts, allowing facial recognition to automatically pay for our taxi, or our groceries! And profile our shopping habits! Looking for a little cash? Sell those old records out of your garage, assured you&#39;ll be paying those appropriate taxes on what were once cash only transactions!</p>

<p>It&#39;s a can of worms that&#39;s all for your safety and convenience, citizen. Now <em>pick up</em> that can!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was with a unit in the Middle East that rolled these systems out about 10 years ago. I’m surprised that it has taken this long for the technology to pop up stateside.  To address your concern about background data being stored, that is exactly how this system works and provides results. Combined with facial recognition will likely be fingerprint and iris scanning. The data is stored and used to identify patterns and deception (when an individual passes through an area or if they are using different multiple ids, this system will pick it up) Unfortunately, the only way for it to provide the best results is for it to be employed far and wide. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And that makes sense. I <em>do</em> understand its use in combat zones. If anything justifies its use, it&#39;s where things are literally <em>that</em> dangerous people with IEDs strapped to themselves can just walk into a crowded area. Of course, that justification for use has already been provided outside warzones, the Boston Marathon bombing being just one example. And that seems perfectly reasonable. My primary concern is the inevitable overreach.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While additional methods were used in the combat zone, there are two primary goals the system can be used for at the border. The first would be to fight smuggling; track who is coming and going and when and identify the guy whose travel patterns are a red flag. To do this you have to collect biometrics on everyone coming and going through the border. I think that’s more or less reasonable to expect if you are crossing a border. </p>

<p>The second way that would be more likely to lead to over reach is looking for individuals who are reentering the US via the Mexican border, but did not leave that way. A hypothetical threat here may be someone leaves of the country, joins up with a terrorist organization, and returns under a different name or fake passport and attempts to cross the land border rather than risk taking a commercial flight. (How real or common this threat is, who knows) In order for the system to pick up the discrepancy, there would already need to be a biotemtric profile on this person in the system. They may change their appearance or get a new fake passport, but unless they get an eye transplant, their iris will be the same. Fingerprints and facial features as well, but the iris is the best identifying factor for the system. To fight this threat, you need biometrics on virtually everyone and anyone. If the equipment is to be successful, it requires extensive information on everyone. 
Is it necessary? Is it overkill? What else will the biometric profiles be used for? I don’t know the answers to these questions. Time will tell. </p>
