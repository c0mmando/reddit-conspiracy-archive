       As the US transfers troops and equipment from Iraq to Afghanistan it's important to understand that the rules of disclosures regarding our military have changed significantly under the Trump administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I didn't care for Trump's decision to let the Pentagon have so much control over what is allowed to be classified information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good article about this:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2018/02/afghanistan-secrecy/">
        https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2018/02/afghanistan-secrecy/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the article:
      </p>
      <p>
       "So what used to be available that is now being withheld?
      </p>
      <p>
       “It is basically casualty, force strength, equipment, operational readiness, attrition figures, as well as performance assessments,” said Mr. Sopko, the SIGAR.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Using the new [classification criteria], I would not be able to tell you in a public setting or the American people how their money is being spent,” Mr. Sopko told Congress at a hearing last November."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if you know what you're actually reading in that first paragraph you can understand that our military forces are now operating at a level of secrecy that is very disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Accountability has always been what differentiates our military forces from mercenaries...we need to consider why that's always been important and push for more transparency and revocation of the new powers Trump gave the Pentagon.

       The booming economy of an "active war" never gets questioned until the media starts airing footage of the caskets showing up at airports.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I doubt the media would do that and I'm not sure we will even know considering these new laws of classified material.

       As a former US Marine who has served my country and deployed to Afghanistan while also having friends currently deployed in war zones - I'm relieved our President has finally decided to stop being so transparent on the movements and actions of our forward operators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain your reasoning for wanting those listed above to be public knowledge for the enemy leadership to get intel reports on daily.  This should be good.

       The other thing that's fucked is their objective in Afghanistan is literally to just kill terrorists.  Although our actions there only creates more terrorists.

       Exactly. It's all that ever ends up happening. And now, it's very easy to get the media's help in "labeling" any group of people they want as terrorists. Doesn't matter what initially caused the people to react in such extreme levels.

       It is, and TPTB love it.  The one thing that I do like about Trump, is he's a perfect representation of what's been going on for decades.  Yes he's loud, racist, superficial, unapologetic, and cold blooded, but so is our foreign and domestic policies.

       I don't support endless war.

       Secretary of State Tillerson has slowly changed his statements in quite a dishonest way regarding Syria.

       We are illegally occupying Syria at this very moment. We are illegally pursuing a plan of balkanization in both Iraq and Syria...

       Then you wouldn't want their movements and numbers to be made public.  Period.  You can't say you respect the service men deployed in war zones while at the same time demanding that dangerous intel on their activities be made public.  Madness.

        No..the madness is you being unable to question why we are still pursuing a completely failed policy regarding the middle east...and it doesn't give you the right to hold yourself or your friends hostage when discussing this.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Appears you can't follow a simple conversation.  I'm discussing the dissemination of tactical intel of our ground troops who are
       <strong>
        already deployed
       </strong>
       and my desire for that intel to be better controlled to limit the chance that this intel gets some of our Patriots killed overseas.
      </p>
      <p>
       But keep running your suck about some overreaching point (that we apparently agree on by the way) about why we are out there to begin with.  Different discussion, not at all what we were talking about and you know it.  Weak attempt to steer the conversation away from where you make ZERO SENSE, into a place you are more comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Regardless - anyone who thinks making "casualty, force strength, equipment, operational readiness, attrition figures, as well as performance assessment" public knowledge in real-time while engaged in combat activities is a moron and has zero understanding and experience in anything tactical.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's madness to suggest otherwise, atleast from a Patriotic US citizen's point of view, not sure where you're sitting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm ready for your off-topic reply distracting from the point here.

       You managed to avoid the very specific points of casualties and attrition rates I brought up the whole time. When I pushed you on it..you moved to "real time" narrative...you're the one who never addressed my point.

       I've been out since 2011.  During my first deployment, the U.S. policy was the destruction of opium fields.  Most Afghans I met absolutely fucking hated the US. for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       During my second deployment the U.S. had switched to just leaving the fields alone, which I honestly think was the right move.  If the objective was to win hearts and minds, setting crops on fire that provide for the livelihood of a huge chunk of the population isn't getting you anywhere.  And yeah, I know how awful the opium trade is - but dealing with poppy fields should be left to the ANP or ANA instead of foreign troops.
