        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy and Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle were two of the targets in the 2001 anthrax attacks.  They both voiced concerns that the Patriot Act could be in violation of constitutional rights.  </p>

<p>The attacks happened several weeks after 9/11.  The notes in the letters had messages with phrases like, &quot;Death to America&quot; and &quot;Death to Israel.&quot;  They all had the date &quot;9-11-2001.&quot; written at the top.  Investigators later determined that someone was attempting to misdirect the investigation.  </p>

<p>The craziest thing of all is that the President&#39;s office (Bush) and the VP&#39;s office (Cheney) all went on Cipro (strong antibiotic used to treat Anthrax) before the letters were sent out! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny, I didnt know this, until the guy who created the anthrax &quot;killed himself&quot;</p>

<p>The spores are unique to who made them, everyone who is making anthrax, it just slightly differs enough that you can identify the maker if you have some of the substance to test.</p>

<p>Knowing this, they claimed they didnt know where the anthrax was coming from, but obviously they did, and then in 2009 the guy kills himself, and then all of a sudden it was &quot;him&quot; who was solely responsible for the mailings, the gov knows this because they were able to identify the strain that was made to his lab.</p>

<p>LOL what, took them almost 8+ years to figure this out.</p>

<p>I also heard a ton of rumors at the time, that the scientist didnt commit suicide, he had a bullet holes in his back or the back of his head, i forget.</p>

<p>Funny thing is, you wont find that information anywhere anymore, because its all &quot;fake&quot; news. 
You can find lots of information blaming the scientist for mailing the anthrax, but in the end, all he did was create it, there was no hard evidence provided that he was mailing it to people. </p>

 “October 19, 2001
. . . Before dawn on Friday morning, four days after the Daschle letter was opened, Peter Jahrling put on a space suit and went into the Submarine and got a tiny sample of live, dry Daschle anthrax. He gave the sample to Tom Geisbert so that he could look at the dry anthrax in a scanning electron microscope. Geisbert carried the tube of dry anthrax into his microscope lab . . . [Geisbert] stared at the bone-colored particles. Now he saw them climbing the wall of the tube, dancing along the wall of the tube heading upward. His assistant, Denise Braun, was working near by. ‘Denise, you’ll never believe this.’ The anthrax was like jumping beans; it seemed to have a life of its own. He began preparing a sample for the scope. He opened the tube and tapped a little bit of the anthrax onto a piece of sticky black tape that would hold the powder in place. But the anthrax bounced off the tape. The particles wouldn’t stick. Eighty percent of the Daschle particles flittered away in air currents up into the hood. That was when he understood that the Hart Building was utterly contaminated . . . [Geisbert] had a national-security clearance, and he knew something about anthrax, but he could not imagine how this weapon had been made. It looked extremely sinister. He started feeling shaky. He called Jahrling. ‘Pete, I’m in the scope room. Can you come up here, like right now?’ Jahrling ran...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im a microbiologists with a PhD and over a decade of hands on research with cloning. If it was a lab strain, i.e. an ATCC strain. I would not know how to determine which lab it came from. I could sequence it, but it&#39;s sequence should be the same as every lab that uses that ATCC strain. If it had a unique custom made plasmid, I could link that to a lab. SNP analysis if the strain has been sub-cultured enough (including the frozen stock) may link it, but that would be incredibly unlikely and require that they passage the stock strain a number of times, which no one would do. As far as &quot;looking&quot; (microscopy?, residual media?) the spores to determine their source, that would not be possible.</p>

<p>The number of people that are allowed to work with the Tox+ strain (BSL3 labs) would be pretty small to begin with. I am not certain, but I would put it in the range of a couple of dozen labs in the US. The list of suspects would fit on half a page. However, it is pretty easy to isolate anthrax from the soil. Farmers and sheep contract the skin version of the disease every now and then (its the pneumonia form of the disease that is the most deadly).</p>

<p>The whole story just seems weird to me. Also, check out &quot;missing microbiologists.&quot;</p>

It&#39;s one of the greatest conspiracies of our time, and it&#39;s clear to everyone--even non-conspiracy minded people--who look into it, that we&#39;re not being told the whole story.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s the documentary by ProPublica, which is a really good overview, though it barely touches on the issue of what really happened (no one has done a good investigative piece actually uncovering what really happened, that I&#39;m aware of):  </p>

<p>Daschle &amp; Leahy voted for the Patriot Act.  Only senator Feingold (D-WI) voted against it.</p>

<p>However the vote was taken October 25, 2001, and the Anthrax attacks started September 18, 2001 [1].  So an argument could be made that Daschle &amp; Leahy were scared into voting for it.  But I have no idea if that&#39;s the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing!</p>

<p>So from the video I&#39;m not sure if he misspoke here since his original claim is that they received it before the attacks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2YrHpB64ac&amp;amp;t=1m30s">but he says the white house received treatment <em>November 11th</em></a>. I got the impression that the suit is over the negligence in caring for postal workers after the attack when the higher gov&#39;t officials were treated immediately.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also quite possible that intelligence had an idea that there would be an anthrax attack but had no idea who the targets would be, and medicated the president and vice president as a precaution. </p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t put it past our government to do something like this though. If they were in control of the attack though, why would they need to even take the medicine, knowing they wouldn&#39;t actually be targets, and why would they even release that they were on it?</p>

<p>If I were you I would get used to it.</p>

<p>For some reason this sub -- in general -- has an aversion to skepticism.</p>

<p>I am convinced now that for most users of this sub, what they come for is the stories, the reinforcement of preexisting beliefs.</p>

<p>People like you and I who ask for sources are effectively asking those of faith to prove their scripture.</p>

<p>I hope you stick around. This place desperately needs more people asking for sources and evidence, not less.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks, been lurking for a long time because it&#39;s interesting to follow, the plausible cases and otherwise.</p>

<p>Legitimate provable conspiracies are far more interesting though, and one of the reasons I&#39;m drawn to the subreddit is that I&#39;m a skeptical person by nature. That means not only of what the government and media says, but what you lot say as well.</p>

<p>It seems kinda counter-intuitive that those who are skeptical of the traditional narrative would not also be skeptical of their own sources.</p>

<p>Yes indeed, it took me a long time (maybe a couple of years) to get my head around the absurdity of it:</p>

<p>People who ostensibly know that the government can and does lie about things like Sandy Hook, are somehow unable to see that the same government can and does lie about other things, like &#39;outer space&#39;.</p>

<p>Now I realise that most &#39;conspiracy&#39; people are merely parrots in human form, no different to the normies. They simply parrot whatever story makes them feel good in the moment. They have no conception of proper <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/articles/primary-source-research-methodology/">research methodology</a>.</p>

<p>And of course it is not their fault. We all go to &#39;school&#39;, which is named after the collective noun for a group of fish for a reason.</p>

<p>Only a very small percentage of people truly want to leave the cave.</p>

<p>In the bigger picture, besides the individual reasons for false flags like 9/11=patriot act/iraq war support, many smaller false flags seem to be just for keeping people in a state of constant fear.

<p>The craziest thing of all is that the President&#39;s office (Bush) and the VP&#39;s office (Cheney) all went on Cipro (strong antibiotic used to treat Anthrax) before the letters were sent out! </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m picturing the two of them making the letters in the Oval Offi ce, and Bush spills the anthrax, sending Cheney into a fit.</p>

<p>The report cast doubt on the U.S. government&#39;s conclusion that Ivins was the perpetrator, finding that although the type of anthrax used in the letters was correctly identified as the Ames strain of the bacterium, there was insufficient scientific evidence for the FBI&#39;s assertion that it originated from Ivins&#39;s laboratory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I looked up the word anthrax and found your thread, I was researching it because of the recent scare. </p>

<p>It was totally an inside job, and it came a fucking <em>week</em> after 9/11 - how convenient. It seems like a group of people were trying to rouse as much fear as possible during that time period to allow them to do whatever they wanted.</p>

<p>How the fuck would terrorists ever get their hands on anthrax? How the hell would they ever get the Ames strain? The Ames strain is a strain the US government first harvested back in 1981, this strain has never been outside of the US government. Just think about that, it&#39;s a random strain that was harvested in 1981 by some Texas vets, who then gave the strain to USAMRIID, and almost 100% were forced to destroy the anthrax they had left, if they even had any.</p>

<p>So basically this means the anthrax used ultimately came from USAMRIID (or maybe another government agency secretly grabbed some too), regardless, it came from the government.</p>

<p>How easy it would be for the president or someone on his side to get some anthrax and set something up, with the goal being to kill some annoying congressmen who&#39;re holding back certain plans, as well as to generate massive fear in the population, which can then be used to make decisions which would otherwise not be allowed in a normal setting. Two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>They then blame Dr. Ivans (he almost certainly didn&#39;t do it), and kill him, making it look like a suicide. After he dies they proclaim they&#39;ve come to the ultimate conclusion, and that he was definitively the one who did it - how convenient, they can announce the guilt of a dead man and close the case. Luckily some patriots, Senator Chuck Grassley and Rep. Rush Holt, called out the FBI, there was probably so much going on behind closed doors we&#39;re simply not privy to, I bet these guys were very suspicious of the FBI.</p>

<p>I guarantee some crazy shit happened. Imagine if George W. Bush was the one who wrote the letter. I mean obviously that&#39;d be very dangerous of him to do, it&#39;d be easy to tell, but if he wanted to rub it in, I could see that.</p>
