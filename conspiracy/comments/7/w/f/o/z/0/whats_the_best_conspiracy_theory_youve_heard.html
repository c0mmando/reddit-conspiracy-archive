       Best? I assume that means a theory that seems the most plausible. I think a lot of people don't believe the official 9/11 story...but I have yet to hear one theory I can fully get behind. So I'll say some of the best for me is the faked moon landings and JFK assassinated by the CIA.

       honestly I can agree with you due to the fact the whole 9/11 story makes more sense than terrorist gaining access to multiple planes without anyone having knowledge or the courage to stop them. JFK is something I don't look into but makes sense to me also considering he was one of the presidents who wanted to make a change and the government didn't approve. For moon landings, they still to this day use photoshop for photos they take of space. why would you need photoshop if you have the most intelligent equipment in the world to be able to even go into space. good choice.

       9/11 was the saudi's crashing into the twin towers. The Gov knew, rigged building 7 for demo,( possible 1 &amp; 2 as well) the pentagon was hit with a missile and the fourth plane in the field was really the one that supposedly hit the pentagon

       Maybe I need to give it more attention after work, to really analyze it.
And I’m not knocking you, you obviously did a lot of collecting.

      <p>
       But, I didn’t get one single piece of that. None of it looked like anything to me.

       It was a complete set-up and that no-one was actually hurt. some very good analyses have been done and it's pretty obvious that it was carefully staged and managed, and that the guy who famously lost his legs in the first blast was already a double amputee.

       Money. Supressing poor people is just a way to make it. You don't force someone to buy drugs, people buy drugs because they want it. They get hooked, they want more. Simple supply and demand.

       That was basically the foundation of the theory, that there's no way one guy can write all of those novels himself and have them (mostly) all be spectacular. I really wish I could remember where I first read or heard about the theory though.

       This is a theory associated with every popular writer at some point just like most of Hollywood celebrities are at some point accused of being part of the Illuminati, or those theories about them dying in car crashes and being replaced with doubles and plastic surgery. Although in some aspects it might be a plausible theory, at this point it does not make any sense or difference.

       I have two, my first favorite conspiracy is ancient aliens,  not the show but the actual conspiracy that aliens influenced ancient civilizations up into today’s current world. I love to research it, it’s just fun. The second would have to be 9/11 because it is the big lie that started my initial interest into conspiracy, it helped me take the plunge of wanting to know more, and becoming more of a free thinker, 9/11 changed the way I think and see the world,  not because of what happened but because they lied to the world about what happened on such a way that it is ridiculous to fathom they got away with it.

       The most insane conspiracy theory is the one peddled by the government on 911, known as the “acrobatic pilots who pulverized 3 steel skyscrapers with 2 aluminum planes” conspiracy theory, or alternatively the “bearded hijackers who never forget to to throw their passports outside of the cockpit window right before crashing their airplanes” conspiracy theory.

       That almost all companies in the economy have the interest of keeping you as an uninformed consumer, a slave to your own debts. That instead of first focusing on the happiness and joy of yourself and those around you, you should stress and fret over issues that will never affect you, nor will you have an effect on those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Live frugally. Buy used, and make what you can. Learn how to be self sufficient. And always for things for your own happiness, never for the satisfaction of societal demands. If you can rebuke this rat race that our world calls society, and fill your life with simple joys and comforts, then you'll be a much happier and healthier individual.

       This is one of my favorites. I'm the mod of that sub and have spent entirely too much time looking into this. From time to time I get really random messages from people about it which I hardly ever respond to. I'll get messages like "hey, I have some info on this but I need you to contact me here" or one of the more recent ones was a guy claiming he had inside knowledge and inside contacts and he would go as in-between for me if I constructed 3 to 5 questions about things I wanted to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never really respond to them because I feel like it's people just fucking with me. Maybe next time I should just to see where it goes.

       My favorite is the one that brought me here in the first place -- namely that most, if not all of the wars fought by the US over the last ~20 years are about maintaining the petrodollar system -- the fact that almost all oil traded around the globe is settled in USD. This creates international demand for USD and is the reason it is the primary reserve currency.

       I wrote up a bit of history on it a while back, if you want to learn more.

       The one that fucks with my head the most is the conspiracy surrounding death and whether going to the light to reincarnate is actually a malevolent trick to keep us trapped.

       There are a lot of really interesting conspiracies to explore, and they all lead down different paths. A lot of them connect in some way or another, but there seems to be a sort of evolution of thoughts that occur when one starts down the path of exploration.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the beginning, you're kind of like a sponge just looking for everything and taking it all in. There's a whole new way of looking at things and so much to get caught up on. Some things (like David Icke's stuff) sound absolutely ridiculous, but you want to know more about the monetary system, and global political connections, and WTF is up with the Clinton Foundation, and what really happened on 9/11, and why they really killed Gaddafi.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pieces start to come together and you begin to see the lie for what it is. A lot of things suddenly make sense, and you start to feel the heavy weight of truth on your shoulders. It really weighs heavily on your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       You start learning about ancient history and cultures and what kind of lies have possibly been told or the common misinformation we all deem valid because it has the institutional stamp. You start digging into religions, and space, and UFO programs and alien beings and dive into Stanley Kubrick and realize this can go on forever. But there is so much to learn so you keep going. Rabbit hole after rabbit hole.
      </p>
      <p>
       You learn about the Rothschilds, and the club of Rome, and occult practices, and pedophile abuse, and mind control, and MK ultra, and Nazi experiments. There is a really dark side to it all and it can really start to take its toll on your outlook and worldview. How can one person change this? How can I make a difference? Maybe I should just focus on my family.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, I must do something and keep learning. I'll spread truth, and get people on the path, and try to open others eyes. I'll let people know of the grand conspiracy to keep everyone down and slowly awareness wll spread. I think a lot of people hit this plateau and feel stuck for a while. Where do you go from here?
      </p>
      <p>
       And then something happens. This wave of optimism and love and light hits you, and something just clicks. Everything comes together and suddenly it's like you put the last piece into the puzzle. You go back to the beginning and it all has a slightly different twist to it -- it all leads up to the breakthrough of that plateau into a whole new space of open-mindedness where suddenly David Icke's ideas don't sound that crazy anymore, and the idea of different energies and other dimensional beings and the power of occult beliefs and rituals and manifest destiny and the wave of the universe and ancient beliefs all seem to be telling the same story.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then we come to the end of it all. Death. The thing we can't escape and the thing that makes us alive, in a sense. What happens at that point? Do we reincarnate? Does it just end? Does our consciousness go off into space? Does it merge with something greater? It's impossible to answer, but to think a trick is being played on us after death, with the answer completely unknowable and the result being our ultimate separation from all oneness (due to not going into the light) or the idea of infinity in a prison due to repeat it with amnesia is a terrifying way to "end it".

       The most outrageous one that holds a valid argument to being true is the monarch mind control. And how all of Hollywood, and much of DC even Bill Clinton are under mind control. Go on YouTube and watch these celebs brains short out. It’s bizarre.
