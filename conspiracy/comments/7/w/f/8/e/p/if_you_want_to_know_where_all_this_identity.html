        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was curious to find out what happened to the left i.e., why did the left become inundated with identity politics (gender identity, race identity, political identity), calling others that dont agree with them as fascists, antifa, BLM, Safe Spaces, screaming, &quot;But you&#39;re a white male,&quot; and that white people dont matter because white privilege, the anti-white movement, Political correctness, anti-free speech and all the stuff I started seeing in the last few years.</p>

<p>Just 2 years ago, I was a democrat, and left the party because of what I deem is the insanity that I mentioned above that the movement has gone into. I noticed that the majority of this was coming from the Universities, majority of which lean heavily and are majority left. I also noticed a lot of redittors (when I would ask where is all this coming from), would mention the Universities as the starting point. So I did some research:</p>

<p>This is not a theory nor is it discussing a theory. Its that factual existence of the Frankfurt school, what it taught, who was in it, and where they all went when many of them came to America and continued to teach the philosophy:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankfurt_School</a></p>

<p>If you can find anything in the above link that is not true, post links/sources/rebuttals</p>

<p>This Is a historical description of the History of P.C. (Cultural Marxism) starting from the WW1 Marxist Theorists.: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjaBpVzOohs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjaBpVzOohs</a></p>

<p>That YT Historical description, mentions the Russian Marxist Revolution of 1917:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>These ideals were championed most vociferously by Russia’s liberals, although populists, Marxists, and anarchists also claimed to support democratic reforms. A growing opposition movement had begun to challenge the Romanov monarchy openly well before the turmoil of World War I.</p>

<p>The political group that proved most troublesome for Kerensky, and would eventually overthrow him, was the Bolshevik Party, led by Vladimir Lenin. Lenin had been living in exile in neutral Switzerland and, due to democratization of politics after the February Revolution, which legalized formerly banned political parties, he perceived the opportunity for his Marxist revolution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which then led to:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin</a></p>

<p>and </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s a couple of the Cultural Marxist theorist leaders, and the mention of what happened to their students/followers:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gy%C3%B6rgy_Luk%C3%A1cs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/György_Lukács</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lukács&#39;s followers were indicted for political crimes throughout the 1960s and 70s, and a number fled to the West. Lukács&#39;s books The Young Hegel and The Destruction of Reason have been used to argue that Lukács was covertly critical of Stalinism as an irrational distortion of Hegelian-Marxism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heads up pdf:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mediaaccess.hu/userspace/pdf_files/PoliticalCorrectOrigin.pdf">http://www.mediaaccess.hu/userspace/pdf_files/PoliticalCorrectOrigin.pdf</a></p>

<p>Under Lukacs, free thinking is a sin, program children via take over of the education system, teach sex education early, undermine the family system, Hegelian dialectic via division, separation and duality, political correctness, social justice. He&#39;s one of the Originators</p>

<p>This can all be also corroborated factually here</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Imagination-Frankfurt-Institute-1923-1950/dp/0520204239">https://www.amazon.com/Dialectical-Imagination-Frankfurt-Institute-1923-1950/dp/0520204239</a></p>

<p>Frankfurt&#39;s School Max Horkheimer move Marxism into a Cultural war:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Horkheimer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Horkheimer</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Through critical theory (a social theory focusing on critiquing and changing society), Horkheimer &quot;attempted to revitalize radical social, and cultural criticism&quot; and discussed authoritarianism, militarism, economic disruption, environmental crisis and the poverty of mass culture.[5] Horkheimer helped to create Critical Theory through a mix of radical and conservative lenses that stem from radical Marxism and end up in &quot;pessimistic Jewish transcendentalism&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Horkeimer then brings in:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_W._Adorno</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Fromm">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_Fromm</a></p>

<p>Fromm create&#39;s the &quot;Left&#39;s Gender Identity Politics&quot;:</p>

<p><a href="https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/Illumina%20Folder/kell8.htm">https://pages.gseis.ucla.edu/faculty/kellner/Illumina%20Folder/kell8.htm</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Erich Fromm is one of the few members of the Frankfurt School who seriously engaged himself with theorizing the problems of gender and the differences between men and women. In certain ways, Fromm anticipated later attempts to produce a feminist Marxism and poststructuralist analyses of the socially constructed nature of gender. Yet Fromm&#39;s gender analysis was highly uneven and even contradictory, pointing to the difficulties in the subject matter and perhaps the difficulty in overcoming dominant male perspectives in analyzing the highly charged and conflicted issues of gender and sexuality.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Herbert Marcuse joins the Frankfurt school:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>He characterizes tolerance of repressive speech as &quot;inauthentic.&quot; Instead, he advocates a form of tolerance that is intolerant of right wing political movements</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sound Familiar?</p>

<p>In 1930, the last 4 operatives I just mentioned, released &quot;Critical Theory&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_theory</a></p>

<p>This is the basis for gay studies, womens studies, trans studies, and any/every &quot;Studies&quot; course you see in American education systems from High school through college/university. The point of &quot;Critical theory&quot; is to criticize something to such a degree that you destroy and break it down. Of course this also used for division and identity politics.</p>

<p>That brings us to David Horowitz</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Horowitz">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Horowitz</a></p>

<p>Ex-Radical Marxist who was there, helping to get Cultural Marxism infiltrated into the Universities in the 60&#39;s. He has evidence, proof, and a variety of books published breaking it all down as well.</p>

<p>Cultural Marxism teaches via Horkheimer that:</p>

<p>Director of the Frankfurt School in 1930 Max Horkheimer said &quot;the concept of logic is not “independent of content” meaning that if an argument is only logical if it helps destroy Western culture and illogical if it supports it. &quot;</p>

<p>So how did the German Marxist get to America?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Social_Research">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Social_Research</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1933, after the rise of Hitler, the Institute left Germany for Geneva and then in 1934 moved to New York City. In New York it became affiliated with Columbia University, and its journal Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung was renamed Studies in Philosophy and Social Science. It was there that much of the important work of the Frankfurt School thinkers began to emerge, and the Institute&#39;s residence in New York was likely partly accountable for its work&#39;s favorable reception in American and English academia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The focus of Marxists need to destroy Democracy, the Family, Culture, Capitalism, now found itself in NY</p>

<p>In 1950 Adorno publishes this:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Authoritarian_Personality">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Authoritarian_Personality</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;invented a set of criteria by which to define personality traits, ranked these traits and their intensity in any given person on what it called the &#39;F scale&#39; (F for fascist).&quot;[1] The personality type Adorno et al. identified can be defined by nine traits that were believed to cluster together as the result of childhood experiences. These traits include conventionalism, authoritarian submission, authoritarian aggression, anti-intellectualism, anti-intraception, superstition and stereotypy, power and &quot;toughness&quot;, destructiveness and cynicism, projectivity, and exaggerated concerns over sex.[2][3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the book, he says the majority of Americans have Fascist traits. Sound familiar? Antifa and the Left calling anyone who does not agree with them as &quot;Fascists&quot;</p>

<p>This book:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Though strongly criticized for bias and methodology,[4][5] the book was highly influential in American social sciences, particularly in the first decade after its publication: &quot;No volume published since the war in the field of social psychology has had a greater impact on the direction of the actual empirical work being carried on in the universities today.&quot;[6]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse#Post_War">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse#Post_War</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In 1952, Marcuse began a teaching career as a political theorist, first at Columbia University, then at Harvard University. Marcuse worked at Brandeis University from 1958 to 1965, then at the University of California San Diego until his retirement.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From there is spreads like cancer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Marcuse was a friend and collaborator of the political sociologist Barrington Moore, Jr. and of the political philosopher Robert Paul Wolff, and also a friend of the Columbia University sociology professor C. Wright Mills, one of the founders of the New Left movement. In his &quot;Introduction&quot; to One-Dimensional Man, Marcuse wrote, “I should like to emphasize the vital importance of the work of C. Wright Mills.”[13]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Books, Sex and Deviance By Guillaume Faye and Other Side of Sin, The: Woundedness from the Perspective of the Sinned-Against
edited by Andrew Sung Park, Susan L. Nelson</p>

<p>Both discuss how Herbert Marcuse created the &quot;Victim Group Mentality&quot; in the minority, black, women&#39;s and gay groups as a way to unite them all under &quot;victim hood&quot;</p>

<p>MArcuse&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros_and_Civilization">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros_and_Civilization</a></p>

<p>Calls for sexual openness and freed, via polymorphous diversity. So basically, not longer being conservative, pro-creative, love, relationships, but narcissism and open sex with whoever, whenever, however</p>

<p>Side Note*</p>

<p>When you bring this up to people on the left, they scoff and say this whole thing is made up by a right wing blogger and that its not true. Even after I post all the links above, showing the history of this movement going back to WW2 and even prior to that, to the Bolsheviks, (there were no blogs/internet then)</p>

<p>you actually believe that elite bloodlines don&#39;t matter at all, while at the same time thinking that capitalism and capitalism alone explains every ill in the world</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Humans are imperfect, and therefore create imperfect systems. Therefore, whatever is this &quot;magical replacement system&quot; that you have in mind, will always come back to square 1, the problem of human nature.</p>

<p>Human nature consists of differences in gender, intelligence, skill/talents, and so on. Human nature, also exhibits greed, corruption, money hunger, division, ideological differences, and a master issue: Sociopaths seek positions of power</p>

<p>This is always what crumbles the communist (no true communism has ever been tried narrative) talking points. Humans are the issue. No matter what new systems you put in place, the human will find a way to take advantage and the sociopaths seek out ways to rise to positions of power within that system, recreating all the same issues that exist in other systems</p>

<p>Even though Capitalism does breed inequality, so do all the other systems, its inevitable because people&#39;s minds produce beliefs, take sides, choose mental systems to belief in that differ from others. You can change the system, but the same systems in people&#39;s minds continue.</p>

<p>Also, Capitalism has many good features. The survival of the fittest, meritocracy based on skill, and competition allows for engineering systems to create a race of evolution in design, tech, infrastructure, alt energy sources, and so on. Literally the computer you are using and the Internet you are connected to, both have evolved into what we have now because of the systems in place.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It took me about 2 years, via Zen/Dzogchen/Advaita. In a nutshell, what you do, is you notice that you are sentient, you are aware. Then, you use discernment, to notice that any position or belief you take, is a superimposition over the primacy of Sentience.</p>

<p>After realizing this and playing with it a bit, you learn to return and Be in the natural state of positionless sentience, where there are no programs running or believed in.</p>

<p>Now after having broken that down. I am fully and consciously aware that I have stepped into a position to break down Cultural Marxist Post Modernism and its influence over academia and Western culture. Its basically a sourced breakdown of its history and where it comes from. Very simple, and there are people you can meet and notice have been entirely programmed by this system</p>

<p>The inward eye is the purity of consciousness when deprogrammed. I understand that, however, that does not take away from the critical breaking down of a system that exists and is in place in our culture</p>

<p>I do, and I ask you to do the same. I ran a business for a few years, small tech based, 3 employees, and I can assure you, when you are on the side of the fence, meritocracy is vital</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Post-Modernism and Marxism are diametrically opposed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Post Modernism came out of a hacked version of Marxism that evolved tiself into the Cultural aspect of undoing or fighting against the social/cultural norms of the west, i.e. sexual purity vs sexual revolution, religion vs no religion, capitalism vs Other. Good write up here:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To the extent that the postmodernist worldview can be summed up, it says narrative is the only access people have to reality, and people in power control narrative. Extreme counter-narrative on behalf of social justice is no vice, to rephrase Goldwater, because the ultimate veracity of those facts will always lie behind a veil of interpretations. There are not true and false observations, only narratives that advance human progress—defined on the progressive template—and narratives that resist it.</p>

<p>That outlook can warp you. Lisa Ruddick described the phenomenon: “I believe that the progressive fervor of the humanities… masks a second-order complex that is all about the thrill of destruction. In the name of critique, anything except critique can be invaded or denatured…. [This kind of thinking] encourages an intellectual sadism that the profession would do well to reflect on.”</p>

<p>They are certainly linked and cross each other. There is of course a pure version of Marxism that begins with Marx, but once the Frankfurt school shows up, it evolves into a Cultural psy op, Critical Theory, attack of everything and anything that&#39;s currently in place, anti-cultures created against everything that already was in culture. So that Frankfurt school morphed its Marxism into Cultural Marxism and Post Modernist Movements of various sorts</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer is a lot simpler. Postmodernism posits as false any grand historical narratives or notions of linear progress. Marxism is exactly such a narrative, it&#39;s just materialist Hegelianism. They might share back and forth particular critiques of capitalism, but their core mindsets are exactly opposite. If you read actual Marxists and actual postmodernists this would be the first thing you&#39;d write, it&#39;s the obvious and most glaring contradiction between them. </p>

Anyhow, if there is something wrong or not credible with the piece, post what it is.

<blockquote>
<p>You cannot understand any thinkers without engaging them directly and with an open mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do study and read these people. The thing is, some of their points, philosophies, theories have a sound basis and are points of further study, for sure. But then you have to ask yourself, did these ideologies (a combo of both post ww2 frankfurt school cultural marxism and post modernist) enter into Western Collective lexicon and influence the Western Academics, willingly so as a conspiratorial movement or just as happenstance, and that&#39;s the question that we are ultimately trying to answer.</p>

<p>Most certainly the Frankfurt school operatives, and their students/followers who also went on to teach in Universities, certainly stayed in contact, met at meeting, influenced all of academia with ideologies like Critical Theory.</p>

<p>I would argue that it was directed and organized to just that, even reading all the links and connections in the OP will show you the conspiratorial nature of it. But let&#39;s say we even go into &quot;happenstance,&quot; its still a fucked movement that allows for criticism and deconstruction of all systems, ideologies, beliefs, movements, structures that are not itself, but critical theory and the movement behind it, is itself, never to be question or you are &quot;fascist&quot; if you do it, or anti-semite if you bring the number of jewish scholars in the movement. And so it protects itself from criticism by attacking those who try and putting them on the defense (just like you did earlier with me when I posted this whole OP)</p>

<p>It took me about 2 years, via Zen/Dzogchen/Advaita. In a nutshell, what you do, is you notice that you are sentient, you are aware. Then, you use discernment, to notice that any position or belief you take, is a superimposition over the primacy of Sentience.</p>

<p>After realizing this and playing with it a bit, you learn to return and Be in the natural state of positionless sentience, where there are no programs running or believed in.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve ever seen an awakened Trump supporter before, haha. I have to wonder, did you experience an increase in love and empathy during the process? How do you view the POTUS&#39;s own psychological profile? Do you recognize the programming from the right as well? Do you consider traditionalism to be a more stable path than progressivism?  </p>

<p>Sorry to badger you. I&#39;m not saying that only progressives can practice awareness, but there tends to be a lot of overlap between understanding your cultural autopilot and breaking from conservative beliefs. Seeing someone go the opposite way is pretty interesting. </p>

<p>I mean, lets take the left/paradigm out completely, and ask, does this suck?</p>

<p>Yes of course. You ever drive pass a homeless person, or give them a sandwich or a few bucks? Or seen someone old passing away or sick? Sure, it sucks and if you have some heart and soul left, its sad and you wish you can do something, and all you really can do is limited by your own time, energy, finances, situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>White nationalists and sexists strawman their opposition that way and propagandize it heavily</p>

<p>This is exactly what my OP covers. Anyone who brings to light the history and origins of the Cultural Marxist/Post Modernist movement, is instantly called, &quot;Fascists, and other fill in the blank names&quot; just as is being done above. Thank you for proving that point. (also, I am not a sexist or white nationalist)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then common straight, white male idiots eagerly lap up any narrative that casts them as the victim. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above is also part of the Movement as described in my OP, separate everyone into groups, races, white/anti-white, etc</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These are extreme reactionaries and propagandists who spread this garbage because they know they&#39;d lose the battle of ideas</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just literally posted the history of this whole movement with factual sources. Let me know if you have any factual rebuttals to any of my links instead of just giving us your opinion</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is because their actual &quot;ideas&quot; are extremely shallow and self-contradictory if you dive in deep enough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who is &quot;their&quot;? Are you grouping me into some group of people? I&#39;ll battle you on ideas all day long and none of them are shallow, and by doing so, will prove your whole opinion above as being wrong</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Their impetus comes from emotions like resentment, narcissism, hatred, and entitlement, their &quot;ideas&quot; are at best a veneer invented post-hoc to rationalize the policies that would sate those emotions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Actually, I am here to operate base on logic, reason, facts, sources, solutions, ideas, discussion, and again none of your above untrue assumptions</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sartre had a good essay on this phenomenon among anti-semites but it applies to many similar groups. (Warning: Direct PDF download)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the problem, is grouping those who expose cultural Marxism, as anti-semites, something that cultural Marxists do to try and discredit the factual truth. It&#39;s a misdirection tactic, fails, and shows the true light of the person using the tactic when they can&#39;t post links/sources to disprove the truth. Typical of the Anti-Truthites</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. But strong effort. The progressive left has absolutely adopted this approach to debate. Your argument is framed in post-modernist/post-structuralist jargon but is in reality no different than its political foil. That&#39;s not to say people on the right are any better. It is to say that both are pandering abuses of political philosophy designed for the explicit purpose of displacing power and influence from one group to another. The primary modern difference is that the left seeks this out to benefit one race or gender over another. The infinite parade of  claims of systematic white supremacy are completely invalidated by observable fact, and are really designed to be unprovable in the first place. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to see how flimsy the progressive left appeal to reason is, nor how aggressively they seek to assign blame or punishment without ever satisfying the burden of evidence. </p>

<p>Im an ex-liberal, and myself witnessed everything my OP talks about, start to infiltrate the Left, and have been active in my liberal city and my University.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is just a giant lie for manipulation, hate propaganda and division.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My OP is all factual with sources. I was curious to find out where things like &quot;Identity Politics&quot; started from, its history, and its source. I started noticing the same Authors who were starting these movements, also started movements like victim mentality within the gay and minority communities, as well as sexual revolution movements and that at the helm of all these movements, are professors/authors that have been a part of the Frankfurt school system and its pholosophies.</p>

<p>All of these movements themselves divide, manipulate, lie, and also cause the same sorts of reactions</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Liberals don&#39;t use those words or think the way the conservatives claim it is only what they tell their believers and followers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am niether of the above. I am a centrist, who still likes some aspects of liberalism, and some aspects of conservatism, but do not identify with either. I also understand that if the right&#39;s (far right) elements get into power it could very bad for a lot of people, just the same if the fringe of the left (far left) get into power it could also be bad, i.e. Hitler and or other characters (both sides)</p>

<p>&quot;Original Sources&quot; doesn&#39;t mean a source you&#39;ve come up with that is &#39;original&#39;? It means text from the actual academics being discussed (The &quot;operatives&quot; as you call them, although as stated earlier they CRITIQUED Soviet Marxism, so I&#39;m not sure who you&#39;re claiming they were operatives of. Frankly the accusation seems somewhat paranoid to me). But an ORIGINAL SOURCE TEXT is the difference between reading THEM DIRECTLY - their writings, and &quot;reading about them&quot; as you put it. Your whole problem is that you&#39;re &quot;reading about them&quot; so you&#39;re getting a biased viewpoint from an interpreter you have no idea about. You have no idea about the politics of the people you&#39;re filtering your views through. This is unhealth, and not genuine research. You&#39;re essentially just parroting other people&#39;s views.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>As stated in another comment, Critical Theory&#39;s explicit goal was to &quot;to liberate human beings from the circumstances that enslave them&quot; - and they specifically didn&#39;t believe in postivist style deconstruction; they were specifically neo-kantians who believed fact and value were both in need of consideration (as opposed to the positivist who believed only in fact). Deconstruction in the way you&#39;re is more something that happens in Post-Modern thought, which as I&#39;ve already pointed to multiple times; The Frankfurt School (specifically Jurgen Habermas) has been <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#9">THE KEY critic of</a> (sorry to keep pasting you this link, but you keep failing to absorb this fact, you can also see it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas#Habermas_versus_postmodernists">all over Habermas&#39; wikipedia page</a>).</p>

<p>Sure, some things were reasonable, such as the discussion of and the critique of anything and everything.

<p>ALSO YOU:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They didn&#39;t start &quot;identity Politics&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>THE SOURCE YOU&#39;RE USING:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In essays beginning in the late 1940s until his death, Fromm was the first Critical Theorist to develop perspectives on gender, focusing on theorizing the differences between men and women. His perspectives were constantly changing however, and were strikingly contradictory, testifying to the difficulties of theorizing gender and overcoming dominant ideological prejudices. In a 1943 essay &quot;Sex and Character,&quot; Fromm takes on the delicate task of characterizing the dominant models of gender and sketching out his own perspectives. He opens by acknowledging the longevity of the project of delineating differences between the sexes, citing Biblical explanations of the essential differences between the sexes, and then points to the highly charged political nature of the endeavor by contrasting liberal Enlightenment positions that there were no innate differences between the sexes with conservative and Romantic claims of essential differences that were used to support male domination and to justify inequality between the sexes (Fromm 1943, p. 21).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>....also, you know that Critical Theory is both A) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_critical_theory">Not automatically Marxist, and Marxism is not required</a>, and B) IT&#39;S WHOLE FIELD OF DISCOURSE! They didn&#39;t nor could they &quot;okay&quot; every little thing that any Critical Theorist said in it (nor would they, that&#39;s illiberal, no better than having a party-line).</p>

<p>...and by the way; when I&#39;ve asked you to go to Original Sources, with quotes and proper evidencing, and you come back with your personal opinion plucked from the air - you lose a lot of credibility. You don&#39;t really have a leg to stand on as far as I can see. The term you&#39;re using &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; is within academia, only applied to 3 groups/people - The Frankfurt School, The Birmingham School and E.P Thompson. It&#39;s not some broad ranging concept, and in fact started out as just a euphemism for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_studies#Stuart_Hall%27s_directorship_at_The_Birmingham_School">&quot;Cultural Studies&quot;</a>. Which was started by The Birmingham School, who followed on from The Frankfurt School - so even before you start you&#39;re one whole group, a separate country, a later time period, and a new field of studies away from the people you&#39;re accusing. Even Critical Theory started out with the initial goal to &quot;to liberate human beings from the circumstances that enslave them&quot; (Horkhiemer) - so you claiming they were trying to infiltrate and destroy western culture is absolute and unfounded BS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m banned from T_D, worldnews, topminds, r/politics, and many others. Same shit, different day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fact that you believe Donald Trump supporters are the &quot;same shit&quot; as Nazis, and that <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> is just communism, shows your lack of subtle of understanding.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>there is also an element within it where you can use critical theory using anything and everything in terms of justification to break down and destroy all aspects of culture.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that&#39;s PRECISELY what they <strong>WERE NOT</strong> doing. They were specifically neo-kantians whose whole point was that NO you can&#39;t just say whatever you want - you have to combine facts with values. They opposed positivism; which sees the world as a compilation of facts without values (this is a key element of The Scientific Enlightenment) - Horkheimer&#39;s &quot;Critique of Instrumental Reason&quot; is specifically a critique of how &quot;reason&quot; and &quot;rationality&quot; can be equally applied to things like the efficiency of the Nazi regime just as the efficiency of the factory floor. They were Kantians, they were saying this shouldn&#39;t be the case, and that facts and values are two different things (ie. That scientific reason isn&#39;t a good in of its self).</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>&quot;cultural marxism, and also by proxy, aspects of post modernism&quot;</em> for the last time, they literally are <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#9">THE KEY CRITICS OF POST MODERNISM.</a> - as well as SUPPORTERS OF THE HIGH ARTS so your phrasing is RIDICULOUS. If they wanted to infiltrate and destroy western culture; they would have helped the Nazis and the USSR win - which is the OPPOSITE of what they did. They helped the allies win. You&#39;re literally using a theory associated with Nazism, the attack people who literally faught the Nazis. This is the power of propaganda - and you my friend have been effected.</p>

<p>&quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; was The Frankfurt School&#39;s critique of the mass production of (for-profit) culture under capitalism. This critique of the mass production of culture was continued by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#Massification_of_culture">The Birmingham School</a> and to some degree by E.P. Thompson. Those are the three groups known as &quot;The Cultural Marxists&quot; - none of them went into &quot;Academia, Politics, Tech, Media, Hollywood&quot; - and they were specifically <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">critiquing many of these things</a> which they called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">The Culture Industry</a> - just read the first paragraph of that link:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>they proposed that popular culture is akin to a factory producing standardized cultural goods—films, radio programmes, magazines, etc.—that are used to manipulate mass society into passivity.[1] Consumption of the easy pleasures of popular culture, made available by the mass communications media, renders people docile and content, no matter how difficult their economic circumstances.[1] The inherent danger of the culture industry is the cultivation of false psychological needs that can only be met and satisfied by the products of capitalism; thus Adorno and Horkheimer especially perceived mass-produced culture as dangerous to the more technically and intellectually difficult high arts. In contrast, true psychological needs are freedom, creativity, and genuine happiness, which refer to an earlier demarcation of human needs, established by Herbert Marcuse. (See Eros and Civilization, 1955).[2]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a CRITIQUE - it is not a piece of advice. They&#39;re not saying &quot;oh hey, look how culture works, we can use this in our devious plot&quot; they&#39;re saying &quot;This shit is fucked&quot;. They would never be part of it.</p>

<p>Likewise from The Birmingham School:</p>

<p><strong>Massification of culture</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Uses of Literacy was an attempt to understand the changes in culture in Britain caused by &quot;massification&quot;. It has been described as marking a &quot;watershed in public perception of culture and class and shifted academic parameters&quot;.[3] Hoggart&#39;s argument is that &quot;the mass publicists&quot; were made &quot;more insistently, effectively and in a more comprehensive and centralised form today than they were earlier&quot; and &quot;that we are moving towards the creation of a mass culture, that the remnants of what was at least in part an urban culture &#39;of the people&#39; are being destroyed&quot;.[4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>The &quot;drift&quot;</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his study Hoggart looks at pulp fiction, popular magazines and newspapers and the movies and finds in all of these, &quot;drift&quot;. He documents the break-up of the old, class culture, lamenting the loss of the close-knit communities and their replacement by the emerging manufactured mass culture. Key features of this are the tabloid newspapers, advertising, and the triumph of Hollywood. These &quot;alien&quot; phenomena have colonized local communities and robbed them of their distinctive features. Hoggart&#39;s attack is not on popular culture; rather it is on mass culture which is imposed from above. &quot;Popular culture&quot; being self-created has a fundamental integrity and evolves according to its own laws and dictates, not as a result of the mass media.[4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cultural Marxism was The Frankfurt School&#39;s critique of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">The Culture Industry</a>. It was an early critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism. Adorno had things like this to say:</p>

<p>Meanwhile Marcuse warned everyone that &quot;progressive politics&quot; could also become repressive and regressive in it&#39;s own ways:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs</a></p>

<p>...and The Birmingham School warned that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#The_.22drift.22">culture was drifting away</a> from local culture.

<p>This was a pre-internet critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism, and ended around the time media became more democratized in the 80s, when the internet began to be foreshadowed with Zines, DIY culture, and public radio/TV. That&#39;s when the tail end of the Birmingham School declared the need to critique mass media <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication">to be kind of over because everyone could talk to everyone.</a></p>

<p>....of course, the right wing conspiracy theorists will say it&#39;s SJWs and a jewish plot that runs the media... but it was actually critiquing the media.</p>

<p>&quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; was The Frankfurt School&#39;s critique of the mass production of (for-profit) culture under capitalism. This critique of the mass production of culture was continued by The Birmingham School and to some degree by E.P. Thompson. Those are the three groups known as &quot;The Cultural Marxists&quot; - none of them went into &quot;Academia, Politics, Tech, Media, Hollywood&quot; - and they were specifically critiquing many of these things which they called The Culture Industry - just read the first paragraph of that link:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re only covering the &quot;critique&quot; aspects of Cultural Marxism. If you want to see how the elements and philosophies of this sort of movement spread everywhere, I&#39;m going to need a week to show you a flow chart how things spread, from Frankfurt school, to their students, to the students of those students, into politics and everywhere else. </p>

<p>We can start here, though:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Marcuse</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Between 1943 and 1950, Marcuse worked in U.S. Government service for the Office of Strategic Services (predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency) where he criticized the Ideology of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the book Soviet Marxism: A Critical Analysis (1958). After his studies, in the 1960s and the 1970s he became known as the preeminent theorist of the New Left and the student movements of West Germany, France, and the United States; some consider him the &quot;father of the New Left&quot;.[7]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So just right there, we already have him in the CIA before it became the CIA, and even though his criticism there, was about Soviet Communism, the methodologies, ideologies, and philosophies by which his criticism of Communism took place, would already be a seed planted within the C.I.A. to be used for any and all further criticism works.</p>

<p>The we have the rest of the above quoted source, discussing Marcuse as the &quot;father of the New Left&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His best known works are Eros and Civilization (1955) and One-Dimensional Man (1964). His Marxist scholarship inspired many radical intellectuals and political activists in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the United States and internationally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This what we do from here, we get a list of the above, &quot;inspired many radical intellectuals and political activists in the 1960s and 1970s, both in the United States and internationally,&quot; and we create a flow chart, showing where all these people went and what they influenced.</p>

<p>Regardless, from Marcuse we have the New Left:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Left</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The New Left was a broad political movement mainly in the 1960s and 1970s consisting of activists in the Western world who campaigned for a broad range of reforms on issues such as civil and political rights, feminism, gay rights, abortion rights, gender roles and drug policy reforms.[2] Some saw the New Left as an oppositional reaction to earlier Marxist and labor union movements for social justice that focused on materialism and social class, while others who used the term saw the movement as a continuation and revitalization of traditional leftist goals.[3][4]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sound familiar? This is what we have now with many of the movements that have come from the left, i.e. Antifa, BLM, a Linda Sarsour (Muslim Ideology) led women&#39;s movement (not sure of you are aware of the hypocrisy between Islam and Women&#39;s rights), various social justice movements, and so on.</p>

<p>If you want, I can create a list of the many changes that SJW&#39;s are no creating within Hollywood/Movies (all female cast in Ghostbusters 2), the call by a College Professor that all he wants for Christmas is White Genocide, and many other examples, the majority of it coming from the left/new left.</p>

<p>Also, even though Cultural Marxism was about Critique to some extent, it was also about directly changing the culture into other splinter groups:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>groups inspired by herbert marcuse</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/scholaractivists.htm">http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/scholaractivists.htm</a></p>

<p>If you click on the link above, there are at least 100 influential people in all sorts of aspects of tech, society, culture, academia directly attributing their influence in thinking to Marcuse.</p>

<p>Granted, I only covered 1 of the Frankfurt School Operatives just to show you how 1 guy, had the ability influence the Left enough to change its entire course and the 100 people he directly influenced. I have yet to cover the rest of the Frankfurt folks, but I assure you, if I did do it here, and I created a flow chart, you would see how these folks directly changed the nature of the Left and American culture</p>

<p>You know Gregor Mendel - the catholic monk who first discovered the structure of cells within cork, and pea leaves; which went on to start the whole field of genetics - believed in God and the teachings of the catholic church. However, you wouldn&#39;t look at Monsanto, and automatically think &quot;They do genetics; just like Gregor Mendel - the Catholic Church is therefore responsible for everything Monsanto does.&quot; (this is called a false syllogism BTW) ...and yet this is what you&#39;re doing with The Frankfurt School.

<blockquote>

<p>Wrong. Stuart Hall and Raymond Williams of The Birmingham School established The New Left Review, the journal which defined the politics of The New Left. Look at it this way; Marcuse and E.P.

<p>Hey dumb ass, Anarchism, Black Rights and Islam all PREDATE The Frankfurt School. None of them particularly regard themselves as left (Black Rights comes closest, but still, Black republicans love their history as much as any other).</p>

<p>WTF is your problem. Are you illiterate?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The enjoyment of the violence suffered by the movie character turns into violence against the spectator, and distraction into exertion. Nothing that the experts have devised as a stimulant must escape the weary eye; no stupidity is allowed in the face of all the trickery; one has to follow everything and even display the smart responses shown and recommended in the film. This raises the question whether the culture industry fulfils the function of diverting minds which it boasts about so loudly. If most of the radio stations and movie theatres were closed down, the consumers would probably not lose so very much. To walk from the street into the movie theatre is no longer to enter a world of dream; as soon as the very existence of these institutions no longer made it obligatory to use them, there would be no great urge to do so. Such closures would not be reactionary machine wrecking. The disappointment would be felt not so much by the enthusiasts as by the slow-witted, who are the ones who suffer for everything anyhow. In spite of the films which are intended to complete her integration, the housewife finds in the darkness of the movie theatre a place of refuge where she can sit for a few hours with nobody watching, just as she used to look out of the window when there were still homes and rest in the evening. The unemployed in the great cities find coolness in summer and warmth in winter in these temperature-controlled locations. Otherwise, despite its size, this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger. <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">-Theodor Adorno</a></p>

<p>Does he sound like he fucking put an all woman cast together for Ghost Busters 2? Are you that fucking retarded? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can create a list of the many changes that SJW&#39;s are no creating within Hollywood/Movies (all female cast in Ghostbusters 2).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes you are that fucking retarded. Not to mention how much of an asshat you look like for even treating this petty shit like it&#39;s the end of the fucking world. Women complain about the majority of violence coming from men. Or that rape victims most commonly already know their attackers - and you&#39;re here complaining that Ghost Busters 2 had women in it, and that previously unknown College Professor made a joke about white genocide (which was probably inspired by the alt-rights popularization of the term). It makes you seem soooo idiotic in comparison. It&#39;s like comparing real world issues to made up half-truth bullshit - because that&#39;s what it is; made up half-truth bullshit. Any rational and worldly person looks at your type of complaints an immediately sees them as pathetic in comparison. Like I don&#39;t mean to attack you - our views change over time; but surely you can see the left complaints about The Banking system, or Americans bombing other countries just has SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANCE AND VALIDITY than the ridiculously petty cultural histrionics you&#39;ve learnt from the right-wing post-gamergate media.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, even though Cultural Marxism was about Critique to some extent, it was also about directly changing the culture into other splinter groups</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, not really. It&#39;s about universalizing social and cultural rights and reforming an over arching system of brutalistic and culturally dominant capitalism which forms and informs a hidden ideology of money and profit, where the rich are cleansed and perfect, the poor are denigrated, and no matter how much money you have - you still have no obligation to &quot;abolish hunger&quot; as Adorno put it earlier.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>at least 100 influential people</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve influence you. Am I now responsible for every bad thing you do? No, that&#39;s fucking idiotic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you would see how these folks directly changed the nature of the Left and American culture</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes they did... and right wing theorists (like William S. Lind, and the video of his you presented earlier) change The Right, and American culture. That&#39;s how life works. The Frankfurt School are very important - but your view of them is incredibly biased.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, The Frankfurt School were involved in the denazification of Germany, The critique and collapse of the USSR. But also; they informed the nature of Medical ethics (via their critiques of Nazi human experimentation), they greatly informed the anti-consumption movement (which has informed the environmentalist movement), they enabled the creation of better and improved media - Stuart Hall <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication">predicted how we&#39;d interact</a>, E.P Thompson greatly contributed to the fight against nuclear weapons. Habermas <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dialectics-Secularization-Reason-Religion/dp/1586171666">cowrote a book with the pope.</a>...</p>

<p>...and Marcuse inspired his Student and right wing pundit Paul Gottfried to write &quot;The Strange Death of Marxism&quot; in which he writes (on page 10) of &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nothing intrinsicaly Marxist, that is to say, defines &quot;cultural Marxism,&quot; save for the evocation or hope of a postbourgeois society.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The mistake of those who see one position sequeing into another is to confuse contents with personalities.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact - isn&#39;t that EXACTLY what you&#39;re doing? Confusing the fact that Marcuse shared his contents with others; as them and their lives being controlled and indoctrinated by them? Don&#39;t you get it - everyone&#39;s moral pathway and political ideas ARE THEIR OWN. We are informed by others, but ultimately we have to make our own way, our own rationalities, and decisions. Stop cowardly hiding behind this; if you want to attack Identity Politics and Social Justice Warriors - do so directly.</p>

<p>Unless you like The Post-Modernism that Habermas critiqued? Or The Identity Politics that Nancy Fraser Critiqued? Or Hollywood and the Mainstream Media that Adorno critiqued? Or the putting rationality above morality which Horkheimer critiqued?</p>

<p>Is that it? Do you support a less moral Hollywood? Or the moral relativism of Post-Modernism? Do you support placing Identity Politics over Redistributive Politics? Or perhaps you believe nihilistic intelligence is more important than having set values/principles in life?</p>

<p>The truth is The Frankfurt School opposed these things. But you don&#39;t seem to be able to handle that fact.</p>

<p>Its hardly that. Frankfurt school gave us some good things, and some bad things. I just showed you how the New Left comes from Marcuse and over 100 people after him all who have been deeply influenced by him and the Frankfurt school who have gone in to influence all sorts of aspects of culture.</p>

<p>Listen, I was on the left just 2 years ago. There are still some sane and progressive folks who want to find common ground, unity, figure out how to fix the issues we find ourselves in, and are intellectually strong w/ good debate skills. However, the good is being undermined by a psychotic new anti-intellectual feelings based movement that is filled with hatred and is bringing in fringe elements that are fueling fires and making everything go down hill, this is why I left the left</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Let me stop you right there. 1st i&#39;m not a &quot;you guys&quot; nor am I on the right. I do agree with many philosophies from both sides. Also let me stop you about this flow chart, something I have never pushed around and this is my first time seeing it. You mistook what I said, which was that I would need to create a flowchart of the Frankfurt school operatives and do research to show who was connected to who and were certain SJW movements came from, how, why, who was involved etc. It would look nothing like that chart, however that chart has certainly piqued my interest</p>

<p>As I said before, MArcuse was me taking 1 guy and breaking him down. Everything you wrote above, I would have done as well eventually, and agree with what you wrote above. The tank commanding liberator, I&#39;m not sure what that has to do with anything. People with various different belief systems and philosophies have done goo things in their lives, this is hardly here nor there.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I have a problem with any of those which try to force themselves on others, on culture, into academia, into government, and so on, in nefarious anti-constitutional ways. Take Islam for example. I have always been against this religion since I first studied it as a teen. When you are a young ignorant atheist and are just starting to read a lot to shape your intellect and even question your own Atheism, out of my studies of the major Religions, this one crossed me as the worst of the offenders for a number of reasons, and I have always been against the spread of Islam outside of the countries it has been active in as a majority, and I have been this way throughout my whole time as a leftist. With Islam, I agree with the Right.</p>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Except the professors joke, is said in seriousness on twitter, the feminist narratives are encroaching into more aspects of gaming, hollywood, books, media, etc and you are missing the entire point. You think what I&#39;m bringing up is petty bullshit, but its not, its part of the bigger picture on how everything is becoming this idiocracy based leftism that has descended into all sorts of stupidity, all of which is causing the reaction from the other side, its what got Trump elected, its why there is now a Global rise in Nationalism, and why there is radicalism rising on both sides.</p>

<p>You fucking failed to see the point I was trying to make and right away going into dumg ass assumptions that made you look stupid.  Do you want this? Do you want this descent into what the left once stood for, to control all the movies, speech, government, media, news, censorship, tech and so on? Because I can take you right now to the South Side of Chicago, and introduce you to some people I know who do not give a fuck about any of these delusional narratives,a ll of which get burst when they folks pistol whip you and take your wallet. </p>

<p>You dont get it. If you get rid of the above, the new system wil repeat what is above. Just like the Left looks down on the right and vice versa, just like some religions want to end all the other ones and be the dominant world religion, just like some races want to end the others and be dominant. Adorno was right, but replace the system and the replacement becomes juts like the old boss</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve influence you. Am I now responsible for every bad thing you do? No, that&#39;s fucking idiotic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Loss of translation. Marcuse influenced 100 influential people, who go out and each themselves influence X of people creating a hundredth monkey scenario. That spread of what Marcuse taught, has both good element and bad elements. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Nothing intrinsicaly Marxist, that is to say, defines &quot;cultural Marxism,&quot; save for the evocation or hope of a postbourgeois society.&quot;</p>

<p>This is how it starts, the enemy is the corporation, the 1%, the bourgeois, and then you zoom out the lends to include the government, the right, white people, Christianity, straight people, the &quot;patriarchy&quot; and on and on and on it goes, which was my point from the beginning. Critical Theory looks to consume, to find the cause of all ills, and to destroy and replace it. This machine never stops, it always continues and increases until there&#39;s nothing left. Sounds exactly like what I have been personally witnessing among my old peers and the hive mind they have evolved into.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stop cowardly hiding behind this; if you want to attack Identity Politics and Social Justice Warriors - do so directly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My interest was where it started from, how it formed, its history. Why do I need to attack any of it directly? The human collective expression that forms these groups, and whatever they do good and bad, will express itself regardless and either continue, die, or plateau </p>

<p>As long as you call them &quot;Frankfurt School operatives&quot; when they were just academics, who to quote Wikipedia &quot;did not always form a series of tightly woven, complementary projects&quot; - and who FYI didn&#39;t even use the term &quot;Frankfurt School&quot; (and certainly not &quot;Cultural Marxists&quot;) to describe themselves. They weren&#39;t operatives, they were individuals. So until you can understand that - I see no hipocracy in doing the same to you; and lumping you in with &quot;those guys on the right&quot; - just as you are [reifiying](goo.gl/YzUYsu) and falsifying the positions of The Frankfurt School so I shall do unto you.</p>

<p>For starters, I&#39;d like to apologize for calling you a dumb ass, that&#39;s something I edited out of the comment (but obviously you got a prior version) - and I don&#39;t think my insulting you is accurate, or helpful to our conversation. So sorry.</p>

<p>Secondly I think it is about hijacking; Hijacking of the term &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; and subverting of what the actual Frankfurt School had to say.</p>

<p>Thirdly I think if you&#39;re going to simply assume without grounds, or any direct illustrative connections that any progress the left makes is automatically the product of Frankfurt School operatives &quot;hijacking, siding with, or infiltration&quot; - then yes; you&#39;re going to assume they&#39;re all power and omnipresent. But this isn&#39;t a product of reality; it&#39;s a product of the all-encompassing definitions you&#39;ve put in place. It&#39;s a product of the over-broad idea that all of the left has been a product of The Frankfurt School - when this is absolutely untrue. Like any movement; the left has intellectual schools, movements and waves... these happen generationally and don&#39;t always relate. For instance; The Frankfurt School informed The Birmingham School but critiqued Post-Modernism, Post-Modernism attacked Marxism, and Identity Politics emerged out of the Black Civil Rights movement and is allied with Judith Butler&#39;s Social Constructivist perspective. This doesn&#39;t automatically mean that The Frankfurt School led to The Birmingham School which led to Post-Modernism, which led to Judith Butler, which led to Identity Politics... NO there are debates, discussions, disagreements INSIDE the left, different positions and groups need mediation to come together. This is why the left values &quot;community organizers&quot; so much; because this job of getting these fragmentary groups together is difficult. So your all encompassing definitions and frankly; paranoid style of thought - is untrue, and not fitting to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik">Realpolitik</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why dont you cover some of the darker more controversial elements I&#39;m wondering?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they were dealt with as far as I can tell. Wilhelm Reich who wrote for the The Frankfurt School very early on; went mad and started writing about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone">Orgone Energy</a> and build contraptions to harvest it from the clouds. He also came up with those <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1e/ea/cc/1eeaccf424d8b297586b868c3cdcd0c3--natural-energy-orgonite.jpg">rejuvenating pyramids</a> some far-out hippies used. But as I say he was kicked out early on (and as I recall died in an American prison, held on false charges, and his works <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich#Book_burning">were burned by the American government</a>)... let&#39;s see, I mean there&#39;s the death of Walter Benjamin who was fleeing the Nazis, and rather than being caught by the Fascist Vichy government of France decided to shoot himself... I mean, all The Frankfurt School&#39;s works were done in the shadow of the holocaust. As Adorno put it: &quot;There can be no poetry after Auschwitz&quot; - so... what dark bits did you want me to cover?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>descent away from civility</p>

<p>It&#39;s frustration. There are many facts about The Frankfurt School - that I&#39;ve put to you over and over and over again - yet I still find myself having to repeat the same points.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because I can take you right now to the South Side of Chicago, and introduce you to some people I know who do not give a fuck about any of these delusional narratives,a ll of which get burst when they folks pistol whip you and take your wallet. </p>

<p>Put up the money for my flight, room and board - and FUCK YEAH I&#39;M IN! - but I&#39;m Australian, and have a knack for talking my way out of shit (I&#39;m good with people). Also; once I explain that we&#39;re there because you wanted to show me that people from the south side of Chicago (can I just assume you&#39;re saying this because it&#39;s black) they&#39;re probably more likely to pistol whip you.</p>

<p>But no, I&#39;m not really afraid that feminists might make movies, or video games, and no I don&#39;t think hate-speech laws are really a form of speech censorship. Despite what the name suggests, most of those types of laws are couched in equal employment law, and that&#39;s the main place they get used. To defend people who believe they&#39;ve been unfairly dismissed. That&#39;s a good thing - people should be fired based on their race, sexual preference or gender alone.</p>

<p>This is how it starts, the enemy is the corporation, the 1%, the bourgeois, and then you zoom out the lends to include the government, the right, white people, Christianity, straight people, the &quot;patriarchy&quot; and on and on and on it goes, which was my point from the beginning. Critical Theory looks to consume, to find the cause of all ills, and to destroy and replace it. This machine never stops, it always continues and increases until there&#39;s nothing left. Sounds exactly like what I have been personally witnessing among my old peers and the hive mind they have evolved into.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You went from worrying that Critical Theory demands a totality of criticism (it doesn&#39;t The Frankfurt School were anti-totalitarians, who as I keep stating to you were moral kantians); to giving your own totalistic critique of your &quot;old peers and the hive mind they have evolved into&quot; - have you stopped to consider that a) maybe they just have different politics to both yourself AND each other. Like maybe they&#39;re individuals with individual world views and different levels of ability to reason and discuss these things.</p>

<p>It sounds like this might be where some of your totalistic viewpoint comes from a bit; and I can empathize. The left have been very good at alienating and ostracising people whose politics don&#39;t conform, or who question the dominant cultural narrative. The left hold what&#39;s called the dominant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony">Cultural Hegemony</a> - this is one of the terms that inspired The Frankfurt School, and a function of society (along with ideology its self) which they fought against.</p>

<p>What you are experiencing isn&#39;t &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; though - it&#39;s group thing, self-righteousness, and a victimhood mentality (that last one is a legitimate criticism the right makes).</p>

<p>But like I say; just stick to the terms that are available: SJWs and Identity Politics. These are valid terms. Don&#39;t bother yourself with The Frankfurt School unless you&#39;re willing to accept what they actually wrote, over what you&#39;ve heard they were about.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interesting in understanding where the modern SJWs came from, you&#39;d be much better served by understanding neo-liberalism. Neo-liberalism is the left wing form of capitalism. It advocates progressive social policies, and free market economic policies - it is how the left manage to support welfare and war at the same time.</p>

<p>That and of course, Identity Politics, particularly Judith Butler&#39;s concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender">Socially Constructed &#39;performative&#39; gender</a>.</p>

<p>Here is how I believe the modern SJW left emerged. I contend it specifically occurred when they decided the term &quot;underprivileged&quot; was a disabling and detrimental term... in doing so they took a step back from universalism of rights, and towards a belief that they had to attack people based on racial, gender, or sexual &quot;privilege&quot;... this tactic was helpful in the short run, but not the long term - and has result both in getting their message out there but at the cost of alienating young men.</p>

In the US,   the generation that is going to move this forward hasn&#39;t been born yet,   or at least hasn&#39;t spoken yet.    The battlelines of the the past are not what is going to shape the people who get down and dirty and practical about working things out in a society that isn&#39;t rigged by a military backed petrodollar.

<p>I&#39;ve known this, however, I do not think the solution is bringing in 3rd world Muslims by the millions into first world countries that are non-musilm.</p>

<p>Its cheaper and easier to help them in their countries, to send aid, to rebuild there:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/7lw499/oxford_professor_helping_refugees_locally_is_135/">https://np.reddit.com/r/ukpolitics/comments/7lw499/oxford_professor_helping_refugees_locally_is_135/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/syrian-refugees-will-cost-ten-times-more-to-care-for-in-europe-than-in-neighboring-countries-a6928676.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/syrian-refugees-will-cost-ten-times-more-to-care-for-in-europe-than-in-neighboring-countries-a6928676.html</a></p>

<p>Or the refugees should be taken in by other countries that have Muslim cultures so there is a easier integration. For example, Saudi Arabia took none.</p>

<p>This is causing a massive rise in Far Right Nationalists, an Italian just did a drive by on African migrants in Italy and is being hailed a hero by Italians, this is going to cause civil wars all across Europe, its really bad news.</p>

<p>In the long run, I think Europe will become majority Muslim and entirely wipe out the native Europeans there. Can you call that karma though? Is it payback for Germans trying to Genocide the Jews?</p>

<p>Or will there be a mixed race that comes out of this and ultimately pull the 3rd worlders out of the 3rd world? I doubt the last part because of this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE</a></p>

<p>Its a mess regardless. The one thing I always mistrusted and think is bad news, even when I was far left, was Islam as a third world unevolved ideology, the majority of which does not allow for a progressive reformation for the sake of coexistence.</p>

<p>All the other major religions, Catholicism, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism, etc have for the most part, reach a collective progressive reformation. Islam doesnt allow for that because of what their Koran states.</p>

<p>I can add a lot more about the issues with Islam, but I am going to save it for well sourced criticism for a future post here, similar to the OP</p>

<p>Agreed, but the issues with Islam even prior to geopolitical maneuvering via conquests for oil/control/etc still continued within those countries. Issues like normalcy of inbreeding between 1st cousins, pedophilia (Bacha Bazi), Fundamentalism, Tyrant rulers, misogyny, anti-gay, and so on </p>

The M.E. wars are another front, Islam another front, M.I.C. another front, deep state another front, eroding the constitution via nefarious operatives is another front, NWO globalists another front, etc. Basically, if you take a nap, you&#39;ve already missed the encroachment of any or all of these elements.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Out of that generational rift, the left got more and more distorted, identity politics became a lot more important. I know you said somewhere you used to be a liberal yourself. What we need at this point is people who are neither left nor right who realize that both sides are sold out and that the deep state and the corporate sponsors have an agenda that needs to have the people distracted by fake divisions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>100% this is what I want to do. We are soooooo fucked if we stay divided. This allows any of the other players to manipulate freely both sides in order to get what they want, i.e. China money is starting to influence the Universities, Russian influence, Israel and the M.I.C., etc</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Corporate welfare, social program handouts, even religious ideology, communist ideology, as long as the elites can use that stuff to stay in power, thats what we need to be looking at. When we fall for it, we are slitting our own throats. The way of life is turning to shit.</p>

<p>What do you think is the answer?</p>

<p>Issues like normalcy of inbreeding between 1st cousins, pedophilia (Bacha Bazi), Fundamentalism, Tyrant rulers, misogyny, anti-gay</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are human issues as much as they are Muslim,  Christian,  or pre-Muslim issues.    After all,   Islam was invented in 622 but didn&#39;t reach Turkey until the fall of Byzantium Apr 6, 1453.   That&#39;s recent in the scope of history,  around the time of Columbus,   about as long as Catholicism has been in South America as far as places like Bosnia are concerned.    Have you been to Bosnia or Turkey?   I have.   I was there in the late 60&#39;s,   also Croatia,  etc.,  the whole area.   Or look at Afghanistan or Iran or Egypt in the mid to late 60&#39;s.  Religion was on the wane.   The rise of Islamic fundamentalism coincided with the rise of a new Christian Fundamentalism in the US,  where religion had also been on the wane before the likes of Billy Graham lead a new Christian movement.   I am not defending religion.   But the clash with people who were tribal recently and are still somewhat tribal reminds me of the excuses used against the Native Americans.    Or even the excuses against the Japanese and the Chinese or the Indians etc.  during the last years of colonialism by Britain,  France,  Spain etc.    Looking back at the clash of the Ottomans should not be an excuse to pile on the ignorance.   The first university in Europe was founded by Muslims in Spain.    Mathematics,   Greek philosophy were more advanced within the Islamic centers of power than they were in Europe during the Dark Ages.    Be careful about falling into a pit of lies.    Appalachia is still in the Dark Ages in some areas as far as inbreeding between 1st cousins, pedophilia, Fundamentalism, Tyrant rulers, misogyny, anti-gay,  snake charmers etc. </p>

<p>The US military has challenges on many fronts,  but this does not mean that the Middle East wars were not fabricated.    The US military are the mercenaries for the NWO globalists,  and the deep state,  its not three things.</p>

<p>The video above from 2004 addresses the answer.    </p>

<p>For us small fry,  the game is rigged.    Some of us do well in Silicon Valley,   or are otherwise relatively comfortable and shut up,  even hope the machine keeps rolling along without too much upset to our favorite distractions.   More and more of us are closer to the edge of dystopia,  and are clearly headed for even more pain.   </p>

<h1>Actually <a href="/u/OT-GOD-IS-DEMIURGE">/u/OT-GOD-IS-DEMIURGE</a></h1>

<p>The Frankfurt School &quot;Cultural Marxists&quot; in fact <a href="https://newleftreview.org/II/3/nancy-fraser-rethinking-recognition">critiqued Identity Politics</a> - Nancy Fraser, who is both a Critical Theorist and has studied under Frankfurt School (to the point she&#39;s listed <a href="https://www.marxists.org/subject/frankfurt-school/">on their marxist.org page</a>) built her academic career <a href="https://newleftreview.org/II/3/nancy-fraser-rethinking-recognition">critiquing the Identity Politics model</a> (she&#39;s been doing this for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy_Fraser#Fortunes_of_Feminism">33 years now</a>).</p>

<p>Likewise, Jurgen Habermas has been <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/postmodernism/#9">critiquing the moral relativism of Post-Modernism</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Habermas#Habermas_versus_postmodernists">37+ years</a>, and has also built his academic career on doing so.</p>

<p>The Frankfurt School were interested in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">critiquing liberal Hollywood and the MSM</a> - what Adorno called &quot;easy going liberalism&quot;.</p>

<p>...and finally there was Max Horkheimer, who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Horkheimer#Eclipse_of_Reason">critiqued &#39;Instrumental Reason&#39;</a> saying that unless it was combined with morality, it could produce things like the Nazi regime.</p>

<p>...Identity Politics <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_politics#History">didn&#39;t even</a> come from The Frankfurt School... it came from a Boston woman named Barbara Smith... and like I say, they&#39;ve argued against it.</p>

<p>Fromm was kicked out of The Frankfurt School, and Lukacs is one of their biggest critics, he described them as having:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;taken up residence in the ‘Grand Hotel Abyss’ which I described in connection with my critique of Schopenhauer as ‘a beautiful hotel, equipped with every comfort, on the edge of an abyss, of nothingness, of absurdity. And the daily contemplation of the abyss between excellent meals or artistic entertainments, can only heighten the enjoyment of the subtle comforts offered.’&quot; <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/lukacs/works/theory-novel/preface.htm">Source</a></p>

<p>See that, it&#39;s a DIRECT LINK to a source text. Your problem is you&#39;re paraphrasing and using OTHER PEOPLE&#39;S interpretation. You&#39;re trusting random people. I&#39;m linking directly to the sources.</p>

<p>David Horowitz, Antonio Gramsci, Vladimir Lenin weren&#39;t even in The Frankfurt School.... so you&#39;re waaay off even in your definition of the group. Sorry dude, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re on about.</p>

<p>The video made by William S. Lind of The Free Congress Foundation (a paleoconservative think tank), who literally writes believes The Frankfurt School keep putting homosexuals on his Television:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, when the cultural Marxists want to do something like “normalize” homosexuality, they do not argue the point philosophically. They just beam television show after television show into every American home where the only normal-seeming white male is a homosexual (the Frankfurt School’s key people spent the war years in Hollywood). -<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjaBpVzOohs">William S. Lind</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who accuses them of &quot;infiltrating Hollywood&quot; when none of them ever worked in the movie industry in any capacity and they&#39;re <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">specifically critiquing that industry</a> (oh look, and ORIGINAL SOURCE).</p>

<p>A guy who I&#39;ve already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4MEtnuOy-_s">linked you a video which directly critiques him.</a> A guy who has been described by someone who actually FOUGHT in war as having:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;never dodged a bullet, he had never led men in combat, he had never even worn a uniform and clearly spending way too much time playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who is now critiquing people who DID dodge bullets. A guy who has written a <a href="https://www.traditionalright.com/victoria/">fictional novel about a Cultural Marxist take over,</a> (because he&#39;s that infatuated with the &quot;truth&quot; of his ideas) and (as you can read on Wikipedia, and in his own writings) advocates a return to Amish times (he&#39;s a Paleo Conservative)... and has given lectures on his &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; theory at holocaust denial conferences?</p>

<p>...and you think I should watch HIS video again. A guy whose main influence has been working under the radical Senator Taft Jr. during the Cold War, adopting his republican fear of the reds, and passing it on (literally in a letter writing campaign) to the modern generation - the guy who put this BS in your head?</p>

<p>How about: NO, how about I don&#39;t watch his video again.</p>

<p>I stop being leftist because the revolution was focused against the NWO, the 1%, the systems in place, humanitarian efforts, calling out corruption wherever it is, etc. After Occupy Wall St. (I was there) everything splintered in identity politics, race politics, gender politics, trans this, bathrooms that, anti-free speech, more communists, more radical types wanting to burn buildings down just because, more people infighting, etc.</p>

<p>So I watched it all descend into some screeching, feelings based, infiltrated, infighting, division and arguments, hatred, etc type of movement. Now some of my old leftist peers are discussing ending white people, they are debating no longer having gay/trans pride parades because of Muslim feelings, and other things that are just ridiculous to me with where I was in my life and starting to see the bigger picture.</p>

<p>I noped the fuck out, but I wanted to understand where all these micro movements came from, how did it enter the collective, why are all the universities majority liberal, why is there no longer healthy debate and critical thinking, why are the school system programs the way they are and how did they get there, and a lot of it has to do with the OP.</p>

<p>Granted there are still some sane people on the left who are progressive and they realize the insanity and infighting, but they are drowned out by the infighters.</p>

<p>At the same time I started getting into Zen, Advaita, Dzogchen, learning the art of no opinion, no view, naked awareness/consciousness i.e. a pure form of objectivity and seeing that any view is already duality, already Hegelian in a sense, already limited, already brings with it, its baggage (detractors, supporters, critics, etc)</p>

<p>So again, I noped the fuck out and came to terms with a major 3rd party gaining the same level of popularity and power as the left/right have. What would this 3rd party look like? I&#39;m still trying to hash things out, so I can&#39;t give you anything concrete yet, but basically something Unifying the majority and best of both worlds </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Look, if you are too impatient for the sweeping changes that communism has promised you,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not a communist and do not see it ever working in any historic model or future model ala (Communists say any true communism has never been tried)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>just chill out and relax, the revolution WILL come, with or without your approval and then all these annoying intersectional political problems will simply evaporate. See you at the first yard line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That revolution is going to be, short term, A.I. + Robotics + Technocracy, and its going to be uglier than what we have now.</p>

<p>Long term it&#39;ll be a new human 2.0 engineered with super intelligence and 100 year life spans, after A.I. reverse engineers genetics</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cultural Marxism was The Frankfurt School&#39;s critique of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_industry">The Culture Industry</a>. It was an early critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism. Adorno had things like this to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Culture Industry not so much adapts to the reactions of its customers as it counterfeits them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man’s lives. The idea of “fully exploiting” available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ruthless unity in the culture industry is evidence of what will happen in politics. Marked differentiations such as those of A and B films, or of stories in magazines in different price ranges, depend not so much on subject matter as on classifying, organising, and labelling consumers. Something is provided for all so that none may escape&quot; -Theodor W. Adorno, <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/adorno/1944/culture-industry.htm">Enlightenment as mass-deception</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile Marcuse warned everyone that &quot;progressive politics&quot; could also become repressive and regressive in it&#39;s own ways:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=al3aOuqpVbs</a></p>

<p>...and The Birmingham School warned that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#The_.22drift.22">culture was drifting away</a> from local culture. Due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#Massification_of_culture">Massification of culture in the form of the globalization of media + tabloid journalism.</a></p>

<p>This was a pre-internet critique of mainstream media and neo-liberalism, and ended around the time media became more democratized in the 80s, when the internet began to be foreshadowed with Zines, DIY culture, and public radio/TV. That&#39;s when the tail end of the Birmingham School declared the need to critique mass media <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encoding/decoding_model_of_communication">to be kind of over because everyone could talk to everyone.</a></p>

<p>There are some cool concepts and theories that came out of the school sure, but was it all good, was it all balanced? Hardly so. You can take critical theory and continue to criticize and work on breaking down everything that exists, even good things. </p>

<p>There are a number of books, philosophers, theories, that discuss how the culture/values expressed through Christianity/Neo-Platonism, are ultimately good, and this was instrumental in the constitution and foundation of what America is about.</p>

<p>If you start to create movements to tear down what I described above, then what is it that will replace the vacuum in its wake? I&#39;m not religious, but I value and understand the importance the family structure brings to children getting the male/female dichotomy in their upbringing, and how the lack of the father figure in the Black culture leads to an imbalance.</p>

<p>Is the answer Islam? Show we bring in more Muslims then and let that replace the systems and cultures that have been in place and brought us what we have here? Is it communism? Is it socialism? Is it a free for all no culture movement that allows cultures to battle it out in the open market?</p>

<p>Is it a non-religious feminist Gov like Sweden? Do you even know what&#39;s going on over there right now?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Aren&#39;t the majority of Jews leftist liberals who are fully aboard what my OP is referring to? Whether its a conscious decision and conspiratorial or not, that can definitely be argued. We can take the liberal bias in the majority of News Media. For example, how Conan O&#39;Brien shows all the news journalists repeating all the same talking points:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM8L7bdwVaA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TM8L7bdwVaA</a></p>

<p>So now explain this Barbara Spectre to me. Can you do this? What the video, analyze what she is saying there, look into her organization and who is funding it and have a discussion about this and whether or not something like this would fall into what we are discussing here?</p>

<p>Not from The Frankfurt School&#39;s neo-kantian perspective you can&#39;t. Because that POV <strong>SPECIFICALLY</strong> factors in values as well as facts (as opposed to the positivist viewpoint that there are only facts).</p>

<p>Not everything you read is true. There&#39;s plenty of batshit crazy things that are written in the bible that are harmful. You&#39;re just whitewashing it.</p>

<p>These are just right wing talking points, and have nothing to do with The Frankfurt School or Cultural Marxism (which to say it again; is The Frankfurt School and Birmingham School&#39;s critique of mass production. See The Birmingham School&#39;s concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Uses_of_Literacy#The_.22drift.22">&quot;Cultural Drift&quot;</a> (which seems to cohere with your values).</p>

<p>Also; no, Religion isn&#39;t required for people to be good, or for society to function. That&#39;s why the social contract exists, that&#39;s why social control mechanisms, repression and suppression of certain behaviours and ways of thinking. That&#39;s why the political divide exists, because it&#39;s a discussion about what we need to suppress and repress. Both sides have some valid points in this discussion, but you&#39;re adopting this backwards right wing white washing of the bible, and hatred for a group of relatively obscure German social theorists from the 1940s, and it&#39;s not really based on the facts/evidence. I mean, it doesn&#39;t take much of a search on youtube to find out there&#39;s some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMRe3ghHpk0&amp;amp;list=PLQydEt2q56pG4iHX1KrSyXW_xfKmW2E67">fucked up shit in the bible.</a> - HOWEVER - I accept that most Christians know how to put these bible stories in a kind of irrelevant historical context. This is the view that the &quot;word is living&quot;. Would you be willing to accept a similarly lenient <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JordanPeterson/comments/7rn3wv/the_terror_of_privilege/">reading of privilege theory?</a> - somehow I doubt it.</p>

<p>You&#39;re fucking talking points are Sweden and Islam? So yeah; I can tell from a mile away that you spend your time absorbing conservative right leaning media. You and your &quot;I&#39;m a centrist&quot; bullshit. Go talk to some random Swedes - it&#39;s like anyone other place; it has a right and left media - and like most places the most hysterical people on the right are high up in the media. Where as the most hysterical people on the left; are in the radical fringe groups (where they belong). Also; not everyone is American (I&#39;m not).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Aren&#39;t the majority of Jews leftist liberals</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Religious Jews tend to be - RELIGIOUS. Also, who gives a fuck about your Conan O&#39;Brien conspiracy theory.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Barbara Spectre... ...and whether or not something like this would fall into what we are discussing here?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let&#39;s see: Is Barbara Spectre from The Frankfurt School or Birmingham School? No.</p>

<p>Is Barbara Spectre making a critique of the mass produced for-profit pop-culture found with Capitalism? No.</p>

<p>So looks like your answer is: No.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So now explain this Barbara Spectre to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That said; if you want my comment on her in general (Separate from your OP): She doesn&#39;t think &#39;white culture&#39; exists. Look at it this way; American culture exists, Australian culture exists, Swedish culture exists, French, German, Irish culture, but these all have their specific nuances that aren&#39;t interchangeable. Slang for something being bullshit for instance, is going to be different in all of these cultures, as will traditional dances and mating rituals, standards of politeness or formality, what&#39;s acceptable, what isn&#39;t (eg. public drinking, speaking ill of the church, how cheese is made, ect...).</p>

<p>Barbara Spectre&#39;s point is; there is no &quot;white culture&quot; - Australians don&#39;t care too much for religion or religious differences. The Irish do. Most Americans are German Protestants, most Irish are Catholics. The French prefer bacterially alive cheese and keep it in the cupboard. Americans sterilize their cheese and keep it in the fridge. Romanians <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Foh_JXidSVI">do this stupid dance</a>. Russians <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9opZaOUqLk">do this stupid dance</a>.</p>

<p>SO why does she put Jews at the centre of multiculturalism? Well that&#39;s simple; because the Jews are one of the world&#39;s major victims of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_diaspora">diaspora</a> (the sporation of dialogues). This was a product of WW2. They&#39;re also a fan of societies being cohesive and functional as WW2 left a scar on their psyche. So they know from an extreme example the nature of having to move to safer ground.</p>

<p>Frankly my friend, I think you need to become a HARD CORE skeptic, you need to really practice hearing one thing from one side of politics; and then immediately going and researching it FROM THE OTHER SIDE of politics. You seem like you&#39;ve fallen for a lot of stock standard memes of the right, and none of the memes from the left.</p>

<p>....and no, the left&#39;s memes are not funny, they&#39;re just things the left spread around to keep sane. They&#39;re particularly unfunny, so don&#39;t look for entertainment on the left. They tend to be more factual and academic about things. It&#39;s very dry compared to the hysterical &quot;SOCIETY IS COLLAPSING&quot; line of the right.</p>

<p>You also need to keep in mind that there are loud and extreme views on both sides... and to not listen to them so much. Ideology, and ideologues are almost always wrong, or at the very least - contain huge gaps spurred on by emotions (such as your fear of social collapse). I&#39;ve got something much scarier for you: That society will continue on, in a fairly mundane way. That your life will not change or be effected by anything you&#39;ve written about in any major way - that these swings of political turmoil you feel - are a product of social and political programming, and are actually a waste of your time... but that you&#39;ll continue to feel them even if you realize this. That&#39;s the power of society and culture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yuri Bezmenov worked for RiA Novosti (a USSR owned newspaper equivalent of Russia Today). He wrote for this outlet in India, where he met his Indian wife. This was the extent of his &quot;subversion&quot; - writing media propaganda for a well known Russian outlet, in India.</p>

<p>He was let into Canada as a political asylum seeker, by Justin Trudeau&#39;s father, where his books, book tour, and the above interview video you&#39;ve posted was funded by The John Birch Society. A self-described conservative advocacy group supporting anti-communism and limited government, whose sole purpose was to be against communism. The JBS lost favour with the American public when they got caught trying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Birch_Society#Eisenhower_issue">to accuse then President Dwight D. Eisenhower of being a secret communist agent</a> (who knows maybe he was a &quot;Frankfurt School Operative&quot; too).</p>

<p>Bezmenov was ultimately a Social Justice Warrior too. Writing in his book &quot;Black is Beautiful, Communism is Not&quot; he writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe that black is beautiful, but unlike some of your liberals, I practice what I preach. I live in a black area of Los Angeles, in the city which has the best black mayor in the United States, Tom Bradley. I am married to a girl who is rather black, maybe not as black as Andrew Young or Jesse Jackson, but nobody’s perfect. And I am trying to bring such beautiful concepts as equality, justice, and freedom into practical implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He never mentions The Frankfurt School, or &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; yet his video is shared by people who attack and misunderstand these terms... most of whom have no idea about his actual role, his Indian wife, or even the nature of the video production they&#39;re watching.</p>

<p>Sure, some things were reasonable, such as the discussion of and the critique of anything and everything. There is certainly an element of critical thinking, but there is also an element within it where you can use critical theory using anything and everything in terms of justification to break down and destroy all aspects of culture.</p>

<p>The main question here, is was the cultural marxism, and also by proxy, aspects of post modernism, a conspiratorial planned movement which spread and infiltrated all aspects of Western Culture?</p>

<p>Save yourself the bother of exposing Islam.   The first country to recognize the US was a Muslim country,   Morocco.    </p>

<p>More people were needlessly killed by the US in the last 30 years than by Muslims.

<p>Now that the war on terror is falling apart and the US is exposed for supporting Al Qaeda and ISIS,  we are resurrecting the cold war against Russia.    Once again,   its the military industrial complex that has us by the balls.    We can rationalize that its Marxism or Islam,   or now Russia&#39;s oligarchs,   but really,   its time to look at what we have done,   what we are doing,  and how destructive that is and will continue to be.

<p>As long as you call them &quot;Frankfurt School operatives&quot; when they were just academics, who to quote Wikipedia &quot;did not always form a series of tightly woven, complementary projects&quot; - and who FYI didn&#39;t even use the term &quot;Frankfurt School&quot; (and certainly not &quot;Cultural Marxists&quot;) to describe themselves. They weren&#39;t operatives, they were individuals. So until you can understand that - I see no hipocracy in doing the same to you; and lumping you in with &quot;those guys on the right&quot; - just as you are [reifiying](goo.gl/YzUYsu) and falsifying the positions of The Frankfurt School so I shall do unto you.</p>

<p>For starters, I&#39;d like to apologize for calling you a dumb ass, that&#39;s something I edited out of the comment (but obviously you got a prior version) - and I don&#39;t think my insulting you is accurate, or helpful to our conversation. So sorry.</p>

<p>Secondly I think it is about hijacking; Hijacking of the term &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; and subverting of what the actual Frankfurt School had to say.</p>

<p>Thirdly I think if you&#39;re going to simply assume without grounds, or any direct illustrative connections that any progress the left makes is automatically the product of Frankfurt School operatives &quot;hijacking, siding with, or infiltration&quot; - then yes; you&#39;re going to assume they&#39;re all power and omnipresent. But this isn&#39;t a product of reality; it&#39;s a product of the all-encompassing definitions you&#39;ve put in place. It&#39;s a product of the over-broad idea that all of the left has been a product of The Frankfurt School - when this is absolutely untrue. Like any movement; the left has intellectual schools, movements and waves... these happen generationally and don&#39;t always relate. For instance; The Frankfurt School informed The Birmingham School but critiqued Post-Modernism, Post-Modernism attacked Marxism, and Identity Politics emerged out of the Black Civil Rights movement and is allied with Judith Butler&#39;s Social Constructivist perspective. This doesn&#39;t automatically mean that The Frankfurt School led to The Birmingham School which led to Post-Modernism, which led to Judith Butler, which led to Identity Politics... NO there are debates, discussions, disagreements INSIDE the left, different positions and groups need mediation to come together. This is why the left values &quot;community organizers&quot; so much; because this job of getting these fragmentary groups together is difficult. So your all encompassing definitions and frankly; paranoid style of thought - is untrue, and not fitting to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realpolitik">Realpolitik</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why dont you cover some of the darker more controversial elements I&#39;m wondering?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because they were dealt with as far as I can tell. Wilhelm Reich who wrote for the The Frankfurt School very early on; went mad and started writing about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone">Orgone Energy</a> and build contraptions to harvest it from the clouds. He also came up with those <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/1e/ea/cc/1eeaccf424d8b297586b868c3cdcd0c3--natural-energy-orgonite.jpg">rejuvenating pyramids</a> some far-out hippies used. But as I say he was kicked out early on (and as I recall died in an American prison, held on false charges, and his works <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Reich#Book_burning">were burned by the American government</a>)... let&#39;s see, I mean there&#39;s the death of Walter Benjamin who was fleeing the Nazis, and rather than being caught by the Fascist Vichy government of France decided to shoot himself... I mean, all The Frankfurt School&#39;s works were done in the shadow of the holocaust. As Adorno put it: &quot;There can be no poetry after Auschwitz&quot; - so... what dark bits did you want me to cover?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But no, I&#39;m not really afraid that feminists might make movies, or video games, and no I don&#39;t think hate-speech laws are really a form of speech censorship. Despite what the name suggests, most of those types of laws are couched in equal employment law, and that&#39;s the main place they get used. To defend people who believe they&#39;ve been unfairly dismissed. That&#39;s a good thing - people should be fired based on their race, sexual preference or gender alone.</p>

<p>You went from worrying that Critical Theory demands a totality of criticism (it doesn&#39;t The Frankfurt School were anti-totalitarians, who as I keep stating to you were moral kantians); to giving your own totalistic critique of your &quot;old peers and the hive mind they have evolved into&quot; - have you stopped to consider that a) maybe they just have different politics to both yourself AND each other. Like maybe they&#39;re individuals with individual world views and different levels of ability to reason and discuss these things.</p>

<p>It sounds like this might be where some of your totalistic viewpoint comes from a bit; and I can empathize. The left have been very good at alienating and ostracising people whose politics don&#39;t conform, or who question the dominant cultural narrative. The left hold what&#39;s called the dominant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_hegemony">Cultural Hegemony</a> - this is one of the terms that inspired The Frankfurt School, and a function of society (along with ideology its self) which they fought against.</p>

<p>What you are experiencing isn&#39;t &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; though - it&#39;s group thing, self-righteousness, and a victimhood mentality (that last one is a legitimate criticism the right makes).</p>

<p>But like I say; just stick to the terms that are available: SJWs and Identity Politics. These are valid terms. Don&#39;t bother yourself with The Frankfurt School unless you&#39;re willing to accept what they actually wrote, over what you&#39;ve heard they were about.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re interesting in understanding where the modern SJWs came from, you&#39;d be much better served by understanding neo-liberalism. Neo-liberalism is the left wing form of capitalism. It advocates progressive social policies, and free market economic policies - it is how the left manage to support welfare and war at the same time.</p>

<p>That and of course, Identity Politics, particularly Judith Butler&#39;s concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_construction_of_gender">Socially Constructed &#39;performative&#39; gender</a>.</p>

<p>Here is how I believe the modern SJW left emerged. I contend it specifically occurred when they decided the term &quot;underprivileged&quot; was a disabling and detrimental term... in doing so they took a step back from universalism of rights, and towards a belief that they had to attack people based on racial, gender, or sexual &quot;privilege&quot;... this tactic was helpful in the short run, but not the long term - and has result both in getting their message out there but at the cost of alienating young men.</p>
