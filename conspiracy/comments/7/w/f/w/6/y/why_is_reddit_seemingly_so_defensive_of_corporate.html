       I've noticed this a lot during my time lurking r/askreddit, literally every time someone says something negative about corporate greed, it will always be downvoted to the bottom instantly. Like wtf, i don't understand this are people completely stupid? How is this even possible, what even compels so many people to defend such shady business practices, its like stating the fact that greed is the source of most of life's problems is seemingly taboo for the masses. Example, even insuite that the government is likely hiding the cure for cancer or attack Monsanto, and you will be downvoted to -30 instantly. This really makes me lose hope in society

       From birth, we are conditioned to idolize the rich and powerful.  It's a carefully crafted narrative, because hey, don't you want to be like them?  Fact is, 99% of you have no chance to be like them, but they can't accept that.   So, they defend the rich and argue their arguments for them.  Simply because they want to be rich, and if they argued against the rich, then what hypocrites they'd be!

       It's easy to want to be something other than what you are when you see no purpose to your life and have no pride in your work.
For example: Joe an 18 year old minimum wage worker at McDonald's who operates a cash register hands a wrapped burger in a bag to a customer. Customer opens bag and wrapper and pulls a tomato off of burger and throws it on the counter in front of Joe splashing Juice on Joes shirt. Customer says I told you Dummies no tomatoes. Joe has a burger reordered after giving a shit ass apology to the customers satisfaction. Customer snatches bag from Joe turns without a word and leaves. Later that night Joe watches TV and escapes reality...
      </p>
      <p>
       Being able to witness or to have understanding of the fruits of ones labor can instill pride. We seem to have lost this as a whole in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to imagine (not advocating slavery whatsoever) that people who worked on ancient monuments could easily have pride in thier works. Or the men and women who contributed to the Hoover Dam. Or the propagandized industrial machine of WWII in the U.S.

       I used to believe this quote for a long time until i realized there was multiple active campaigns run within the United States after the Great Depression to extinguish a massive Socialist uprising across the United States.

       I tend to lean toward a UK professor who stated, socialism(he was speaking of socialized medicine) only took root in Europe due to the massive destruction that occurred during WW2.  The US has never had anything that compared that amount of destruction.  During the rebuilding it was determined that every person was affected and no one should be without healthcare due to economic status.  It very well may take something similar before the US will accept that as a necessary thing for any advanced society.

       I used to assume generally speaking most people ignored upvotes and downvotes and used the NEW tab all the time.  The inability to post for a while after getting beaten with downvotes was a consequence but overall I thought reddit a more savvy audience that read to consume information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reality is that many people aren't browsing NEW, and those downvotes push things out of sight.  It makes perfect sense that part of a corporation's marketing strategy is to pay people to browse reddit, twitter, facebook, wherever and bury any dissent.  In turn, then, it makes sense to seek out everything, the highest voted, the downvoted, the no voted.  Who wants to read u/GallowBoob posts exclusively.

       I think it's less about being defensive of corporate greed (and frankly just plain old fashioned cheating and law breaking), and more about being hyper-defensive about communism, socialism and Marxism.  To many people, any criticism of corporate entities or behavior is an attempt to undermine capitalism.  The truth is that capitalism works best (in theory) when everyone - without exception - is subject to the same rule, letter and spirit of the law (and it is enforced).  We obviously fall short of the ideal, because bad actors will and do break and bend the rules, and so naturally people get defensive when that fact gets pointed out.

       There’s a fundamental problem that in Capitalism wealth consolidates into a quantity that will easily corrupt any government.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before long - politicians are funded by wealth and “The People” are not represented by the lawmakers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you start out with laws against this - consolidated wealth is powerful enough to undermine those laws and chip away at them year after year until they are gone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Americans are so brainwashed that I can’t even express this thought without someone getting rageful in real life (or downvoting on Reddit.)

       Monetary corruption happens in every single governmental system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideological corruption primarily only happens in socialist/communist authoritarian systems because the government has so much control over narrative and finance.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion ideological corruption is the worse of the two, because it's harder to see happening.

       Ideological corruption happens just as much under capitalism.

       Our MSM is proof of that, driven not by accuracy and integrity, but based solely upon viewership and commercial revenue.

       Even on this sub, just today, a bunch of people were defending corporate tax breaks for corporations and the rich. It's like another user said on this thread: we are trained to idolize and worship the rich.

       Americans are programmed to their core from day one to
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       capitalism even though few of them are capitalists... And most of them work for sad wages, often multiple jobs and no benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Love” isn’t even a strong enough word. If you so much as mention any negative side effect of Capitalism it’s like you are directly attacking them. You could say personal insults about their wives or mothers and they would react less strongly...
      </p>
      <p>
       The programming runs deep.

       Reddit has become much more corporate overall as its business partners seek to monetize their investments.  Smaller subs are where it's at.  Check out

       There's also "corporate welfare." Which is greater than social welfare, but that rarely gets mentioned, when people are complaining about the lazy "takers" in our society.

       It wouldn't be surprising if certain notorious companies/industries had paid staff scanning social media to refute, downvote and otherwise mute any criticisms leveled at them.
      </p>

       I saw this in action in the late 90's when I was working on a website launch for a particular anti-corporate "brand." We had SO MANY negative posts, it was amazing. Especially since the site hadn't officially launched yet, didn't show up in search engines yet, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only way anyone knew to post on our site was if they new the URL before the site was even officially up. And yet there were 100's of posts criticizing, insulting and arguing against us.
