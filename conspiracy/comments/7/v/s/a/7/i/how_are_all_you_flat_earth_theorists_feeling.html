    <div class="md"><p>i watched at work with some coworkers. none of which are flat earthers. but all of which said the video looked off.</p>

<p>while im open to the theory, i dont necessarily subscribe to it.</p>

<p>perhaps those with more knowledge about space can answer a few things for me:
1: the temp in space - would the suns radiation not burn/melt/disintegrate the unprotected tires and car interior?
2: the rockets really had enough fuel to get to the upper atmosphere and land safely? from what i recall growing up the fuel to weight ratio seems off here. im no scientist, let alone a rocket scientist so someone please help me out here.</p>

<p>not saying this didnt happen, incredible feat either way, just some questions id like answered. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite true. Because it&#39;s in a near-vacuum, heat transfer is extremely slow. It will eventually impart all that heat onto an object there, but it takes a long time.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>True, but misleading. How temperature changes in a convective environment depends on <em>energy density</em> more than temperature. The energy density up there is very low because it&#39;s nearly a vacuum, so convection is basically not happening at all.</p>

<p>To understand this better, put an ice cube on a plate and drop another one into a glass of room-temperature water and observe which one melts first. The one in the water melts a <em>lot</em> faster even at the same temperature because there&#39;s more <em>stuff</em> around it from which heat can move into it.</p>

<p>You and your friends got a lot of experience with rocketry?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the temp in space</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Space doesn&#39;t have a temperature. It&#39;s a vacuum — or at that altitude, nearly a vacuum. That means heat can only be transferred by radiation, not by convection. Does the sun shining on something warm it up? Sure. Does it cause it to spontaneously explode or anything? Nope.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the rockets really had enough fuel to get to the upper atmosphere and land safely?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. This is not actually new. Space X has been doing powered returns for a while now. It requires more propellant than just letting the stage burn out and ditching it in the Atlantic, but the extra propellant cost is (in principle) offset by the cost savings of reusing the stage instead of building a whole new one.</p>

<p>But you had no real expectations. You&#39;d never seen anything like this before. &quot;It looks fake&quot; is only a valid thing to say if you&#39;re comparing it to something <em>real</em> and finding meaningful differences.</p>

<p>An indoor swimming pool appears blue from above. as light reflecting from the bottom of the pool travels through enough water that its red component is absorbed. The same water in a smaller bucket looks only slightly blue,[1] and observing the water at close range makes it appear colorless to the human eye.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, it&#39;s just cause we didn&#39;t find the mechanism, thanks.  The fact that gravity hasn&#39;t been proven has left the door open for debate.  Many great people have tackled gravity, tried to prove it and find it&#39;s &#39;mechanism&#39;.  It&#39;s unfortunate that it has not been settled.  And it would be sad if people stopped looking for answers.</p>

<p>I get the feeling you are too biased to entertain any of these theories.</p>

<p>I can tell you clearly;  I do not care what you believe and have no desire to change what you believe.  I do not believe the earth is flat.  I just find the topic interesting.  I think it&#39;s crazy it resurfaced?  How, why, has it happened before?  I think it&#39;s crazy it&#39;s allowed to exist as an idea.  I have never thought of it before a few years ago...I think that is weird.  And maybe most of all I think it&#39;s so crazy the reaction of people like you.  There are so many people out there that truly believe in batshit crazy things...the Mandela effect comes to mind.  I would never go looking for these people so I could tell them how crazy they are?

<p>First what do TPTB believe in? Pretty much all signs (that they give, wear, build ect) point back to Babylon. Their sun God. They believe everything should revolve around it. Including earth. Instead of the sun possibly being something that was made to compliment earth. Almost all secret societies, the royals, the Catholic Church all give a nod to ancient babylon in lots of ways, because they actually believe in these Gods and think they are serving them. So rather or not earth is flat isn&#39;t really the question...but what they are trying to keep people from knowing.</p>

<p>What&#39;s easier to believe: That the US, USSR, China, Russia, Japan, Indian space programs as well as private Space Agencies and all astronauts are all in on this GIANT conspiracy...<br/>
Or that the earth is actually round?</p>

<p>There is a reason why every major religion accepts the heliocentric model whereas flatties can&#39;t even agree if the so called ice wall is infinite or not. (They haven&#39;t even been out to Antarctica to check)</p>

<p>The &quot;Babylon&quot; answer is a cop out that falls apart pretty much instantly. It requires hundreds of thousands of people to somehow be complicit in the biggest coverup on earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember the rabbit/duck optical illusion? If I told you I was going to show you a picture of a duck, then showed you the illusion, most of the time you would see a duck and you wouldn&#39;t necessarily see something else by staring at it for longer periods of time. You&#39;ll just continue to confirm that it&#39;s a duck. Well some people see the duck but as they continue to look--or maybe their brain is better at conceptualizing things--they might see the rabbit. Then they say &quot;Ah there isn&#39;t really a duck there. It&#39;s a rabbit.&quot; Then all the others who were primed to see the duck treated it as a personal attack on their identity to be told that it&#39;s not a duck, but a rabbit, so they became even more committed that it was a duck. This leads us to the question of why someone would want to trick you in the first place. At best, it&#39;s just a power play by the most powerful humans because knowledge is power. At worst, we are a captive alien colony being deceived into believing we are free to travel 13 billion light years across the universe and to do as we please.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Freefall is the act of falling without assistance which is what occurs after the initial thruster firing happens to break away from the main rocket. There is very good video of the entire descent of several of these launches. As far as how it was controlled back, it is much easier to discern a specific location on a spheroidal object at a higher elevation than it is from the surface. Basically, the angle of ascent is part of the calculation for the return vector. The lower percentage burn that is still occurring assists in the alignment. They also cannot begin a direct, downward freefall until after passing through the upper atmosphere again. There is a small period of gliding to get over the target. This is also why you see the boosters able to land where they are, and the main(almost made it) land at its point in the ocean. That much more distance, mass, accelerant is calculated. Remember, the entire point of this is to prove that we can reuse these things which historically were the reason we stalled in space exploration. We show that we can lower costs by reusing, it can bolster interest in pushing further with the funding that is saved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A part of it, yes. At a very elementary explanation: imagine you release a paper airplane, upward, from the 5th story of a courtyard. The plane flies up, performs an arch of 180 degrees vertical plus 45 degrees left or right. It completes this arch, aligning now facing toward you. Your point of reference is the initial separation point. The ground floor is zero elevation. The angle of descent is correcting the east/west direction as the plane is traveling down the y axis. The landing point can be anywhere from directly down to the horizon plus about 10 degrees due to the rotation speed of the planet. As this is happening, the plane has tiny thrusters that are correcting the travel line to the landing point via programs, on board radar and gps guidance. </p>

<p>This whole process is essentially the boosters landing. Hope this helps. </p>

<p>It is. Which is why everybody was so shocked when Space X managed to pull it off. The math checks out (remember that the almost-empty stage has almost a negligible weight compared to the fully fueled rocket at liftoff), but <em>everything</em> has to go <em>exactly</em> right … which it has been doing for some time now. It&#39;s not impossible. It&#39;s just <em>really</em> good engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not expecting anyone on this sub to explain the engineering involved. Now if they were to point us to any source of information, that&#39;d be nice.</p>

<p>But in the absence of this, we can look critically at the actual physical maneuvers required and consider the physical realities of the control difficulties and the fuel needs for that maneuver and apply the simple absurdity principle to it. </p>

<p>Does it seem even remotely possible to do this, given the physical character of the craft and the available propellant, and the distance it needs to travel, and in the time that it did it? </p>

<p>Has anything similar to this been done before anywhere?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just pointing out that possibly, and possibly by far, the trickiest part of the whole enterprise may likely be bringing back the two boosters from the point of separation to the point of landing.</p>

<p>They demoed and tested the landing itself several times before they got it right. That&#39;s fine. </p>

<p>How many times did they do the 180 maneuver before they got it right? Did they get it perfectly right, with two boosters simultaneously, on the very first time? No previous testing of this difficult-at-best maneuver?</p>

<p>And it also happens to be those specific maneuvers that are not documented in any video or other media anywhere. Nor are any tests documented.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not an engineer. But I am very much into model rocketry, model planes, and UAVs. I know a fair bit about the physics involved. And I can look at what they did and go &quot;hmmm... that doesn&#39;t quite seem right, I&#39;d like more information.&quot;</p>

<p>I did not make this video, nor do I make any videos or disseminate any information regarding flat earth, nor do I subscribe to the flat earth theory.  I simply said that I had 2 questions in the realm of flat earth.  The other guy answered my question to my satisfaction.  </p>

<p>This questions remains WHY they are using any kind of trick photography, which anyone can clearly see is the case.  Now, after you watch it where I selected it to start, if you have any other questions, you can watch the rest of the 3 minute clip.  After that, you are free to make your own search if you&#39;d like.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a &quot;flat earther&quot; but I do wonder why so much NASA video strangeness and why there&#39;s not much non fish eye lens space footage. </p>

<p>Look at these two images showing how much more info is collected with a &quot;wide Angle&quot; lens AKA fish eye</p>

<p>So if you have a multi million dollar project and you want to capture as much info as possible do you use a tiny tiny angle lens to limit distortion or as wide of an angle as possible to collect as much data as you can?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>With respect I do not think that is an accurate comparison.  Nasa claims there are over 20,000 objects in the defined area that is our orbit that are larger than a softball.  Hundreds of these objects are visible from the surface of our planet with the naked eye.  Can&#39;t see metal filings scattered around a gym from the roof.</p>

<p>So I question what I&#39;m seeing....then I think to myself the magnitudes more difficult it would be to generate this debris in the background.  Perhaps with the next generation of engines they use to render these images they can squeeze that out.  Not to mention how difficult it would be to make sure to put recognizable objects EXACTLY where they are supposed to be.  Because they know people will check and can&#39;t have a satellite that is currently supposed to be on the other side of the earth showing up in the background.  So there&#39;s that.</p>

<p>Close. It&#39;s due to camera exposure. Compared to the earth, stars are very faint. So you&#39;d have to overexpose the earth for the stars to be shown. </p>

<p>If they&#39;re actually in LEO, then the surface of the Earth would appear to pass by quite quickly. See <strong>ALL</strong> ISS footage for examples of this. </p>

<p>Whereas if they&#39;re a very long distance away then their orbit will be when viewing the Earth, quite slow... Their footage of the Earth proves they are a great distance away as the Earth isn&#39;t clearly moving under them at all. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That image you posted is vastly not to scale. The satellites are enlarged to see them. Picture this:</p>

<p>Most satellites that work are the size of cars or small busses. They’re dozens or hundreds of miles apart in space as they orbit, and most are in a higher orbit. From a plane, looking down, it’s nearly impossible to discern cars and busses. That’s only 7 miles away at most. Now try 10 times that. The chance of seeing anything from that distance that is that small is impossible.</p>

<p>Most photos from space that you usually see are also just from the ISS in LEO. This is below nearly all satellites. Photos you see of the whole earth are likely from NASA’s EPIC camera, on the DSCOVR satellite at L1. This is from 1 million miles away. Those satellites will be impossible to see. They register as less than a fraction of a pixel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool.  It&#39;s seems like you are telling me it is impossible to get a picture of a satellite with another behind it.  Per nasa we can potential see hundreds of satellites from earth with our naked eye, with optimal conditions.  From our viewing point they resemble a star: small but recognizable.  I wonder why there can&#39;t be a scenario where we would see satellites behind another satellite in space.  Perhaps two satellites closer together in orbit than the distance between the surface of the earth and earths orbit.  Perhaps they would still be small and resemble stars.  But I would think some would be visible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not it’s not impossible to take another photo of a satellite from space. What I’m saying is that it’s impossible to take a photo of satellites from that distance. You need to be close to them.</p>

<p>We can see them with the naked eye because they’re brighter. In space, you need to expose properly to see the earth, which would be much brighter than any satellite in the daytime. At night, you and a satellite are both in earth’s shadow, so you couldn’t see it. The only way to see a satellite from space is to be close to it, or expose the camera to see it.</p>

<p>We see them from earth at night because the sky is dark, and they reflect the sun’s light. You can’t and don’t see them in the daytime though, because it’s too bright out. Same reason you can’t see them from space. Earth is too bright. </p>

<p>The only satellites we really can take photos of, and resolute any detail, are the ISS and Hubble. Those are some of the largest and closest satellites to earth (the ISS by far), and even they are extremely difficult to take proper photos of.</p>

<p>To take photos of satellites from earth, also, requires an excellent telescope, observing a large and close satellite. Most satellites aren’t larger than a bus (the ISS is an exception), and are far away in GTO (ISS is an exception for its size).</p>

<p>Space is also gigantic. So much larger than you could fathom. The space between satellites is overwhelming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Satellites really fall into a few similar orbits, though they’re certainly not close to each other regardless. Things like the inclination of a satellite and it’s eccentricity will change the position of it relative to others.</p>

<p>For geocentric orbits (ones around earth), the main ones are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which is between 160km and 2000km</p></li>
<li><p>Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), which is between 2000km and 35786km (right below GSO). Most satellites are at 20,200 km or 20,650 km, with an orbital period of 12 hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Geosynchronous Orbit (GSO) is an orbit that matches one sidereal day. This doesn’t mean it has to be a perfect circle, though, and it’s position relative to the surface of earth can change with a different inclination.</p></li>
<li><p>Geostationary Orbit (GEO), which is a version of a GSO, but it is a perfect circle, and has no inclination. Satellites in this orbit are at 35,786 km, and are exactly above the equator. Their position relative to one point on earth never changes.</p></li>
<li><p>High Earth Orbit (HEO), which is an orbit above 35,786 km and are greater than 24 hours. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Those are the major types of orbits. As you can tell, most, except a GEO, can range by thousands of kilometers. Then you have to factor in the circumference of each orbit.</p>

<p>If GEO is 35,786 km from earth, or the radius, then it has a circumference of 224,850 km. That is huge. If the average satellite is 5 m wide (much larger than reality), then you’d need 44,970,000 satellites to fill it. If you sent up 10,000 satellites, and made sure they had an even space between them, then there’d be 22.5 km between each satellite. That is ridiculously huge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No problem. Most of the smaller ones are debris, or cubesats. Debris could be anywhere but cubesats, which are small cubes ranging from 8in to 2 feet usually, fall into LEO. Even at LEO there’s so many possible inclinations, altitudes, and eccentricities they could be orbiting at, that you’d be lucky to come within a few thousand feet of one. </p>

<p>The larger satellites are smaller in number, and are usually found among the middle/geosynchronous orbits. More space to be in, harder to see. Even if they’re larger.</p>

<p>No. Imagine 5000 cars scattered around the Earth in different continents and places. Imagine the people who place them coordinating to make those cars as far from each-other as possible.</p>

<p>Now we know your house isn&#39;t near any cars so if you go out and look around you won&#39;t find any and you wouldn&#39;t see any even if you walked hundreds of miles in any direction.</p>

<p>Even if you randomly chuck a rocket into space the chances of it even coming near anything else are so little. SpaceX most likely also coordinated to know there&#39;s a lot of empty space.</p>

<p>Earth is basically like a reflector and is very bright. More than you might think. It&#39;s like trying to distinguish a small light source while staring at a light bulb. Which brings us to the real point - cameras are much worse than our eyes at handling different levels of light. If you&#39;d expose it enough light to maybe see satellites, everything else would be bright white nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for replying.  Sorry if I went on a tangent but I really think people are too definitive.  </p>

<p>So you answered me &#39;No&#39;, two satellites could never be &#39;remotely&#39; close.  That seemed absolute, case closed.  I haven&#39;t noticed where thousands of the smartest people in the world agree with that, but ok.  Note this <a href="https://www.pixalytics.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Debris_objects_-_mostly_debris_-_in_low_Earth_orbit_LEO_-_view_over_the_equator.jpg">pic</a> claims that the sizes have been exaggerated.  Has the placement also?</p>

<p>&quot;Imagine 5000 cars scattered around the Earth in different continents and places.&quot;  </p>

<p>This would reflect communication devices and not merely objects in orbit, but thats fine. </p>

<p>&quot;Imagine the people who place them coordinating to make those cars as far from each-other as possible.&quot;</p>

<p>That is nice to imagine but they aren&#39;t all evenly spaced out, according to the information we are given.  (I say that because I don&#39;t own a telescope and haven&#39;t traveled the earth trying to catalog them all, so I will have to defer to what I am told and hope I am receiving accurate information.  I certainly won&#39;t swear by it) In addition &quot;as possible&quot; must take into account the task of the satellites.   Irregardless we are told from multiple sources they are in no way equidistant (tracking software, renderings). </p>

<p>Once more, as these objects are dispersed around the globe they are also at varying distances;  Locked in geocentric orbits.  This allows satellites to mover relatively &#39;close&#39; to one another without risking collision.   And would allow for two or more two appear in a frame.</p>

<p>&quot;Earth is basically like a reflector and is very bright.&quot;</p>

<p>We see the earth, complete with varying, accurate colors.  We see the car; again in full color.  What would prevent us from seeing another satellite between the car and the earth?    Going back to the pic I shared earlier; where would you put the car and not have anything else in frame?</p>

<p>I like space.  In my opinion there is non enough footage of satellites/space junk.  Why?  Probably expensive to get and not enough demand.  Maybe one day in addition to google mars and google moon we&#39;ll have google orbit.</p>

<p>There are about 500 satellites in low earth orbit, which is at an altitude of about 180-2000 km. The live feed we saw from the car was before the first rising burn to 7000 km, which means all the footage war essentially from low earth orbit.<br/>
That means one of the 500 satellites in LEO had to cross between the car an the earth at a time when the camera was facing the earth. The chances of that happening are astronomically low.</p>

<p>No you can&#39;t. It&#39;s incredibly hard to spot satellites. They have to be at just the right altitude and just the right angle to the sun to see them, plus you have to be far from city lights.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes multiple in &quot;close&quot; proximity to each other?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, whatever you&#39;re thinking is &quot;close proximity&quot; is actually hundreds of miles (usually thousands) of empty space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>could you see a car or car sized object on the earth&#39;s surface?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the car were as bright as the sun, then yeah, you&#39;d see a point of light. But only if you were at low enough altitude, you knew exactly where to look and the rest of your field of view was very dim.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not an inconsistency. You&#39;re just not getting the scale here. Space is bigger than you think.</p>

<p>You&#39;re telling me I&#39;ve never seen multiple satellites moving across the same night sky within &quot;close&quot; proximity to each other? How are you going to tell me what I have and haven&#39;t seen friend? You can, and I have, and I&#39;m sure many others who have gone camping or live outside of largely populated/lighted areas have seen exactly what I&#39;m talking about. You don&#39;t get to just say &quot;nuh uh&quot; and expect me to forget what I&#39;ve experience first-hand.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Satellites may be catching and reflecting the sun&#39;s light, but they are not &quot;as bright as the sun&quot; in any regard.. Also.. if I am on the side of the globe that it is midnight, and the satellite is many, many times smaller than Earth and is straight above me, what sunlight is the satellite reflecting at that point?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And I retaliate to your initial tone with me and now I want you to play &quot;spot the asshole?&quot;</p>

<p>I present you with a plethora of websites that literally say <em>you</em> are wrong here, and I&#39;m the asshole?

<p>Seeing satellites from Earth&#39;s surface on a clear night is easily done, it is easiest in areas with low light. They zip across the sky, much slower than a &quot;shooting star&quot; but much quicker than an airplane. Are you now willing to admit you are wrong?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s actually very difficult. You and the satellite have to be in exactly the right places relative to each other and the sun, you have to know precisely where to look, and you have to be far from any light pollution. If this <em>were not</em> true, then the sky would be full of conspicuously visible satellites! Think for a second, geez.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I already stated it is most easily done in clear areas, with very low light. I also have seen them in suburban areas where I have lived, albeit maybe once or twice.</p>

<p>I do not need to know precisely where to look, I don&#39;t just so happen to be in the right positions relative to the satellite and the sun, I have literally been camping on MANY occasions, sat out stargazing late at night and witnessed, sometimes <em>multiple</em> (meaning more than 1 simultaneously or shortly after one another), satellites in the night sky.</p>

<p>To tell me I have not seen what I have with my own two eyes is asking me to not only stop trusting what I have seen, stop trusting what I have read (and provided) as evidence that at the very least &quot;science&quot; agrees I am seeing something, they say it&#39;s satellites, but to instead trust YOU.

But seeing the Tesla in space was the first thing I saw, and not 15 seconds after turning it on there was a weird lighting &#39;glitch&#39;? of some sort that made it appear like the Tesla was in an enclosed room for a second, then a quick flash and back to normal.</p>

<p>IDK all the photos and videos of the Telsa up there looking insanely fake, I know the launch happened but the images are off to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not expecting anyone on this sub to explain the engineering involved. Now if they were to point us to any source of information, that&#39;d be nice.</p>

<p>But in the absence of this, we can look critically at the actual physical maneuvers required and consider the physical realities of the control difficulties and the fuel needs for that maneuver and apply the simple absurdity principle to it. </p>

<p>Does it seem even remotely possible to do this, given the physical character of the craft and the available propellant, and the distance it needs to travel, and in the time that it did it? </p>

<p>Has anything similar to this been done before anywhere?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just pointing out that possibly, and possibly by far, the trickiest part of the whole enterprise may likely be bringing back the two boosters from the point of separation to the point of landing.</p>

<p>They demoed and tested the landing itself several times before they got it right. That&#39;s fine. </p>

<p>How many times did they do the 180 maneuver before they got it right? Did they get it perfectly right, with two boosters simultaneously, on the very first time? No previous testing of this difficult-at-best maneuver?</p>

<p>And it also happens to be those specific maneuvers that are not documented in any video or other media anywhere. Nor are any tests documented.</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not an engineer. But I am very much into model rocketry, model planes, and UAVs. I know a fair bit about the physics involved. And I can look at what they did and go &quot;hmmm... that doesn&#39;t quite seem right, I&#39;d like more information.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cool.  It&#39;s seems like you are telling me it is impossible to get a picture of a satellite with another behind it.  Per nasa we can potential see hundreds of satellites from earth with our naked eye, with optimal conditions.  From our viewing point they resemble a star: small but recognizable.  I wonder why there can&#39;t be a scenario where we would see satellites behind another satellite in space.  Perhaps two satellites closer together in orbit than the distance between the surface of the earth and earths orbit.  Perhaps they would still be small and resemble stars.  But I would think some would be visible.</p>
