    <div class="md"><p>The cables aren&#39;t the issue.  The adapters that step 110-115v AC down to 5v DC are complex little boogers and it&#39;s easy to fuck it up if you cheap out the components.  12V DC to 5V DC is much easier, and it&#39;s also easy to get high quality 110v AC to 12V DC adapters.  Hell, any decent PC power supply has one as do a lot of laptop power bricks.  Go through a stack of those looking for 12V output, wire that to a car-cig-lighter-type socket, then 12v to 5v USB is easy to find and most are at least decent because it&#39;s harder to fuck that up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most official chargers have hardware inside them that communicates with the phone. If the phone understands this it will tell the charger to supply more current, allowing it to charge faster. A replacement charger typically won&#39;t communicate with the phone and will charge slower, which is probably what you&#39;re experiencing. </p>

<p>Assuming the voltage and max current are what the battery&#39;s rated for, there should be nothing wrong with using a third party charger (it will just charge far slower).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah.  What I do is hoard factory chargers, and the moment I can find any used I snatch &#39;em up.  Failing that I use 12v adapters of as good a lineage as I can, because stepping 12v DC to 5v DC is a lot easier - it&#39;s harder to build a fucked up 12v based charger.  Chargers that go from 115v AC to 5v DC have to get rid of the 60 cycle hum, for starters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably not an inadequate supply of chargers, but the fact that phone makers try to push the envelope on battery charging -- wanting to make a phone that has a large battery capacity <em>and</em> charges at a very high rate, all while wanting to provide a long battery service life.  </p>

<p>I think this is one of those classic &quot;you can have 2 of these 3, but not all of them&quot; kind of situations.  You can have a long service life and high capacity, but it will charge slow.  You can have long service and fast charging but low capacity, or you can have high capacity and fast charging but it&#39;s hell on service life.</p>

<p>Operating at the edge of battery engineering designs, it&#39;s easy to see how a poorly regulated charger might wreak havoc.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s charging cables and connectors.  I think micro USB has always been poor and even purpose designed &quot;superior&quot; charging connectors like Apple&#39;s lightning connectors aren&#39;t necessarily durable enough for a duty cycle of multiple insertions/removals over a few years.  The jury&#39;s still out whether USB-C solves this specific problem.  Personally, I think wireless charging as flawed as it is helps here because there&#39;s no physical plug cycle.</p>

<p>Overall, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any one conspiracy besides the conspiracy of capitalism/consumerism.  Producers are trying to sell advanced engineering at mass production prices and consumers are willing to believe in miracles and shop for lowest price at the same time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never had a USB charger that fucked up my phone. I have at least 5 of them atm. One is an official Samsung one (same brand as my phone). One is an ASUS one. One is a Nokia one. Two are from a £1 store.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure they all output at 5V. I&#39;ll check later (though maybe my USB voltage meter is lying?).</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are cheap Chinese ones that will screw up your phone. You probably shouldn&#39;t buy them.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s something that&#39;s happening a lot with your phone, have you considered that it&#39;s your phone that&#39;s the problem?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunealy this mostly comes down to ignorance. USB (Universal Serial Bus) is a &quot;Universal&quot; connection port. What is NOT universal about a charger is the amount of POWER it will output to your device. As smartphone/tablet battery sizes and charging time capabilities changed, the amount of power required to meet those charging times and battery sizes ALSO changed. Ever heard it&#39;s your responsibility to read the small print? Well guess what..... almost every USB charger has small print. That small print has the &quot;Input: and Output:&quot; for the power specifications of the charger. It is the CONSUMERS responsibility to READ THE MANUAL which will ALSO tell them the power requirements of any THIRD PARTY/AFTERMARKET chargers they attempt to buy. Or they can match the specs on the original USB charger that came with the phone to any they buy. TLDR?: that&#39;s your first problem</p>
