    <div class="md"><p>But of course anyone can now claim that they&#39;re going or have been to the Moon but in order to actually disprove or call them out on it the US would have to make a case that none of their own efforts ever measured-up to or satisfied, either. </p>

<p>So they just have to put-up and shut-up about it. In all truth there&#39;s virtually no scientific information that existed when the US was supposed to be travelling to the Moon that isn&#39;t now known and hasn&#39;t been vastly surpassed just about everywhere else on the entire planet.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more than likely that all of the various space agencies now exist in countless countries only do so a front to divert substantial amounts of their taxpayers money to far more and secretive &quot;Earthly concerns&quot; without any of their citizenry actually being any the wiser about it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes regarding physics</p>

<p>for example, i put that the mass of the Moon was about 1/6 the mass of the Earth, </p>

<p>and other observers say that its somewhere between 1/80 and 1/100, depending on the source </p>

<p>so while that may make some aspects of the journey more easy, it would make other aspects more difficult </p>

<p>the moon landing hoax is going to bring down the credibility of the establishment. there is a reason this scandal just won&#39;t go away, regardless of how many times the charlatans point to the rocket equation (which only applies in space, and not on earth)  </p>

<p>heres some other things I&#39;ve learned, in case you missed it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, gravity is about 1/6th of Earth&#39;s, so that  is probably where the confusion came in there. Mass and surface gravity don&#39;t scale linearly.</p>

<p>Also the rocket equation can be used for launches from Earth too, you just have to include the losses from gravity &amp; drag ahead of time. Basically it just means that your delta-V is gonna be significantly higher than it would be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, if you don&#39;t look into it at all, you&#39;re not likely to be presented with a lot of evidence for something that happened nearly fifty years ago. But I think even you are aware there is more information than a page of text and a few photographs in a 7th grade textbook.</p>

<p>For example, regarding pictures, there is <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/projectapolloarchive/albums">this</a>. Every famous picture is in there somewhere, alongside thousands that aren&#39;t commonly seen, including washed out and poorly framed ones. That alone puts a crimp in a lot of conspiracy arguments which rely on photographic anomalies, since you can cross-reference a lot of things between photos. I&#39;ve used them once or twice to answer arguments here on Reddit, though I don&#39;t think you were involved.</p>

<p>As for text, there are of course entire textbooks written about the Apollo Program and all that surrounds it - personally I favour pre-Apollo missions like the Mercury or Gemini projects, but they all share a lot in common, including a fair amount of technological overlap (as one might expect.) NASA itself has a <a href="https://history.nasa.gov/ap11ann/booksbiblio.htm">list</a> which includes technical manuals, memoirs, popular science coverage and critique.</p>

<p>Aside from that, of course, the physics of the stated method of going to the Moon can be analyzed - if the plan does not conform to known natural principles that can be tested, it can&#39;t have happened. Of course, if it does conform, that also means it could have been done - the Saturn V rocket certainly existed! A lot of the more entertaining discussions on space conspiracies in general tend to fall into this category. The layman very rarely has any grasp on physics outside their immediate 1g earthside comfort zone.</p>

<p>And you could indeed stage and create an impressive and highly convincing array of fakes and hoaxes all of that for a mere fraction of that cost.</p>
