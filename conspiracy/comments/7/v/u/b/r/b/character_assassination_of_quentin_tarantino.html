       Has anyone noticed recently that a lot of negative press towards famed director Quentin Tarantino has been “coming to light”. Ex: kill bill crash, comments on Roman Polanski victim, etc. It just seems odd how calculated this stuff seems to roll out suddenly. And is almost always framed in a way to make a potential victim look bad... idk maybe it’s nothing or maybe it really is something.

       A character assassination implies that Tarantino did nothing wrong. He deserves to be criticized about his comments on Polanski, and I wouldn't be surprised if Tarantino was a pedophile as well

       It was legit, so legit that they actually identified the victims and were setting up "payments of restituion" meaning the FBI already knew these photos, knew the "models" or the "kids" or "victims" because ANOTHER celebrity paid for at least SOME of them to be PRODUCDED, some of them could be photos of CELEBRITIES as KIDS.... if I were writing a tom clancy book, and i may be writing a book or not, ahaha i am not... nor will I ever.. but the story would go along the lines that mark "got suicided" miles from his house in a canyon by a friend of a friend in the sharing pictures game...
      </p>
      <p>
       but the biggest clue to mark salling case, the victims are KNOWN.

       I like it an actual reason for why. I could see QT being semi innocent non with standing his shitty comments and creepy actions and this being a smear campaign to shy away not just Sailings death but what he was into. He had a lot of cp, where did it come from and was he involved in the production?

       No Mark Saling was not involved in production, he bought "coveted" sets from another celebrity and was cought with those plus THOUSANDS more...
      </p>
      <p>
       QT is just a fluffer name a distraction from BS and HW, he won't fall. He's probably such a creep he gets contracts signed before having fun...

       QT is doing a friend a favor by taking some of the heat.

       BS, HW are pulling out every trick in the book to not get suicided. IMO.
