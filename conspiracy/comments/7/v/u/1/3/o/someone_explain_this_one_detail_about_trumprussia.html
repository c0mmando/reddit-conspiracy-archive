        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The Clinton campaign hired Fusion GPS to uncover dirt on Trump. Fusion GPS hired Michael Steele.</p>

<p>The day before the Trump Tower meeting with Don Jr (and others) Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya met and had lunch with Glenn Simpson, who runs Fusion GPS. The same Fusion GPS that was being paid by the Clinton campaign to uncover dirt on Trump. They meet <em>again</em> the day <em>after</em> the Trump Tower meeting Natalia Veselnitskaya has with Don Jr.</p>

<p>Someone explain why that shouldn&#39;t strike me as suspicious as hell? </p>

<p>Why did the FBI never independently confirm the hack into the DNC but solely relied on the findings of a group (CrowdStrike) that was paid by the DNC for their work?</p>

<p>How is it okay to get FISA warrants on an American citizen via a politically paid for Dossier which you can&#39;t verify (at all)? It&#39;s okay to shit on the Constitution now because your team/candidate benefits? Fuck that.</p>

<p>We all already know how the Democrat primary for the presidential nod was rigged against Sanders—it has been proven.</p>

<p>Why have no cases—Flynn, Manafort, Papadopoulos, etc—been about Russian collusion? That is <em>why</em> Mueller is even there, right? </p>

<p>In my opinion Fusion GPS is a smear firm, not the respectable opposition research firm the mainstream media makes them out to be. Some of the media went to Steele&#39;s briefings, so I don&#39;t expect them to accurately report on Fusion GPS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don’t forget Obama’s DOJ had to approve Veselnitskaya’s entry as “extraordinary circumstances”.</p>

<p>Obama’s DOJ included Bruce Ohr, who’s mentioned in Grassley’s complaint against Chris Steele as having been in communication with Steele.</p>

<p>So members of DOJ are in communication with an oppo research firm working for DNC, they approve Veselnitskaya’s entry as “extraordinary circumstances”, she meets with Simpson directly before and after meeting Trump Jr., and then oh yeah, details of the meeting eventually leaked to the press. Fusion/Steele apparently had no qualms feeding their allegations to journalists.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are on the same wavelength, comrade.</p>

<p>—It&#39;s been proven the DNC and Clinton campaign cheated Bernie Sanders. The head of the DNC had to quit over it.</p>

<p>—The direct initial evidence of Russia meddling in the US election? Brought to us by an entity (CrowdStrike) paid for by the DNC and quickly taken as gospel by the FBI without verifying the hack themselves. The head of the DNC at that time was one of Clinton&#39;s former campaign managers from her 2008 campaign.</p>

<p>—The dossier originated from the Clinton campaign funding. </p>

<p>I’ve been saying for a long time that it’s amazing that the two gospels of Russia Collusion, Meddling, etc. are Crowdstrikes Report and The Dossier.</p>

<p>2 documents put together with no government oversight, both parties have refused to appear in front a congressional committee to allow their findings to be scrutinized, both parties reports contained materially false information, and oh yeah, both parties were paid by the DNC which we now know was under the direct control of Hillary’s campaign.</p>

<p>Oh I forgot the other damning info, $100k in Facebook ads that apparently were Russian purchased and a political mish mash of identity politics.</p>

<p>George Soros gave $25 MILLION to Hilllary’s campaign and related causes alone in the 2016 elections.</p>

<p>So Soros spent 250x the amount the Russians allegedly did and couldn’t have more of an impact than internet trolls. That sounds legit.</p>

<p>Hillary’s campaign spent $768 million.</p>

<p>Now, let’s be generous and say travel and rallies cost her half, the still had $384 million to play with.</p>

<p>In total, $2.6 billion (that’s billion) was spent on all races in the 2016 election cycle.</p>

<p>We’re seriously trying to argue that 100k in Facebook ads that aren’t even all pushing conservative angles was instrumental to the US race being decided. If we multiply that by 100 we get 10 million. It’s a drop in the bucket even if the intentions were purely malicious.</p>

<p>That and Russian bots.</p>

<p>There are 68 million active monthly US twitter users.</p>

<p>Almost 130 million votes were cast in the presidential election.</p>

<p>The number of “Russian bots” varies widely by reporting and the criteria for attribution is sketchy.</p>

<p>I’m not even gonna get into how 24% of those users were from urban areas that Hillary universally carried exceptional support in.</p>

<p>There is simply no valid argument for Russian meddling without believing Russia hacked the DNC and Podesta. The evidence we have for this is a report from Crowdstrike which was paid for the DNC, made attribution based largely on a disproved claim regarding Ukrainian artillery losses (they had to issue a revised report), and Crowdstrike refused to appear in front of congress.</p>

<p>The DNC also rebuffed FBI requests to access their server.</p>

<p>We also now know that Steele was feeding unproven allegations to reporters, which led to most initial “Collusion” suspicion reporting.</p>

<p>So yes, the two gospels of Russian meddling and Collusion are extremely sketchy documents that were paid for by the DNC. The DNC had a funding crisis and ceded significant control to Hilary’s campaign in exchange for financial support.</p>

<p>So Hillary’s campaign basically financed the compilation of the 2 documents that laid the groundwork for everyone losing their minds.</p>

<p>That’s absurd to me.</p>

<p>The big question for me is who recommended Page to the Trump campaign? He was just a name among many used to bolster the campaign credibility against &quot;Never Trumpers&quot; during the primaries. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-advisers-public-comments-ties-to-moscow-stir-unease-in-both-parties/2016/08/05/2e8722fa-5815-11e6-9aee-8075993d73a2_story.html?utm_term=.a68608995b25">The narrative pushing was already starting in WaPo in August of 2016.</a></p>

<p>Carter Page sought out Republican Ed Cox who introduced him to Corey Lewandowski and the ball rolled from there.</p>

<p>So, Page took the initiative on his own. If you have the time you should take a look through Page’s congressional testimony, it’s really eye opening, especially with what is being disclosed re: Fusion/Steele.</p>

<p>I may do a post on the testimony too, but that’d be a bear. Thing’s ~240 pages, it was a bitch just to read through it.</p>

<p>Not to mention, the Trump and Clinton campaigns spent a combined $81 <em>million</em> on Facebook ads. $100k of Russian money is a pretty small drop in the bucket compared to what the political parties were doing.</p>

<p>The claim relies on the uncertain theory that the leaked files were 1) first generation copies of the stolen data (not duplicates of what was stolen) and 2) leaked directly from the drive used in the theft.</p>

<p>the things they lied about were major. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit.</p>

<p>Here are the &#39;lies&#39; Papadopolous told:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>He said his interactions with a Russian professor occurred before he joined the Trump campaign. The FBI says they occurred after he joined the campaign.</p></li>
<li><p>He said he knew about &quot;thousands of emails&quot; from before he joined the campaign. The FBI says he learned about them after he joined the campaign.</p></li>
<li><p>He said the professor was a &quot;nothing&quot; that was &quot;talking up&quot; his connections to the Russian government. The FBI says he actually knew that the professor had ties to the government and had tried to use those ties to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials.</p></li>
<li><p>He said that he met a certain &quot;female Russian national&quot; before joining the campaign and their email exchanges had been innocuous. The FBI says he met the &quot;female Russian national&quot; after he joined the campaign and had once again tried to use her connections to arrange a meeting between the campaign and Russian government officials.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s it. Those are the <em>major</em> things he lied about.</p>

<p>He admitted the professor had told him about Clinton emails but apparently lied about when he was told. The FBI does not say he made any attempt to obtain those emails, but talks at great length about his attempts to arrange a meeting between Trump and Russian government officials.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no sign of &quot;collusion&quot; in this document. In fact this document reads very much like the FBI throwing charges at Papadopolous because they were unable to get anything else to charge him with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fusion GPS was not hired to dig up dirt on trump. they were hired to create and manufacture dirt on trump.</p>

<p>I would not be at all surprised if it comes out that the supposed &#39;collusion&#39; meeting between don jr. and russians was somehow setup by fusion gps with the aim of being able to use it in a later investigation.</p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most damning things that came out in the memo was the idea that this whole russian collusion insurance policy taken out against trump existed before he became president and involved corruption at the highest level of government to make possible. Basically it show that the deep state is real, and they hate/are terrified of trump.</p>

<p>collusion is not a real legal issue with any sort of precedence. The whole russia collusion issue has been complete and total bullshit. After living 9 yrs abroad, I am disgusted at how ignorant and gullible americans have become.</p>

<p>Collusion is not a real legal charge, and there is not nor has there ever been any evidence of so-called collusion between trump and the russians. People who do not see this simple obvious truth should continue wallow in their own pools of cess.</p>

<p>Fusion does not exist as an arm of the Clinton campaign designed to take down Donald Trump, they have had multiple clients from both parties and from around the world. I think their services are poised for corruption and fuckery, but they are a legal entity people pay a shit ton of money to conduct research. Obviously they are public enemy number one now. I don&#39;t think they instantly deserve the benefit of the doubt, although neither does the perpetually lying/spinning Trump campaign.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an article attempting to break down the varied representations of those dinners that surrounded the Trump tower meeting. Take them for what you will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Veselnitskaya is the family lawyer for Denis Katsyv. He contracted FusionGPS to help get the Magnitsky Act repealed. The other guy at the Trump Tower meeting, Rinat whatever, was also working on this campaign with Veselnitskaya. They were running around trying to get a meeting with anyone that would listen. This is why the supposed dirt Veselnitskaya handed Trump Jr. was actually a FusionGPS document. </p>

<p>This is all very suspicious, especially considering what FusionGPS was up to. At the same time they were contracted by the DNC/Clinton to “find”dirt on Trump they were working for Katsyv to try and get the Magnitsky Act repealed. This is what they talked about at the Trump Tower meeting, the Magnitsky Act. This makes me think that FusionGPS set this meeting up to kill two birds with one stone: get “dirt” on Trump as well as get Veselnitskaya in the room to talk about the Magnitsky Act. This, on top of the fact that Simpson met with Veselnitskaya the day before and the day after the Trump Tower meeting, is just too convenient to be one big coincidence. </p>
