<p>What do you think the moon really is?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A satellite station that was placed in Earth orbit millennia ago to, among various other things, monitor human activities here on this planet.  Information exists (from people like Marine Captain Randy Cramer, Andrew Basiago, Tony Rodriguez, and others) regarding a <em>great</em> deal of activity from many different types of ET groups that exist on the opposite/dark side of the moon.  It&#39;s categorized by some as a &quot;DMZ&quot; - a demilitarized zone.  Many different ET diplomatic meetings are said to take place there, and there are <em>many</em> different species of ETs all residing on the moon and w/embassies of sorts there without direct conflict w/one another.  Many of these species are said to be directly antagonistic to one another, but since the moon is said to be a DMZ and conflict is expressly prohibited there, all of the species residing there do not fight with one another.</p>

<p>Is there a chance they will try to communicate back if we send something around the moon?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to the information given by the above names referenced, Earth humans have not only tried to communicate, but have greatly succeeded.  There is a program called the SSP - the Secret Space Program - and this program has a communication post with the reported delegation of ETs on the opposite side of the moon.  As such, communication got established and has been ongoing for quite some time now.  The 99% of humanity on planet Earth is not kept aware of any of this, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For instance, a satellite in orbit around the moon that sends a beam of light when it&#39;s on the dark side?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The questions you ask work under the premise whereby the 99% of humanity on this planet is in communication with the dark side of the moon.  It’s said that there is a cabal of covert groups on this planet that have all been working since at least as far back as the 50s to keep the reality of ET existence on and around planet Earth from reaching the understanding of the public.</p>

<p>So far, unfortunately, they’ve managed to do a good job.</p>

<p>Thing that really gets me the most about the moon, we are one of the only planets to have ONE satellite, that so happens to perfectly cover the sun during an eclipse. What are the odds in that...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Clearly the rear side of the moon gets the most impacts by asteroids. I mean, that&#39;s an obvious one. Only a couple of Jupiter&#39;s satellites are tidally locked and we know this through simple telescopy and previous flyby missions. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit the distance of the moon and earth from the sun resulting in near total eclipses is pretty awesome but that&#39;s not perfect either. For example, only a certain line of sight on the Earths surface is able to witness a total eclipse. Wouldn&#39;t it more perfect if eclipses occurred for an entire hemisphere and not just a thin path? Not to mention the moon will eventually stray far enough from the Earth to no longer have such eclipses and also become unlocked from its tidal orbit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, it would get more impacts because that is the rear side of the moon which is facing the meteors consistently... Why else would it get more impact strikes if it&#39;s not the side that is facing away from the Earth?</p>

<p>I doubt just using a telescope that you&#39;d be able to tell if Jupiter&#39;s moons are tidal locked or not. As for flyby missions, lots of movement from our satellite so again, would be a difficult thing to know for sure.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve often watched the moon. From full moon to total eclipse. The &#39;man on the moon&#39; seems to be still visible when the moon is eclipsing. It shouldn&#39;t be if it&#39;s tidal locked since it would already be half way rotated by that point. We should be able to see the moon moving by noticing a different surface half way through the month / lunar cycle.</p>

<p>Wither it&#39;s only a &#39;thin path&#39; to see the full eclipse or not. I&#39;m still very skeptical that we have only the one satellite and it&#39;s big enough as distance it is away from the sun to cover it during an eclipse. Does that not also make the moon very big compared to other planets moons?</p>

<p>You can reply a simple &#39;no&#39; or &#39;yes&#39; all you want. The moon does not rotate, so it&#39;s the same side facing us and it&#39;s the same side facing outwards. The moon is abnormally big for our planet. Things don&#39;t add up about it.</p>

<p>It does rotate, just not from Earth&#39;s perspective because of tidal locking.</p>

<p>Explain to me how it is possible then. How can our telescopes determine what side of Jupiter&#39;s moon is and is not facing Jupiter? The distance is very large and every planets satellite that I know of doesn&#39;t have much, if any, detail from telescopes on Earth.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think our moon does rotate and explained my reasoning. You have yet to apart from disagreeing.</p>

<p>I have not said &#39;who&#39; is behind the moon. I&#39;ve just stated that there is certain things that don&#39;t add up about it. Thanks for trying to put words in my mouth though.</p>

<p>If the moon is &#39;tidal locked&#39; both sides should be struck evenly as the moon revolves and rotates. That is not the case.</p>
