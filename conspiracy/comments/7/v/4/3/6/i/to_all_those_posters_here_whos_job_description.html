        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The last week has made it exceptionally clear that there are a lot of reddit users commenting on recent political events that are all using the same “playbook”. </p>

<p>Your similar catchwords, talking points, and the coincidental timing of your comments and posts make it abundantly clear that a large portion of those defending the reprehensible are paid to do so. </p>

<p>I understand that many in our country do jobs they would prefer not to. Many have to do things everyday that they don’t personally agree with because their employers task them to do it. No one actually enjoys picking up garbage, but it still gets done if you catch my drift. </p>

<p>While many of the things PR posters post about aren’t virtuous, they don’t always cross the line of bad ethics and morals. </p>

<p>The current political crisis in the United States is something new, documented, and reprehensible. There are many of you who are now openly defending treason, and the blatant disregard of our constitution. </p>

<p>I ask you to find strength from the American hero’s who have become before you and chosen to do the RIGHT thing when necessary. Those who have given their very lives for the idea that our country represents honesty and integrity. </p>

<p>If you are American and being paid to post these things online, it’s time to stand against treason. Report those giving the orders. Find your way out and change your lives to a virtuous one. </p>

<p>Do the right thing for your country. Stop helping to rot in from the inside. Stop trying to compromise one of the last places on reddit where real truth can be discussed. </p>

<p>I emplore you. Do the right thing for OUR country. Get out before it’s too late. </p>

Instead they resort to the bullshit being told by a handful of rich people that own the MSM and pay for PR because it supports their party.

<p>Fuck that, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-tax-ryan/house-speaker-ryan-deletes-tweet-praising-1-50-pay-increase-idUSKBN1FO00T?il=0">I just got a huge raise!</a> I&#39;m not selling out my bosses.

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, so we&#39;re going to completely ignore the influx of the_dumbass users, who use the same buzzwords, talking points and attitude, and DO IT FOR FREE, and not talk about the integrity of fact or what the actual definition of patriotism is? Because, as an American, I&#39;m loyal to the idea of autonomy, not nationalism. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not denying there&#39;s paid employees of corporate and political interest, (which, like sucks for the employee really, that they can&#39;t find better work), but this sub used to be about uncovering government programs and corporate influence, not arguing about abortion and which former Goldman Sachs employees were good hires for the Trump Administration. </p>

<p>Fuck much of what Obama did, but at least there was more transparency. The fact that we&#39;re now in a position to have government censors in the media and a White House that removed whole pieces of the website and refuses to hold actual press conferences with a President (refusing to answer a question with &quot;you&#39;re fake news&quot;), especially since he&#39;s taking nearly every weekend off is much more troubling to me than giving a fuck about imaginary internet points. Fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh please.  It is sad that people cannot think for themselves and believe their party could be corrupt.  Instead they resort to the bullshit being told by a handful of rich people that own the MSM and pay for PR because it supports their party. Yet 10 years ago they were screaming at the same MSM owners for supporting Bush for doing the same things their party is now doing, supporting and promoting.  It&#39;s insane.</p>
