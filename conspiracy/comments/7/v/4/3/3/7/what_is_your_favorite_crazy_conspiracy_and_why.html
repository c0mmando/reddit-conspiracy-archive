       Hi guys, I have this afternoon off from work and would love to spend a bit of time looking into some "Crazy" Conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be about ANYTHING that might seem "Crazy" to someone "Normal".
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens, UFO's, Military, Space, Earth, Swamp Monsters, Garden Gnomes, Religous, Mud Fossils; It can be about anything, I'm completely open minded and would just like to read about some interesting stuff!
      </p>
      <p>
       Go wild r/conspiracy, let me know what your favorite Conspiracies are!

       Favorite crazy conspiracy? Reptilians of course. Why? Because I wholeheartedly believe they're real. Had a dream I'll never forget.

       Oh I used to love the Reptillian Conspiracy theories - David Icke introduced them to me although I have to admit, I haven't looked into them in about 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has there been much interesting stuff come out about them in the last decade? Any vids/info you wanna share with me if there is?

       You gotta remember/understand that the reason is more likely because it was a trend or fashion to look the way they do, same haircut, facial hair, dresses etc. Just like why so many millennial men look very similar right now with the glasses, short beard, buttoned shirts and so on. They looked similar because ALL people looked like that and it was standard.

       Almost like fashion and trends are a thing, and they dressed and looked the same because it was standard! Wait until you see millennial men with the same exact glasses, haircuts and buttoned shirts. You'll go crazy.

       The reason the US Government won't acknowledge the TR-3B Astra is that is uses a nuclear reactor for power.

       Nuclear-powered Subs - Citizens are cool with those as they are out in the oceans, unseen.

       Believe it or not I've actually seen one of these TR-3B's in Outback Australia when I was a teenager living on the family farm.

       They're 100% a legit black project and being used. (I saw it in 2003)

       Yeah my dad saw one as well, out in a remote area near an airbase, in the early hours of a foggy morning.  It paced him for a few miles at a very low altitude, just above tree tops, until he came to a 4-way stop opposition another car.  Then it just shot up and away. His brother is a high ranked airforce officer who refuses to even get drawn into conversations about the TR-3B.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember after 9/11 when US announced it was going into Afghanistan, the Seattle Times actually ran an article about the new state-of-the-art military toys that were to be used and had drawings of the TR-3B and a smaller unmanned drone version.  It was in the print version of the paper, but scrubbed immediately from their online news site.

       Wow, what an intense experience that must have been for your Dad man.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I saw it, I was getting Firewood from our back paddock that was full of trees, preparing for Winter. I only saw it from a Distance but it certainly didn't follow me or anything like that, It was a fair distance away (1 or 2kms) and quite high in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       It did move REALLY fast though.

       I saw one as well, about a year ago. Southwest USA flying due east in early evening, silent, cruising probably around 15-20k feet, bit faster than an average airliner, three red lights, totally triply and exhilarating to have visual confirmation with my own eyes.

       It is pretty cool. I think it could come from various sources honestly though.

       Archons...seriously...my mind doesn't even want to know about the possibility of Archons...that says alot.

       I think the whole concept scares the shit out of me so much because I've seen instances/things in real life that hint towards something like the Archons being one of the only plausible explanations.

       "Lower" in the sense that this being thinks he's God, and has all the Abrahamic religions worshiping it, but really he is not god, but a lesser spirit

       It really is interesting how certain lines of thought and ways of thinking seem to have a tendency of 'getting lost' isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Get in the practice of really paying attention to what's going on in your mind from a metacognitive viewpoint and you can sometimes see interesting patterns in how the thoughts flow. Is it your subconscious acting up and trying to alter the flow of your thoughts or something else?

       One question....ever feel like you can't breathe while your sleeping? And you try to wake up because you realize you're dreaming...but you can't...and you still can't breathe...so you try to wake up again...but you can't...and finally...when you do wake up, you're completely out of breath.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no matter how hard you try...you just can't remember what you were dreaming about..."before" you realized you couldn't breathe.

       Hidden spiritual powers that govern existence below a certain level. Sometimes referred to ans the powers and principalities or The Authorities.

       In brief, they're basically the servants, governors, administrators and general servants of what is either a malevolent or deeply deeply ignorant deity that considers itself to be the supreme god of all creation and actively acts to punish anyone who refuses to submit to it's will or that challenges it's claim to supremacy.
      </p>

       Gnostic christians referred to the leader of the archons as the demiurge, there's a story about the buddha where he encounters a being that is remarkably similar in behavior to what some gnostic texts describe and weirdly, in the gnostic texts many of the demiurge's servants are and appear as angels which gets extra weird because in at least one text the unnamed supreme deity gnostic christians refer to also has angels it uses as servants.

       Prince Phillip and his descendants have German blood (he's a Mountbatten). Technically Elizabeth does as well, but she's like 1/16 German, as well as something like 1/16 Spanish and French. She is a direct paternal descendant of the original English family though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saxe-Coburg was the royal house name before Windsor, changed in 1917 because of rising German paranoia. Saxe-Coburg is indeed a German royal house, but that doesn't make the family itself German. A royal house is just a name given to a dynasty (Windsor was chosen as the current royal house simply because it "sounded English").

       elvis never died, instead took up new personas. one of them was rene angelil, husband of celine dion. to add to this, elvis was actually celine dion's father! so that whole time her father was actually pretending to be her husband.

       tupac shakur was not a real person but an android person created to fulfill an agenda/tupac is definitely dead and his death was covered up. there were multiple versions of tupac. they still use tupac's voice but gave it to a new artist, kasanova tha don. many believe kasanova is really tupac, but he isn't.

       majority of "people" you see on mainstream television are secretly transgendered, androgynous, or synthetic. a lot of times they take people from other countries and give them operations which reverse their characteristics. by that i mean a chinese man can transition to a black female and you would never know. i actually know for a fact one of the black actresses on the young and the restless was originally a small chinese man.

       This article, just posted recently here on

      <p>
       Are Vegas Casinos Mining Cryptocurrency?
      </p>
      <p>
       And, in the article, this theory: BitCoin was actually created by artificial intelligence, for artificial intelligence, and then modified by human beings. The only reason that cryptocurrency has a monetary value is to make it important to HUMANS so that they will build the machines to mine the cryptocurrency.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking brilliant.  I love this theory so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article goes to a dark place, however, suggesting that the Casinos/AI were behing the Vegas massacre on Oct 1st; "To create a really strong AI you need to introduce a chaos pattern that it can learn human response from. It's starting to look like they used #VegasStrong as a cover operation to launch a strong AI backed by cryptocurrency. MGM uses Palantir. The FBI uses Palantir. If Palantir is being used to mine cryptocurrency for MGM Resorts, then we have a gigantic collusion."

       Humans... On Mars already?
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember seeing a video that was supposedly "Leaked" from like the 1970 and it was some kind of "Drone" flying over a Mars like Terrain. I've never been able to find that video again but DAMN did it convince me that we are already on Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any good material about this one or do you recommend me just Googling Rob Steele and Mars?

       I know YouTube comments shouldn’t be taken seriously but some of them are saying that it’s just reused footage that has been edited really well. Apparently Buzz Aldrin appeared 1:26 in the video. I had a look and they looked a little similar but I couldn’t fill make it out. If this is legit then I’m gonna go down a rabbit hole and if it’s not then it’s a really well made video.

       The footage at the end is eye opening. Something about it doesn't seem "Faked" so to speak.

       It's the Internet, of course it could be faked but I don't know, something about it just seems very intriguing.

       You’re definitely right. It is really intriguing. It almost had me for a second. The close ups of mars were epic. But the small flashes of the astronauts and then being from other Apollo missions really denounces the credibility of the video. But with the being said, it was a really cool video. If something like this got leaked, I would just combust.

       There is not much more than
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9cgm1B7Rew">
        some beliefs he expressed back in June in an Info Wars interview
       </a>
       . While talking about the actions of pedophilia rings, he touches upon his belief (which he does describe as "out there") about the existence of slave colonies in Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       The video is very unpopular and prompted Alex Jones to issue a follow-up video to clarify he doesn't endorse the belief. I don't think Robert Steele has been on the show ever since, and subsequent interviews with other people would ask about it, only for him to be bothered and suggest focusing on other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The claim is too out there, and he was CIA, so there's good reason to brand the idea as pure misinformation. But I won't outright deny that there's a possibility.

       Here's an odd one.   Say Bigfoot was real and we knew about it.  It's critically endangered and it's territory extends over tens of millions of acres.  If it was officially discovered and recognized, the EPA and Endangered Species Protection Act would have to set aside massive preserves across the Pacific Northwest.  That could destroy the American Lumber industry.
      </p>

       So industry and Government work to prevent the official discovery of Sasquatch.

       What I'd big foot is actually the remnants of the giant race. Like the supposed giant in Afghanistan that was captured during the IRAQ war. Really powerful that it could kill most prey, but sensible to hide as it is human.

       Phantom Time theory and even more so WHY if true. The theory is that the Catholic Church, the Jesuits in particular, essentually hoaxed somewhere from 3 to 10 centuries as a way to distance people from paganism and bring the population under complete control. I believe they had the capability to pull this off, all universities across Europe were under strict Jesuit control, the Inquisition and religious wars of the time killed millions of free thinkers, and they rolled out the new Gregorian calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why go to such an extent? The question is, what was known back then that has been forgotten? Was Paganism much closer to the truth? When you look into it, Paganism ties in really well, or at least is a lot closer, to ancient astronaut theories. God used to have an S on the end, religious people seem to conveniently ignore that part of history. Before the Abrahamic religions showed up, almost all of the world was pantheistic... they worshipped, or at least paid homage to the advanced dudes who came to our planet from somewhere else. The story lines up pretty much universally. Soooo are those sneaky little bastards over at the church hiding something? Maybe. They sure have a nice collection over at the Vatican archives or so I hear, and it probably goes deeper than that. Food for thought.

       I love the
       <em>
        Stephen Hawking died and was replaced
       </em>
       theory. It's so outlandish, but the evidence is so tantalizing that I can't help but be  sucked in by it. I mean, sort of.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also makes the fact that "Stephen Hawking" visited Jeffery Epstien's island a bit more sensible.

       He is def still putting on a hell of a show and i go to even curated event i can. But the brain vibrates at bass frequencies when it is in a creative, happy state if mind.... my theory is he might be synchronizing the resonant frequency of peoples brainwaves.

       "Gamma waves (25 to 100 Hz) typically hover around 40 Hz and are the fastest of the brain wave bandwiths. Gamma waves relate to simultaneous processing of information from different brain areas and have been associated with higher states of conscious perception."
