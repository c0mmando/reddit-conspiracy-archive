       Your question presupposes that "Jesus Christ" actually was a real person - despite no recorded evidence (The Bible is not evidence). It also presupposes the "Lucifer" exists, yet again with no recorded evidence. So, your question is a non-question that belongs in a religion sub and not here.

       I think it is relevant because of the belief system of the people who rule the world.   They have certain religious believes, and they are willing to enslave humanity based on those beliefs.

       Lucifer as in Satan?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read about theories by historians that Lucifer was basically mistranslated over time in the scripture, basically that his name (literally Morning Star I think?) referred to a specific king of the times,  and it only came to refer to the devil through misunderstanding. I guess this doesn't really address your questions but if anyone knows more about it I'd be interested.

       I've heard both referred as the morning star (which is a planet or star that raises before sun rise..I.e. they thought it brought the sun rise). We may never know with all the bible edits, but JC still had great teachings and as an excellent example of how to live your life.

       That's not a theory, that's a fact. "Lucifer" is latin so it canot even be the actual name in the original text. It literally means morning star and is fou d in the bible only once, in a passage adressing a babylonian king.

       Literally no theologan believes that this refers to Satan.

       Well duh. The word originates from the Vulgate, where it was used to translate the Hebrew
       <em>
        helel,
       </em>
       meaning "shining one." The Latin
       <em>

       means "light-bringing," which is a fine translation.

       You mentioned the middle ages.....have you ever seen the youtube series describing how there were no middle ages?
      </p>
      <p>
       **its freaky with weird evidence. I am not convinced. But i slightly might have my doubts of whether its 100% wrong. Im not sure
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea is that lots of documents / maps and art etc. That was originally supposed to be dated as 1594 or 1638 *(examples) were actually dated i-594 and j-638
      </p>
      <p>
       As if to say theres like 1000 years of just made up history that didnt actually happen or isnt actually properly accounted for.

       There's several things here.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, what you're talking about is called the Phantom Time Hypothesis, and it isn't a "youtube series." It originated with a paper published by a German "historian" (and I use the term quite wrongly) around 1990.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the hypothesis doesn't suggest that the
       <em>
        entire thousand-year Middle Ages
       </em>
       was fabricated. It suggests that the calendar was pushed ahead by about 200 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       And third and finally, it's horseshit. Literally no one takes it seriously. We have piles of evidence that the year is exactly what we think it is, not least from astronomical observations that cannot possibly be faked.

       i don't think it was even comparing him to a fallen angel. seems more like the where comparing him to an object of respect and that he no longer resembles in splendor 'shining one'. and i agree neb neb was not a supernatural devine thing or a light in the sky.

       I've thought this for a while. Think about it. Satan is known as "the great deceiver". Well, then how do we know Christianity isn't deceiving its followers into thinking that their way is right when its actually wrong? How much conflict is created in the name of a Christianity? Most, in my opinion.

       Daniel quinn has written a series of books all of them are intertwined around some basic principles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main idea is this: 
Humans are destroying earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is not written from a perspective of a global warming fear monger. Its written based around the ideas that we are doing it to ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first two books *(ishmael and my ishmael) are about a gorilla. Meaning they are narrated somewhat from a gorrmillas perspective - this gorilla was taken hostage - captured by humans and ends up becoming a "teacher" in a sense *(sounds far fetched - but trust me.....just read the book. It changed my perspective on everything!)
      </p>
      <p>
       I have two periods in my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 26 yrs of my life - including: Everything i knew before i read ishmael - and real life the way i see the world today after ishmael.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story of b is the 3rd or 4th in the series of books - and it as well as beyond dechaute*(spelling?) Are more from a religious perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ishmael and my ishmael are more from a real world cause and effect perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you like to read.......i guarantee you nearly 100% if you read one of them you will want to gobble up the other 3 within less than 6 to 8 weeks of opening the first.
      </p>
      <p>
       They really SORTOF go in order that ishmael was the first released but you could read them in almost any order *(except beyond dechaute should definitely be last)
      </p>
      <p>
       Ishamel and my ishmael are different variations of the same story.
      </p>
      <p>
       How about this - get one of those two and read it cover to cover - then come back to this thread and tell me your thoughts. If you dont feel enlightened - as if the book completely changed your perspective on humans/earth etc - then i will peraonally refund you the price of the book(a gift card code or usps or something)

       Its more than just the huge number of wars fought in the name of religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just the idea that humans are the reason for earth to exist. God *(humans creator) created the heavens and the earth in an effort to provide a great garden for people to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       So he didnt create earth for elephants and monkeys and fishes and birds. He created everything to serve humans. Seems like a pretty goddamned selfish concept to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it*(greed/religion/pride) is the whole reason we *(humans) destroy the earth unconditionally and with no fear of the consequences of our annual destructions.

       Christ was a real person, see Tacitus, Suetonius, or Flavius Josephus for a historical perspecticve of the times. As to Lucifer, he isn't Satan (translation : Great Enemy) from the Jewish old testament. Lucifer is the first being to fall, sin and whatnot againt Creation. Lucifer doen't want to do what he's supposed to, so he has a rough time of it. Jesus (not in the historical concept) does what he's supposed to do (religiously), I have a tough time linking the two ideologies, only possible if there were a fundamental misunderstanding of what it meant to be human, though perhaps that's the conspiracy.

       You're getting hung up on trivia. The Hebrew
       <em>
        satan
       </em>
       means one who opposes: adversary, enemy. In the Hebrew Bible is found the appellation
       <em>
        ha satan,
       </em>
       literally meaning
       <em>
        the
       </em>
       adversary, the one apart from all others, the special one. Translating that as "great enemy" is not a stretch at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Translating between languages is rarely a word-by-word operation. This is especially true when the languages are at most distantly related. Hebrew is a very different language from English. A variety of different English phrases can all be used to translate a single Hebrew word or phrase.

       A better translation would be
       <em>
        the opposer,
       </em>
       but we don't really use that word in English, so it's most commonly translated as "the adversary."

       All prophets came to warn you about people who will control you by making up demons and evil beings. They understood that most people succumb to the ideas of the masses. These people claimed Devine right to boss people around when prophets die and made up daemons and shit to control you. Wake up it is time

       Its a little more complicated than that. But not much more. Let me give you my opinion *(slightly based on dan quinns stories and modified by my own experiences with religion)
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so many thousands of years ago people were like animals *(ie they lived free - and they ate off the land......so if they were hungry they went into the woods and found some bananas or berries and thats what they ate. This is important because it was before the advent of agriculture *(and before the invention of religion)
      </p>
      <p>
       So then one day this chick - we will call her eve. She said hey boyfriend......we will call him adam. Look i like it that you always go in the woods and find me these random fruits but these strawberries are like the bomb! I love these things. If you get me more strawberries i will give you oral pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
       So adam went back and found more and more strawberries. Cause he liked oral pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
       And he realized if he plants the seeds the strawberries actually grow in the area where they be hanging out at.  So he did it again and suddenly he was able to have strawberries without going into the woods to look for them.
And boom - agriculture was beginning to take shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with this all starting -  more food was available and as such people could live safer *(and longer) and suddenly the human population started to boom and adam and eves sons and grandsons made more babies and more strawberries and the population got bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       But suddenly you had a different set of problems. You were less scared of going hungry - instead you were scared of the other humans doing bad, bad things. *(like stealing your strawberries, or forcing your sister to give you oral pleasure or killing you)
      </p>
      <p>
       So the elders got together and said we need to make some rules *(we could theoretically call them commandments.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I think ten is a good number. Thou shall not steal. Thou shall not kill. Thou shall not commit adultry etc.etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And one of the elders said wait a minute these guys are never going to agree to follow all these rules. And the smartest one - we will call him moses - he said look - you let me convince them. These are not our laws. These are gods laws! If they think the rules came from a higher power - they will follow the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR - The whole religion thing is a way to control people since there are too many people to live together with no rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pss - i can go all day with this theory about the bible stories. Ask me about cane and able and others. I can give you a realistic definition of how its a true story - just taken out of context

       To some extent.....yeah
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the natural order of evolution. The stronger animals get the most food. If their enemies screw around their enemies get dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we have broken that system.
      </p>
      <p>
       *we....humans.....figured out how to outsmart the normal food chain. By banding together and creating civilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thousands of years ago if there was a famine thousands of people died. Now if theres a famine - usa ends in helicopters full of "aid" in the form of food and medicine
      </p>
      <p>
       **which means the world continues to get more and more over populated with humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       The laws of the jungle were over taken by the laws of man. But man was unable to control himself. "Humans" are greedy and selfish. To the point of destroying earth so badly that it wont be habitable in another 1000 yrs.
(Likely way sooner)

       Lucifer isn't Jesus, nor is Lucifer Satan.  Lucifer is a demigod entity that offers pure power to humans.  Due to the nature of humans, this always results in sin.  Sometimes Satan encourages people to follow Lucifer by giving them confused ideas like your question.
