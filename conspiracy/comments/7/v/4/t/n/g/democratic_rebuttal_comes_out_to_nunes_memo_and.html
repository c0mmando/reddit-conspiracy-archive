<p><strong>Here’s a direct link to the document</strong>: <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/TODAY/z_Creative/inline-headers/FINAL%20DRAFT%20--%20Dear%20Colleague%20on%20Nunes%20Memo.pdf">http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/TODAY/z_Creative/inline-headers/FINAL%20DRAFT%20--%20Dear%20Colleague%20on%20Nunes%20Memo.pdf</a></p>

<p><strong>And here’s a link to the article where it came from</strong>: <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/democratic-rebuttal-calls-nunes-memo-deliberately-misleading-n844426?icid=today_hp_NBCtopheadlines">https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/democratic-rebuttal-calls-nunes-memo-deliberately-misleading-n844426?icid=today_hp_NBCtopheadlines</a></p>

<p>Shortly after this story broke (and possibly completely unrelated), the House Intelligence Committee posted two more documents related to the Nunes memo. The first document is a response to the various charges placed against the memo, and the second document lists key points.</p>

<p><strong>First document</strong>- <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hpsci_fisa_memo_charge_and_response.pdf">https://intelligence.house.gov/uploadedfiles/hpsci_fisa_memo_charge_and_response.pdf</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen users saying this a few times in the sub now, and it&#39;s time to use our logic to discredit this notion.</p>

<p>The memo can be a &quot;nothing burger&quot; on the substance of the corruption and still &quot;hurt national security.&quot; One is not exclusive of the other.</p>

<p>Regarding your comment:</p>

<p>It certainly is an &quot;idiotic strategy&quot; by Democrats to claim &quot;national security.&quot; They would have done better be emphasizing the one-sided nature of the release, and demanding <em>more</em> to be released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s not what the implication was when Schiff and co were warning us all about how dangerous the memo was to American security. To veraciously lie about how dangerous the memo was, instead of saying its contents are unreliable due to partisan bunk puts the suspect on those trying to stop the publication in the first place. </p>

<p>Sure you can argue your way around that if you want to, and there’s no incontrovertible evidence that Schiff is incriminated by the memo, but from the timeline and presentation of the memo set up by Schiff, you have to wonder why they wanted to cover this up from the american people. If people are being spied on, and doing so was illegal, they should be fighting for justice and to not is a big misstep in the public light. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing one thing - the memo describes an act that <em>regardless</em> of the existence of other evidence could be considered a crime.</p>

<p>Intentionally withholding material facts could be called perjury. Regardless of whether or not the judge would have changed his opinion of the evidence presented, the application was sworn to be true and complete, when it wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>This apparent crime was committed seemingly in an attempt to manipulate the judge&#39;s ruling by withholding information that called into question the veracity of the information presented.</p>

<p>Added to that, it was apparently committed as a result of partisan bias within the FBI.</p>

<p>The <em>only</em> rebuttal we need to see is evidence that the judge wast told the information in the dossier had not been corroborated and had been generated by a foreign agent paid by an organisation hired by the DNC to conduct opposition research on Trump.</p>

<p>Proving that would <em>not</em> harm national security at all, because that is the very claim the Democrats have been making all along... right?</p>

<p>Or is it? It seems to me that neither the FBI nor the Democrats have said that the claims made in the memo are false. They only claim that other omitted information would change our perception of the act.</p>

<p>But, it won&#39;t. If the FBI did withhold material evidence, then it is fair to say they committed perjury.</p>

<p>You can be convicted of perjury even if you only told one lie. It doesn&#39;t matter if you also told one hundred truths... that one lie is still a crime.</p>

<p>Flynn was charged with lying to investigators. Should the agents that presented the FISA application be charged for lying to the court?</p>

<p>If justice is equal they should be.</p>

<p>same process that the Nunes memo underwent</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If Republicans had not first pushed their partisan memo, there would be no Democratic response. Essentially, Republicans are hiding behind the fact that they came first to partisanizing intelligence, and therefore, they should legitimately take the benefit of getting their word out first, with the assistance of a very partisan press. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s being falsely represented that the Republican&#39;s are preventing it&#39;s release</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are preventing the release of the Democratic response, and hiding behind rules to do so. They ambushed the Democrats and anyone else who might want to have a full objective investigation of the DJT campaign. For parity, Republicans could have either waited to release both memos together, or they could have withdrawn theirs. Pretty simple really.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not forget what underlies all of this. Devin Nunes and other hyper partisans want to discredit the FBI and the investigation for two very specific and dangerous reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They do not want anyone but the most cronyest of cronies to look at Donald Trump. Every single leader of the investigation is Republicans, but that&#39;s not good enough for them.</p></li>
<li><p>They are turning the idea of &quot;conflict of interest&quot; on its head, but attacking the investigators personally. Reality dictates that investigators should be adversarial to investigation subjects -- not cronies.</p></li>
<li><p>The Donald Trump administration wants to take over the FBI and the rest of the federal government with a pure-crony system where his political heads can fire anyone at any time without cause, as he announced at the SOTU.</p></li>

Again, any Democrat member is allowed to read the Schiff memo on the floor with immunity if they wanted to.</p>

<p>There may very well be partisan politics being played. But the oversight committees are supposed to provide oversight. Those committees report to us, the American public. And if the FBI/DOJ is abusing the FISA Court system and process they have the right and the obligation to inform the public.</p>

<p>Brush everything aside, we now know that the FBI/DOJ knowingly and willingly took a piece of evidence that they knew was unverified to a FISA Court in order to be granted the ability to survey Americans. They presented the evidence as credible, yet you, I, and the media know it was not. That&#39;s abuse of the FISA system. That should not happen. We have a right to know.</p>

<p>Some may say that this discredits the Mueller investigation, I don&#39;t believe that. I do believe that the FISA system was abused and now I&#39;m left with the question, how often has the FBI/DOJ taken unverified information and presented it as credible in order to legally spy on Americans? And that&#39;s a question everyone, regardless of which side of the aisle you favor, should be asking.</p>

<p>This is a good point, but it leaves two issues unanswered. (1) Does a full rebuttal require the release of classified information? (2) Should Republicans have started this partisan game of playing with intelligence information in the first place?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There certainly is, as we all know Devin Nunes is a Donald Trump crony, and the vote was on partisan lines. Nothing quite like this has ever happened before.</p>

<p>But the oversight committees are supposed to provide oversight.  Those committees report to us, the American public.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>... which they rarely do. Why this time? Obviously, for partisan reasons. Recall that the FISA law was slackened up after it was discovered that GWB was doing warrantless spying -- and the law passed gave him <em>retroactive immunity</em> for the clearest crime that he committed. Republicans have temporarily flip-flopped on FISA for political convenience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They presented the evidence as credible, yet you, I, and the media know it was not. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dossier is quite credible, as is the other information available. It is quite ironic that even with the limited information available the warrants seem routine and supportable. If we had all the information, it would only strengthen the case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s abuse of the FISA system. That should not happen. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>While you are willing to accept this partisan exploitation, I am only willing to agree that the FISA system is abusive. There should be no special court, and certainly, that court should not contain judges selected only by a Republican.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have a right to know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have a right to know all kinds of things, but it seems the &quot;right to know&quot; is used exclusively by some for partisan Republican releases -- even when they are plainly misleading. The time to support the &quot;right to know&quot; <em>begins</em> with the right to know all the pertinent details.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do believe that the FISA system was abused</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think it should be eliminated, as too, should other special courts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>has the FBI/DOJ taken unverified information and presented it as credible in order to legally spy on Americans? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question, except that, as I just said, the information appears reasonably verified. </p>

<p>Now, what do you make of this? <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/politics/strzok-fbi-comey-clinton-letter">http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/31/politics/strzok-fbi-comey-clinton-letter</a></p>

<p>Kind of blows the whole idea that the FBI is the deep state against Donald Trump, and suggests that it is the deep state for the protection of Donald Trump. </p>

Not trying to be mean, your just not grasping what I&#39;ve said and is out there. I know I&#39;m pretty much arguing the rights side, but hand to god I didn&#39;t vote for Trump and paid little attention to any of this until late November. And while it&#39;s still unfolding and we&#39;re still getting info and leaks, the picture I&#39;ve seen point&#39;s to the rights conspiracy being more likely true than the lefts conspiracy.

<p>In its final paragraph, the Nunes memo
states: “[t]he Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence
investigation in late July 2016.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe so... but this warrant wasn&#39;t for Papadopoulos or the Trump campaign in general... it was specifically aimed at Carter Page and thus had to present probable cause to believe that <em>Carter Page</em> was acting as an agent of a foreign power.</p>

<p>This Demcorat&#39;s &#39;memo&#39; does nothing to dispute the claim that the dossier was the only source of information that apparently provided that probable cause.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth,”
included false information or excluded true information that was or would have been critical to
the court’s determination of probable cause. The Nunes memo alleges nothing that would
even come close to meeting this standard.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to this Democrat. Other people, including the judge, may have different opinions. I for one believe that withholding the source of the dossier &quot;would have been critical to the court’s determination of probable cause&quot;, especially if no other information provided probable cause to believe Carter Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, rather than as an agent of the Trump campaign.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, to be clear: Carter Page was, more likely than not, an agent of a foreign power. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whoa there buddy! That&#39;s pure fucking bullshit! Just because a warrant was issued, that doesn&#39;t mean Page was <em>actually</em> acting as an agent of a foreign power! Remember, innocent until <em>proved guilty</em>, and a <em>secret</em> warrant application isn&#39;t a fair trial.</p>

<p>That sentence alone makes me believe this Democrat is a lying piece of shit.</p>

<p>Can anyone else believe a Democrat would say that simply because an investigator was able to acquire a warrant, that means the suspect is guilty? I mean seriously, <em>what the fuck?</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nunes memo would have us believe the Russia investigation was a Democratic
plot from the outset. That is simply ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A Democrat <em>would</em> say that. I do not see any real defense against the claim. Simply calling it ridiculous is not a valid defense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nunes memo does not show that the government relied solely, or even substantially,
on the information provided to the FBI by Christopher Steele when it made its application to the
court. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And this memo does not show it wasn&#39;t. Considering the author claims to have read the warrant applications, I have to wonder why the author seems to lack any real argument against the claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It does not show that Steele’s work was compromised by the source of funding. It does
not show that Fusion GPS—</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t need to show that. All it has to show is that the FBI concealed the origin of the information, and so far no one has disputed that claim. Determining the veracity of the information was in the hands of the judge, and to do that he/she needed <em>all</em> the relevant information - which the FBI apparently intentionally failed to provide.</p>

<p>That leads me to believe the FBI thought the judge may have a different opinion if he/she had <em>all</em> the facts. Why else conceal that information?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In fact,
Fusion GPS initiated the project on behalf of the conservative Washington Free Beacon, not the
DNC. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a provable lie. Steele was not hired by Fusion GPS until after the conservative website stopped funding Fusion GPS. It was DNC money and <em>only</em> DNC money that was used to fund Steele.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing about the source of Steele’s funding or his later opinions about Donald Trump
speak to the credibility of his work, or its inclusion in the FISA application. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. There is a reason scientists, journalists and even politicians are expected to reveal the source of their funding - because such funding can and often is a source of bias in the results. To claim otherwise is pure disingenuous bullshit.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And nothing about the payment from the DNC is unethical or improper. Christopher
Steele is one of the world’s leading experts on Russian organized crime.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So paying foreign agents to dig up dirt on political opponents in an attempt to manipulate the outcome of an election is not a crime. Funny how that seems to only apply when its the Democrats doing it...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>—the memo provides no basis whatsoever to justify the removal of Rod Rosenstein as
Deputy Attorney General from his critical and trusted position. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless Rosenstein <em>knew</em> that material information was intentionally being withheld from the court. If he did know, then he is an accomplice to alleged perjury.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no
reason to believe that he reviewed or approved any FISA application for submission to the court
except according to normal process and procedures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true. It doesn&#39;t matter if he reviewed the application according to &quot;normal process and procedure&quot;... it is the <em>approval</em> of a potentially willfully false application that is the problem. His review is not meant to simply be a rubber stamp. He is essentially putting his name on the application, and thus if it is illegal, he has to face the consequences.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although he was not involved in the initial application, the Deputy Attorney General could not
have signed an application to renew surveillance on Carter Page if the government was unable to
show that it had already gathered valuable evidence under existing orders and expected that
collection to continue. Under these circumstances, any decision not to approve the renewal
would have appeared to have been politically motivated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unless of course there was no such information, or that information was also false. In that case he would <em>expected</em> to refuse. That&#39;s his duty.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nunes memo shows that House Republicans are now part and parcel to an
organized effort to obstruct the Special Counsel’s investigation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why are the Democrats intentionally conflating the Special Counsel investigation - which began in May 2017 - with the FBI FISA warrant applications - which began in October 2016.</p>

<p>The FISA warrants had nothing to do with the Special Counsel investigation.</p>

<p>Overall, this Democrat&#39;s &quot;rebuttal&quot; is pure hot air and bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t care who you are or claim to be but your post takes Republicans at face value, and makes conspiracies out of the Democrats claims.

I don&#39;t care if you are a Repub or Dem, but you post has bias - it does not treat the arguments on both sides equally.</p>

<p>The Steele Doss was not funded by the W. Free Beacon we know what. It also was not used as a sole source for RENEWING Carter Page&#39;s monitoring warrant. We know it wasn&#39;t the sole source because the Nunes Memo says it wasn&#39;t. He also never reviewed the underlying FISA warrants before writing the Memo. The memo says it was A source not THE source. It also has nothing to do with Cater Page&#39;s initial investigations going back to 2013. He also doesn&#39;t know how the FISA warrant was even handled. The memo is a red herring. You SHOULD be saying, lets wait to see what the second Memo says. You shouldn&#39;t be taken the Memo at face values, especially if you claim to be unbiased. </p>

<p>Secondly, neither the FBI nor any law enforcement agency, typically reveal anything to the suspect of an active investigation. The fact  Nunes revealed the ongoing investigation into Page is a huge red flag, (during his midnight run). You think a police officer is going to tell a suspect his phone is being monitored? </p>

<p>Carter Page was investigated before Trump decided to run. Cater Page&#39;s RENEWAL was approved AFTER he left the Trump Campaign as a VOLUNTEER advisor. At least get the most important things right, then you can conspire with what&#39;s left. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is where you make your first mistake. Neither of those &quot;sides&quot; are my allies.</p>

<p>You may not want to believe it, but I am <em>not</em> a Republican, nor do I support Trump. I didn&#39;t support Hillary either, but that has more to do with my belief that neither the Republicans nor the Democrats should be leading the US because they are both corrupt to their core.</p>

<p>Here is your second mistake. Why do I have to think of something <em>misleading</em>? Your question should be &quot;truthful from one and <em>false</em> from the other.&quot; True facts can be misleading, but they are still true.</p>

<p>But, here you go:</p>

<p>From the Democrats:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FISA court found probable cause to believe that Carter Page is an agent of a foreign power.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That is true. We do not know whether other information helped convince the judge that Page was acting as a foreign agent. You may note I never said anything about whether the warrant was justified or not.</p>

<p>What I did say is that the investigators appear to have committed perjury in the application and that the judge <em>may</em> have ruled differently if told the truth about the dossier.</p>

<p>From the Republican memo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is itself misleading. The fact we <em>now</em> know that Steele was the source of the information in that article does not mean the FBI knew it at the time the application was made. Of course, the Republican memo admits that the FBI did not know the source:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Steele should have been terminated for his previous undisclosed contacts with Yahoo and other outlets in September—before the Page application was submitted to the FISC in October—but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about those contacts.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the FBI did not learn about Steele&#39;s leaks until the end of October, <em>after</em> the warrant application. This information calls the veracity of the dossier into question but does not demonstrate any intentional wrongdoing from the FBI.</p>

<p>Another <em>potential</em> lie in the Republican memo is the claim that McCabe testified that there would have been no warrant if not for the dossier. That testimony is still secret, so we have to take the Republican&#39;s word for it, and the Democrats are saying it is &quot;100% false&quot;.</p>

<p>What the Democrats are <em>not</em> saying is that it is &quot;100% false&quot; that the FBI withheld material information from the judge regarding the source of the dossier.</p>

<p>That one act could be considered perjury, and it forces one to ask &quot;what would motivate FBI agents and DOJ officials to commit perjury?&quot; They knowingly omitted material information and it seems their only motive for doing so was partisan bias.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can anyone else believe a Democrat would say that simply because an investigator was able to acquire a warrant, that means the suspect is guilty?</p>

<p>No, I can&#39;t. Because &quot;more likely than not&quot;, taken at face value, would mean that there&#39;s at least a 51% chance of  guilt. You may disagree with that, but to say that it&#39;s claiming the suspect is absolutely guilty based on the warrant is just dishonest.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bullshit. There is a reason scientists, journalists and even politicians are expected to reveal the source of their funding - because such funding can be, and often is, a source of bias in the results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because all of those are capable of influencing the public? The Fusion GPS Dossier was opposition research for those who funded it. Journalists are expected to reveal where their funding comes from because you can pay them to lie to the public. Same with scientists. Someone doing opposition research for you would usually only be lying <em>to you</em>. While probably biased, since the goal is to dig up dirt on their target, there&#39;s no incentive for dishonesty as their backers would want legitimate dirt.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the bias would be there for any opposition research, regardless of who funded it. As long as the judge was aware that it was opposition research, who funded it seems  irrelevant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that the dossier was presented to a judge as credible is the issue your ignoring. If they had enough on Carter Page why did they need the dossier? Why did they need the Yahoo article that was basically Steele corroborating his own shit? I&#39;m not trying to argue with you, I get that a lot of folks don&#39;t like Trump. This is bigger than Trump though. These agencies have ridiculous power. There are supposed to be checks and balances. That&#39;s what the FISA court is for. Step back and really think about this. They sign a sworn affidavit that the evidence presented is true. Regardless of the shit they had on Carter Page, that dossier wasn&#39;t credible and they used it knowing anyways.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh yes it can... those Democrats can say &quot;it was not the only source of information&quot;.</p>

<p>The closest this &quot;rebuttal&quot; comes to saying that is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing in the Nunes memo rules out the possibility that
considerable evidence beyond the Steele dossier helped the court reach that conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This guy read the application. Why is it only a possibility? Why does he not clearly state that other information was presented to the judge?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, I can&#39;t. Because &quot;more likely than not&quot;, taken at face value, would mean that there&#39;s at least a 51% chance of guilt. You may disagree with that, but to say that it&#39;s claiming the suspect is absolutely guilty based on the warrant is just dishonest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is dishonest to claim that this Democrat is not intentionally implying that Page <em>is</em> &quot;guilty&quot; of being a foreign agent. He chose his words carefully, but they are clearly designed to mislead. Let&#39;s look closer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So, to be clear: Carter Page was, more likely than not, an agent of a foreign power. The Department of Justice thought so. A federal judge agreed. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why mention the DoJ or the Judge? Clearly the implication is &quot;They thought he was a foreign agent, so clearly he was&quot;.</p>

<p>Of course, that overlooks the fact the DoJ was lying in the application about the information they presented to the judge, and the judge was relying on the application to make that determination.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because all of those are capable of influencing the public? The Fusion GPS Dossier was opposition research for those who funded it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the dossier was used by the FBI in court and <em>they</em> lied about the source of funding. That <em>may</em> have influenced the judge.</p>

<p>Because the judge wasn&#39;t told, we have no way of knowing whether the judge&#39;s opinion might have been different if he had known. The FBI sure seemed to think it might have been, as there appears to be no other reason to withhold that information.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Someone doing opposition research for you would usually only be lying to you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh bullshit. Opposition research is done specifically so it can be used to influence the public. Stop being a fool. In this case it was also used to influence a judge, and that appears to have been a crime.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While probably biased, since the goal is to dig up dirt on their target, there&#39;s no incentive for dishonesty as their backers would want legitimate dirt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bullshit. No one cares if the dirt is legitimate... they only care if they can make it stick. Having the name of a respected foreign agent attached to it sure helped.</p>

<p>Seriously, you and half of the US public bought into the &quot;pissing on the bed&quot; claim, and none of you gave a shit whether it was really true or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As long as the judge was aware that it was opposition research, who funded it seems irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there it is... even <em>you</em> have to admit that if the judge wasn&#39;t told there is a problem.</p>

<p><em>That</em> is the core claim of the Republican memo. The judge <em>wasn&#39;t</em> told.</p>

<p>No one... not the FBI, not this Democrat... has disputed that claim.</p>

<p>Obviously because they can&#39;t. If they dispute the claim and the Republicans vote to release the application, then they will be caught in a lie. So they do not dispute it.</p>

<p>They simply try to baffle you with bullshit, hoping you&#39;ll be too stupid to notice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on mobile so I&#39;m not going to actually quote you. But you&#39;re not as knowledgeable as you sound. </p>

<p>1.) You&#39;re shifting the burden of proof here. The Republican memo was the first to make a claim: that the Dossier was the only &quot;evidence&quot; used to get a FISA warrant. But we don&#39;t actually know what was used to get that warrant. The Republican memo did not provide evidence for its claim, and so any counter argument doesn&#39;t need to provide evidence. It&#39;s up to the person making a claim to provide evidence, not the person countering it. </p>

<p>2.) That &quot;Democrat&quot; is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and has seen the classified information pertaining to this case. Their opinion holds far more weight than yours or mine. And you can&#39;t use hypothetical &quot;a judge MAY disagree&quot; bullcrap. That predictive stuff isn&#39;t really an argument. </p>

<p>3.) As you can see in your own quoted material, it says he&#39;s more than likely a foreign agent. That&#39;s because our own law enforcement agencies think he&#39;s a foreign agent. No one is saying he&#39;s for sure a spy. Just that there&#39;s evidence for it (more than you or I know. But Gowdy knows, and he just basically quit).</p>

<p>4.) And the Republican claim that Democrats are behind everything isn&#39;t backed up by evidence, but do you care about that? No lol</p>

<p>5.) Dude. Nunez never even read the FISA warrant application. He never even saw it. The Democrat DID see it. So in this case, the Democrats opinion is the only one that matters. Of course, Gowdy also read it, but he just abandoned ship, so...</p>

<p>6.)  Again, you can&#39;t set up a claim (that the FBI concealed information) and then demand others discredit it. YOU need to prove YOUR claim. And you or your memo HAVENT. The AUTHOR of the memo HASNT READ THE FISA WARRANT APPLICATION.</p>

<p>7.) It&#39;s not a lie, the opposition research project on Trump conducted by Fusion GPS was started by conservatives. The project is larger than just Christopher Steele. Once Trump won the primary, the conservative funders pulled out (Trump wasn&#39;t opposition at that point). Fusion hired Steele to contribute and liberals picked up the funding for it, because they could use it. It&#39;s not some vast conspiracy. </p>

<p>8.) I would hope the funding was disclosed. And it may have been, neither of us have seen the actual details. But it doesn&#39;t mean any of the information is wrong (though it is healthy to question it).</p>

<p>9.) Opposition research is perfectly legal and normal. Utilizing stolen data is however borderline illegal and immoral. </p>

<p>10.) Again, you&#39;re using hypotheticals like they&#39;re arguments. Stop it. </p>

<p>11.) Another hypothetical as an argument...</p>

<p>12.) Wow, another hypothetical. &quot;It would be his duty to refuse!&quot;...if this hypothetical situation I have no evidence for is real! </p>

<p>13.) They&#39;re &quot;conflating&quot; the FISA application with the Mueller investigation  because the Numes memo is an attempt (by a Trumpian sycophant) to protect Trump by discrediting the FBI. Trump, and therefore his congressional lackey Nunes, want the FBI discredited that the federal criminal investigation centered on his campaign is discredited. See? The investigation can&#39;t be trusted if the organization conducting it can&#39;t be trusted! It&#39;s see-through....to most of us...</p>

<p>You just have no idea... period.</p>

<p>This entire memo is about acts that took place <em>before</em> there even was a &quot;special investigation&quot; as you put it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If this is simply an overview of FISA abuses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not. It is specifically related to a single case.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d love to put an end to all this crap and simply get the FISA approving members&#39; opinion</p>

<p>WTF? Do you think Congress approves FISA warrants?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d put good money on its approval even with the source included, which would make this entire fiasco entirely irrelevant.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Perjury is perjury, regardless of whether or not it changes the outcome.</p>

<p>For example, the FBI already knew what Flynn was talking about in their interview with him. They knew the correct answers, but he lied. So he was charged and plead guilty.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter in the slightest that his lies had absolutely no affect on the outcome.</p>

<p>The same applies here. If the FBI committed perjury by claiming that they had presented all material information to the FISA judge when they were actually withholding information, then it doesn&#39;t matter whether those lies would have changed the outcome or not. They are still lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>But you&#39;re not as knowledgeable as you sound.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I sound knowledgeable that is <em>your</em> perception. I never claimed any special knowledge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re shifting the burden of proof here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, I&#39;m not. I am not asking the Democrats to prove anything. In fact, I pointed out that what was missing was the <em>claim</em>, not the proof of the claim.</p>

<p>Quote the part of the memo where the Democrats state that the Republican memo presented false information. Not misleading... false. Not once does the Democrat memo dispute the claim that the FBI withheld material information. Forget the proof, they don&#39;t even make the allegation!</p>

<p>Why does the Democrat memo <em>not</em> state that the FBI <em>did</em> tell the judge about the DNC&#39;s role in funding the dossier? Could it be because it is a provable fact that the judge was <em>not</em> told? If that is the case then the FBI committed perjury. They intentionally withheld material information from an application they swore was true and complete, and no one... not the FBI, not the Democrats... have disputed that claim.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that the Dossier was the only &quot;evidence&quot; used to get a FISA warrant</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It does not make that claim at all. In fact it specifically mentions a Yahoo news article. It also states that the source of both pieces of evidence was the same, and that the judge was not told that either.</p>

<p>The claim made by the Republican memo is that the dossier was this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Deputy Director McCabe testified before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That does not state that there was <em>no</em> other evidence. It only states that the dossier was considered to be the most important evidence, without which the warrant would not have been sought. It attributes this claim to McCabe. It is possible that McCabe did not say this, but you will note that has nothing at all to do with whether or not material evidence was withheld from the court.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say it again in a different way - if you are on the witness stand and answer 100 questions truthfully, but tell only one lie, you have still committed perjury. In a court case, even one proven lie can call your entire testimony into question, and you can be prosecuted for that one lie, regardless of the 100 times you told the truth.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That &quot;Democrat&quot; is a member of the House Intelligence Committee and has seen the classified information pertaining to this case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes... that&#39;s what I said in my other comment. Now ask yourself... if he has seen the warrant application, why does he <em>not</em> state that the judge <em>was</em> told about the DNC&#39;s role? Why is <em>he</em> &quot;withholding the truth&quot;?</p>

<p>Could it be because the judge was <em>not</em> told and he knows it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As you can see in your own quoted material, it says he&#39;s more than likely a foreign agent. That&#39;s because our own law enforcement agencies think he&#39;s a foreign agent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or it&#39;s because they wanted to justify their attempt to manipulate the election by wiretapping a Trump campaign member, and the only way they could do that was by claiming they had probable cause to believe he was a foreign agent.</p>

<p>The fact they withheld material information gives me probable cause to believe they were lying about that too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And the Republican claim that Democrats are behind everything isn&#39;t backed up by evidence</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Behind everything? Let&#39;s be specific here... do you admit the Democrats were &quot;behind&quot; the creation of the dossier? That has been proved beyond doubt by the testimony of the people who created it. Do you admit that leading agents in the investigation of the Trump campaign were biased and supported Clinton? That has been proved by the text messages the FBI was forced to release.</p>

<p>Do you admit that biased agents lying about DNC funded dossiers to a FISA judge implies that there is some bias in the investigation itself, and that people who support the Democrats are &quot;behind&quot; it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nunes never even read the FISA warrant application. He never even saw it. The Democrat DID see it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the Democrat never once claims the FISA court was told about the DNC funding the dossier. Why not? Seriously, I&#39;ll keep asking the question... it is the core claim of the Republican memo that the FBI withheld material information from the FISA application.</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t this Democrat that has seen the application claim that the judge <em>was</em> told? </p>

<p>Obviously because the judge <em>wasn&#39;t</em> told and he knows it. He&#39;s just hoping you&#39;re stupid enough not to ask that question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, you can&#39;t set up a claim (that the FBI concealed information) and then demand others discredit it. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not setting anything up. That is the core claim of the Republican memo. That memo was written based on an examination of the application. Both a Republican and a Democrat read that application.</p>

<p>No one, not them, not the FBI, is claiming that the information was <em>not</em> withheld. No one. The Democrat is simply trying to distract you from that fact while hoping you&#39;re stupid enough to miss the elephant in the room.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s not a lie, the opposition research project on Trump conducted by Fusion GPS was started by conservatives. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It <em>is</em> a lie. The conservatives ceased funding Fusion GPS <em>before</em> Steele was even hired. His work product - the dossier - was 100% funded by the DNC and had nothing to do with the conservatives.</p>

<p>Even Fusion GPS admitted that. Why can&#39;t you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would hope the funding was disclosed. And it may have been, neither of us have seen the actual details. But it doesn&#39;t mean any of the information is wrong (though it is healthy to question it).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>OK, so what if it wasn&#39;t? What if the FBI intentionally withheld material evidence from the judge, thereby committing perjury.</p>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s OK of the FBI to commit perjury when they are seeking to obtain invasive warrants against US citizens? How would you feel if <em>you</em> were the target of that warrant? Do you care about your rights at all?</p>

<p>Or is it only Republican&#39;s rights that you don&#39;t care about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Opposition research is perfectly legal and normal. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yep.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Utilizing stolen data is however borderline illegal and immoral.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They didn&#39;t utilise stolen data. Oh, and did you consider it &quot;borderline illegal an immoral&quot; when the media utilised Snowden&#39;s stolen data? Or Manning&#39;s?</p>

<p>Or was that different because it was exposing the acts of Republican administrations?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Again, you&#39;re using hypotheticals like they&#39;re arguments. Stop it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pfft. Asking me to &quot;stop it&quot; because you have no answer is rather lame. Try again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wow, another hypothetical. &quot;It would be his duty to refuse!&quot;...if this hypothetical situation I have no evidence for is real!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you do not believe it would the duty of an attorney to refuse to submit to a court a document that they know to be false?</p>

<p>You do know lawyers can be disbarred for that, right?</p>

<p>What do you think laws and regulations are for, except to state how people should behave in a given hypothetical situation.</p>

<p>But, you may not have noticed that I was responding to a hypothetical posed by the Democrat:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under these circumstances, any decision not to approve the renewal would have appeared to have been politically motivated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See? I didn&#39;t create the hypothetical, but I was able to produce a sound argument against it. It <em>is</em> possible, you know.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;re &quot;conflating&quot; the FISA application with the Mueller investigation because the Nunes memo is an attempt (by a Trumpian sycophant) to protect Trump by discrediting the FBI.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry?</p>

<p>You still do not understand, do you? The Special Counsel is <em>not</em> the FBI. Discrediting the FBI does nothing to discredit the Special Counsel.</p>

<p>In fact part of the reason for having a Special Counsel is the actions of the FBI have been called into question.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Based on the &quot;unique circumstances,&quot; Rosenstein said, &quot;the public interest requires me to place this investigation under the authority of a person who exercises <strong>a degree of independence from the normal chain of command.</strong>&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I have determined that a special counsel is necessary in order for the American people to have full confidence in the outcome,&quot; Rosenstein said. &quot;Our nation is grounded on the rule of law and <strong>the public must be assured that government officials administer the law fairly</strong>. Special Counsel Mueller will have all appropriate resources to conduct a thorough and complete investigation, and I am confident that he will follow the facts, apply the law and reach a just result.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort met with a russian lawyer with ties to the Kremlin, a Russian-American lobbyist with links to Russian intelligence, and a Russian-American businessman who was once investigated for money laundering.

    <div class="md"><p>?????? I never once mentioned anything about supporting Hillary lol. The FBI/DNC (two separate groups that have literally nothing to do with each other) didn&#39;t &quot;spy on Trump. They had been surveilling Carter Page for three years, and Trump picked him to join his campaign, which then obviously sent red flags up considering what we know about Carter Page.</p>

<p>Did you even bother to read anything I posted before, or did you just want to comment something about Hillary? Lol</p>

<p>The problem with that is that the source of the &#39;public reporting&#39; of the thing in the first place was the author of the damn thing. That&#39;s the point. It was circular reporting. This isn&#39;t even acceptable practice for regular reporting, let alone as a basis for a FISA application. Unless of course the FISA court doesn&#39;t care about standards, and simply does everything for show. Which I guess we can&#39;t rule out, since they are a secret court in the first place.</p>

<p>Whether or not the reporting was circular is OF NO CONSEQUENCE to the application, since the yahoo report was not used as corroborating evidence. It was only referenced to show that the author went public.</p>

<p>The yahoo article being added actually nullifies tons of the memos claims. The memo claims that the source of the dossier was not listed. However, the source of the dossier was PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE before the FISA app went through. Go back and look yourself.</p>
