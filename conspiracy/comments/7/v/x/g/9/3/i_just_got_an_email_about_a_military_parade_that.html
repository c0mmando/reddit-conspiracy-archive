        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It said that Trump wants our military present everywhere, on street corners, in the streets etc. I&#39;m unsure of the source of my email, whether it&#39;s from a conservative or liberal group. I have seen other news of this on Reddit though.</p>

<p>To my main point though... I wonder if this is actually a cover for the shit that&#39;s about to hit the fan when major Washington players will be rounded up and arrested. &quot;Q&quot; alluded to something like this happening. He said it would be big and that there could be chaos, but everyone would be protected. A military &quot;parade&quot; is a great way to keep the peace if there are disgruntled Americans when their favorite politicians are arrested for treason and corruption.</p>

<p>What do you guys think? BTW, I&#39;m a moderate that leans right. I&#39;m not a shill, I&#39;m not a Trumpet (but I support any mission to end corruption and treason). I was a Democrat prior to Bernie getting shafted in the primaries.</p>

<p>So let me see if I understand this correctly.   You WANT to see a pseudo martial law declared to cudgel some unruly protesters?  And this is being posted to a conspiracy sub that is supposedly skeptical of government corruption and abuse?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And the appropriate response to that is troops in the streets obviously.  You know, not the regular Democratic means of investigating and prosecuting but putting boots on the ground in the fucking US.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t want Martial Law either and think it&#39;s highly unlikely but these are extraordinary times.</p>

<p>I was disappointed that Bush covered up Clinton&#39;s crimes. Disappointed that Obama covered up Bush&#39;s crimes. Started to get disappointed that Trump was doing the same but it appears he is actually going after them. It&#39;s incredible to see.</p>

<p>If Andy McCabe was arrested, and people took to Washington to seize power because they are delusional, then that would require the military. As it would in all circumstances. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to say that this is right or wrong. I&#39;m just trying to connect the dots of everything that is going on. A military parade in the US has not been done in a while.

<p>That means you fell for the Republican plan, disrupt the primaries, blame the Democratic when it was Republican led voter suppression that disrupted the primaries and they used their compliant MSM to promote the false story . . . that merged nicely with the DNC which had also been taken over by conservatives, way back in the late 80s who did call themselves Democratic but produced the very conservative Bill

<p><a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wikileaks-list-least-65-msm-reporters-meeting-andor-coordinating-offline-top-hillary-advisors/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2016/10/wikileaks-list-least-65-msm-reporters-meeting-andor-coordinating-offline-top-hillary-advisors/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The voter purges, closed polling places, voter ID vote blocking all took place in conservative states.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Same kinds of things Democrats do in cities. New York this time around was filled with all sorts of shady shit, busing in voters to multiple voting places, closing places where they new would be majority GOP voters, throwing out GOP votes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nothing in those emails had any information about suppressing the vote,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sure it happens on both sides, but that&#39;s not the point. The point is Hillary stole the DNC nomination and rigged for herself against Bernie, super fucked up. I&#39;m not going to vote Dem or have anything to do with these folks until there is some sort of reformation some time in the future. In its current state, its corrupt AF so I&#39;m staying independent.</p>

<p>Also in terms of voter ID, here are all the things an ID is required for by law:</p>

<p>Voter ID is really nice when it is advertised as free (Wisconsin) but impossible to obtain if one is a poor and likely Democratic voter. </p>

<p>Alabama the state that closed the DMV offices in the poorest counties.</p>

<p>I assumed that. I could tell by the wording. But I try to address the points people bring up and I try to stay as moderate as possible. I respect everyone&#39;s opinions, even if I think they are false. </p>

<p>I always remind myself that we are all just victims of propaganda... Including myself. I accept that I could be wrong about all of this (but my gut is that I&#39;m not). I just try not to do anything that divides all of us more than we already are... Even when someone is clearly on the opposite side and using a combative tone in their comment. I definitely have my opinions about who is on the right side of history, but I keep my cheerleading to the subreddits that are geared toward that type of commenting. Here at conspiracy, I try to stay neutral because I want to get this sub back to what it used to be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very true. I still feel that the best way to fight the propagandists is by reasonable responses to them. I just tell them that they could be right, but I have a different belief based on my perception of what is going on. One thing I don&#39;t do is change my beliefs based on comments or posts from Reddit, unless they link to a fairly credible source of info (of which there are few). I basically soak up everything I can, then make my own decisions based on my reasoning skills. I look at bias from the source, I consider history, I consider ulterior motives by the authors etc etc. </p>

<p>Basically, I fight the propagandists by being honest and reasonable because it&#39;s the last thing that they want me to be. They want to get us riled up and emotional. They want us to mis speak and use shaky logic or loose evidence so they can attack it. I don&#39;t cite any articles etc. I just tell them what my perception is and leave it at that</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False assumption:” Republican plan” republicans are divided and have completely different priorities. Mcaine and Lindsey graham are hated by one faction, trump is hated by all of them, Cruz and Rubio hate another group, and it goes on. Republicans are not unified.

Don’t trust any of it, but don’t jump to conclusions using generalizations. All blacks r not the same. All republicans r not the same. Nor r all democrats not the same.

    <div class="md"><p>I totally agree, a parade is ceremonial. I&#39;m just saying that if Q is right, it would be a great cover for a way to get military on the streets to quell any problems that might arise if there is a big round up of corrupt and treasonous politicians who are still loved by many Americans. Q talks about a big event like this.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t believe that this is the case, but my &quot;question everything&quot; mentality tells me that it&#39;s possible, given how uncommon an event like a military parade is in the US. It has happened in the past, but I don&#39;t think in my lifetime.</p>

<p>It might not even be considered martial law. It might just be a way to prevent martial law from ever having to be declared... Put military on streets for parade, then arrest all corrupt and treasonous politicians, people may want to riot, but will not because military is present. Martial law never has to be declared, riots averted.</p>

<p>Seems plausible???</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nah, if anything I think this parade can be seen as a show of force and that the military brass is on Trump&#39;s side. Martial Law is a nation wide thing, and I think would only be declared under an extreme catastrophe. This parade would be very localized and it will be purely ceremonial.</p>

<p>One of the big differences between JFK and Trump in taking on the deep state is that JFK was also at odds with his generals over the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam. Trump has the generals on his side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Chances are that you are correct. It&#39;s very Trumpish to do something like this and I think it&#39;s cool. It helps breed patriotism and respect for our military. I don&#39;t always agree with the wars we we have been fighting, but if we ever got attacked, I definitely want our military there to protect us.</p>

<p>I responded to another comment about the Martial law situation... If a parade happens as a cover for a round up, it may actually prevent martial law from having to be declared because rioters would be deterred by just the military presence. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s a cover for a round up, I was just connecting some dots and proposing a theory. I think there is a tiny chance that it could happen, given the state our country is in and the political climate, but it&#39;s probably just going to be a ceremonial parade.</p>

I am not tying to defend trump, but attacking trump does not change the fact the military supports trump. They also literally worship the ground Mattis walks on. I can tell u never served.

    <div class="md"><p>They are definitely not uncommon in other countries. I just read about Bastille day in France... It was cited in the article I read. I was just saying that it&#39;s uncommon in the US. At the same time, it seems like something Trump would do, so it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a total surprise to me. I was just critically thinking about everything that is going on and proposing a &quot;radical&quot; theory about ulterior motives for a military parade. Chances are that it will just be a parade, but here in conspiracy we have to throw these theories out there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think trump is trying to energize the public, inspire a sense of pride and unity. Americans from all walks of life have been demoralized. Rather than rooting for the NFL for example maybe expressing a sense of pride will inspire people to be more involved and active. Hold the corrupt politicians feet to the fire. A lot of people need bells and whistles otherwise the kardashians would not be famous. Civic pride and involvement is a good thing, but not for the swamp who want us unaware, distracted, and apathetic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dislike many of the wars we have fought since world war 2. In fact, I can&#39;t think of any I agree with really. There might have been some legitimate wars, but all the propaganda and misinformation surrounding these conflicts makes me wonder why we were/are actually there. So many wars seem to just be fought for bankers and resources, vs protecting us or allies. </p>

<p>Regarding &quot;jerking off our military&quot;... I do believe in a strong national defense (not offense). I do want to have the best military, but I want it to be used properly and wars authorized by Congress. </p>

<p>I hope Trump does the right thing, so far he has not made any big moves, maybe he is just trying to clean up some messes before he pulls out. We will see.</p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s an argument for the theory of it being a cover for a round up? Why waste money on a military parade? Maybe it&#39;s not just a parade? Maybe there&#39;s another reason to have military in the streets?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am 1000000000000000% against this idea. I think it is a waste of money,  Everyone knows America is a big bad bully that spends all of its money on fucking war, and greed and not enough of its money on healthcare, science, and education. We don’t need to show our strength to other countries, and a parade isn’t going to unify us as a country. It’s going to make the Democrats mad, it’s going to give the republicans boners and make everyone in between uncomfortable. Trump saw NK do this, and he saw France do this and like the five year old he is he wanted to do it to. His friends all got buzz light years and now he wants one as well. It’s ridiculous, it’s scary, it’s a waste of resources. I’d like to note I am not left, or right.  I have liberal like ideals however I am mostly anti government. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I totally understand where you&#39;re coming from. I&#39;m sort of indifferent about the parade. I think it could have some positive benefits, like increasing patriotism and honoring our military. On the other hand, the funds used for this could be used elsewhere in our society. I don&#39;t really relate this parade to North Korea, or any other &quot;bad&quot; country because allies do them too, like France. </p>

<p>The reasons that you laid out are why I believe there is actually something else going on. Most of the left, and even some on the right believe that Trump is impulsive, unpredictable and makes bad decisions. I happen to believe he is very strategic. Many things he has said or done seemed crazy at the time, but eventually we see that he had a planner reason for doing those things. He is often vindicated for those things months later when new information comes to light and is released to the public. </p>

<p>I admit that I don&#39;t always agree with what Trump does, but I trust him and I like what he has done so far. I trust that he has America&#39;s best interest at heart and more specifically is fighting for the citizens of this country. I know this is a controversial stance, but I read everything I can from both sides and that is the conclusion that I have come to.</p>

<p>I am mostly anti government myself, which is exactly the reason I support Trump. My perception is that he really is cleaning up Washington of all the things that cause me to be anti government. I would be more pro-government if we could get rid of all the corruption and drain Washington of all the people who make decisions based on their own well being vs the well being of the American citizens. If we can put in place a government &quot;for the people&quot;, we will see a drastic shift in support of government.</p>

<p>I am still skeptical of many things that Trump is doing, but I honestly trust that he has a plan. He likes to win and the only way he can is to gain the support of most American citizens. I trust that everything will fall into place. </p>
