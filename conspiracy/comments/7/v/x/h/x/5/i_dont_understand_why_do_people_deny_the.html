<p>No history book or government will answer your call like an old friend or family member will, and these last few years I&#39;ve seen too many people aligning themselves with &quot;the right side of history&quot; or &quot;resist&quot;, rather than the only networks that have a snowballs chance in hell of keeping them alive should SHTF</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To put it in context I have a lot of family in South Africa and let me just say, the only thing that keeps you alive once a narrative gets out of control isn&#39;t your ability to recite historical or political platitudes- it&#39;s how well you can still maintain your relations with family and friends despite disagreements on politics and the like. The people who block people out of their life or get disparaging towards their family for having a different or &quot;uncouth&quot; ideas are the ones who end up struggling the most. The ones that get along despite an odd or non-cosmopolitan uncle or two survive and thrive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i am not antisemetic, i have a jewish friends. i think they got the short end of the stick in all of WW2. except for palestine, which lost its right to a state for some reason.</p>

<p>ive learned about both sides. there are some crazies that are totally racist. you can immediately see those. then there are some serious questions. why arent there any german documents regarding exterminations? they kept extensive files on everything else under the sun. why not that too? youd think if it were so important, that the germans would have been shouting that: today, we will killed the millionth jew. hail hitler, or whatever.</p>

<p>then theres the fact that americans bombed their supply lies (a good idea in war) which led to a lot of the jews and those in camps being starved. would you feed your slave camp, or your guards? pretty easy choice. ive also read that there were outbreaks of disease and infestation, which were documented, which explains a lot of the dead bodies.</p>

<p>what actually pisses me off, is that people get all butt hurt about the holocaust like it was the worst thing to happen ever. pretty sure we americans killed a shitton more native americans. so fucking many, that those cultures dont even exist. the jewish culture is flourishing, and yet, we have to be reminded of this ALL THE TIME. no one mentions Mao, or lenin/stalin who killed WAY more people, by the order of at least 10.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s one of the most scrutinized and researched series of events in the 20th century. Sure, there&#39;s no way to know the true numbers, but all estimates of total deaths are around 10 million, of which a little more than half were Jews. It sounds insane, but think of Babi Yar. You probably aren&#39;t even familiar with the name, but it was a massacre of 30,000 Jews in less than a week. They were just chased from their homes at gunpoint, shot, and dumped in a ditch. A few survived to tell the tale along with several Nazis who later talked about it. That&#39;s before mass extermination procedures were put into effect, so it&#39;s not hard to imagine the concentration camps being far far worse and more &quot;effective&quot;.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t recall Gazan families being forced and stuffed into box cars, driven for days without food, then let off and forced into crowded work or death camps. Can you point me out a source for this?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, we bombed the shit out of Germany and killed a bunch of their civilians. This is my opinion, you can call it racist, but, it seems that people are overly sensitive about the holocaust as compared to other genocides. Also the inconsistencies/possible explanations for part of it i mentioned above.</p>

<p>Pretty sure gazans are chased from their homes at gunpoint... For no reason really too. I understand the rockets are annoying, but, my understanding is that they aren&#39;t even effective cuz of the defense system.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s not quite to boxcars for the gazans, they do live under extreme duress. They&#39;re second class citizens, and face extreme prejudice. It amazes me how the Jewish people, after being subjected to the holocaust, are treating others so inhumanly.</p>

<p>I hope it&#39;s apparent I&#39;m not trying to troll, and that I&#39;m not racist. I&#39;m just open to differing views. I even enjoy the wrong ones (flat earth/eugenics). I think the psychology of it all is interesting. The psychology of the holocaust, and how people interpret it, is fascinating for me.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that people are oversensitive, it&#39;s that no one tries to deny other genocides (except for denying the Armenian Genocide, and they get a free pass if they do it in Turkey). </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Well you see, there&#39;s a freaking <strong>massive</strong> difference between &quot;living life under duress&quot; and &quot;being summarily forced from your home to a near-certain death along with all of your friends and family&quot;. The Holocaust killed 2/3rds of an ethnic group (European Jews) in less than 5 years. What&#39;s happening in Gaza, even if you were to blame it all on Israel and not Hamas, isn&#39;t even comparable considering the fact that the population has increased at a normal and steady rate since forever. </p>

<p>MAN OF 1938<br/>
From the unholy organist, a hymn of hate.</p>

<p>Read the entire article <a href="http://www.scrapbookpages.com/DachauMemorial/TimeCover.html">one a single page here</a> or <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,760539,00.html">on TIME&#39;s web site.</a></p>

<p>A few excerpts:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Führer of the German people, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, Navy &amp; Air Force, Chancellor of the Third Reich, Herr Hitler reaped on that day at Munich the harvest of an audacious, defiant, ruthless foreign policy he had pursued for five and a half years. He had torn the Treaty of Versailles to shreds. He had rearmed Germany to the teeth— or as close to the teeth as he was able. He had stolen Austria before the eyes of a horrified and apparently impotent world.</p>

<p>But the figure of Adolf Hitler strode over a cringing Europe with all the swagger of a conqueror. Not the mere fact that the Führer brought 10,500,000 more people (7,000,000 Austrians, 3,500,000 Sudetens) under his absolute rule made him the Man of 1938. Japan during the same time added tens of millions of Chinese to her empire. More significant was the fact <strong>Hitler became in 1938 the greatest threatening force that the democratic, freedom-loving world faces today.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A generation ago western civilization had apparently outgrown the major evils of barbarism except for war between nations. The Russian Communist Revolution promoted the evil of class war. Hitler topped it by another, <strong>race war.</strong> Fascism and Communism both resurrected religious war. These multiple forms of barbarism gave shape in 1938 to an issue over which men may again, perhaps soon, shed blood: the issue of civilized liberty v. <strong>barbaric authoritarianism.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The genius of free wills has been so stifled by the oppression of dictatorship that Germany&#39;s output of poetry, prose, music, philosophy,art has been meagre indeed.</p>

<p>The man most <strong>responsible for this world tragedy</strong> is a moody, brooding, unprepossessing, 49-year-old Austrian-born ascetic with a Charlie Chaplin mustache. The son of an Austrian petty customs official, Adolf Hitler was raised as a spoiled child by a doting mother. Consistently failing to pass even the most elementary studies, he grew up a half-educated young man, untrained for any trade or profession, seemingly doomed to failure. Brilliant, charming, cosmopolitan Vienna he learned to loathe for what he called its Semitism; more to his liking was homogeneous Munich, his real home after 1912.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The situation which gave rise to this <strong>demagogic, ignorant, desperate movement</strong> was inherent in the German Republic&#39;s birth and in the craving of large sections of the politically immature German people for strong, masterful leadership. Democracy in Germany was conceived in the womb of military defeat. It was the Republic which put its signature (unwillingly) to the humiliating Versailles Treaty, a brand of shame which it never lived down in German minds.</p>

<p>In bad straits even in fair weather, the German Republic collapsed under the weight of the 1929-34 depression in which German unemployment soared to 7,000,000 above a nationwide wind drift of bankruptcies and failures. Called to power as Chancellor of the Third Reich on January 30, 1933 by aged, senile President Paul von Hindenburg, Chancellor Hitler began to turn the Reich inside out. Unemployment was solved by: 1) a far-reaching program of public works; 2) an intense re-armament program, including a huge standing army; 3) enforced labor in the service of the State (the German Labor Corps); 4) putting political enemies and Jewish, Communist and Socialist jobholders in concentration camps.</p>

<p>What Adolf Hitler &amp; Co. did to Germany in less than six years was applauded wildly and ecstatically by most Germans. He lifted the nation from post-War defeatism. Under the swastika Germany was unified. His was no ordinary dictatorship, but rather one of great energy and magnificent planning. The &quot;socialist&quot; part of National Socialism might be scoffed at by hard-&amp;-fast Marxists, but the Nazi movement nevertheless had a mass basis. The 1,500 miles of magnificent highways built, schemes for cheap cars and simple workers&#39; benefits, grandiose plans for rebuilding German cities made Germans burst with pride. Germans might eat many substitute foods or wear ersatz clothes but they did eat.</p>

<p><strong>What Adolf Hitler &amp; Co. did to the German people in that time left civilized men and women aghast. Civil rights and liberties have disappeared. Opposition to the Nazi regime has become tantamount to suicide or worse. Free speech and free assembly are anachronisms. The reputations of the once-vaunted German centres of learning have vanished. Education has been reduced to a National Socialist catechism.</strong></p>

<p>Pace Quickened. Germany&#39;s 700,000 Jews have been tortured physically, robbed of homes and properties, denied a chance to earn a living, chased off the streets. Now they are being held for &quot;ransom,&quot; a gangster trick through the ages. But not only Jews have suffered. Out of Germany has come a steady, ever- swelling stream of refugees, Jews and Gentiles, liberals and conservatives, Catholics as well as Protestants, who could stand Naziism no longer. TIME&#39;s cover, showing Organist Adolf Hitler playing his hymn of hate in a desecrated cathedral while victims dangle on a St. Catherine&#39;s wheel and the Nazi hierarchy looks on, was drawn by Baron Rudolph Charles von Ripper, a Catholic who found Germany intolerable.</p>

<p>churchill&#39;s niece, the third mitford sister, was hitler&#39;s mistress for the entire war living in germany. she tried to commit suicide when russia invaded, bungled it, and lived out the rest of life her severely mentally handicapped with her mom on some island north of scotland. </p>

<p>her oldest sister, also churchill&#39;s neice, was the wife of the head of the UK&#39;s facist party. </p>

<p>all of the miford clan, but the youngest daughter, was in love, with hitler, they visited him severally times during the war. after the war, they all declared hitler had decieved them, except for daddy mitford, he maintained until he died that hitler was a swell and a great man. </p>

<p>the most famous mitford girl, neice #2, wasn&#39;t really political but even she liked hitler until she became de gaul&#39;s mistress. </p>

<p>only the youngest mitford always hated hitler. she and her husband, churchill&#39;s youngest son, were communists, who went to fight for the spanish revolutionaries against franco. churchill disowned his son and this neice, and his son&#39;s plane mysteriously blew up after he got in a fight with churchill about flying to spain shortly after he took off.</p>

<p>churchill never disowned, nor even expressed displeasure with any of the hitlerian mitfords. he never made the niece living in germany come home and never stopped the otheres from traveling there. he refused to give his neice/daughter in law his son&#39;s inheritance when she died. she moved to america, got a normal job, and you&#39;d never know she was technically, an english noblewoman.</p>

<p>churchill also said of mussolini that should england ever find herself in the predicament that iraly did after ww1, he hoped she have someone like mussolini to see her through.</p>

<p>which was taken over by the Soviets who didn&#39;t do the best job of documenting what they found</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is there proof that &quot;most of the killings&quot; were done in the east when the Soviets didn&#39;t do the best job of documenting what they found? From what I understand the one major problem that people have with the supposed numbers of people that died during the holocaust is that most of the dying is largely unverified because it supposedly took place in the &quot;killing camps&quot; in the east, where there was no actual documentation. </p>

<p>Saying that they&#39;re just &quot;disputing parts of the story&quot; is just a cowards way of trying to get people to listen to them. No one wants to hear someone say that they are a Holocaust Denier, but if they start off with an easy to swallow pill, they can bury the hook later.</p>

They need to understand the intricacies of fiat currency and debt. </p>

<p>If they can grasp that every single thing being preached in the media is a lie,maybe, just maybe they will be able to stretch and realize that the only thing they know about the holocaust is what the news said or even worse, what Hollywood has been pumping out for the last 70 years.</p>

<p>This right here is a big thing that threw me. I don&#39;t deny it happened and for the most part, have just followed along with what I&#39;ve read in history whether that is right or wrong. </p>

<p>Then when I started seeing conflicting claims that were immediately swatted with such fervor and anger I started to read more.  Even more recently you see stuff like <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-42164853">arresting this 89-yo lady</a> and trying to throw her in jail for denying parts of the Holocaust. </p>

<p>That&#39;s when I started to question things. What do the governments of the world have to fear from an old lady? Why can&#39;t she speak her mind even if she is wrong? Why is anyone barred from having a public discussion about it without fear of reprisal by law enforcement? Is there something actually being hidden here?</p>

<p>That&#39;s the kind of shit that makes me turn my head to the side and say &quot;I&#39;m going to read more about this now because I don&#39;t know if I believe everything you are saying anymore.&quot;</p>

<p>Also why not just shoot Jews on sight? The cost to transport, house, feed, delouse, poison and whatever else would cripple a nation as opposed to the cost of a bullet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you spent even a couple of minutes on this topic you would know that the exact opposite is the case. </p>

<p>&quot;as opposed to the cost of a bullet.&quot; - Bullets were too valuable to use for shooting them, they were needed on the frontlines where an actual war was going on. </p>

<p>&quot;The cost to transport&quot; - It&#39;s not expensive to throw them into trains by the hundreds until there is no more space and send them off. </p>

<p>&quot;The cost to house, feed&quot; - Again, minuscule considering the conditions they had to live in. Furthermore, they were used for slave labor, so there was actually profit involved. </p>

<p>&quot;The cost to poison&quot; - They literally found one of the cheapest ways for mass-extermination on that level. This method was chosen specifically for it&#39;s low cost and effectiveness. </p>

<p>Most ethnic Jews weren&#39;t Zionists until after the Holocaust. And his mentor was <a href="https://thirdreichocculthistory.blogspot.com/2011/07/dietrich-eckart-hitlers-mentor.html">Dietrich Eckhart</a> who hated Jews. The group directly involved with bringing Hitler to power was the Thule Society:</p>

<p>&quot;Eckart was a key member of the Thule Gesellschaft, founded by Sebottendorff, - a secretive group of occultists that believed in the coming of a “German Messiah” (Stark von Obern - the strong one from above) who would redeem Germany after its defeat in World War I.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is very difficult to find a mainstream synthesis of this because of the nature of the subject. Most sources will come from holocaust deniers, and are thus open to attack (however well documented the individual facts may be, e.g. of Faurisson or Irving, because of their conclusions most will reject <em>anything</em> they say).</p>

<p>You can however verify this for yourself. Look at the individual claims made in Nuremberg, and then look at what mainstream historians nowadays say. Typical examples include the human lampshades, soap, shrunken heads, etc.</p>

<p>One big red flag I can cite is the example of Dachau. It is now <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/mobile/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005214">admitted as a mainstream fact</a> no humans were gassed there.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thetruthseeker.co.uk/?p=85432">The World Almanac is often used as a reference to dispute the large numbers of Jews dying. In 1933 it reported a world Jewish population of around 15 million. In 1948, it reported a world Jewish population of...around 15 million.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_in_Israel">Israel was officially created shortly after the end of WWII. In 1948 the US quickly recognized it&#39;s statehood, 11 minutes after Israel officially comes into existence.</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Antisemitic_canards">All of this, of course, is tied into Anti-Semitism. If you want to get an understanding of why people are anti-semitic, there are several common canards.</a> I find it quite interesting that Jewish people have been routinely kicked out of civilizations throughout history. </p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmelnytsky_Uprising#Jews">Khmelnytsky Uprising in 1916</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Many of the original issues with Jews stemmed around the process of money-lending (officially termed usury), which was at one point very frowned upon by most religions and societies at the time, but this was a very common practice within the Jewish faith.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhineland_massacres">The Rhineland communities were relatively wealthy, both due to their isolation, and because they were not restricted as Catholics were against moneylending. Many crusaders had to go into debt in order to purchase weaponry and equipment for the expedition; as Western Catholicism strictly forbade usury, many crusaders inevitably found themselves indebted to Jewish moneylenders.</a>&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Time and time again, the Jewish people are a small population that do end up achieving a lot, <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/10-jews-in-forbes-top-50-billionaires/">whether that is wealth or fame</a>, as well as many notable intellectuals are of the Jewish faith.</p>

<p>So what I&#39;m getting to is that, for some time, Israel has been trying to become a state. Shortly after the greatest suffering in recent Jewish history, they now have a state, immediately supported by the &quot;winners&quot; of WWII. What I find the most interesting, however, is that for a country full of people fleeing and fearing for their lives in the WWII Nazi Holocaust, it seems odd that they would treat their fellow humans with such disdain and violence. </p>

<p>I should add, as a footnote, that there is a distinction between <a href="https://www.veteransnewsnow.com/2014/10/15/510541what-is-zionism/">Zionist Jews, and Jews in general, with the former being the more conspiratorial fodder</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Six million is a number Jews have been claiming suffering on throughout history.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This often gets repeated. It&#39;s simply not true. The claim for this comes from Google 10 years ago, when they had a massive catalog of old newspapers that you could search through. Some bigot did a search for &quot;6 million Jews&quot; and copypasta&#39;d the results. Problem is that newspapers <em>also</em> <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wKIqw">reported</a> trouble involving 3 million Jews, or 7 million Jews. So 6 million wasn&#39;t some magical number. Another oft-repeated myth is that there&#39;s some sort of prophecy where 6 million Jews will return to Israel. There&#39;s no such prophecy and never was. Ancient Hebrew doesn&#39;t even have a way of saying the number &quot;million&quot;. It&#39;s based just something said by a Rabbi in 1965 and completely misunderstood.</p>

<p>Most of the rest of your comment is focused on Israel, which is a completely separate topic. Holocaust Deniers like to pretend that only Zionists told the story of the Holocaust. In reality, Zionism was rather unpopular among Jews until the 60&#39;s. And the vast majority of research, study, published narratives, and discussions on the topic (pre-1967) was by non-Zionist, or even anti-Zionist, Jews. So why would a Polish religious Jew who believes that the creation of Israel is a sin, decide to collude with the people he hates?</p>

<p>The Jewish prophecy of 6 million returning to Israel is tied up in Gematria that I haven&#39;t had time to fully explore, but from what I&#39;ve read, I agree, is a myth.</p>

<p>However, I don&#39;t feel that Israel/Palestine is necessarily a separate part of this topic. I find it very odd that a people united under a common past of being singled out and murdered for their religious background are in the middle of actively wiping out Arabs on their perceived homeland. So when you consider they were promised land in Palestine in 1917, then gained it as a result of WWII in 1948, and are continuing to illegally invade Palestinian land, it is all very similar to the long history of Jews being removed from societies.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2a8b3x/israel_to_pay_students_2000_for_proisraeli_social/">The IDF, established in 1948, is very engaged in propaganda, or controlling the image of Israel. This goes hand in hand with holocaust denial laws that exist. Control the information and you can control the world.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of what you said is true, but the partial truth makes your conclusions false. There <em>were</em> newspapers making references to &quot;six million Jews&quot; predating WWII, but there were many more references to other numbers, like 9 million or 3 million. The full facts draw a different picture, no one was pushing the number 6,000,000 specifically, it&#39;s just cherry picked data.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Jewish prophecy of 6 million returning to Israel is tied up in Gematria</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m glad you see the truth in that. Anyone who knows anything about Gematria will tell you how ridiculous it is. You would need something on the order of fifty thousand letters to come to the number 6,000,000. Gematria calculations rarely exceed 1,000.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>However, I don&#39;t feel that Israel/Palestine is necessarily a separate part of this topic</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course it&#39;s related, even the most hard-core Zionist will tell you how early Zionists used the Holocaust to sway the world towards supporting Israel. But you are again cherry picking facts to support a false narrative. In the end of the day, most Jews in 1945 did not support the idea of a Jewish homeland in Israel. Yet <em>all</em> Jews actively talked about how terrible the Holocaust was and Holocaust Denial is all but non-existent among Jews, even those who are fiercely anti-Zionist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will have to look more closely into those references you alluded to in the screenshots in the previous post. I don&#39;t think that discredits the story though - it just shows a history of working up sympathy by showing unparalleled plight of X millions of their people. </p>

<p>There has of course been <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/ny-rabbi-not-even-1-million-jews-killed-in-holocaust/">many revisions to the 6 million number since WWII, bringing the believed total to much less than that</a>, depending how one wants to quantify the numbers. So it certainly seems plausible that the numbers were inflated, and if they were, for what reason?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/01/27/holocaust-non-jewish-victims_n_6555604.html">What&#39;s interesting is the control of speech - the holocaust is virtually synonymous with Jewish suffering, yet an equal number of non-Jewish individuals were victims.</a> Furthermore the term genocide also tends to be closely linked to the WWII events, even though there are other cases, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_Genocide">the Armenian Genocide, which was close in it&#39;s scope and casualties</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/formerlyfundie/yes-israel-palestinians-actually-genocide/">the ongoing &quot;Palestinian Genocide&quot;</a>, yet most people are unaware of these events while we are ALL aware of the WWII tragedies.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/polish-senate-approves-holocaust-law/">We can see even today the WWII events still ring out in public forums and legislation.</a> </p>

<p>In summation, I still have no idea what my actual belief is in relation to the events surrounding WWII. I do believe that people were killed, and I&#39;m sure that people were singled out for their beliefs or their perceived contributions (or lack thereof) to society. But I do think, as with anything, a grain of sand has been snowballed into a massive polarizing arguing point, and it&#39;s gotten to the point where questioning the even makes you anti-Semitic. There is no other place in history that I&#39;m currently aware of that a huge event like this has so closely been tied to a single religion or people. Especially when that particular event affected more than just the Jewish population.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your original argument was that the six million number was a fabrication because it predated the Holocaust. Now you&#39;re just moving the goalposts by claiming that it&#39;s &quot;a history of working up sympathy&quot; whatever that means.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>many revisions to the 6 million number since WWII</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There really haven&#39;t. The &quot;Rabbi&quot; in question (a guy nearly universally criticized by Jews) claimed that of the 6 million Jewish deaths in the Holocaust, 5 million were children of mixed Jewish-gentile marriages. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>the holocaust is virtually synonymous with Jewish suffering, yet an equal number of non-Jewish individuals were victims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because Jews suffered far more than non-Jews during the Holocaust. 2/3 of European Jews were killed due to Hitler&#39;s policies, Concentration Camps, labor camps, death marches, Einzgruppen, etc. The only group to suffer even close to that was the Gypsies and they lost around 1/5th of their people.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Furthermore the term genocide also tends to be closely linked to the WWII events, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only according to you. Growing up, it was the Cambodian Genocide that I heard most about, along with the Rwandan Genocide(s). </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I do think, as with anything, a grain of sand has been snowballed into a massive polarizing arguing point</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You see, therein lies the issue. It&#39;s <em>not</em> a polarizing point. It&#39;s a fact, like the sky is blue or the Earth is round. Only a tiny, insignificant, minority of people whose historical education comes from web forums and YouTube videos actually deny the history. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&#39;s gotten to the point where questioning the even makes you anti-Semitic.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, yeah. I find it difficult to understand how someone can call nearly a hundred thousand Jews to all liars and not be an anti-Semite. Every argument I&#39;ve heard about Holocaust Denial involves the assumption that you can&#39;t trust Jewish witnesses because they are Jews. Virtually every major Holocaust Denier in history is also a massive anti-Semite (Zundel, Irving, etc.)that wants laws discriminating against Jews. The single exception is David Cole but even he eventually recanted. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no other place in history that I&#39;m currently aware of that a huge event like this has so closely been tied to a single religion or people. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s an event that affected the Jewish people more than any other event in the last 2000 years. It was also a massive event that affected the whole world, but Jews in a far greater way than anyone else. Of <em>course</em> it&#39;s going to be like that.</p>

<p>What are claimed as death camps are all in Soviet territory. In Auschwitz it&#39;s claimed the Soviets built a chimney that&#39;s not even attached to the building.</p>

<p>If we consider that the Holocaust was a conspiracy, the seeming purpose is to create Israel.</p>

<p>Israel and US politics are tangled. Some will definitely claim Israel controls the US. Others might say that the US has to do a lot of what Israel says because Israel is basically the US&#39;s largest base of operations in the Middle East, and the US benefits from controlling/destabilizing the Middle East.</p>

<p>So if all these camps are in Soviet territory and the Soviets are adding to the camps to make them seem like they are more Death Camp than Work Camp, my question is WHY?</p>

<p>Is the idea that the Soviets secretly control Israel and thereby secretly control the US? Because I don&#39;t hear that said a lot.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s because it&#39;s easier to fake the stuff in the Soviet area, then why haven&#39;t the Soviets spoken up?</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand how the Soviets benefit from faking Death Camps. Can anyone explain, whether or not you agree, I just want to understand what the actual argument is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a couple answers here. First of all, the purpose of World War 2 and the “Holocaust” wasn’t to establish Israel. That was sealed with the Balfour Declaration during World War 1. Yes, it’s true that Israel wasn’t founded until after World War 2, but they had the Balfour Declaration secured with our without that war. </p>

<p>The true purpose of both World Wars was the establishment of a Federal Europe. Elites in Europe, including an overclass of elite Jews as well as traitorous elite Europeans, had been trying to retake financial control of the USA since losing control of it during the Revolutionary War. They saw the raw amount of land being ruled from one Central Government, all speaking one unified language, and they coveted this for Europe. In 1913, the financial system that already ruled Britain and France sunk its teeth into the USA, through the Federal Reserve Act. There is no coincidence that the Fed went up in 1913 while World War 1 began in 1914. It is also no coincidence that the European Economic Community, (the EEC), which later developed into the European Union, was founded in 1951, just a few short years after World War 2. </p>

<p>So, the short answer is that the World Wars weren’t to create Israel. The countries already under the thrall of elite Jewish international finance, being England, France, and the USA, fought aggressive wars against fellow 1st world countries, all to spread the elites’ money system for them. Central Europe was too strategically important not to control, if you are part of a cabal/network that has designs on Globalism. Germany among many other Central European countries, valued its autarky and independence, and was a productive country. It had no incentive to give up its own sovereign control over Central Europe, which Britain/France/USA/International Finance coveted. So war was required. World War 2 was to create the EU. And I can agree that yes, it also paved the way for the previously agreed upon Balfour Declaration to be executed, delivering Israel. </p>

<p>The Soviets benefit from faking the death camps for two reasons. First, the Bolshevik Soviets were highly Jewish among their top ranks, as were the Polish Communists. Secondly, the Germanics and the Slavs had a longstanding territorial feud, these were peoples who had experienced border friction for generations. Tens of millions of Russians died during the war. They hated and resented Germany, not only did they have a vested interest in protecting the Jewish narrative, but they had a personal interest in the destruction of Germany. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the thorough response.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re to go with the narrative of the Soviets faking the evidence, it seems like they don&#39;t gain much benefit. A centralized Europe is problematic to the Soviets, and in the Middle East right now Israel seems to be a thorn in the side of them and their allies (Syria and Iran.)</p>

<p>Was the issue of the Jews in Central Europe that large, did they miscalculate, or am I missing something?</p>

<p>Then of course there&#39;s the question: if the Soviets faked it, why didn&#39;t the others call them out on it (sort of a reverse Moon Landing question -- which I have my own answer for)?</p>

<p>Just trying to understand the point of view better, so any information is appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, the current version of a centralized Europe would have been problematic for the Soviets. Which is why after World War 2, the Soviets had essentially outlived their usefulness to the Western powers, hence the beginning of the Cold War, and the eventual fall of the USSR. What &quot;we&quot; needed from them was their help in subjugating continental Europe. Also, Stalin purged the Jewish influence from his regime after World War 2, which also was part of triggering the Cold War. </p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t actually an issue of Jews in Central Europe. It was a matter of land, human beings, and a financial/power system that wanted to control those people and that territory. The Jews in Central Europe were the official reason given for conflict, the real reason was Jews OUTSIDE of Central Europe, along with Elites Whites, who had designs on further growing their power base around international finance. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just classic expansionism and imperialism, and Central Europe was the area that wasn&#39;t under control yet. Britain and France came under the control of international finance first. Then the USA and Russia. They had created a ring of controlled territory around Central Europe. And I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever played the Civilization series, a videogame, but nothing is more annoying than foreign territory inside of your sphere of influence. The World Wars were the consolidation of territory in Europe. And since then, they have spread much further and clearly have designs on Globalism, a one world order.</p>

<p>As for why others didn&#39;t call them out, the victors write the history. Many, many people HAVE called them out. For decades. And they are derided as loons, as conspiracy theorists, etc. Too many people have seen the Hollywood movies, too many people have seen the Holocaust Channel, <em>cough</em> I mean History Channel documentaries. Calling them out hasn&#39;t worked, because powerful people, including those in control of the EU and the USA, and the globalist Corporations, have all built a world off this false foundation. They have a vested interest in slandering or discrediting anyone who questions their narrative, because the entire modern world is built around it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if any of that actually addressed your core questions, though.</p>

<li><p>&quot;First casualty of war is the Truth&quot; and &quot;History is written by the Victors&quot;...Therefore, I&#39;m naturally skeptical on what we learn about wars.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Balfour Document</strong> - This was written in 1917, and seemed to be executed based on the events of WWII.  Seems suspicious.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Soviet Union</strong> contributed much worse attrosities during WWII, to their own people, but their people receive much less attention than the Jewish people. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>If it&#39;s the complete truth, why is speaking about the Holocaust illegal in many European countries?</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Israel is an apartheid state and war-state now.</strong>  They&#39;re not necessarily good guys right now.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jews declared war on Germany first.</strong></p></li>
</ol>

<p>All these reasons leave me to doubt the official version of 6 million Jews dying and needing their own new nation to escape and to make amends.  Atrocities probably happened to the Jews, but Atrocities happened to a lot of people during WWII too.</p>

<p>Using terms like &#39;deniers&#39; just shuts down debate.  There are a lot of gray areas.  </p>

<p>Think about it. If the Holocaust didn&#39;t happen, that would mean that all people who said that they witnessed it are liars. And there are literally tens of thousands of witnesses. The <em>only</em> way you can say for sure that they all lied (and not one ever recanted, even decades later) is to say that they all worked together. And the <em>only</em> thing all of these people had in common (victims were from various countries, spoke various languages, and even had various religions as not all Jews follow Judaism) was that they were all Jewish. So essentially, Holocaust Deniers are saying that Jews cannot be trusted. That, no matter what, if a person is Jewish that means you can&#39;t believe them. And to justify that belief and pretend it&#39;s not the bigotry it is, they point to the Holocaust and call it &quot;the Jewish lie&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that you are skeptical about the Holocaust because you &quot;have a hard time trusting Jews who espouse Jewish values&quot;. You&#39;re more than welcome to have that opinion, but I see no way that you can stand by it without immediately discounting 99.99% of all Jews as distrustful. If you want to say that <em>Zionists</em> are distrustful because you distrust Zionist ideology, fine. But you&#39;re logic doesn&#39;t really stand unless you&#39;re willing to admit that you distrust Jews be default.</p>

<p>What I believe is irrelevant. My idea of Jewish values differs from the next guys. If you ask 10 Jews what &quot;Jewish values&quot; mean, I guarantee you ain&#39;t getting less than 15 contradictory answers. That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying: you can&#39;t just throw out the vague term &quot;Jewish ethos&quot; and pretend it&#39;s a good reason for distrusting Jews if there&#39;s no clear definition of it to begin with!</p>

<p>No. It&#39;s a myth invented by 19th century anti-Semites that many Jews took on as a bit of a joke. There&#39;s no phrase &quot;chosen people&quot; in all of the Jewish holy books.

<p>They aren&#39;t? There isn&#39;t even a Jewish lobby, that&#39;s another anti-Semitic myth. Read <em>The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy</em> by John Mearschimer and Stephen Walt.

<p>Let me ask you: presume that all of your statements and beliefs are true. That Jews have undue amounts of power and control over the world&#39;s media and governments. That Jews consider themselves to be a superior race to non-Jews. That Jews have time and again altered history to make themselves look like the victims when they were really the bad guys all along.</p>

<p>What does that mean for you? That Jews should be mistrusted? Discriminated against? Not allowed to vote or hold office? Because that sounds like exactly what you are trying to push for.</p>

The reject the concept of an organized lobby again and again stating quite clearly that there is no unified &quot;Israeli lobby&quot; but rather a loose collection of (mostly Christian) special interest groups.

From now on, when a discussing the etiology of societal corrosion and the Atlas Shrugged ethos, I will specify the widespread ideological underpinnings of &quot;Western liberal Jews&quot; as the dominant influential cultural group found on one side of this reality.</p>

<p>I appreciate that the Boca Raton bagel and lox ladies luncheon club do not represent the views of all Judaica today.   So when a discussion comes about Zionism, I will be sure to specify my disdain for the &quot;Mizra Kibbutz Zionist Jews.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The values of Western liberal Jews are the primary problem due to their actual influence and involvement in global commerce and the commanding heights industry worldwide.   In other words, a corrosive ideology is interwoven into power that makes others suffer on this planet.  With this in mind, it is not difficult to imagine a bedrock of broader resentment of just &quot;Jews&quot; forming in general.  The flagrancy of what Zionism in any capacity is directed at surely doesn&#39;t help this generalization from forming either.</p>

<p>You just said that you distrust Jews. I&#39;m not &quot;phycologizing the topic&quot; (???) I&#39;m just taking things to the logical conclusion. Honestly, where do you people get off?

<p>The best way I can answer this is take a good look at the world.  Jews are doing quite well in general.  93% of the world lives on less than $50 per day.  I am sensitive to the plight of others and deeply appreciate some of the forces that make the world the way it is today.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is undeniable that many Jews were systemically persecuted and murdered by Nazi Germany during WWII.  Only a moron thinks that such a thing was an outright hoax.  However, as a critical thinking student of history, political philosophy, and sociology,  I can appreciate that there is a great deal of distrust (I would argue even pervasive distrust globally) towards Jewish values, the Jewish ethos, zionism, and political Judaism in general.  While this bedrock of distrust is not necessarily unfounded, it can lead to some irrational and/or hasty conclusions about the nature of the holocaust.  Hopefully that helps you understand why.  If you want to understand the nature and origins of this distrust, that is a separate conversation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It exists because the Allies didn&#39;t want to take in a bunch of Jewish refugees, so their solution was to dump them in the desert to keep them busy fighting Muslims. There&#39;s a hefty number of Jewish people opposed to Israel, as according to their beliefs God is the one who is supposed to deliver Jerusalem to the Jews, not the British Government. It exists because TPTB have similar beliefs to the Nazis, hence why many of the worlds richest at the time gave their financial support to Hitler, and why the planned a Fascist coup of the US. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is very difficult to find a mainstream synthesis of this because of the nature of the subject. Most sources will come from holocaust deniers, and are thus open to attack (however well documented the individual facts may be, e.g. of Faurisson or Irving, because of their conclusions most will reject <em>anything</em> they say).</p>

<p>You can however verify this for yourself. Look at the individual claims made in Nuremberg, and then look at what mainstream historians nowadays say. Typical examples include the human lampshades, soap, shrunken heads, etc.</p>

<p>One big red flag I can cite is the example of Dachau. It is now <a href="https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/mobile/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005214">admitted as a mainstream fact</a> no humans were gassed there.</p>
