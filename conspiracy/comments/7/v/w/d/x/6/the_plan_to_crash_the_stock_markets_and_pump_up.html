<p>Here is an additional conspiracy theory: Before Bitcoin crashes, the stock markets around the world will be manipulated to plummet big time, causing a huge scare making investors, big and small, to run to Bitcoin as a rescuer of their sharply falling investments.</p>

<p>That enormous input of investments into Bitcoin will make the price and market cap of bitcoin skyrocket to unbelievably high levels, and after that Bitcoin will crash.</p>

<p>The purpose for such massive financial collapse is to establish a necessary socioeconomic foundation for introducing a new global currency.</p>

<p>I was just thinking about something similar to this.....</p>

<p>Its weird because the ability to &quot;manipulate the market&quot; has always been near impossible because no one person or small group of people have enough money to buy enough shares to completely change things.</p>

<p>But now with the top 1% of the world owning a much larger % of the wealth i would say that has changed alot from 50 yrs ago</p>

<p>They want a centralized global currency controlled by authorities, not a decentralized cryptocurrency like bitcoin. So they need to pump up bitcoin and then make it crash due to technical rather than psychological reasons. This will make people, both laypersons and expert, distrust trustless cryptocurrencies and become prone to accept a centralized digital currency controlled by world authorities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m curious about in what other applications the k1 curve is used. Anyway, the other possibility is that the bitcoin mining algorithm fails in 2018. My idea here is that the hash function SHA-256 used in Bitcoin, which seems to be an excellent hash function nonetheless has a designed limitation so that when the target difficulty reaches a certain level, no block hashes satisfying the target can be found which will stop the mining.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a recent Bitcoin block hash:  0000000000000000005510256987411e13d8c2523dcba10114a70917af9f877b -- <a href="https://blockchain.info/blocks">https://blockchain.info/blocks</a></p>

<p>That&#39;s 18 leading zeros. Let&#39;s say that SHA-256 can&#39;t produce more than 20 leading zeros, then when the Bitcoin target difficulty reaches 21 zeros the mining stops functioning.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, or use SHA3 if SHA512 also has the limitation. But it would be a major disruption in Bitcoin. And to speculate further, the deep state planners have a maneuver for that too, such as causing division in the Bitcoin community for how the hard fork should be done, causing Bitcoin to be split up in many different hard forks and people will lose trust in the whole decentralized cryptocurrency idea.</p>

<p>Sure, but if Bitcoin crashes technically, then it&#39;s fragile like hell. And according to my theory planned to fail and so it is guaranteed to lose, along with the whole decentralized cryptocurrency idea.</p>

<p>People will then trust a centralized digital currency more that is controlled by world authorities.</p>

<p>That&#39;s precisely the point: bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies today are decentralized. The world rulers want a centralized digital currency controlled by world authorities. So they need to make people, both laypersons and experts start to distrust decentralized cryptocurrencies and hence the need for making Bitcoin crash, not only economically but technically.</p>

<p>This will make people willing to accept a centralized world currency since the faith in the competing decentralized cryptocurrencies will be destroyed. Without a Bitcoin crash many people would demand that the new global currency should be decentralized without any centralized authority controlling it. A Bitcoin technical failure opens up an opportunity for having citizens the world over accept a centralized global currency.</p>

<p>Those two articles would then be a recent example of a coordinated manipulation control as a first step downplaying phase. The price of bitcoin drops, but only to be followed later a global stock markets crash and a huge increase in the bitcoin price according to my theory.</p>

<p>So one prediction is that later on in 2018 mainstream news articles will change tune and start to describe how good bitcoin is as an investment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. And my theory is that it will be a planned burning down of Bitcoin, the new competitor to fiat currencies. Satoshi was then likely a deep state group of crypto experts deliberately designing Bitcoin to fail in 2018 by predicting and controlling the overall hashing power or by breaking elliptic curve cryptography at a certain date.</p>

<p>The Bitcoin community may seem robust today, but notice the difficulty the community has when trying to implement new changes to Bitcoin. If a crash of the Bitcoin system happens on a technical level, then even if the Bitcoin community quickly can do a hard fork into a new system (which may be trickier than it sounds) then the deep state can cause division in the community leading to indecision and resulting in others doing all kinds of Bitcoin hard forks making people lost their trust in decentralized cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>And how will the deep state cause division in the Bitcoin community? Obviously most efficiently by already having their own people inside the community in leading/influential positions.</p>

<p>With the major threat to centralized financial control, Bitcoin, eliminated, the international deep state then have the opportunity to lay the groundwork for a centralized global digital currency and having the general public accept the idea since the decentralized cryptocurrency path has been burned to ashes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I def don&#39;t see many investors getting anywhere near crypto-currency. I was yelling from the rooftops in January of last year for everyone to buy Ether at $10. Only a couple of my friends listened but they thank me almost everyday, lol. Most people are way too scared about it&#39;s volatility and they don&#39;t understand it. 
Ethereum is the much safer play and is so much more than a crypto-currency. Most people don&#39;t even know what it is and I prefer it that way. </p>

<p>Bitcoin is dead in my book and I def don&#39;t see much of a future with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Ethereum sucks. What is it used for? Decentralized automated organizations? I think that the form of smart contracts Ethereum provides are insufficient for real practical applications in general.</p>

<p>And as a decentralized computing platform Ethereum sucks even worse, since the code for the smart contracts has to be computed with incredible redundancy.</p>
