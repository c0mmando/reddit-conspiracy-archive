<p>there&#39;s no one in DNC which stands a chance, more black americans are approving of trump. his SOTU speech had 75% approval rating, I really dont see anyway the decimated dnc has any hope what so ever in 2020 and I&#39;m an ex-dem.</p>

<p>I&#39;m saying that on it&#39;s face, it seems incredibly shady that someone would pay for information and then feed information to whatever person or group was gathering that information - supposedly per the Grassley-Graham memo, Steele was getting his info, at least indirectly from Sidney Blumenthal. </p>

<p>So it&#39;s like laundering bad or at least questionable dirt through someone with a good name because they&#39;re basically doing with intelligence what they did with mortgage backed investments - using trusted people/sources to forward bad data to a fool a consumer of that data. But instead of buyers of terrible investments, it&#39;s the FBI (who might have also looked the other way purposefully / been complicit) and FISA judges handing away the communications of a political campaign.</p>

<p>Why does that matter? </p>

<p>Also Steele did not get it from Clinton&#39;s people. Steele got it from a State department official, who got it from someone who is a friend of the Clintons, who says he got it from another source.</p>

<p>The dossier wasn&#39;t used to convict anyone. It only needs to raise questions that give a reasonable suspicion to acquire a warrant for more investigation.</p>

<p>If a questionable source raises the potential of treason you investigate further no?</p>

<p>&quot;When you hear who the source, one of the sources of that information is, you&#39;re going to think, &#39;Oh, my gosh, I&#39;ve heard that name somewhere before. Where could it possibly have been?&#39;&quot; Gowdy replied.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Asked whether it was a foreign source, the South Carolina Republican said it was domestic.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m trying to think of how Secretary Clinton defined him. I think she said he was an old friend who emailed her from time to time,&quot; Gowdy said.</p>

<p>Asked whether it was Blumenthal, Gowdy said: &quot;That would be really warm. You&#39;re warm.&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps, if that was the info he gave them then probably. You are purely speculating on what happened at this point though. I&#39;m excited for it all to come out so we can understand what happened better.</p>

<p>You talking about the idea that a friend of Hillary claims to have gotten info from an undisclosed source, gave that info to the state department, and then Steele got it?</p>

<p>It depends on what the information was and if he just accepted or verified it outside of that source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;ll have the Schiff memo soon enough and we can see what that side has to say about that particular footnote. I&#39;ve heard a Democrat congressman from California, not Schiff but I&#39;m too lazy to google, say on a talk show that they masked the names. But again, it will come to light.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t referring to the laundering of tips done by Blumenthal and Steele. I was referring to several key members of the FBI/DOJ perjuring themselves on the FISA applications and renewals when they swore they were presenting the FISC with credible evidence. </p>

<p>If he DID verify it, maybe you have a point. But I&#39;m not so sure it was verified. And if it was verifiable why would they need to give the unsolicited intelligence to Steele? Why couldn&#39;t Blumenthal or whomever it was within the Clinton camp just give the FBI the tips themselves? Why the third party?</p>

<p>It appears that nothing was verified regarding the dossier, aside from the Yahoo article that Steele planted to verify his own work. It appears that the FBI/DOJ, rather than practicing due diligence, relied on Steele&#39;s credibility. Despite Steele being fired from the FBI in late October 2016 for disclosing shit to the media the FBI continued to rely on his word alone. Perjury is a very real crime.</p>

<p>We still don&#39;t know what was on the warrant. It also doesn&#39;t seem you&#39;re including the fact Page was a known collaborator from back in 2013.</p>

<p>Indeed we will get the Schiff memo (assuming Trump releases it) but why would they mask the names on the FISA warrant? I won&#39;t claim to be an expert but isn&#39;t that open to classified information?</p>

<p>Or if it was masked wasn&#39;t the point of the warrant to unmask the names and find out who was talking to? This has been spun around so many times I admit I get lost on what specific thing is supposed to be treason by whom today.</p>

<p>The FBI/DOJ masked the Clinton campaign/DNC on the FISA application. I think maybe you&#39;ve misunderstood my earlier point. </p>

<p>There is ridiculous spin out there. I promise you, if your only watching one source your being naive to believe your getting the full picture. I truly believe there will be a spring cleaning in the FBI/DOJ. It&#39;s already begun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I see where you are going.  Are you saying that Steele... a guy with 22 years at MI6, the guy who was heading the Russia desk in 2006, who has cultivated 30 years of sources in Russia, who is widely respected by the intelligence community ... was simply parroting information fed to him by Sidney Blumenthal?  That this was the sum total of what he accomplished?  It is amazing to me the lengths to which people are going to stretch the bounds of credulity to cover for this president.  If there is no &quot;there&quot; there, then let it play out.  Are you worried that this perceived bias is somehow going to manifest itself into false evidence?  Carter Page is a known quantity.  Funny how they attempt to impugn Steele&#39;s credibility but fail to mentino that in testimony to the House Intelligence Committee Carter Page himself corroborated items in Steele&#39;s memos.  </p>

<p>Yep. If they could get foreign spies to make up some shit about a pee pee tape for Trump, why couldn&#39;t they get someone to say something similar about Bernie Sanders? If you defend Trump being spied on inappropriately like this, you guarantee Trump will do the same. It&#39;s like people forget that the hated asshole they&#39;re OK with being illegally spy on is actually the president now. </p>
