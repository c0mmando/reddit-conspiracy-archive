Now the circulatory news about a car sent into space distracts, how can they track a car but not a billion dollar high tech space craft? When asked about the satellite, The Pentagon deflects to Space X, who claims everything was good on their end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, but all top secret launches are tracked. They can&#39;t stop them.  </p>

<p>For example, NROL-76 is in a 390x409km orbit at a 50<sup>o</sup> inclination. How do I know that despite that being classified information? Well, it&#39;s because some amateur guy on the ground found it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I want to know is why they cut off footage of the camera facing deep space. I saw no stars or anything. A journalist asked Elon Musk how long they would be able to transmit footage of space before they lose connection, and he completely deflected the question, choosing to talk about his emotions and Hot Wheels instead. Like none of these honchos can take our requests seriously. They willfully maintain a monopoly on the knowledge of what goes on in space, always subtly deflecting questions that demand transparency. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The light overwhelms what the camera can see, especially when it#s reflecting of the Earth. You&#39;d need a far longer shutter opening time, or it&#39;s equivalent in digital terms, to see the stars, but all that light drowns them out. </p>

<p>Usually when you see those incredible photos of a star-laden sky at night it&#39;s from a time-lapse photograph, where the shutter is left open for as long as possible to get as much light in as it can.</p>
