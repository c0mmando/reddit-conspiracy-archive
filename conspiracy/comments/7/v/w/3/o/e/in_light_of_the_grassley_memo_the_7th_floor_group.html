        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/370918981/2018-02-06-CEG-LG-to-DOJ-FBI-Unclassified-Steele-Referral#">Grassley memo</a>,</p>

<p>...on page 2, it says that the FBI filed its first warrant application under FISA for Carter Page on October 21, 2016.</p>

<p>...on page 6, &quot;One memorandum by Mr. Steele that was not published by Buzzfeed is dated October 19, 2016...Mr. Steele&#39;s memorandum states that his company &quot;received this report from [redacted] US State Department...&quot;</p>

<p>If we hearken back to October 2016, particularly the week of October 15 through 21, what else was going on that week? </p>

<p>October 15: Assange internet cut</p>

<p>October 15: Todd &amp; Clare attempt to <a href="https://www.toddandclare.com/datinglife/online-dating/category/julian-assange/">smear</a> Assange as a pedophile. </p>

<p>October 16: Wikileaks tweets three &quot;precommittment hashes&quot; one of which is labeled <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/787777344740163584">&quot;John Kerry&quot;</a></p>

<p>October 16: John Kerry <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/john-kerry-takes-syria-aleppo-talks-to-london-vladimir-putin-russia/">arrives in London</a></p>

<p>October 17: 7th Floor Group aka &quot;shadow government&quot; exposed, a wikipedia created and very shortly thereafter, <a href="https://wearechange.org/who-wikipedia-fbi-deletes-7th-floor-group/">deleted by the FBI</a>. Note that John Kerry is a member of the 7th Floor Group. </p>

<p>October 21: Wikileaks tweets <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks/status/789582613132480514">&quot;The Obama administration should not have attempted to misuse its instruments of state to stop criticism of its ruling party candidate.&quot;</a></p>

<p>What was the extent of the 7th Floor Group&#39;s involvement in the conspiracy to coronate HRC? I wonder if they, rather than the FBI were the prime movers in the attempt to create the Russian collusion narrative? I wonder if the 7th Floor Group were concerned that Assange might have information that would instantly debunk the narrative they were attempting to weave, and therefore attempted to shut him up in any way possible?</p>

<p>If you were the part of one of the most powerful regimes in the world, would you fear someone who thinks like this, perhaps consider it a glimpse of his gameplan?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“To radically shift regime behavior we must think clearly and boldly for if we have learned anything, it is that regimes do not want to be changed. We must think beyond those who have gone before us, and discover technological changes that embolden us with ways to act in which our forebears could not. Firstly we must understand what aspect of government or neocorporatist behavior we wish to change or remove. Secondly we must develop a way of thinking about this behavior that is strong enough carry us through the mire of politically distorted language, and into a position of clarity. Finally must use these insights to inspire within us and others a course of ennobling, and effective action.”</p>

<p>Julian Assange, <a href="https://cryptome.org/0002/ja-conspiracies.pdf">“State and Terrorist Conspiracies”</a> (pdf warning)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wikileaks is absolutely central to the Russian Conspiracy narrative, and yet, has Assange been interviewed by any of the investigators? How often have you heard the legacy media mention Wikileaks throughout this process? Not too much, eh? Seems like they avoid the subject at all costs, except to allege without proof that Russia supplied their intel.</p>

<p>Other points to note - at the current State Department, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-state-department-vacancies/">seven of nine top jobs are empty</a>. And those remaining are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/26/politics/state-department-employees-hire-attorneys-political-retribution/index.html">lawyering up</a>. If the Obama State Department is implicated in being the originators of the conspiracy to frame Trump/Russian collusion, how much of a threat is that to the Obama legacy? Is preserving that legacy a priority for Congress, or at least some faction therein? </p>

<p>There&#39;s a good chance they already know why he was there, though, considering the US government originally <a href="https://www.alternet.org/grayzone-project/us-denied-entry-craig-murray">barred him from entry</a> that same month (without stating any reason), until public backlash forced them to let him in.</p>

<p>Murray suggested that the Podesta emails came from an American leak as well. So much squirming in ye old can o&#39; worms - mustn&#39;t crack the lid.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scott Horton then asked, “Is it fair to say that you’re saying that the Podesta leak came from inside the intelligence services, NSA [the electronic spying National Security Agency] or another agency?”</p>

<p>“I think what I said was certainly compatible with that kind of interpretation, yeah,” Murray responded. “In both cases they are leaks by Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I remember the Todd and Clare debacle, had no idea they were still running a site.

    <div class="md"><p>To me, the most interesting questions about Todd and Clare are <em>why</em> was their payment to Assange for the ad supposed to come from the Russian government, and <em>how the hell did they pull that off</em>? </p>

<p>That seems to show 1) an interest in artificially creating a financial paper trail between WikiLeaks and Russia, and 2) a strong enough connection with the Russian government to pull that off. Totally bizarre, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &#39;why&#39; is obvious, as you say it was a trap. The &#39;how&#39;, no idea. Who&#39;s to say it even was Russian govt money? Only requirement is that assange thought it was, if he takes it they just leak the email exchange and he gets got. </p>

<p>The other question I had at the time was &#39;who&#39; - as in &#39;who the fuck thought this would work?&#39; Whole thing just seemed dumb. My grandma wouldn&#39;t have fallen for it, never mind paranoid exiled intel broker assange.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;how&quot; question makes the &quot;why&quot; question more interesting, though. Does even Russia want us to think WikiLeaks is Russian propaganda? Or are we talking smaller-scale infiltration of the Russian government by the US or some other party -- in which case, what other implications could that have? Or maybe it was just a bluff, with the email itself intended as the evidence like you suggeat -- could be.</p>

<p>It is quite a fascinating mystery, though. Especially because of how hamfisted it was. But I guess the election put them in a time crunch. Guccifer 2.0 is another good example of a hamfisted attempt to link WikiLeaks and Russia that doesn&#39;t hold up to even a little scrutiny.</p>

<p>Just answer me one little thing: Why was the entire moderator team of r/Wikileaks replaced during the week in question?</p>

<p>Looks like a conspiracy doesn&#39;t it? Maybe that might help you realise why I didn&#39;t have a source for that.

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/about/moderators">https://www.reddit.com/r/WikiLeaks/about/moderators</a> -- all of one moderator dates to that week. Three have been there for 4 or more years. </p>

<p>I realize why you lack such a source. It doesn&#39;t exist. He wouldn&#39;t say that because it would be dumb. It would mean all they&#39;d have to do to convince fans he&#39;s dead is compromise his PGP key somehow, which would be a lot easier than actually killing him.</p>

<p>Remember <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/julian-assange-just-read-bitcoin-block-hash-prove-alive/">this part of his AMA</a>, where he read off the most recent bitcoin blockchain hash? Gonna guess that doesn&#39;t count to you, because reasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said entire legal team. That was a lie. Have certain WikiLeaks lawyers died under mysterious circumstances? Yes. John Jones and Michael Ratner both come to mind, although &quot;foremost&quot; is certainly debatable, and both died well before you allege Julian Assange was killed. Their deaths should be investigated thoroughly. It certainly is conceivable that their deaths had something to do with WikiLeaks, especially in the case of Jones, who was killed by a train but was declared not a suicide. But it certainly does not follow that that was to preemptively cover for secretly assassinating Assange 6 months later. That&#39;s absurd.</p>

<p>And I guess you&#39;re just going to ignore the fact that Assange <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/05/19/sweden-drops-julian-assange-rape-investigation/">gave a statement from the embassy balcony</a> in front of a large audience, caught on video from multiple angles, after Sweden dropped the case? You&#39;re cherrypicking bits and pieces and misrepresenting the situation quite blatantly. You are pushing an agenda that <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/01/mother-julian-assange-speaks-stop-spreading-propaganda-situation/">Christine Assange specifically called out</a> as anti-WikiLeaks trolling that furthers a US State Department and Deep State war against WikiLeaks. I&#39;m sure some people are buying your persistent nonsense, or you probably wouldn&#39;t still be at it, but I&#39;m going to keep calling it what it is: blatantly misleading propaganda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any timeline of WikiLeaks and Julian Assange should include the release of private messages between WikiLeaks and Donald Trump Jr. where WL worked with the Donald Trump campaign to create an illusion of transparency and objectivity. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>involvement in the conspiracy to coronate HRC?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, the NY FBI was known as &quot;Trumplandia.&quot; They held back the Anthony Weiner computer for more than three weeks to get closer to the election, then handed it off to DC without having done any work to find out about those emails. Peter Strzok of the NY FBI narrated a letter for Comey to hand to the investigators in Congress who promptly leaked that to the press. Nearly all accounts say this is when HRC&#39;s poll numbers dropped.</p>

<p>Also, Deep State Rudy Guiliani, &quot;Mr. 9-11,&quot; said just before the Comey letter was released that a big surprise was coming from the NY FBI, and he knew from his contacts with current and former FBI employees/</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wikileaks is absolutely central to the Russian Conspiracy narrative</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not really. WL may be central to an investigation of illegal campaign activities. Russian &quot;collusion&quot; not required, although it it possible.</p>

<p>The Russian conspiracy &quot;narrative&quot; has been built rather solidly with no fewer than nine top Donald Trump campaign members known for sure to be involved in contacts with Russians connected to the Vladimir Putin administration or directly to Russian officials. At this date, denying such contacts and the potential for illegal acts -- especially with four charged and two convicted of related crimes -- is unsupportable fact denials.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>to allege without proof that Russia supplied their intel.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While I too am suspicious of the information provided due to both its highly technical and manipulable nature, the intelligence agencies in a position to know claim Russian involvement. </p>

<p>Why would anyone believe these &quot;deep state&quot; intelligence agencies? Probably because it was the &quot;deep state&quot; that said Iraq had no WMDs, while the Republican politicians said otherwise. Today, we have the same thing -- intelligence saying Russian involvement, (most) Republicans claiming otherwise. There is no basis to trust the politicians over the intelligence agencies. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>has Assange been interviewed by any of the investigators?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good question. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is preserving that legacy a priority for Congress</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely not. The Republican Senate in particular pledges to oppose Barack Obama on all legislation no matter what. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too many links but let&#39;s just take your first one. The deep state in the Bill Moyers article was under the direction of the Republican politicians. Man, does that ruin your meme. Once again, as usual and as I said, the politicians are the ones in charge, not some nefarious &quot;deep state&quot; -- at least not in that case.</p>

<p>The deep state described in the second article is not a renegade intelligence service, but rather a combination of public and private power.  Further, these are all headed by appointees of the politicians -- once again showing that Republicans are in charge of the deep state -- not the other way around:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Deep State does not consist of the entire government. It is a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies: the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department.</p>

<p>Trump will start following foreign policy set by the DOD and intelligence, which he has, or Trump will go down.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He has been doing this since taking office, and even before then, most of it he had already agreed to -- pushing toward war with North Korea and wanting to eliminate the Iran peace deal TO FINISH the  PNAC agenda. Donald Trump is a Republican partisan in just about every way. The only significant possible exception I see is the &quot;build the wall&quot; thing. Even his schizophrenic stance on Russia is not credible. He is as much against Russia as he is for it -- sort of like Ronald Reagan was with Saddam Hussein. We&#39;ve seen all of this before.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bill Clinton was impeached. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not on any of the many investigation avenues going on in the first five or so years. Your deep state Republicans got him on something entirely different -- and they did so with their oligarch funded MSM talk radio shock troops and the &quot;vast right wing conspiracy&quot; lawsuit practically forcing Bill Clinton to misrepresent the situation. It took an insider mole to provide the infamous evidence, the blue dress. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Trump is not going down. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All you have are one-sided counterpoints in your need to protect Donald Trump. You just flat ignored everything that might be unfavorable to Donald Trump -- every last thing. If you go back to my first comment, you will see that I took a fairer, more two sided approach. At this point, it&#39;s just an argument against a total partisan. You are not looking for a conversation. </p>

<p>You should not just take the first one, as it is not meant to be a representative sample in the manner that you want it to be.  The Iran-Contra scandal was one episode, among several that &#39;deep politics&#39; became exposed.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The deep state described in the second article is not a renegade intelligence service, but rather a combination of public and private power.</p>

<p>It literally names the following agencies:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is a hybrid of national security and law enforcement agencies: the Department of Defense, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department. I also include the Department of the Treasury because of its jurisdiction over financial flows, its enforcement of international sanctions and its organic symbiosis with Wall Street.</p>

<p>Further, these are all headed by appointees of the politicians -- once again showing that Republicans are in charge of the deep state -- not the other way around:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It shows nothing of the kind, rather it argues that there is a bipartisan group-think  enforced through private and public institutions.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t disagree with the general trust of your argument, however,  Clinton was favored to win, and Trump made everyone in these circles panic with advocated detente with Russia, had anti-NATO rhetoric, and de-escalated Syrian operations somewhat.   I am not going to pretend that the deep state is some kind of monolith.  There are obviously different factions, with some favoring Trump, while some opposing.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>All you have are one-sided counterpoints in your need to protect Donald Trump. </p>

<p>I am not protecting Donald Trump.  I am not a supporter.  I am an opponent of  agencies and actors that undermine an elected representative, and that spy and run counterinsurgency like operations on dissident movements.  Whether you like it or not,  there is a lot more evidence that Clapper, Brennon, Comey and other members of the Obama administration violated constitutional rights of American citizens.   Maybe you don&#39;t care because you are a democratic hack, but I care because the political movements I belong too have been actively suppressed by this national security state, starting with the Palmer raids. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is no need for this type of comment.  You want to claim that the root of the problem is the Republican party, I disagree.  The root of the problem is the national security state that emerged after WWII, that is unaccountable and has been wrecking lives domestically and abroad. </p>

<p>Donald Trump stole the election with the help of the deep state. There is no significant deep state trying to remove him -- the larger, more powerful and more effective deep state is the one that got him in in the first place. And it wasn&#39;t just deep state - it was vote cheating that goes back to the 2000 election.</p>

<p>But that is what you did, you tried to dismiss &#39;deep state&#39; theory by stating, look at these Republican hacks that are articulating it.  Therefore anyone who articulates it is either being duped or is themselves a Republican hack.   You poisoned the well.   Furthermore,  articulation of a theory because of political incentive, does not entail that that framework is wrong, nor that the political incentive is unjustified. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I explained in my first comment, Republicans in and out of the FBI gamed the election to cheat for Donald Trump.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think this conclusion can be supported, at best it was the case that the FBI was in deep turmoil about how the Clinton investigation was handled,  hence why Comey had to come out with the letter stating the investigation is being reopened, due to the new emails recovered on the Weiner laptop. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t believe this stuff. Did you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe claims made by either Republican or Democrat presidential candidates.  However, my belief is not relevant to what the sectors of the deep state believed, and they had Trumps rhetoric to go by. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Donald Trump stole the election with the help of the deep state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am very open for us to have a through investigation of electoral fraud.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no significant deep state trying to remove him -- the larger, more powerful and more effective deep state is the one that got him in in the first place. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here I disagree fundamentally with you.  Brennan, Clapper, Comey  all worked to undermine Trump, and as this case is making clear, the 5 eyes through Steele and Australian intelligence are cooperating.    </p>

<p>If you are interested in why I think the deep state did not want Trump, watch this interview with Abby Martin.   I agree with her assessment. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qKrPPv2ErY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qKrPPv2ErY</a></p>

<p>Now, I don&#39;t think there is evidence to support that Trump was a beneficiary of a rigged election, but as I stated, I am more then happy to support an independent investigation into election, and voter fraud.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The very people who gave us 9-11 and the Iraq War have now fooled people like you into believing that they are the ones who oppose the deep state.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t think they oppose the deep state as evidence by the fact that the 702 section got re-authorized.  However, I do think that the deep state is deeply fractured currently, and that is an opportunity for anyone who is against the surveillance state, to expose secret courts, secret laws and shine a light on this issue a little bit.   The very fact that the concept of the deep state is normalized is a small victory. </p>

<p>Seems to me that your whole point is to distract from the very real evidence of gaming the election by the &quot;deep state&quot; as you continue to support Donald Trump as if he were against the deep state. </p>

<p>While you are claiming you don&#39;t support Donald Trump, you completely overlook or deny the long history of Republicans messing with elections to help their party -- which was on full display again in 2016, AND you deny any Russian connections despite many DJT campaign officials admitting it out of their own mouths. Did you call me a partisan hack? ROFL</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your first article does not support your claim, especially how it was advised not to make the investigation public, and how language was changed to diminish Clinton malfeasance.    It supports the fact that there was deep division within the FBI about how the Clinton investigation was handled. </p>

<p>Your second article also provides stronger support for that thesis as it states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are lots of people who don’t think Trump is qualified, but also believe Clinton is corrupt,” the source said. “What you hear a lot is that it’s a bad choice, between an incompetent and a corrupt politician.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As does your third article, notice how they all have something in common, they state that people in the FBI were not satisfied with how Comey handled the Clinton investigation.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Seems to me that your whole point is to distract from the very real evidence of gaming the election by the &quot;deep state&quot; as you continue to support Donald Trump as if he were against the deep state.</p>

<p>Well then not only is your perception about what was going on in the FBI skewed,  but so is your understanding of what I am stating. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>To reiterate the point that was made, I don&#39;t think there is evidence for this claim, but I support an independent investigation into voter and electoral fraud.   Calling for the intelligence agencies to intervene with the electoral collage included. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>AND you deny any Russian connections despite many DJT campaign officials admitting it out of their own mouths</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t deny &#39;connections&#39; as that is a propaganda term, that you are using because of its vagueness.    There are plenty of connections.  What I deny is that Trump and the Russian government worked together to undermine Clinton, and to help Trump win.  I deny that they hacked the DNC, and I deny that wikileaks is a Russian agent.    All of these are smears by intelligence agencies and the Clinton campaign and supporters. </p>

<p>The point is that there was deep division in the FBI because of the way that the Clinton investigation was handled.  In order to pacify the FBI internally, Comey had to reopen the investigation.   I don&#39;t think there is a lot of evidence that this was a deciding factor against Clinton.  She won the popular vote, as her acolytes never get tired of saying...</p>

<p>No, I am supporting an elected official against un-elected entities that basically ran a domestic regime change operation.  I don&#39;t care who that elected official is, but I do care about the national security state being exposed and having its power curtailed.  Just for an example, the critique of the FISC itself, was hidden, but now is entering the political discourse.  This is a good turn of events. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The &quot;domestic regime change operation&quot; already took place.</p>

<p>In 2000, it was the 5-4 Supreme Court.</p>

<p>In 2004, it was the delivery of Ohio to GWB.</p>

<p>In 2012, it was the attempt to hack the election in Ohio but apparently Anonymous intervened and blocked the hack. Karl Rove had his famous &quot;meltdown&quot; on TV and Obama got a second term.</p>

<p>Since then, it has been the new voter ID laws, the moving of polling places, the CrossCheck voter purge system, the hyper partisan gerrymandering, the consolidated media, etc.</p>

<p>In 2016, there were all those things, plus the NY FBI Trumplandia Comey fiasco that you see differently.</p>

<p>It&#39;s funny how you and I are both concerned about a &quot;regime change operation,&quot; but you see it as the person in the White House as the target, and I see it as the person who got into the White House being the third time an election was gamed. History is very informative.</p>

<p>We can probably both agree that Russian collusion is not the centerpiece of the situation -- except that I say there probably is some while you completely deny it.</p>

<p>Things have changed a lot since 1958. Today, more than since the 1920&#39;s, corporations and wealthy people are in change again. After the attempted coup in 1934-35, things quieted down for a while. But by the 1960&#39;s, a strain of oligarchy began to get its act together, culminating in the election of Ronald Reagan.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, whether Donald Trump is removed or not, this entire series of events has set this nation back just as much as 9-11 did. </p>

<p>Donald Trump will either continue his reactionary policies, or the next person in line will. That&#39;s too bad for all of us and good for the plutocrats. :(</p>

<p>I see a US citizen, Christopher Page, that was surveilled on based on political opposition research, and I see an elected representative that is being undermined by the national security apparatus, and political opponents. </p>

<p>On the rest of your post, I am in general agreement with you, except I do not share your liberal nostalgia.   Especially on the immediate post war period, and the creation of the national security state.    I see the general trend of this country the same as you do, except I do not think that the Democratic party is a bulwark, it is an accomplice.      If you have netflix, check out Oliver Stone&#39;s, &quot;Untold History of the United States&quot;, especially on the immediate postwar period.  I think it will help disillusion you about the nature of the Democratic party.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Liberal nostagia.&quot; That is a very strange term, one that should not exist. </p>

<p>We saw general progress in the years that Democrats had control. It did not happen because Democrats were not &quot;complicit&quot; nor because they were some kind of &quot;bulwark&quot; -- it happened because they were pressured by people to actually do some opposition to oligarchy -- and because some of them were authentic supporters of the people. Democrats are responsible for nearly everything in government that helped the people. Nearly everything. That is a huge difference. </p>

<p>So, you say we need to get rid of the spying state and the wars, but how do you propose to do that?</p>

<p>As things were improving in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s, that gave people the tools to push to fix more. Progress was being made. Wars and spying are very important and both parties do them (one more than the other, but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll disagree), but it is easier to stand up against these when we are not fight for food, and when we are not involved in identity group division. Democrats did a very good job fixing the food issue (which has since reversed), and they were working on the identity group issues. Ronald Reagan ended that.</p>

<p>There has been exactly one time that the government went after the &quot;deep state.&quot; That was in the late 1970s under a Democratic Congress and Jimmy Carter. Many of the conspiracies we discuss here were exposed during these post-Watergate years. Then Ronald Reagan came in and that ended. Things move slowly. Look at the trends. When Democrats held the bulk of power, we made progress. Once Republicans gained the bulk of power, things went backward. You can draw a clear line: 1981.</p>

<p>Yeah, like ending welfare, deregulating the telecommunications industry, doing away with banking regulation, expanding NATO, bombing the Balkans, passing a neoliberal health care plan, opposing single payer, introducing the first version of the patriot act in the 90&#39;s, passing the Iraq Liberation Act in 98, passing the National Security Act, and on and on it goes.

<p>Look at the wages versus productivity graph. There were a few spasms in the late 1970&#39;s but it was after the Ronald Reagan tax cuts that the two lines separated permanently. Did you ever happen to notice that every recession occurred under Republicans except the 1979 one? And that one was caused by oil companies colluding to raise prices.</p>

<p>Still on this one, huh? I think that the outrage we saw from Joe Biden and John Kirby probably occurred because they knew at the time that Donald Trump was gaming the election, but they were not willing or able to mention exactly what they knew. They looked just terrible. </p>

<p>Republicans would never do a thing like that. Republicans will do anything to get back into power.

<p>Lying about wars before the election as per Richard Nixon and Donald Trump, interveining in foreign policy as per Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, you name it.</p>

<p>Republicans have utter contempt for democracy of any kind, and they are purely a party of oligarchy going all the way back to people like Rutherford Hayes and William McKinley, whose election stories are very dirty.</p>

<p>Let me clue you in on something very simple again: the Republican Party cannot be expected to ever represent the people when they spend so much time undermining our right to vote.</p>

<p>There is no chance whatsoever that Republicans will reform the system to benefit the people. This is shown at the very outset when all they want to do is cheat on elections. And it&#39;s all downhill from there.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need to argue this point to me, I agree with you about the Republicans.    I think FDR did great by taking on the industrialists and bankers, it is just that I disagree with the imperial policy that was starting to be shaped under him.    The Deep State ended up being finalized with the passage of the National Security Act of 1947.   Since then the MIC, DOD, the Intelligence apparatus,  and capital both finance and industrial has been running this country and has been setting the trajectory. It has done this through both parties. </p>

<p>I keep on referencing Glennon to you. He does not think there is some kind of sinister force, or people planning in secret, he argues that this &#39;double government&#39; was the necessary outcome of how we structure our political institutions.   If you are don&#39;t want to seriously pursue this topic because you don&#39;t buy it, I recommend just watching this talk he gave on the subject.  I know video is more engaging then text. </p>

<p>Strategically, I think you are making a mistake.   Any cracks that either party causes should be exploited by us.   If the Republicans want to go after FISA and FISC because of political incentive, let them.  We should push for more.   If they want to expose corruption in the intelligence community and the FBI,  I say go for it, even if it is motivated by political reasons.   It is a mistake to a priori denounce such moves, and it certainly is a mistake to automatically defend the Democrats and the Obama leftovers. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is great. I want to shed a little light on this whole paragraph because I think it is a huge part of the PSYOP. This should really make you think:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Republican party was at war with Trump. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it appeared, and so it fed into the &quot;outsider&quot; illusion. When Donald Trump went after Jeb Bush during the debate, who wasn&#39;t cheering? I know I was. But then what was Donald Trump really thinking? It could have been revealed by noting that DJT said he voted for GWB in 2004 despite the war &quot;disaster&quot; because he liked the tax cuts. That is very telling. But it didn&#39;t make the big echo chamber.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the primaries it was obvious that they wanted Jeb, but Trump outmaneuvered them, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, we are relying on the claims of Republicans. Do we trust Republicans to tell us what is really on their minds? I know I don&#39;t. The corporate media whose stockholders in control just also happen to be the same people and institutions that control nearly all of large corporations provided Donald Trump with billions of dollars in free publicity - -positive publicity as they let him talk live on the TV uninterrupted hundreds of times. That&#39;s the best advertising you can get. </p>

<p>Second, there were 19 people in the primaries. Many of them appeared to be somewhat interchangeable <em>in comparison</em> to Donald Trump. Donald Trump was the odd man out. ANYONE should have been able to tell right away that DJT was favored to win -- that his victory against such a large set of familiar opponents was virtually inevitable for the obvious reason that Donald Trump opponents would be split. I assure you, Republicans saw this right from the beginning. </p>

<p>Recently, the Koch brothers threatened Republicans with a lack of funding should they not pass the tax cuts. This same method could have been used in 2016 to get rid of most of the candidates and provide a chance that DJT would not win the primaries. But they didn&#39;t. Are we to believe this was an accident?</p>

<p>bottom line: they could have kept DJT out of the media the way they did with Bernie Sanders, and they could have made it harder for DJT to win the primaries. They did neither.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>with a lot of help from the Clinton campaign and their Pied Piper strategy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hillary Clinton was fooled as were many others. Personally, I thought DJT had the best chance to win, but I was pretty alone. Only a few others were saying that. Those who were should be given high marks for analysis now. Those who were not should be scrutinized on their future predictions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Neocons like Frum and Krisol were openly talking about switching to Hillary, you remember those PNAC characters? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>What better way to give Hillary the kiss of death than to have some of the most notable neocons endorse her? And what could she do, refuse them? This was absolutely brilliant -- Republicans literally supporting HRC to make her look bad. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think that both parties were internally fragmented last election. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was a core of Republicans who wanted DJT in and who worked for him, and as time went by, others started coming along. Despite the anti-Trump rhetoric, behind the scenes many were working <em>for</em> him. They stepped up the attacks on the voting system -- armed with the recent 5-4 SCOTUS decision on the Voting Rights Act and milked it for all it was worth.</p>

<p>I would not be surprised if Republicans, who were in control of the voting apparatus in many states, cheated <em>for</em> HRC -- because one thing was for sure -- they were all against Bernie Sanders.</p>

<p>Why would Republicans want DJT in? Because he would pursue their agenda for the most part, and when it is over, they will not look so reactionary -- they would become moderates. What a great way to repair their reputation and the stink of GWB has not been shaken. </p>

<p>At the same time, we see the people giving GWB a 51 percent favorable rating. That is incredible. DJT has rehabilitated GWB into positive territory. Also, as already mentioned, we now have Democrats becoming reactionary too by supporting corporate media and intelligence agencies. Whatever happens to DJT, the paradigm ends much further to the right for both parties!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The media has completely ignored this aspect. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even now, for the most part, MSM picks up on DJT&#39;s outrageous comments and his character, but not so much on his policies. Have you heard much this week about North Korea? That should be the top story. By catering to this stalemate of Trump outrage and identity groups, MSM is advancing the Republican agenda, even while appearing to oppose DJT.</p>

<p>Now, you have some serious food for thought i hope ...</p>

My impression was that Jeb was the pick, he was not getting traction, and that the media started giving free coverage to Trump, so much so that they rather show an empty Trump podium that show Sanders.

<p>Concerning Clinton,  she did win the popular vote.  Obama stated no one is messing with our elections.  Now I am certainly open to the possibility that this was not true, but we need some good evidence.  DJT did not rehabilitate Bush, &#39;The Resistance&quot; did.  </p>

<p>I think I included it. The obvious fact that DJT was the stand out, and Republicans had the power to reduce his chances. It&#39;s like the Emperor&#39;s New Clothes. It&#39;s so obscenely obvious that I&#39;m surprised I don&#39;t hear it more. </p>

<p>He was wrong. It appears that Democrats just thought they would win and so they did not want to get into this whole mess until after the election. Can you imagine what would have happened if Obama or Hillary started saying Trump was trying to steal the election? Would that have helped anything? It was either idiocy or complicity that they countered DJT&#39;s accusations by saying basically it&#39;s not possible. As I remember, Obama said something like &#39;What does that even mean?&#39; </p>

<p>Hillary totally blew it when Chris Wallace asked the question about concession. </p>

<p>If I were to hedge a guess, I would say HRC was more likely to be complicit in the whole fiasco than Obama was.</p>

<p>I have always been of the impression that John Kerry was complicit in allowing GWB to steal the 2004 election. We can&#39;t know for sure, but we can at least say that he is not someone to be supported.</p>

<p>I respect Palast a lot, and his work work should be a springboard to investigate election and voter fraud.  But Obama could have stated,&#39; there are some irregularities during the election&#39;, and we need to investigate, instead when Jill Stein wanted a recount, she was hounded!   So I think this brings us back into a circle when we started.  We both agree some bullshit went down last election.  If what you claim is the case, then the Democratic response has been horrible.  Instead of going after Trump on policy issues, or trying to show election irregularities, the settle on an Anti-Russia narrative that is increasing tensions with a nuclear power, it is aligned with neoconservative foreign policy objectives, and are actively smearing Assange and Wikileaks.    I agree with your point, that political recovery from this mess is going to be difficult, if not impossible. </p>

<p>They couldn&#39;t very well do that after the pre-election claims. Fortunately for all of us, election issues are finally bubbling up after 16 years of serious election gaming.

<p>Let&#39;s recall that Republicans wrote up the official post cold war strategy all the way back in 1992. There is no chance whatsoever that Republicans are going to back down on it.

<p>During the Yugoslav wars, Republicans were against their own policy for partisan advantage. Once that was over, they reverted back. This is the kind of thing I expect regarding FISA.

<p>Perhaps, however, I think  a stronger case is that the neoconservatives had been wanting a cold war back since at least 2008.  This is in line with the foreign policy apparatus that did not appreciate being opposed in Syria, remember the reaction in the press and congress the day after NYT published Putin&#39;s letter? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think so.   GWB was pursuing normalization with Russia, and Russia assisted in operations we did post 9/11.   The anti-Russia stuff can be traced to 2008 and Russian response to the NATO meeting in Bucharest, where it was stated that NATO will be expanding to Ukraine and Georgia.  The Georgian war broke out, Putin intervened, and the neoconservatives went crazy. </p>

<p>Barrett is mistaken here in two ways. The first he claims it was Assange that was communicating.  Assange had his internet cut during this time, and secondly there was no working with the Donald Trump campaign.  Wikileaks asked for Trump&#39;s tax returns and other information that they suspect might be coming out in order to publish it stating that they will not provide spin, like other MSM outlets (which is true and good journalism), and they state it will help them counter the smears of the Clinton campaign (which is true, and omitted in the Atlantic article).  Trump Jr, does not provide, instead he asks about a new leak he heard about, and Wikileaks does not answer.  There was no working with the Trump campaign.  That is a smear. </p>

<p>This is complete nonsense, as are too many other points in your comment.</p>

<p>Someone at WL was communicating, making it clear that WikiLeaks was neither objective nor transparent, and that the organization favored Donald Trump. WL was at a minimum an arm of the Donald Trump campaign -- regardless of whether it was Julian Assange and regardless of whether his internet was cut. These things have never been explained or corrected, and that is on WikiLeaks and Julian Assange. </p>

<p>A partisan is an adherent to a cause. You can tell a partisan not only by his one-sided arguments, but even more tellingly, when he distorts facts in favor of his cause -- that is a smoking gun.</p>

<p>Whether you are partisan Republican or a partisan &quot;both parties are the same&quot; person may be debatable, but you are a plain partisan either way. BTW, &quot;both parties are the same&quot; naturally benefits the oligarchy. So that&#39;s what you are supporting whether you intend so or not.</p>

<p>Michael Glennon&#39;s thesis is poor. He couldn&#39;t even get the Obama &quot;promises&quot; right. His 2008 Obama was completely different than the one I remember. It doesn&#39;t help that he is boring as hell.</p>

<p>I stated two claims.  The first that Barrett was wrong when he claimed this was Assange, and he is, Assange had his internet cut.  The second point is that the DM&#39;s do not show what you claimed.  It is also a fact.

<p>Calling me a partisan, is rich, as the only conceptual framework you use, Republicans bad, Democrats better, not engaging with the fact that they both push a neoliberal economic policy and a neoconservative foreign policy, also facts.

<p>I trust neither, frankly. </p>

Incidentally, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&amp;amp;v=uTDO-kuOGTQ">Mueller claimed</a> there were WMDs as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve considered the possibility that the Obama Administration&#39;s
/DNC&#39;s

Seems like a stretch at first glance (and hey, we&#39;re in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, so I&#39;ll throw it out there), but if one steps outside of the traditional partisan paradigm for a moment and looks instead at the cross-partisan group of actors, the neocons, a case can be made for their potential ongoing complicity in keeping cross-partisan skeletons in the neocon closet. Coincidentally,
 <a href="https://www.alternet.org/how-bush-administration-covered-saudi-connection-911">Mueller participated</a> in the initial rollout of the 9/11 coverup too.</p>

<p>Maybe it wasn&#39;t 9/11 they were trying to keep on the down low? Maybe it was some other malfeasance that was so egregious that HRC <em>had</em> to win so the cover wouldn&#39;t be blown.

<p>Elections have been mostly manipulated by Republicans since GWB stole the 2000 election to implement PNAC. The information on this is overwhelming. Even now, we have THREE cases at the Supreme Court and the state of Pennsylvania threatening that they will ignore the state supreme court. Then, there is Cross Check which purged millions of voters in 2016, including enough in every swing state to turn the election.</p>

<p>This is pure fantasy. Donald Trump was never going to expose 9-11. Anyone who believed he would needs to take a hard look at their political skills. There was an example of this in the past with Ron Paul. Many believed that Ron Paul was a secret 9-11 truther until one day he was asked straight out if there was a conspiracy -- he said, &quot;absolutely not.&quot; That should have been the end of that, but people today still believe Ron Paul is a 9-11 truther. </p>

<p>This is how PSYOPS work. The politicians who want wars convince people like you that some ambiguous &quot;deep state&quot; did it -- and that they are going to fight against the deep state -- and you believe it., So they go in there and do more of the same. </p>

<p>No, this is historical revisionism.  The only intelligence group that came out and stated that this is not the case was VIPS. </p>

<p>It is simply not true that the intelligence agencies were somehow undermining the narrative, they were generating.  That is why I specifically quoted the RAND assessment of the situation, because, while no-one denies that they produced intelligence for foreign policy objectives, just like the Russia DNI report, they still reported plenty of false things supporting WMD development. </p>

<p>I am well aware of Cheney feeding people like Judith Miller stories,  only to cite them for support... kind of like FBI with Steele...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The politicians advocate for wars because they are integrated in the military industrial complex, a big part of the nexus making up the deep state. </p>

<p>Well I know, like they run on an anti-war ticket and promise to close Guantanamo, only to expend the theater of war to Syria, Libya, and intensify the military intervention in Yemen, and then when they try to deescalate the war in Syria the DOD undermines them... no, no deep state there whatsoever. </p>

<p>All of these are legitimate issues and are worth fighting Trump on, it is what the Democrats, if they were not compromised by the MIC, banking and Wall Street, should have ran on.

I think it was all or nearly all Republicans. Maybe that&#39;s your Deep State right there. Maybe the JFK assassination continues to work to protect Republicans and keep Democrats from pushing more for change...</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Obama <em>was</em> banned from moving people out of GitMo. Once again, things are pretty much the opposite of what Republicans claim. The Deep State didn&#39;t do that -- Congress did -- first, in a provision of a must-pass or shutdown bill, then in a stand alone bill. Democrats were involved in these things too, although Republicans promoted them. These are, as per something thematic throughout this page -- namely, that <em>politicians are hiding behind the Deep State.</em> </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sure he could have. But how would that have played out? How would it have played out if Bill Clinton took a stand against the 1996 Telecommunications Act? These things would have taken place anyway, and they would have even worse enemies in the oligarchy. Once again, remember JFK. The point is: if it weren&#39;t for Republicans putting these things up in the first place, there wouldn&#39;t be &quot;complicit&quot; Democrats.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am always against a spy state. I am not for a LARP where one party complains about the FBI and spying then turns around and says he wants to be able to fire government employees who are not cronies. From the frying pan into the fire.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like &quot;opposition research,&quot; and the warrants were based on other things anyway. But pretending that your Republican Fake News and your Republican partisan &quot;memos&quot; are true and complete -- It&#39;s not the &quot;opposition research&quot; that is the problem -- it is the existence of a secret court manned exclusively by a Republican with judges who favor the spy state. There is no rule or law that says warrants cannot be grated upon &quot;opposition research.&quot; This is whole-cloth Republican spin.</p>

<p>If &quot;opposition research&quot; was a problem then the DNC Leaks would certainly fall into that category. The current Republican line is not much different than what Democrats were saying then, is it? Here, as we can see, both parties completely flip-flopped.</p>

<p>In the end, we live under policies, not stories of who is more corrupt or more honest. Republicans make sure that they keep the subject on corruption and the personal -- all the while pushing for more undemocratic advantages in elections. That should tell us plenty.</p>

<p>No. These back-and-forths are painfully long and I usually try to avoid this. I am not responding to everything, and still its way too long. I&#39;m gonna shorten it up this time. Toooooooooooo lonnnnnnnnnnng!</p>

It is a bullshit charge that is an outcome of a long time pivot in foreign policy towards anti-Russia brought by neoconservatives, and cooked up as an excuse by the Clinton campaign, both to deflect from what they internally found was the weakest point, and what they used as an excuse for loosing the presidency.  </p>

<p>Because it is reality. There would be no reaction without the instigation. You apparently expect that Democrats should be all pure and all knowing. That is not how people are. They see -- accurately -- that Donald Trump is a danger to free speech, and they react by supporting the corporate media.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>same companies fund both parties</p>

<p>There are serious differences in funding amounts, timing, and sources. Besides, the billionaire oligarchs have developed an &quot;independent&quot; existence as large as the parties and they support Republicans almost entirely.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You think the Banks care which party is in charge? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. And once Republicans have destroyed their reputations to a point where they have no chance at all, as in 1992 and 2008, they rush to fund Democrats temporarily to subvert their agenda. Which party voted 5-4 for <em>Citizens United</em>? Which has consistently opposed it? Real differences.</p>

<p>Easy to say when you deny Donald Trump stole the election. You are still entirely partisan after all this time. </p>

<p>People&#39;s view of the media has changed dramatically -- Republicans plummeted, Democrats jumped -- more partisan than ever.</p>

<p>Your bottom line is the classic &quot;Both parties are the same&quot; or &quot;both parties are equally bad.&quot; This is a reactionary view that disfavors change. Lay down and concede to the oligarchy. </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t think change can be made, there won&#39;t be any. If you don&#39;t think picking one person over another in a contest makes a difference, then you have no interest in democracy or anything like it.</p>

<p>I do not expect this, I expected them to learn the lessons from the WMD media blitz, to stay objective a little bit, and not be partisan hacks. </p>

<p>Yes. And once Republicans have destroyed their reputations to a point where they have no chance at all, as in 1992 and 2008, they rush to fund Democrats temporarily to subvert their agenda.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, it is not like we have evidence from Wikileaks that Citibank picked Obama&#39;s administration or that derivative markets and the banking sector were deregulated  during the Clinton administration, and advocated by Summers, a Clinton boy.   What you just stated about the Democratic party is just straight up false. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Which party voted 5-4 for Citizens United? </p>

<p>The political process was corrupt before Citizens United.</p>

<p>This is pretty simple. Democrats are for limiting funds. Republicans are for unlimited funds.</p>

<p>This is so reductive and absurd.   Yeah?  Obama sure was limiting to all that money that the Financial sector got through financial infusions and bailouts.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Easy to say when you deny Donald Trump stole the election. You are still entirely partisan after all this time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am not partisan.  These are the facts. Clinton and the DNC rigged the primaries against Sanders.   The FBI should have found Clinton guilty instead they exonerated her.  The Clinton campaign pursued a Pied Piper strategy HELPING trump win the nomination thinking he would be the easiest to beat.  It is a lie that Wikileaks is a Russian intelligence operation.  It is a lie that the DNC was hacked by the Russians, it was an internal leak.  It is a lie that Carter met Sechin and was promised up to 19 percent of Rosneft shares.   The partisan party in this character is yourself, and that is that you buy into the &#39;there are differences between the two parties&#39;, yeah one uses lube the other one spit. </p>

<p>Your bottom line is the classic &quot;Both parties are the same&quot; or &quot;both parties are equally bad.&quot; This is a reactionary view that disfavors change.</p>

<p>It is not reactionary.  It is articulating that both parties pursue a neoliberal policy domestically, and a neoconservative foreign policy, and that the duopoly is a trap.  It is what has been preventing meaningful change in this country.  It has stifled democracy, because unlike you, I don&#39;t think democracy is picking one character over another, I think democracy means that people that are affected by decisions should have meaningful say in them.  You obviously don&#39;t. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt anyone&#39;s reading at this point. </p>

<p>You can use funky words like &quot;reductive&quot; and try to whisk away <em>Citizens United</em> as if it didn&#39;t make a difference. That&#39;s pretty telling. Republicans wanted it so badly that they twisted all the precedents and twisted the facts of the case, and took an unusual second oral argument. They did not do all of that because it didn&#39;t matter. They did it because it <em>did</em> matter -- especially true in this case as that decision has harmed the Republican Party&#39;s reputation. They chose unlimited money over reputation because money matters more.</p>

<p>And more <em>more</em> money matters more. Here you go again trying to claim that things are &quot;the same.&quot; No, things are not the same. </p>

<p>Concept&quot; people push for changes that will make a difference. They generally do not push for things that don&#39;t matter. Your most fundamental philosophy is plain wrong. Lumping massive items together as identical or even equal is lazy and wrong. And given your decent knowledge of events (except that you have quite a few of them wrong), you should know that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>political process was corrupt before Citizens United.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here you go inferring that all &quot;corruption&quot; is equal. Plainly no.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t think democracy is picking one character over another</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, I do think exactly that -- in the context of virtually any election. We learn before grade school that every person is unique and different. I have not forgotten.</p>

<p>Because however you slice it, and wherever you draw the line -- &quot;lesser of the evils&quot; or &quot;greater of the goods&quot; or anywhere else -- changes or lack thereof make differences and sometimes life or deat4h differences in the lives of real people, AND changes feed upon themselves and spur more changes. For example, as long as we are arguing over whether &quot;black lives matter&quot; we are not available to make further changes. </p>

<p>Would I have taken Al Gore over GWB? No question about it. That year, the choice for me was particularly easy. They were miles apart. I was right too, as the reactionary changes under GWB were awful. I voted for Ralph Nadar because I was in a noncompetitive state, but if I had been in a swing state, I would have voted for Al Gore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is not reactionary.</p>

<p>That all said, let&#39;s assume you are right. Both parties are basically the same. What should we do?</p>

<p>Concept: The Democratic party is a method that meaninful change is averted, and neoliberal policy pursued.  Both the Democratic party and the Republican party push for policy that their owners tell them to push for, and that the national security state tells them to pursue. </p>

<p>I think it is a fundamental mistake to ignore commonality while hinging on differences.   Republicans and Democrats are not identities.  The two sets do not contain exactly the same members.   The sets are different.   You think those differences are significant, I don&#39;t.  It is the commonalities that matter more.  They are both neoliberal parties in economic policy, and neoconservative in foreign policy. </p>

<p>Please show what I am wrong about. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here you go inferring that all &quot;corruption&quot; is equal. Plainly no.</p>

<p>I was making a different point, and that is that Citizens United did not ruin something that was good, and worth preserving, I concede that it did make matters of funding worse. </p>

<p>I do not share you liberal commitments here. I certainly don&#39;t think presidential politicians are authentic persons, they are characters lately literally actors.  The question is whose script to they read from.  Both parties work for the same studio. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would I have taken Al Gore over GWB? No question about it.</p>

<p>Why?  The only thing that would have been different is that you would support his intervention in Afghanistan, and would have supported his regime change operation in Iraq.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That all said, let&#39;s assume you are right. Both parties are basically the same. What should we do?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a question of what is to be done!  I don&#39;t know you course of action is right for you.   Leaving the democratic party is one option,  staying in it, but holding it accountable for the lies and the cluster of the past 10 years is another.   The progressive Sanders wing of the party is promising. It is full of new talent that has not been compromised by either money, or the cult of national security.  However, the Clintonite wing needs to be purged and held accountable. </p>

<p>Wow, that&#39;s pretty crazy. All these years I thought 9-11 was a false flag operation done by people like GWB, Dick Cheney, and Rudy Giuliani (who supports Donald Trump now). And you&#39;re telling me, apparently that both 9-11 and the September 14, 2001, AUMF would have occurred, and that the PNAC war agenda -- a purely Republican policy -- would have happened precisely as it did. Sorry, no.</p>

<p>Note the pattern. Democrat Jimmy Carter is defeated, and Ronald Reagan is worse. BTW, that was the year the Senate turned Republican after a generation.</p>

<p>Democrat Bill Clinton came in, and he &quot;continued&quot; what Ronald Reagan started. If Ronald Reagan did not start it, Bill Clinton could not have continued it.</p>

<p>GWB steals the election, and things got worse.</p>

<p>Barack Obama comes in and &#39;continues&#39; the GWB agenda.</p>

<p>You see what is happening? One party to some extent is holding the line at least in the realm of changes previously made. The other party is making things worse.</p>

<p>I would prefer to hold the line. That&#39;s where we start. Hold the line, then we may start pushing for positive change rather than just reacting to the reactionism.</p>

<p>Progress has come in the past, and it will likely come again. It can happen and it does happen. It will not happen when the party of oligarchy gets a rubber stamp. That speeds up the damage and harms real people. This is conceptual but it is far more than theory: real people live and die on these changes or lack of changes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The progressive Sanders wing of the party is promising.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As we saw in 2000, a third party cannot win. If a team of superstars like Ralph Nadar and Phil Donahue could not even get three percent -- at a time before elections were so close and the cheating was so blatant -- there is virtually no chance of third party getting in for the foreseeable future. Maybe you and I would both like a third party, but it simply won&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>So what do we do? It appears we have a little bit of common ground here. Bernie Sanders -- a lifelong independent (as I am too) -- infiltrates the Democratic Party, almost wins the nomination (and considering the games of HRC probably should have, another point where we have some agreement). </p>

<p>What we are seeing now is promising. Many people rushing to join the Democratic Party. The end game here is to take the bulk of power and topple the leadership. This can work. </p>

<p>It would never work for the Republican Party, as we saw in 2010 and since with the Tea Party. That turned out to be a LARP of the establishment, with a good number of dissatisfied Republicans or conservatives jumping in to be used by it.</p>

<p>I know you are being facetious about 9/11, but no one thinks that the administration did it, except for partisan hacks that were pushing it in the 2000&#39;s, just to turn against 9/11 conspiracies with the Obama administration.   I think there is strong evidence that it was a coordinated affair between multiple different intelligence agencies and members of our own military/intelligence apparatus.    </p>

<p>So yes, it would have went down in the exact same manner.  The rhetoric would not have been the same, a little less nationalism, more emphasis on preventive action, but yes, both Afghanistan, and Iraq would have been undermined.   The policy to engage in regime change in Iraq has its genesis in the Iraq Liberation Act, passed under Clinton. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_Liberation_Act</a></p>

<p>And the plan to overthrow governments in the Middle East was a product of a secret agreement between Israeli and US intelligence agencies. </p>

<p>Here is a secret agreement from 1999 between Israel and U.S intelligence identifying Iraq, Iran, Syria and Libya as countries that need to be undermined:</p>

<p>Continuing an agenda is not the same as holding the line.   Which is in itself a bad metaphor guiding terrible politics.   The parties are neoliberal, they have the same agenda.   </p>

<p>Oligarchs are a problem, and they co-opted both parties.  You don&#39;t fight them by continuing the same old stuff that they have benefited from. </p>

<p>Well sure, if they are forced to debate on RT, only to be accused of pushing a &#39;Kremlin&#39; agenda like the DNI report alleged.   Third parties are viable, especially in the digital age we live.  Sanders demonstrated this last election.  If the MSM won&#39;t give equal and fair treatment to all political parties,  fuck them, let the institution die.  If the gatekeepers were out of the way,  the duopoly would be compromised.     </p>

<p>The tea party was not an organic mass movement, it was a Koch brothers astroturf campaign.  But I think you are mistaken that the Republican party can&#39;t be moved in better direction.  A populist movement can certainly move it, and fracture it.  Not necessarily in the right direction, but it can be moved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, fair point. I also at one time thought he might have been offed, and I&#39;ve been following the story pretty closely since just before things went weird in Oct 2016. I currently believe he&#39;s alive, but I will concede that if he were dead it would answer those questions in a way I hadn&#39;t considered.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2018/01/mother-julian-assange-speaks-stop-spreading-propaganda-situation/">Mother of Julian Assange Speaks Out – Stop Spreading Propaganda About His Situation!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“All of a sudden, out comes all these twitchy anti-WikiLeaks trolls — all over WikiLeaks’ feed saying that Julian has been compromised, that he’s been taken over by the CIA and WikiLeaks can’t be trusted and so you shouldn’t fund them anymore. I would ask the new WikiLeaks supporters not to buy into this. You may have your concerns, of course we all do, because we all love Julian and want to defend and protect him — but WikiLeaks is actually at war,” [Christine] Assange asserted. “The US State Department and the Deep State have declared war on WikiLeaks.”</p>

<p>Seemingly every time something happens with Assange or his Twitter account conspiracy theorists appear with wild accusations. The theories usually include unfounded claims that he has been compromised or that he has reached a deal and is out of the embassy — but sometimes the falsehoods are far worse. In one of the more extreme and far-reaching theories, a group of people on Twitter have been peddling lies that Julian was assassinated in October of 2016 — and that his televised appearances are digital or holograms.</p>

<p>These disinfo campaigns completely ignore the fact that many journalists and friends of Assange have visited him within the past year — including Pamela Anderson, Charles Johnson, Tim Pool, Randy Credico, and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher.</p>

<p>Sources close to WikiLeaks have previously told me that they believe these lies, disguised by those who start them as concern, are designed to sow public distrust with the organization.</p>

<p>“I would ask the new WikiLeaks supporters to just hold the line, just wait until you hear from WikiLeaks. If anything happens to my son, don’t you worry, I will be out there screaming from the rooftops,” she said. “His friends, his colleagues, his lawyers — we will all let you know if anything has gone wrong. You don’t have to worry about that.”</p>

<p>I followed the events of October 2016 very, very closely. I&#39;m convinced that while <a href="/r/WhereIsAssange">/r/WhereIsAssange</a> had the best initial intentions, it was manipulated into undermining confidence in wikileaks. Turned us into useful idiots, they did. Lesson learned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is your &quot;proof&quot; that Assange is dead? Even in this comment thread, the commenters don&#39;t assert that any of it is proof Assange is dead. Are you just hoping it&#39;ll be so technical that people assume it means what you assert it means, and cause people to disregard the overwhelming evidence that&#39;s emerged since then showing that Assange is alive and still in the embassy, including the man himself giving a statement from the balcony?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For the final time, let me reiterate.</p>

<p>Julian specifically told his supporters that if they were to get him they would do everything in their power to make it look like he was still alive that is why he created the high security proof of life key in the instance that he went missing and then returned we could tell without doubt it was him because he would prove it with his digital fingerprint.
He said this because if they got him and his dead man&#39;s switch went off, they would not want people to try find the keys to the insurance files.
Does that not make sense to you?</p>

<p>If this all turns out to be true, just imagine how many convictions will be overturned (including many actual criminals set free), based on the fact that &quot;Person X&quot; signed off on it and that person is now found to be dirty / incompetent, so every action he took in the past is now suspicious.</p>

<p>Yeah, you know, you&#39;re right. Why wouldn&#39;t they sacrifice him to save the rest? Thought provoking question.</p>

<p>I cannot even imagine how they will begin to unravel this thing. I suspect there&#39;s a number of moles and double agents at play here too, so... well, there just isn&#39;t enough popcorn in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh! Thank you for the correction. An edit makes a lot more sense.</p>

<p>Todd &amp; Clare did attempt to smear Assange as a pedophile back in October 2016, but I didn&#39;t remember Weinstein&#39;s name coming up at the time. When I saw the link, I jumped to the conclusion that Weinstein&#39;s behavior was an open secret at that time that they were citing, but an edit makes so much more sense.</p>

<p>Looks like a conspiracy doesn&#39;t it? Maybe that might help you realise why I didn&#39;t have a source for that.

<p>The point is that there was deep division in the FBI because of the way that the Clinton investigation was handled.  In order to pacify the FBI internally, Comey had to reopen the investigation.   I don&#39;t think there is a lot of evidence that this was a deciding factor against Clinton.  She won the popular vote, as her acolytes never get tired of saying...</p>

<p>No, I am supporting an elected official against un-elected entities that basically ran a domestic regime change operation.  I don&#39;t care who that elected official is, but I do care about the national security state being exposed and having its power curtailed.  Just for an example, the critique of the FISC itself, was hidden, but now is entering the political discourse.  This is a good turn of events. </p>
