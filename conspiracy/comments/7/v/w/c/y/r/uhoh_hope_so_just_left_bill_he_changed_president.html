       <em>
        In Comey’s final statement,
even the reference to “another senior government official” might have been viewed as
too incriminating, and it was stricken altogether. 73 Section 793(f) prohibits having
knowledge, and failing to report, the existence of national defense documents that are
mishandled through gross negligence. The changes in Director Comey’s statement to
delete the reference to President Obama—taken with the President’s April 10
statements about the investigation—raise questions about whether the FBI sought to
downplay President Obama’s role or awareness of Secretary Clinton’s conduct.

       This is why I feel like those who consider themselves true progressives need to get on the right side of this one and start to speak out about it and help push for transperancy. I dont care what your political affiliations are, this much bigger than that now.

       Man, having properties consistent with someone with his salary making modest investments for, how long has he been a public servant? 40 something years? Anyway, yeah, that
       <strong>
        <em>
         really
        </em>
       </strong>
       makes him a sellout.

       It's totally the same as all these "liberals" and neoliberals in Congress suddenly making millions
       <em>

       Pelosi
       <em>

       Clinton.

       I can't believe people are stupid enough to buy this shit about Bernie. Anyone who looks at what he did as Mayor of Burlington or what he's been talking about for his entire political career (ya know, railing against every foreign policy and domestic mistake the United States has been making for decades?) knows that his policies are a threat to the oligarchy. And yet all this incredibly weak bullshit seems to stick for you people. Oh no, he has three houses! Or the whole "what has he gotten accomplished in Congress" line- like, what the fuck do you expect given the establishment he's working against? One of, what, three independent Senators? Of course he hasn't gotten shit done, because the rest of the country has been voting in pieces of shit who bow and scrape to whoever throws them a million dollars. At least Bernie's been calling it like it is for his entire fucking life.
      </p>
      <p>
       What
       <strong>
        <em>
         really
        </em>
       </strong>
       gets me about this, is the same people who buy these weak ass smears against Bernie
       <em>
        tend
       </em>
       to also be willing to look the way on any number of things Trump's done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I hope to god Bernie runs in 2020, maybe we'll finally get the debate that chickenshit pussy Trump wimped out on.

       Then why the bank fraud between him and his wife? Not sure about you, but someone that is real does not commit bank fraud, but that's my opinion. If Bernie runs in 2020 he would lose at this point he sold out to the establishment when he signed on with Hillary.

       You may fine that acceptable I do not. I am not being bias though. You may have your head planted so far up Bernie was, but if Trump has to take responsibility for Charlottesville, as Bernie himself suggested. Bernie should take responsibility for those 3. Practice what you preach.

       his actual voting record going back to 1992 says otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       his record is basically the same as diane fienstien's.
      </p>
      <p>
       he's no russ finegold, which is why you don't know russ finegold.
      </p>
      <p>
       nothing illustrates this better than finegold's 2006 censure resoultion against bush and cheney. sanders refused to sign on because, and i quote, "it would be divisive."
      </p>
      <p>
       only 3 people had the balls to join finegold in trying to censure people for torturing people. finegold has been the dems greatest foe on the left every since, because, unlike kucinich, finegold really does have national electability.
      </p>
      <p>
       sanders didn't start getting public adoration as the savior of the left until obama's last term. he hit the news rounds by strategically saying obama should be primaried, which he laughed off right after it had achieved his purpose--a gig on tv talk shows. after that, he became a regular on sunday talkshows, increasing his name recognition, but always sure to say he was a socialist, which he is not. not even close.
      </p>
      <p>
       he was pushed in 2015 as the presumably unelectable pied piper candidate on the left to keep finegold out, and make sure the actual left was engaged enough to go to the polls in nov. he wasn't supposed to do well. no one thought it would be an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       people who think he was not an intentional judas goat are blinded by their fandom. the real left called it in the summer of 2015, in fact we called it in 2011 when he bounded into the forefront with his primary obama stunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       finegold voted against the neo-jim crowe act of 1994, sanders voted for it and to this day refuses to admit the vote was evil, weasling out of it by citing the two toothless dem beard provisions, violence against women and assault weapons. both were jokes added solely as cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       fwiw socialism is the socioeconomic system wherein 100% of the means of production (i.e. capital) and 100% of the profits resulting from its application are equally owned as an inalienable right by those whose actual labor in applying the means of production generates the profit. and i mean actual workers, not managerial classes.
      </p>
      <p>
       you cannot be a socialist and support the continuation of capitalism. even the kinder, gentler keynesian capitalism of sanders. he is not a democratic socialist, he is a social democrat, which is a euphamism for social capitalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       the real left has called him out for this for decades. he presuambly is suffciently well educated and intelligent to know he is misusing the terms. so why does he do it?

       Way to prove contempt for the media, want to go for racism. I’m a Jew if it helps. You had like nine words and some how still contradicted yourself. Impressive.

       Anyone with a developed intellect has contempt for the media. What's your point? What's that? You don't have one?
      </p>
      <p>
       What does being a Jew having to do with anything? Are you drunk-posting?

       You had 3 sentences and managed to say absolutely nothing at all. Was your post randomly-generated or are you going to claim credit for this failure to engage in critical thinking?  This is opposite of impressive.

       Are you done drooling on yourself yet? If you read the comments back it's clear how I am pointing out that fact that you are a moron. You call, among other things 'contempt for the media' a 'talking point' while at the same time - and now twice - saying you have contempt for the media. I was pointing out how you contradict yourself so easily.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe I need to explain this to you twice, but seeing your comment history it makes sense I would need to. Reply if you like wasting your time - which seeing as you have no life, friends, intellect or relationship, you probably will.

       Ouch. Looks like it's gotten person for the little snowflake. I'm aware I tend to get under the skin of you over emotional liberals but you're not even trying to hide it. You're reading my post history too? And admitting it? Nice. Continue to admire. Look, but don't touch. I own you now.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Show me where I called contempt for the media a talking point. If this depends on
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       interpretation of words, which is to say, your convulsion of the truth in order to artificially create the variables you want and need in the argument, then you sir, have in a single gasp, exposed your own stupidity and desperation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not going to end well for you. Remain seated.
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) I've said I have contempt for the media once in response to you. My first comment was a reference to another liberal jackass bringing his r/politics talking point bullshit into an arena where it obviously has no place: His response to a thread with incredibly damning evidence against the DNC and in particular key members within it, was not to talk about the issue being discussed in the thread, but to derail into a political hackjob bullshit because any argument
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       the subject matter is absolutely impossible, because the Democrat party is infested with scandal and everyone on the planet knows it. He got checked, just like you're getting checked right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now,
       <em>
        your
       </em>
       response to this, was to talk about Jews and contempt for the media (just... wow), because like him, you too are a fucking moron, with nothing substantial to say about the subject matter. No, like him, and all other zombie hive-minded liberal sheep, you have a monotone and entirely predictable path of progression in an argument or discussion. It always starts with ignoring the subject at hand, or dismissing it (both of you have done this, and you've done it twice now) and instead making it about the person whose comments you disagree with (bingo) or a strawman/unrelated issue (wow, you're 3 for 3).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you've reduced yourself into the "you don't have a life looooser lolol!!!!1!" angle? Another sure sign you've just gotten your ass wrecked in an argument. Nowhere to go but down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can assure you, that you do not possess the mental and intellectual equipment required to dance with me. Go back to your little circle-jerk where people always agree with each other and your thoughts are never challenged (which of course is why you fucking idiots never learn how to argue).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here? You will continue to get your ass kicked. Every. Single. Time. Spend some time educating yourself and expanding your mind, and come back in a few years to try again.

       I dont really think this scandal can "blow up".
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain:
      </p>
      <p>
       We've got two sides so enormously determined that the other is at fault. One side claims that a foreign state influenced the election and essentially put their own puppet in control of the country. Driving it off the deep end of a cliff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The otherone, claims a "deepstate"-esque group is devilishly trying to usurp a lawfully elected president of the Country. Using bogus claims and cherry picking comments to paint him dirty. Buying peoples trusts/allegiances.
      </p>
      <p>
       See. Regardless of who ends up "right" in this, shits going fucking down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muller goes on stage claiming there was no collusion and no obstruction of justice? get ready for riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Muller goes on stage claiming there was collusion and obstuction of justice (+ an second attempt of obstuction of justice with the whole GOP memo and attacks on the fbi). Get ready for riots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think people are calling this "bigger than watergate" just for hyperbole. This shit is actually pretty scary, and should worry a lot of people. Regardless of which side "gets it right" sort-o-say. Things will get violent.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that scares the hell out of me.

       Is this related to the newly released text messages between Strzok and Page? Or is this the new investigation into Hillary Clinton's private email server? Is there any evidence besides an assumption that when Comey says "another senior government official" he is talking about Obama? Is the quote from the title a part of the newly released texts. Can anybody have a conversation with me about this, or are we just laughing at shills and Dems?

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On June 30, 2016, Strzok and Page exchanged texts about edits to Director Comey’s
statement. Strzok texted, “K. Rybicki just sent another version.” Page responded,
“Bill just popped his head in, hopefully to talk to him.” (“Bill” likely refers to Bill
Priestap, Strzok’s boss). Strzok replied, “Hope so. Just left Bill. . . . He changed
President to ‘another senior government official.’”72 In Comey’s final statement,
even the reference to “another senior government official” might have been viewed as
too incriminating, and it was stricken altogether.73 Section 793(f) prohibits having
knowledge, and failing to report, the existence of national defense documents that are
mishandled through gross negligence. The changes in Director Comey’s statement to
delete the reference to President Obama—taken with the President’s April 10
statements about the investigation—raise questions about whether the FBI sought to
downplay President Obama’s role or awareness of Secretary Clinton’s conduct.

       Thank you. When they are discussing "Director Comey’s statement," are they referring to
       <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/pressrel/press-releases/statement-by-fbi-director-james-b-comey-on-the-investigation-of-secretary-hillary-clinton2019s-use-of-a-personal-e-mail-system">
        his press conference on July 5th, 2016,
       </a>
       where he did not recommend criminal charges to the DoJ? I'm unsure if  “Hope so. Just left Bill. . . . He changed President to ‘another senior government official.’” is referring to Comey's statement, because those words don't really appear in his statement. The closest I could find in Comey's statement is "Others we found by reviewing the archived government e-mail accounts of people who had been government employees at the same time as Secretary Clinton, including high-ranking officials at other agencies, people with whom a Secretary of State might naturally correspond." Unless these texts are referring to another statement made by Comey. Not trying to shill or be obtuse, I just want to be sure we are all discussing the same sources. I appreciate your responses.

       Thank you, I missed that. And do we have any evidence that this was actually edited out of Comey's statement, besides the Strzok/Page texts? The texts only talk about removing "President" from the statement, then it is in the words of Senator Ron Johnson that "'another senior government official' might have been viewed as too incriminating, and it was stricken altogether." I want to be sure we can differentiate between known facts and what the report is assuming.

       I'm looking forward to where this leads. I want to remain skeptical until something solid bubbles up, especially when the title sounds so damning and all the comments are congratulating each other for a big "win," but there's no actual discussion about the substance.

       It's very unlikely that there will be a "big win" on any single text message. People get excited though.

       And yes, I checked and the footnotes do lead to the text messages in the pdf I linked.

       his actual voting record going back to 1992 says otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       his record is basically the same as diane fienstien's.
      </p>
      <p>
       he's no russ finegold, which is why you don't know russ finegold.
      </p>
      <p>
       nothing illustrates this better than finegold's 2006 censure resoultion against bush and cheney. sanders refused to sign on because, and i quote, "it would be divisive."
      </p>
      <p>
       only 3 people had the balls to join finegold in trying to censure people for torturing people. finegold has been the dems greatest foe on the left every since, because, unlike kucinich, finegold really does have national electability.
      </p>
      <p>
       sanders didn't start getting public adoration as the savior of the left until obama's last term. he hit the news rounds by strategically saying obama should be primaried, which he laughed off right after it had achieved his purpose--a gig on tv talk shows. after that, he became a regular on sunday talkshows, increasing his name recognition, but always sure to say he was a socialist, which he is not. not even close.
      </p>
      <p>
       he was pushed in 2015 as the presumably unelectable pied piper candidate on the left to keep finegold out, and make sure the actual left was engaged enough to go to the polls in nov. he wasn't supposed to do well. no one thought it would be an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       people who think he was not an intentional judas goat are blinded by their fandom. the real left called it in the summer of 2015, in fact we called it in 2011 when he bounded into the forefront with his primary obama stunt.
      </p>
      <p>
       finegold voted against the neo-jim crowe act of 1994, sanders voted for it and to this day refuses to admit the vote was evil, weasling out of it by citing the two toothless dem beard provisions, violence against women and assault weapons. both were jokes added solely as cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       fwiw socialism is the socioeconomic system wherein 100% of the means of production (i.e. capital) and 100% of the profits resulting from its application are equally owned as an inalienable right by those whose actual labor in applying the means of production generates the profit. and i mean actual workers, not managerial classes.
      </p>
      <p>
       you cannot be a socialist and support the continuation of capitalism. even the kinder, gentler keynesian capitalism of sanders. he is not a democratic socialist, he is a social democrat, which is a euphamism for social capitalist.
      </p>
      <p>
       the real left has called him out for this for decades. he presuambly is suffciently well educated and intelligent to know he is misusing the terms. so why does he do it?
