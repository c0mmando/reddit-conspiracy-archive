<p>They also used the same techniques and language as other discrediting operations.

    <div class="md"><p>The Vedic texts give a very cryptic description of flat earth that describes earth as a plane of existence, or a dimension, that spans the entire universe until the &quot;mountain of existence/nonexistence&quot; the different regions of earth are separated by concentric circles of ice and water. Antarctica is just a barrier that separates this smaller earth from the other parts of earth. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so heavily guarded. It&#39;s mostly to keep other beings out, not keep us in. The space above us is just more subtle beings of mind and intellect. The space below is is for beings that are heavily sensual.</p>

<p>This is very simplified. But gives an idea. It&#39;s all in the ancient puranas of India but it&#39;s pretty hard to decipher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you can&#39;t say let me suggest a couple of thoughts:</p>

<p>If the Earth were flat, the sun would rise and set at the roughly same time across the entire Earth. (and it doesn&#39;t matter whether a disk like Earth is spinning or a Sun is circling the Earth.) Time zones would be irrelevant, and the use of time zones would, in fact, be crazy, because the sun would be rising in the middle of the night somewhere. So, do you really think that it is always day and night at the same time everywhere on the planet? Same for the Moon.</p>

<p>If the Earth were flat, everyone on the Earth would see the Moon in the same orientation (same visible features oriented top and bottom). (and it doesn&#39;t matter whether the flat Earth is spinning or the Moon is circling the flat Earth). Then why do those in the southern hemisphere see the moon with the opposite orientation?</p>

<p>I have found no flat Earth model that explains these observations, though I have not read &quot;the fifth canto of the Bhagavat Purana&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea.... I think the &quot;Flat earthers&quot; made a mistake in claiming a flat earth, when they should have just focused on what is wrong with the currently stated model. There is def some wrong facts being taught, earth isn&#39;t a globe and even stated so as a &quot;oblate spheroid&quot; in a apple or pear shape, with top more round and bottom half longer. </p>

<p>I have noticed plenty of other strange observations on the map... like check out the shape of Africa, and then compare it to Australia. If you take Africa, spin it and shrink a bit then it looks just like Australia, with Madagascar being new Zealand. </p>

<p>I think the &quot;Flat earth movement&quot; was put out there to hide from the truth that there is more going on in those maps and the claim of flat earth is easy to dismiss and keep people from looking any closer (tho the smart ones will)/. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually pretty smart.  The Conspiracy community has grown enormously in the last few years.  That many people asking questions and, more importantly, directing those questions towards the power wealth of the world makes a big threat.  </p>

<p>I remember around 2005 there were a significant number of people discussing 9/11 conspiracies online.  First came the &quot;Debunkers&quot; who invaded all the boards who were vicious.  Then came the theories that were completely....embarrassingly absurd.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s what this is.  It&#39;s just to muddy the water.  One good hint is that the &quot;Flat Earth Theory&quot; doesn&#39;t lead anywhere.  What if the earth was flat?  What are the implications of that?  Who&#39;s to blame for that?  Who gains from this lie, really?  Certainly not the Power Wealth.  They&#39;re free and clear.</p>

<p>Big clue.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Both of those things show the opposite of a flat earth and &quot;fake&quot; space.</p>

<p>The Earth is a globe.</p>

<p>Space is real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That isn&#39;t why it&#39;s true, no.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true because it&#39;s easily verifiable via observation and experiment (these are more or less the same thing, just with various degrees of formality), and even moreso because the converse -- a flat earth -- is easily disproven via observation and experiment.</p>

<p>That I say something, that NASA says something, has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>Just to take this one example, you&#39;re confusing your own perception of an illusion with tested and verifiable reality.</p>

<p>Easy-to-digest explanation:</p>

<p>What&#39;s very frustrating is this is all very available information, and yet you&#39;re still talking about &quot;basic geometry with the sun rays through clouds&quot; as if you have never even bothered to look up the &quot;basic geometry&quot; information about a major example you&#39;re providing. You&#39;re expecting everyone else to do your work for you, to personally one-on-one tutor you this stuff...just so that at the end you can pretend you were the smart one all along.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an extension of Axiom Denial Disorder--an anti-authority disorder.</p>

<p>Some people feel wronged by authority, and have extended that to disbelieving <em>everything</em> they are told is true by people in authority.</p>

<p>It&#39;s understandable. Hell, I was taught that Columbus was some good guy &quot;discovering&quot; America, and a bunch of bullshit history when I was young. The older I got, the more I realized that &quot;history&quot; is generally bullshit created by those whose books didn&#39;t get burnt.</p>

<p>Some people respond stronger to these kinds of revelations, and then assume <em>everything</em> they are told by anyone who wants them to believe something is false.</p>

<p>I have tried repeatedly to have rational conversations with FE believers, but it won&#39;t work. I cite &quot;authorities&quot; in physics and science, and to them, that&#39;s no good. So then I have &quot;no argument&quot; since they don&#39;t believe in even the most basic facts.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve given up trying to have any rational discourse with anyone who believes FE. Now I just call them stupid fucking idiots and go about my day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, spot on. I learned the truth about the faked moon landings a few years ago, and I&#39;ve seen more and more people waking up to the reality since then.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also seen &quot;flat earth&quot; growing at a similar rate. Any mention of &quot;faked moon landing&quot; is often quickly followed by &quot;flat earth.&quot;</p>

<p>I believe these two ideas are very intentionally being tied together, as if belief in one necessitates the belief in the other. This is how they&#39;re going to keep the sleepers from realizing the truth about the moon landings.</p>
