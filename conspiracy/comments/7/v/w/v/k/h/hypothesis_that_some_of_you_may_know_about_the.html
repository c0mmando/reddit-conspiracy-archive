       Considering the size of the online, flat earthers, yes it looks like a faked up "movement,"   and yes to discredit conspiracy investigations.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also used the same techniques and language as other discrediting operations.  BernieBros(dicredit Sanders voters), SJWs (to discredit all the efforts to equal civil rights for all, women, LGBT, Culture, ethnic, religious)BLM(specifically to draw attacks against African Americans) Free Speechers, (to destroy any movement to civil discourse.)etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember that so called "liberal," MSM pushes all of this fakery as if it is real.  There is no liberal media, anywhere that is allowed in the national dialog.

       As more people wake up and question authority, expect your government to maximize it's time attempting to put people back in the dark.  Government will be forced to become even less transparent than it already is. This is why government has to be secretive. Why else would they be secretive?

       This nation has had only one side, conservative since 1969 to 2009, where a little left movement was advanced that is already being pushed back.

       I don't pick sides. American politics is solely confined to within the authoritarian right.  I don't agree with authoritarianists.  I see the 'left' and the 'right' as one in the same.  There is no left or right and sometimes they can even change places. Trump is more left than Hillary.

       I don't think political compass is propaganda. It might even be one of the few things out there that isn't. Honestly, when your government is authoritarian, is really doesn't matter where you fall since it's all Liberty- in the top half of the compass. I reside in the lower half, the Liberty+ half. If that doesn't make sense to you, I can make it.

       I was saying from the beginning that it was either a social experiment to see how easy it was to get people to believe in the absurd...or a government op to in an attempt to pin that absurdity to the Truth movement, conspiracy theorists and critical thinkers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the derogatory nature of "conspiracy Theorist" is starting to wear off as time and time again critical thinkers are proving the MSM to be the false reality...FE is a new kind of dirt to throw on us.

       The Vedic texts give a very cryptic description of flat earth that describes earth as a plane of existence, or a dimension, that spans the entire universe until the "mountain of existence/nonexistence" the different regions of earth are separated by concentric circles of ice and water. Antarctica is just a barrier that separates this smaller earth from the other parts of earth. That's why it's so heavily guarded. It's mostly to keep other beings out, not keep us in. The space above us is just more subtle beings of mind and intellect. The space below is is for beings that are heavily sensual.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is very simplified. But gives an idea. It's all in the ancient puranas of India but it's pretty hard to decipher.

       The vedic scriptures say that all is Brahman. Brahman is consciousness or spirit. There is a saying in the upanishads that goes like this "You are Brahman" and " All this is Brahman".

       Yeah but this can be misunderstood very easily. Tat tvam asi is the famous sutra that states this..."You are that"
      </p>
      <p>
       This means we are simultaneously one and different from brahman. It's not that reality is impersonal. We have the nature of spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Krishna also confirms this in bhagavad gita. We are all spirit and individuals eternally. One and different simultaneously.

       Well this is actually only partially true. Brahman, paramatma, and Bhagavan are all parts of the Absolute Truth stated in the Bhagavat Purana, which is the essence of all the Vedas. To say Bhagavan is Brahman is true, but Bhagavan is a more essential form of Brahman.

       Yeah and the Gitopanisad says that Krsna is the source of Brahman. And that devotion to him is the highest yoga. Can't have devotion if the lover and beloved are the same person. He also says that all beings are eternally individuals.

       This is the problem with just reading one upanisad. The Gitopanisad is the essence of the upanisads. Read that and you'll get a better understanding of brahman

       Lol the knowledge of the Vedas are not words, it's knowledge, tattva. The problem is, you learned about Brahman but you don't know the different tattvas (ontological categories) of reality that make up the experience of consciousness. The upanisads are cryptic and esoteric. The Gita is the truths of the upanisads unlocked. Trying to say "it's all one" without having the experience is intellectually dishonest. The Vedas say MUCH MORE than "everything is Brahman that's it"

       Says in the isopanisad that ignorance in the form of knowledge is worse than ignorance itself. By cherry picking the Vedas to fit an impersinalnor voidist preference, you are doing yourself a disservice. The upanisads are highly misunderstood and it seems you have taken a sutra out of context.

       Read isopanisad and Gitopanisad and THEN reevaluate. To say you read one text and that's it is irresponsible as a seeker.

       I can just tell by you saying "I am what I am" that you haven't understood the message of the upanisads. It's much more contextual than how you present it. It's not good to be so confident that you "know" when you can't even expand upon this in any regard.

       No it IS possible if one is gifted the vision by Bhagavan. What you are saying is not supported by the Vedas. You shouldn't mix your opinion in what the Vedas say. That's exactly what isopanisad warns us about.

       Yea, I'm a fan of the Vedic version with mt meru and all. I've seen a few other suggestions that really get the mind going, toroidal planes with cave system, cup/chalice with a pyramid in it, the heart/cardoid shape.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perspective seems to be important too. I've also seen the "expanding earth" model as alternative to tectonic plates which is interesting.

       Since you can't say let me suggest a couple of thoughts:
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth were flat, the sun would rise and set at the roughly same time across the entire Earth. (and it doesn't matter whether a disk like Earth is spinning or a Sun is circling the Earth.) Time zones would be irrelevant, and the use of time zones would, in fact, be crazy, because the sun would be rising in the middle of the night somewhere. So, do you really think that it is always day and night at the same time everywhere on the planet? Same for the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth were flat, everyone on the Earth would see the Moon in the same orientation (same visible features oriented top and bottom). (and it doesn't matter whether the flat Earth is spinning or the Moon is circling the flat Earth). Then why do those in the southern hemisphere see the moon with the opposite orientation?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have found no flat Earth model that explains these observations, though I have not read "the fifth canto of the Bhagavat Purana".

       I don't know.  When someone used to broach the subject of anything conspiracy or esoteric they would distance themselves from the lunatic fringe using the Little Green Men strawman. Most people were only exposed to Flat Earth after the advent of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fot a crazy hypothesis Flat Earth is remarkably well thought out.  And most people laughing at it couldn't even rap their head around it.  In the decline of civilization we're facing when trust in all institutions is diminishing it's no surprise people are drifting to kooky beliefs of all sorts.

       Oh lawd another flat earth hit piece in this subreddit. I never see any pro posts about flat earth but only hit pieces. Why do people find it necessary to post anti flat earth sentiment on here if there is no vocal flat earth presence here? Strong agenda.

       Yea.... I think the "Flat earthers" made a mistake in claiming a flat earth, when they should have just focused on what is wrong with the currently stated model. There is def some wrong facts being taught, earth isn't a globe and even stated so as a "oblate spheroid" in a apple or pear shape, with top more round and bottom half longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have noticed plenty of other strange observations on the map... like check out the shape of Africa, and then compare it to Australia. If you take Africa, spin it and shrink a bit then it looks just like Australia, with Madagascar being new Zealand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the "Flat earth movement" was put out there to hide from the truth that there is more going on in those maps and the claim of flat earth is easy to dismiss and keep people from looking any closer (tho the smart ones will)/.

       This just means it's not a perfect sphere. It's spherical for all intents aside from rocket/satellite telemetry. The "oblate" flattening ratio is 1:298. VERY minor.

       Well it's pretty obvious - I don't make threads pertaining to flat earth here, I'm just one voice of many, merely posting in response to the topic posted. And I don't see many if any posted here as they don't never get any traction, yet these anti flat posts do get some traction and visibility. Bit odd for a conspiracy forum I say.

       Flat Earthers always say this as if it adds to their credibility. I suppose you're in no position to debunk either the flat earth or the globe earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll bite though. What proof do you have that space is a made up thing? What's the point of convincing countless generations that the earth is a globe if it isn't? With the never ending costs of that supposed propaganda machine.

       If people can be convinced that fire damage caused a skyscraper to fall at almost free fall speed, and perfectly into its own footprint, they can be made to believe anything....or maybe that's what those pushing flat earth theory are testing.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, if anyone is still unconvinced that the Earth is round (though perhaps not a perfect sphere), I would suggest you take a helicopter ride up to about 3500 feet agl.  You will then be able to see the curve of the earth with your own eyes.  Source:  did static line jump out of a UH-1 Huey from 3500 ft agl, and was able to see the curve of the earth with the naked eye.  It was pretty cool..

       It's actually pretty smart.  The Conspiracy community has grown enormously in the last few years.  That many people asking questions and, more importantly, directing those questions towards the power wealth of the world makes a big threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember around 2005 there were a significant number of people discussing 9/11 conspiracies online.  First came the "Debunkers" who invaded all the boards who were vicious.  Then came the theories that were completely....embarrassingly absurd.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what this is.  It's just to muddy the water.  One good hint is that the "Flat Earth Theory" doesn't lead anywhere.  What if the earth was flat?  What are the implications of that?  Who's to blame for that?  Who gains from this lie, really?  Certainly not the Power Wealth.  They're free and clear.

       That isn't why it's true, no.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's true because it's easily verifiable via observation and experiment (these are more or less the same thing, just with various degrees of formality), and even moreso because the converse -- a flat earth -- is easily disproven via observation and experiment.

       Just to take this one example, you're confusing your own perception of an illusion with tested and verifiable reality.

       What's very frustrating is this is all very available information, and yet you're still talking about "basic geometry with the sun rays through clouds" as if you have never even bothered to look up the "basic geometry" information about a major example you're providing. You're expecting everyone else to do your work for you, to personally one-on-one tutor you this stuff...just so that at the end you can pretend you were the smart one all along.

       It's an extension of Axiom Denial Disorder--an anti-authority disorder.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people feel wronged by authority, and have extended that to disbelieving
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       they are told is true by people in authority.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's understandable. Hell, I was taught that Columbus was some good guy "discovering" America, and a bunch of bullshit history when I was young. The older I got, the more I realized that "history" is generally bullshit created by those whose books didn't get burnt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some people respond stronger to these kinds of revelations, and then assume
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       they are told by anyone who wants them to believe something is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have tried repeatedly to have rational conversations with FE believers, but it won't work. I cite "authorities" in physics and science, and to them, that's no good. So then I have "no argument" since they don't believe in even the most basic facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've given up trying to have any rational discourse with anyone who believes FE. Now I just call them stupid fucking idiots and go about my day.

       Yes, spot on. I learned the truth about the faked moon landings a few years ago, and I've seen more and more people waking up to the reality since then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also seen "flat earth" growing at a similar rate. Any mention of "faked moon landing" is often quickly followed by "flat earth."
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe these two ideas are very intentionally being tied together, as if belief in one necessitates the belief in the other. This is how they're going to keep the sleepers from realizing the truth about the moon landings.

       I got beers with my friends who aren’t into conspiracies last week and was explaining to them about pizzzzza gate. I basically said that i dont know if I believe everything but if this stuff happens in Hollywood, why can’t it happen in the government. They instantly started mocking me and called me a flat earther.
