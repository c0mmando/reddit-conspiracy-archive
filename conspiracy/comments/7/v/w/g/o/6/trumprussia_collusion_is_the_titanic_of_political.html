       The entire narrative keeping afloat the idea of "Trump-Russia collusion" is crumbling faster than ever before. I expect the usual downvotes that come from questioning the official story and giving you a different opinion on a conspiracy sub, but this post is for everyone, including the people who believe they can simply hide all information that makes them uncomfortable. You have enjoyed being on the offensive for the last year and a half, but now you are forced on to the defensive, forced to defend certain people and actions you would rather not, and you don't like it. I understand.

       Christopher Steele, the foreign agent who created the now-infamous Piss Dossier allegedly based on Russian-sourced information, which was created
       <a href="https://apnews.com/63c883156e314b68b86209d3b63890f5">
        after
       </a>
       receiving funds from the DNC and Hillary Clinton, now faces accusations of perjury in the US, the UK, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-06%20CEG%20LG%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20(Unclassified%20Steele%20Referral).pdf">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The unverified parts of the Piss Dossier that have not already been proven false are relying heavily on accusing Carter Page of being a key player in the collusion. Meanwhile, Carter Page is still to this day both a free man, not sent to prison by US prosecutors, not put in the witness protection program, and also not dead, somehow avoiding the ruthless Russians and their assassins, and he is happily doing television interviews with no lawyer to help him. Carter Page is
       <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/carter-page-trump-russia-investigation-zero-fears-mueller-indictment-a8029841.html">
        completely unconcerned
       </a>
       about being prosecuted for any crime, because he knows his entire life has already been combed through by this point, and in fact he is
       <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/09/14/ex-trump-aide-carter-page-sues-yahoo-huffpost-for-defamation/">
        taking legal action
       </a>
       himself as a result of accusations thrown his way. (Also interesting to note that Carter Page is suing Yahoo (among others) over the same article mentioned in Christopher Steele's criminal referral:
       <a href="https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2018-02-06%20CEG%20LG%20to%20DOJ%20FBI%20(Unclassified%20Steele%20Referral).pdf">

       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       This all comes after
       <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/03/carter-page-nunes-memo-216934">
        Carter Page assisted the FBI with their investigations in to a Russian spy ring in 2013
       </a>
       . Carter Page was not charged.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, now, what we are left with is Christopher Steele and Carter Page.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christopher Steele will most likely go down for perjury, making the DNC / Clinton-funded Piss Dossier worth even less than it is now. It will be put on about the same level as a Facebook rant from a convicted liar - a paid political hitman. A desperate collection of amusing stories created by a mercenary who wanted to keep the money train rolling in, and keep his network of influence within US agencies intact. Steele's conviction is not necessary though, as the burden of proof remains on him. Nobody must prove that the Piss Dossier is any more false than it has already been proven to be. Steele, or others on his behalf, must prove that the accusations are true. And because many of those accusations rely on Carter Page playing a key role, it is extremely doubtful that they are true. The doubt grows with every passing day that Carter Page remains a free man, and Trump remains president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter Page will continue to be looked at as
       <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/02/03/carter-page-nunes-memo-216934">
        "a bit of an idiot"
       </a>
       by anyone who has read about him and his history. I actually find it hard to believe that any serious person believes Carter Page had a major role in this story. The Russians knew he was compromised since 2013 when Page told the FBI what he knew about a Russian spy ring, leading to convictions of Russian spies... but we're supposed to believe the Russians are going to trust this blithering idiot and FBI snitch with rigging the elections years later? This fool who can't keep his mouth shut and goes on TV interviews with no lawyer? And then we would have to believe that both Carter Page and his Russian associates managed to pull this off with no evidence coming to light in the years since.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does this political hoax relate to the tragedy of the Titanic, you ask?
      </p>
      <p>
       The Titanic did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone after it crashed and fell apart. Those who waited, or were forced to wait due to their low status, until the last minute to jump off the sinking ship did not survive. They froze to death or drowned - their hands paralyzed by the cold, no longer able to cling to the flimsy wreckage of the ship that once kept them safely afloat.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, there is no lifeboat for the captain. The captain must take ultimate responsibility. The captain must go down with the ship.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who will be designated as the honorary captain of this hoax before it finally sinks? Who does it all lead back to? Who is such damaged goods, such a burden to their country, party, political and business associates, both in the recent past, present, and future? Who has brought the most humiliation on a global scale, both personal and political, for all of the people involved in this hoax? Who is expendable and ready to be cut loose? Can you think of any names that would fit here? ;-)

       It get's literally nothing right about the story. That's not how the dossier was compiled, it's not how information is gathered, and it's not how sources work.

       No. really. It literally got everything wrong. It claimed this reporter created the Dossier and worked with the FBI when he so obviously did not.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That article is very good. It doesn't say anything about Carter Page "assisting" the FBI though, how did you come to that conclusion?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the real purpose of Page’s trip was clandestine. He had come to meet with the Kremlin. And in particular with Igor Sechin. Sechin was a former spy and, more importantly, someone who commanded Putin’s absolute confidence. He was in effect Russia’s second most powerful official, its de facto deputy leader.
       </p>
       <p>
        By this point Sechin had been at Putin’s side for more than three decades. He had begun his career in the KGB and served as a military translator in Mozambique. In the 1990s he worked with Putin in the mayor’s offce in St Petersburg. Sechin functioned as Putin’s scowling gatekeeper. He carried the boss’s briefcase and lurked outside Putin’s ground-floor office in St Petersburg’s city hall.
       </p>
       <p>
        His appearance was lugubrious. Sechin had a rubbery face, narrow-set eyes, and a boxer’s squishy nose. When Putin was elected president, Sechin became his deputy chief of staff and, from 2004, executive chairman of the Russian state oil firm Rosneft, the country’s biggest oil producer. A stint as deputy prime minister was not successful. “He’s clever, despite looking like a dummy. But he can’t speak or do public politics,” Sergei Sokolov, deputy editor of the liberal Novaya Gazeta newspaper, said of Sechin.
       </p>
       <p>
        In private Sechin impressed. Chris Barter—the former CEO of Goldman Sachs Moscow—described him as an “extremely charming and smart guy, on top of his numbers operationally.” It was clear that Sechin had Russia’s entire security services at his disposal. He would be willing to personally reward anyone who advanced the objectives of the Russian state, Barter added.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2014 Page had written a sycophantic piece that lauded Sechin for his “great accomplishments.” In a blog for Global Policy, Page wrote that Sechin had done more to advance U..S.-Russian relations than anybody in decades. Sechin was a wronged Russian statesman, in Page’s view, unfairly punished and sanctioned by the Obama White House.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was the backdrop to Page’s Moscow trip.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eleven days after Page flew back from Russia to New York, Steele filed a memo to Fusion GPS, the business intelligence firm headed by former Wall Street Journalreporter Glenn Simpson. Simpson had initially begun investigating Trump and Russia at the behest of the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. Only later— once Trump had all but secured the nomination—did a law firm employed by the Democrats take over the Trump contract. The fact that Republicans opposed to Trump had begun the inquiry was nowhere to be found in Nunes’ memo.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dated July 19, 2016, Steele’s field memorandum was titled: “Russia: Secret Kremlin meetings attended by Trump advisor Carter Page in Moscow.”

       Collusion would mean that the trump campaign was made aware of russian attempts to influence the election. So the russians would have to say " we are going to fuck around with facebook, release damaging information on your opponent, and funnel money to your campaign through back channels that cant be traced."
Why would they do that? The only thing that produces is risk of being detected, especially with the trump campaign. Russia can do all of those things on it's own. Why would they expose themselves to what, ask permission?

       You're right, but actually collusion requires more than that. It requires at least two parties. In this case, Trump and "Russia" are the two parties. We assume that "Russia" means Putin or someone very close to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia can do whatever it did, but if there was no collusion between Russia and Trump to do what they did... well, there was no collusion.

       Maybe. We will never know, and it would have nothing to do with Trump either way.

       The way the Russians bought ads on Facebook was not done in a way to maximize the incredibly small budget they had to work with though.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't make an effort to target battleground states. They targeted "black activists", LGBT groups, Muslims, and all kinds of weird SJW advertisements. Some Russian ads were anti-Trump. Some Russian ads were pro-Hillary. It was a mess... completely all over the place with who they were trying to target (when they even bothered to target anyone at all).

       Or Putin knew that it wouldn't matter if he got caught doing it. He helps Trump get elected so the sanctions don't get put in place and for the US leadership to become a mockery. When people figure it out,  sit back and laugh because the US isn't going to do shit about it besides tear itself apart over it.

       That is certainly suspicious and doesn't look good for Trump, especially given the allegations of collusion.  But Russia might have just done it because they knew electing Trump would weaken the USA generally, cause division, cause chaos, and leave the USA focused inward with an incompetent administration in charge, leaving Russia to increase its influence worldwide.  I can definitely see why Russia would want to influence the election in Trump's favor even if there was no collusion.

       This is all true.  Except it would be of extra benefit for Russia to get more in return (like the release of frozen funds due to sanctions).  And this would be ignoring the Trump admin and advisors who are linked to Russia/Russian interests and have already been indicted.

       I don't think the narrative of Russians rigging the election is what people are focused on, what the concern is that Russia communicated with the Trump campaign and offered assistance in return for preferential treatment once elected. We know campaign officials were in communication with Russian officials. We know Russia attempted to influence the election, either via tarted ads or payments to organizations. We know the White House has decided to not enforce sanctions that were voted on and signed by Trump himself. We know Trump pressured Comey for his allegiance and also to make the Flynn problem disappear. We know that he fired Comey for his resistance to the previous two points. This is what people are concerned about.

       And you've known all of that for a long time, too. Like I said, Trump's opponents have had a year and a half of being on constant offense. Daily "bombshells" and leaks that were sure to bring him down. None of that worked out. We've been over this. Yes, Mueller is still investigating, but I'm fairly sure he's not still going over all this same stuff.

       Just because we haven't heard anything about Russian Facebook ads doesn't mean that it's no longer part of, contributing towards, or the focal point of a conviction. Often we use our opinions as justifications for things, and that's what I saw in your counter-argument above.

       All of those as insinuation without and actual evidence of wrongdoing.

       You essentially just made the argument that people are concerned about half truths that don't accurately describe what happened, or what continues to happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree. People are concerned about bullshit that turned out to be untrue. Now the onus is on those people to wake up and recognize the narrative they bought with their heart and soul turned out to be a political con by the opposing party.

       Flynn's conversation was deemed to be wholly legitimate by the FBI. You have to actually have an argument as to how this would be nefarious, because you are disagreeing with the FBI's assessment.

      <p>
       Because you know nothing about how leverage works.

      <p>
       CAATSA is a big fat report, detailing
       <em>

       </em>
       the specifics of Russia's oligarchical structure, and the people closest to Putin. This big fat report, when released into the public, serves as
       <em>
        a huge hammer
       </em>
       with which the US can smash Russia at any moment if they determine their actions are illegitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why in the world would they give up that leverage for nothing? Especially if it is, as they argue, working as a deterrent against behavior we would not like?
      </p>
      <p>
       You only think sanctions have been imposed because you have convinced yourself of the foolish narrative that Putin controls Trump, or some nonsensical derivation of that.

       This is my issue with Trump in a nutshell, not whether or not he had a golden shower in Moscow. I’ll be honest though, “conspiracy theorists” used to be academically honest people that would take the time to see through the facade the government is pushing on people. But r/conspiracy just seems to be a bunch of Trump shills. Seriously, when did conspiracy theorists go so far out of their way to protect the government from scrutiny.

       "Conspiracy theorists" has just come to mean people who are contrarian.  I think the Trump election has exposed that.  Now that the majority or people along with the media see all this evidence of Russia trying to influence elections it means the "conspiracy" people have to take the contrarian view.  Russia didn't really try to influence the elections but the media and other are trying to trick you into thinking they did.  It is more about feeling that you are one of the few who sees the truth than it is honest analysis of what is most likely.

        Now that the majority or people along with the media see all this evidence of Russia trying to influence elections it means the "conspiracy" people have to take the contrarian view. Russia didn't really try to influence the elections but the media and other are trying to trick you into thinking they did.

       Who here said that Russia didn't try to influence the election? Of course they tried. The issue all along has been "Trump-Russia collusion" but now you're trying to change it to a "one way agreement" in which no collusion actually happened? WTF? That is so dishonest.

       The Trump Jr meeting fits into this narrative too. The deep state attempted to get Trump Jr to suggest a quid pro qou, magnastki act reductions in exchange for hillary dirt. He didnt take the bait and just ended the meeting instead. Which was a setup all along to prove collusion and get FISA warrants on them. That didnt work, so they took steele's fairy tale to the court instead.

       It's possible. The Don Jr meeting at Trump Tower was June 2016, months before the FISA applications everyone is talking about now. Maybe they had an application rejected based on that lawyer and so they needed something else?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government's support for Mr. Trump - helped along by Aras and Emin.

       My question is though, if this Russia stuff is all made up and the meeting with Trump Jr. was just a conspiracy to make it look like there was a Russia connection, why did Trump Jr. not dispute or question that part of the email?
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine you're running for office and have no connections or dealings with Iran at all. Some Iranian guy sends you an email wanting to setup a meeting, and at the end he says "This is part of the Iranian government's support for your campaign." Wouldn't you be demanding some clarification on that? Wouldn't that set off some red flags?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the email was a trap to get Trump Jr. into a room with some Russians to make it look like there were connections and deals going on, did they know he was stupid enough to disregard a statement like that in an email and then self-publish the email chain on Twitter?

       Russia is the United States most important ally for virtually our whole history. They recognized the US very early, sent fleets and military advisors to support the Union against the British-supported South, were our allies in two World Wars and paid
       <em>

       to end the threat of the Nazis.

       The fact that the British probably murdered FDR to install their puppet Truman and start the lunatic Cold War that enabled the colonial powers to maintain their overseas holdings doesn't change anything. The USSR collapsed before the average redditor was born.

       What do you mean... for what? Do you think the Republicans wanted Trump? He ran against about 15 Republicans, insulted more than that, including the beloved (for some reason) war veteran John McCain, and, well, you get the idea. You could say that Trump was not their first choice...
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe his lawyer even told him to lay off for now. He hasn't lifted the previous sanctions, but if he puts these new ones in that are specifically about the election, it could be used against him by Mueller.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think by now that Mueller is scraping the bottom of the barrel of the investigation - he will not find collusion - and he would use anything like this just to pin something on Trump himself. Perhaps use it as an admission of guilt in some way. Remember how hesitant Trump always is, even just to admit that Russia tried to influence the election? He doesn't have to admit there was a two-way agreement (collusion), but he barely even wants to recognize publicly that there was a one-way influence campaign from Russia, which there obviously was.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see how excited everyone gets when "obstruction of justice" is mentioned, right? That's because it's the best case scenario for how the investigation ends if you don't like Trump. That's basically all you can hope for at this point, and it's still a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump was worried about collusion, the new sanctions would be in place. He's not concerned about how it looks, or how guilty it looks in the eyes of some people. Why is that? Is it because he's too stupid to know he shouldn't be that confident? Or... he just knows there is no collusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       It would also explain his lack of concern about how firing certain people would appear.
      </p>
      <p>
       You look at these things as the acts of a guilty man, and I definitely understand how you could see that. But it's just too obvious for there to be no real charges yet. If he was as stupid as people hoped he was, there would have been charges by now.

       But then how do you make that fit with the rest of the facts? He is too stupid to know he shouldn't be that confident, yet there have been no charges? This complete retard has managed to fool every intel agency?

       I understand we live in two different worlds - worlds of facts and alternative facts, but a characterizing theme of his presidency has been failure at nearly every step. There are things that he has done that I agree with, things I benefit from, but his framework for problem solving is mostly based off of blind confidence and gas lighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may not be charges for collusion - ever. You and I both know that isn't against the law. However, it is important we support our government agencies in defending our democratic systems from Russian interference. For people who don't support that, our president included, it is reasonable to suspect hidden motives.

       So, just pick something at random from my post and dispute it. Don't tire yourself out. Just dispute one fact. There is some opinion in there, but focus on the facts for now.

       Again, you have not disputed any of the facts presented. So this is an irrelevant talking point that is not effective on me. Your world may contain no facts at all, as far as I know.

       Another characterizing theme has been "resistance" at every step. Much more than the usual sour grapes after a humiliating election defeat. You know that.

       Now you're just going back to "he's stupid". We've been over that. Explain how this stupidity, and this "failure at nearly every step" has not brought out any evidence of "Trump-Russia collusion".

       I can't stand arguments like this. It's purely moving the goal posts. We have heard all along that it was "Trump-Russia collusion", and now that it's looking extremely unlikely that it happened, you and many others want to change the argument to "Russia tried to influence the election". Well, no shit. A lot of countries tried to influence the election, and they're not led by angels either.

       Let's do something about foreign influence on our elections. It's a dark day when the president wants to stand in the way of these investigations, even while he and others have acknowledged that he is not targeted, although some obviously think he's implicated.

       So, what exactly are you arguing with me about then? If you don't think there was collusion, why are you arguing with me in my post about there not being any collusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       And to only say that "some" think he's implicated is incredibly dishonest. It's more than some. It's a lot. It really does seem like you're trying to play down the widely believed accusation that "Trump colluded with Russia."
      </p>
      <p>
       I  mean... that is the basis of the Steele dossier. And one of the key parts of the Steele dossier is Carter Page. Hence my original post discussing these two key figures.
      </p>

       Maybe you never believed that personally, but it's silly to try to deny that it's the mainstream opinion at this point.

       You got a shitstorm because you're posting a Fox news article on r/conspiracy. The mods here have said they're gone if this is just another political sub. One of our most recent top posts is why Avril Lavine was replaced with a doppelganger in 2003. That's what people come here for. There are plenty of subs for mainstream media.

       For a start, Steele himself does not claim that the dossier is entirely true. He admits at least some of it is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a long read, but
       <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2017/10/25/what-the-trump-dossier-says-and-what-it-doesnt/">
        this article
       </a>
       is a decent start. Just get a coffee first and be prepared to sit through a lot of
       <em>
        "Well, this is still unverified for now..."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that most articles are written from the point of "which parts are true" and not the other way around. Because, obviously, the parts that can be proven true would make a very small article. ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
       And, again, because it's basically impossible to prove a negative. You can't prove to me that you have never been to the moon.

       It has already been proven to contain false information by others, so I don't know why you're so adamant about defending a non-point here. Nobody thinks his dossier is 100% accurate.

       And that makes the other 10% - 30%... what?
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words: he thinks it's about 3/4 accurate, but most of that 3/4 is still unverified. This isn't an opinion. You can read on any news website you like. The Steele Dossier remains mostly unverified, and there is false information in it.

       There are parts of the dossier that have been proven false, and there are very large parts of the dossier that remain unverified. That's just the way it is.

       This "veteran spy" fucked up so badly that he put information in the dossier about the wrong Michael Cohen, the kind of mistake some kid on the chans would make when trying to doxx:

       Because you don't seem to get it. You keep putting words in my mouth, trying to claim that I said the whole dossier was false. I didn't say that. It is mostly unverified. I have shown you at least one giant error in it - the kind of false information that suggests the work of an amateur, or a has-been, once-great, agent who let his desperation and admitted bias take hold.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that you don't want to think bad thoughts about Steele and his dossier, because he makes up such a large part of the entire collusion narrative that you're invested in, but at some point you just need to face the facts. The dossier was just a dud at first, but now due to the FISA scandal it is a liability.

       It's not Cohen's own words. He showed his passport stamps. He gave an alibi that was checked out. And then it was revealed the whole thing was a

       Wait so let me get this straight if a dossier funded by your own "team" with 0 evidence of anything in it makes a claim then everything in it is true?? If logic wasn't insane enough you are also saying that an accused saying he is innocent is somehow evidence of guilt and that he is lying??

         Claims:
        </strong>
        One of the more significant reports, it again asserts that Page met with Rosneft chief executive Sechin in July. At the meeting, Sechin offered Page and Trump a 19 percent stake in Rosneft in exchange for lifting sanctions on Russia if elected.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also asserts that Cohen, Trump’s lawyer, was playing a “key role” in the Russia-Trump relationship.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Analysis:
        </strong>
        The Rosneft claim received a lot of attention when, in January, a 19.5 percent stake in the company was sold to an unknown buyer. Later reporting, though, indicated that the buyers were companies based in Qatar and Switzerland. It was essentially a loan, and Moscow prearranged to buy back some of the company from the Qataris.

       So, without wasting another day going point by point through one of these posts, opening with calling the Russia investigation "the official story" conveniently ignores that the party in power over our government is actively disputing it/"fighting back". It's actually kind of remarkable that you would claim the story coming out of the White House is not "the official story".

       I guess you could see that as a strange way to word it. But you know what I mean, and you're just using it in an attempt to avoid the contents of the post. The story that "Trump colluded with Russia" is basically the default position at this point. Right? It's very mainstream, you could say.

       Just because a lot of people agree with a conspiracy theory doesn't stop it from being a conspiracy theory, or make it "the official story". I know it helps prime people to buy into your post, but the story President pushes is pretty much the definition of "the official story", no matter how stupid or obviously deceitful it may be.

       Wait... so Trump is alleged to have colluded with Russia, but in your mind you're allowing Trump to put out the official story on his own crime?
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't that a bit like allowing Osama Bin Laden to have the official story on 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't it be the ones making the initial accusation, which was widely believed, who are putting out the official story? Anything else is a rebuttal to that initial story, right?

       No, in the same way that, say, Pizzagate is not the official story, despite it being the accusation. The official story comes from the people in power, and Trump is in the most powerful position of all as President.

       I understand what you're saying, but I just don't agree here. The "people in power" at the time this story was created did include the president, heads of intel agencies, 90% of the media and Hollywood, many high level politicians, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously they weren't all conspiring. They just followed along. Very few of them actually saw any source documents until recently. A lot of them were probably sincerely worried at first.

       If you assume that every person in the world is out to get your guy, you can handwave away anything. You want to know why I didn't waste my time going point by point through your post? It's because if you pre-suppose the existence of a massive conspiracy out to get Trump then there is no common ground to debate on.

       Sure. I mean, I share the view of the other person you were replying to, I think it's a bit ridiculous to assume there's a massive conspiracy across party lines to illegally take down the President. I think there's still some handwaving going on, but it doesn't help to say that literally everyone is out to get Trump. That's just patently false

       Actually, this one is at 11, roughly double the prior post in the chain. I would expect either my previous reference to Pizzagate attracted some downvotes/turned off some upvoters, or my higher post was just of higher quality/more pithy.

       Further down the comment chain, we're still at a uniform 9 upvotes for everyone defending CIA propaganda, and all of the comments questioning this nonsense get downvoted to -4 where they won't be seen.

       Reddit voting is systematically manipulated and not an accurate measure of what people actually think.

       Actually this post has a few fewer upvotes than my previous in the chain, which is fairly typical behavior on Reddit. People who upvoted the first comment will generally upvote the second, although some will fall off due to boredom or disinterest with the chain.

       I don't believe you, because I've seen this exact comment pattern too many times. But if you are being truthful, then you need to think for yourself and do some research on how frequently the voting is manipulated on reddit, and stop supporting the people doing the manipulating.

       The Dossier claims that Russia was cultivating Trump for 8 years...that’s ridiculous at face value.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also tried to use the fact that he was offered lucrative land deals in Russia, buuuuut turned them down, as evidence that he is somehow beholden to Russia. He turned down the people he was supposedly coopted by? Sure that makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter Page’s released testimony is a long, but interesting read. That guys shreds “Russian Collusion” in his opening statement. He’s also emphatic of his innocence, has never lawyered up for this, has already met with Mueller, is not under indictment and stated that neither Mueller or his team stated he should expect to be indicted in the future, and I assume he’s going to be suing a very large number of people and entities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile the author of the Dossier is suspected of perjury by the US, UK, and FBI, disclosed his findings to media outlets knowing they would disclose information they couldn’t possibly corroborate and that he himself, despite a $50,000 offer of payment-for-corroboration from the FBI, could not corroborate, did not show for his court appearance in London, accepted intel sourced from Clinton confidants (albeit subsequently to the initial dossier). And oh yeah (best part) was working on behalf of the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly get the impression that a lot of people commenting so passionately on “Trump Russia” have never even read the Dossier or Crowdstrike’s report, or the “Intelligence Community Assessment” related to “Russian Interference”.

       Christopher Steele may have gotten the info from the Russians. Which means Putin (ex-KGB) was feeding him a 4chan hoax, knowing that they would leak it to the press and look like morons when everyone realized it was a 4chan hoax.

       You could try, and this is just a suggestion, not getting triggered by people's stupid Reddit comments to the point you report them to national law enforcement. Again just a suggestion, but maybe you could just downvote them and move on or if it's breaking Reddit tos or the rules of the sub just report them to the mods.

       Unfortunately for you and your world view, the fact that Jews are the main peddlers of Russophobia is plain to see and document. First coming from the Neocons and now the main stream. Just because you're unfamiliar with it does not mean it doesn't exist. The reason we're here in Conspiracy is because we cannot state matters of fact without the shame units wiping them. Free speech is a beautiful thing. Maybe you'd better wake up to your agitators by studying what happened to Russia 100 years ago. That was also a conspiracy. Conspiracy fact, not theory. The Russians have still not recovered from what the Communists did to them r/ComJewPix

       My thought is most Americans do not care about Russia. They care about feeding their families and having a decent life. IMO, this is why Trump won the electoral college. Trump being shady didn't bother his voters/non voters, and won't bother most now. Rather, voting for him has like the metaphor of throwing a brick at the political elites who have ignored the plight of the poor and working class. If dems care more about Russia then they do about actual policies to help the working class, they will lose again.

       Weiner foremost in the Dem way of thinking, because his wrongs are most understandable to the average public.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the FBI related people more than likely. They are the thugs that get cut loose as chaff. Weiner would twist someone's arm to make sure this is the choice that happens instead. The Dem elite all know each others' fuck stories and have been complicit in one anothers' raping and rape to ensure and guarantee by threat mutual silence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the FBI have a point of compromise in the DNC, then someone straight down the middle would be turned over instead, like Huma Abedin. Close to the most guilty looking but also potentially a fuckup in everyone's. They could easily manufacture evidence that she was behind some bevvy of hacks and leaks and mishandling of information and the FBI would quickly run with it, close investigation, and bribe a judge to get it all closed as quickly as possible. The papers would parade it as somehow a liberal success and turn their sites right back to Trump. Of course the trial of Abedin would see a photograph of her shaking hands or speaking to a Russia  of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wishing this actually all crawls right back up Hillary Clinton's leg would be like Icarus trying to fly to the sun. By the time any one of Clinton's wrongs got shouted in public enough to irritate the average public to care, a slew of other people would be going down for the crime in her place, some as sycophantic martyrs. Podesta would probably be found suicided soon after the allegations.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you throw of all four of them , I guess there's some non-politically active elite like Harvey Weinstein. Big, in the spotlight, already starting to admit guilty feelings from a remote location. Or just another hit parade of well known film makers and underground art show super freaks. Another few years of that though and Hollywood will be bled dry.
      </p>
      <p>
       So. Honestly I think it'll go:
      </p>
      <p>
       I. Hollywood
II. Abedin
III. FBI
IV. Weiner
V. Podesta
VI. Clinton
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I doubt the American public's fucks to give ratio will get them past level 2.

       Hah... it does seem like that way sometimes, but I still enjoy it. I know most of the downvotes aren't from people who actually took the time to read anything. They just hit and run without an argument or even a comment.

       Yes. That's it. No amount of evidence I could produce could ever sway your mind. Trump could hold a press conference and admit:
- He's either actively cooperated with the Russian government to influence our election, or he purposefully looked away
- He's trying to destroy the United States from within
- He's not a billionaire
- He cheated on Melania
- He doesn't want to be President at all
- He will not stop until he is a dictator for life
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, anyone with an ounce of sense would believe these things because Trump is a self-absorbed idiot who cannot tell the truth. But you guys, you guys, you're just
       <em>
        convinced
       </em>
       of the opposite. So why bother? My blood pressure thanks me. Have a great day!

       "Trump" is literally your most used word on reddit, and damn near 100% of your posts are in r/conspiracy. It's not a difficult conclusion to draw. You vehemently argue against every negative accusation or comment made about him, regardless of facts, by claiming there's some grand conspiracy against him. Your position is ideological. It's jingoistic. And it's transparent as fuck.

       What's the problem? That I am focused, while you're a scatterbrain? Am I not allowed to have interests? Should I post about Pokemon or something to make you happy? Maybe my 4th and 5th most used words on Reddit should be "fuck" and "shit"

       I wouldn't normally do this, but since you want to analyze my post history... let's see where you were about 7 months ago as well:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I'm going to lose everything. Can't seem to get out of this hole. I guess I shouldn't really be surprised. Born to poverty, die in poverty. Fuck this life. (gofundme.com)

      <p>
       That's right. You were suicidal and begging for money on Reddit. Like I said, I didn't want to do this. I'm not heartless. But you want to play detective... so this is how it has to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next time, just stick to the facts. You have none, zero argument, so it turned out this way. Sorry.

       You're obsessed. Our accounts are roughly the same age. If 100% of my comments were in this sub, and my most commonly used words was "Hillary", and in every context in which I used that word was in defense of Hillary, would you not think I was some kind of pro Hillary conspiracy shill?

       Like I said: next time stick to the facts. Come up with an argument. Don't just be a little bitch about it, searching through someone's history in order to avoid the facts. It makes you look like a fool who can't express himself without baseless insults and "shill" accusations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you were talking non-stop about Hillary, I'd never know about it, because I wouldn't care enough to go searching. I would take your comments as they are, without playing amateur detective on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, you really should delete all of those posts you made begging for money before you try this same avoidance tactic on someone else. They may not be as nice as I was about it.

       Your posting history about Trump is incredibly relevant to the context of this submission. Don't pretend like it's not. That's why reddit makes your posting history public.
      </p>
      <p>
       Face it. You're a Trump lackey who will never be critical of him, no matter what. This, by definition, makes you a shill. It colors everything you say about him with personal bias. You aren't concerned with facts. You are concerned with defending Trump, and nothing else. When your bias is that obvious, your argument is meaningless.

People who actually care about those facts that you keep mentioning, tend to suppress their bias as much as possible during political discourse.

       Again, facts don't matter to you. Blind support of Trump is what matters to you. In 7 months, you have not had one critical word to say about the president who holds the lowest approval rating of at least the last 7 presidents in their first year. The fact that you don't understand why this is an issue is exactly why I brought it up. The fact that you can't even defend your position with anything other than personal insults and "go away' tactics is why your submission is worthless. You don't want to debate facts. Facts will not change your position or your mind.

        The Rosneft claim received a lot of attention when, in January, a 19.5 percent stake in the company was sold to an unknown buyer. Later reporting, though, indicated that the buyers were companies based in Qatar and Switzerland. It was essentially a loan, and Moscow prearranged to buy back some of the company from the Qataris.

       Oh but it is - it is the basis of the collusion accusations, along with Carter Page being one of the main accused. That's what this entire post is about. Page and Steele. The two main characters still standing in this collusion story.
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you understand why people think it's so unlikely that Carter Page was involved? The TV interviews with no lawyer, the blanket denials and legal action against alleged slander, or how about his history of co-operating with the FBI against Russian spies?
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't think Putin might have done a little background research before trusting an FBI snitch with the task of colluding with a US presidential candidate? And if Putin is that stupid to choose Carter Page... why didn't that stupidity generate any evidence that could be used so far?
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have to agree here though. Mueller is still investigating. We'll just see what happens.

       And you asked for another dossier claim that was proven false. The Rosneft "deal":

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Claims:
        </strong>
        One of the more significant reports, it again asserts that Page met with Rosneft chief executive Sechin in July. At the meeting, Sechin offered Page and Trump a 19 percent stake in Rosneft in exchange for lifting sanctions on Russia if elected.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also asserts that Cohen, Trump’s lawyer, was playing a “key role” in the Russia-Trump relationship.
       </p>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Analysis:
        </strong>
        The Rosneft claim received a lot of attention when, in January, a 19.5 percent stake in the company was sold to an unknown buyer. Later reporting, though, indicated that the buyers were companies based in Qatar and Switzerland. It was essentially a loan, and Moscow prearranged to buy back some of the company from the Qataris.

       Yes. That's it. No amount of evidence I could produce could ever sway your mind. Trump could hold a press conference and admit:
- He's either actively cooperated with the Russian government to influence our election, or he purposefully looked away
- He's trying to destroy the United States from within
- He's not a billionaire
- He cheated on Melania
- He doesn't want to be President at all
- He will not stop until he is a dictator for life
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, anyone with an ounce of sense would believe these things because Trump is a self-absorbed idiot who cannot tell the truth. But you guys, you guys, you're just
       <em>
        convinced
       </em>
       of the opposite. So why bother? My blood pressure thanks me. Have a great day!

       "Trump" is literally your most used word on reddit, and damn near 100% of your posts are in r/conspiracy. It's not a difficult conclusion to draw. You vehemently argue against every negative accusation or comment made about him, regardless of facts, by claiming there's some grand conspiracy against him. Your position is ideological. It's jingoistic. And it's transparent as fuck.

       But not everyone goes to such great lengths to display their bias. People who actually care about those facts that you keep mentioning, tend to suppress their bias as much as possible during political discourse. You wear it on your sleeve, which renders your entire argument void. Facts don't matter when you've made up your mind before obtaining said facts.
