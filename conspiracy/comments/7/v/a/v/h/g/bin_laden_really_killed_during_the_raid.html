They had pictures of the bodies of all the people the SEALs killed that night.. but no pictures of bin laden, and they threw the body in the sea..</p>

<p>I think it’s glaringly obvious he was taken alive and tortured for info, yes probably long dead now</p>

<p>But with all the leaks of recent times, has there been any confirmation of any of this? </p>

When we would conduct dismounted patrols through the local villages I would ask the interpreter to ask some of the people where Bin Laden was(half joking/half serious). The response that I received was that he was dead. I thought that these we bs answers because I was all about the government not lying to me. Years later looking back I think there may have been some truth to what the people were saying. </p>
