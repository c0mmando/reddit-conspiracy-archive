       Most people don't realize this and I often hear complaints when people talk about "if you hate censorship, just make your own Twitter." Well, that would be easy if you had people funding you to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars and over a decade later you still weren't expected to be profitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       (

       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn't that unusual. Google's only profitable venture is Google Search. Everything else, including YouTube, bleeds money. So when people have no problem with censorship on these platforms I don't think they fully understand the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why are they still around if they just lose their investor's money? Unless.......

       reddit is the biggest work of all time. Well maybe not the biggest but it's up there.
      </p>
      <p>
       "What if we made a website, that looked like it was user content, but it was really advertisements masquerading as people posting interesting stuff. I mean for anyone to even consider paying us for this service though we would have to make sure there was some system in place that we controlled to push the purchased ads above all the actual user generated comments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, once we get this set up, we can make it look like the website was """"never profitable"""" to begin with. That should save us quite a bit on taxes, eh?"

       Most large corporations try to report as little profit as possible, so as to minimize their taxes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any profits they have will be turned into C-level bonuses or investments that get taxed at a lower rate (assets, real estate, etc).

       "Twitter has lost $2 billion since in 2011" That's not minimizing reported profits, that's bleeding money.

       <p>
        Previously, two Russian state entities closely linked with the Kremlin - Gazprom Investholding and VTB Bank - had funded investment vehicles associated with Milner (DST USA II and DST Investments 3) to take stakes in Silicon Valley giants.
       </p>
       <p>
        The investment in Twitter by DST Investments 3 was part-funded with $191m from VTB in 2011. The stake was sold about six months after Twitter floated on the stock market, returning a profit of $240m.

       You gotta believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       But really, just like most tech unicorns, including FB account fudginess, it is sustained by massive investments and the hope of these investors into being on the "next big thing". The expectation is that, in the future, these companies will eventually turn out a profit, bad become the future Google, Microsoft or Apple.
      </p>
      <p>
       What really buoyed all this was almost a decade of QE and ZIRP. The stock market has been a giant bubble since the Lehman crash. So with an abundance of easy cash, all this "nonsense" has perpetuated for this long.

       twitter is a tool for top down information control using appeals to popularity. it wasn't envisioned as such but it's definitely taken on that form now
      </p>
      <p>
       the thing that made me realize that almost everything on the platform is completely made up was james comey having nearly a million likes and retweets and follows on his tweets about FISA and yet i didn't see a single tweet response that wasn't ripping that guy a new asshole. supposedly hundreds of thousands of people agree with him enough to like his tweet and yet none of them left a comment? those numbers had to be entirely fabricated or they're bots liking tweets but.. that's a much more troubling explanation for their business model.

       Look at uber as another example - despite delivering a physical service, they lose massive amounts of money every quarter.  Their investors are ok with this because they hope uber will one day completely monopolize the “taxi” market and become incredibly profitable.  Not how I would choose to spend my money, but it’s not an irrational strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is arguably a conspiracy, but not in the way you described.  It’s pretty unfair that Uber has so much private equity money that they can afford to operate at a loss until every independent cab has gone out of business, but that doesn’t mean they’re a sinister front for something.  Same logic applies to the tech companies you mentioned.  The conspiracy is that they’re so rich they can operate at a loss until we’re completely addicted to them, at which point they’ll try to make back all that money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Welcome to late capitalism, where Silicon Valley will throw billions of dollars behind any half baked idea and let tech bros burn it for years, but the rest of us can’t get a loan to start a small business.

       elon musk has cultivated a cult of personality to prevent anyone from calling him out on his bullshit
      </p>
      <p>
       'elon musk is going to save humanity with awesome technology' is just marketing. realizing that tesla is lying about their numbers threatens the idea so people don't want to admit it
      </p>
      <p>
       every single sales figure chart is like this. it appears that tesla is doing insanely well but they have framed the comparison in such a manner that they win the race before it starts

       Twitter and YouTube are both propped up by expectations that they'll eventually turn a profit. Each one has literally billions of users, and I think understandably investors are hopeful that somehow the huge userbases will somehow be monetized. The strategies atm are ads and data collection which help but still haven't nailed it.

       I miss the old YouTube. I had a channel from 08-12 or so. There Was SO MUCH MORE conspiracy content back then and great channels. 
Anyone remember Nuffrespects channel with the 911 videos. Even with them manipulating view counts he was probably hitting 10 million on some stuff. 
I still spend a lot of time there for news clips, conspiracy analysis and documentaries and live music. 
The amount of channels that were shut down I don't know but it was probably thousands. I had 600 videos. Political confrontations I did. Short documentaries. 
There is stuff lost forever that I used to could find easily.

       Money can be used as a tool it's how you use it. Why be dependent on money when you can control it, and use it to consolidate more power using money as the foundation to achieve total control over institutions and governments of the world and thus the people. After all currency is practiced all around the world, it's already intertwined from governments, economies, and our private lives. People have known about the influence financial institutions can have on business and industrt for a long time it's really nothing new, it's just not a lot of people know about it.

       Don’t pm him, he is trying to get subscribers to his paid vlog site and YouTube channel. Step2thejep is likely John Le Bon and he wants $20 a month for his wisdom... he got banned from shilling his own site on this sub... hence the PM.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of his ideas are based in a lack of understanding even basic physics and many of his free posts have no substance but shill his paid content.
      </p>
      <p>
       In one video he asserts missiles cannot fly in level flight because he doesn’t understand basic physics, is proven wrong in the comments, makes a video pretending to admit wrong and then concludes he should just keep his material behind a paywall. If you argue with him and show him equations and papers on missle flight/control he calls it drawings and theory. Show him videos of missiles in flight and they are doctored. His own theory is based on drawings, misunderstanding if basic physics and conjecture and it seems like the only proof he might accept is if someone strapped him to a missle and fired him from a fighter jet. Then when he got called out on it made another video where he pretended to retract his first video, then doubled down and decided it best he stay behind his pay wall.

That's probably a good way to get a ban. Shame because they seem like pretty open minded folk. All my research is on my sub reddits free and i can't imagine trying to make money off of people who are just trying to peek behind the curtain. Skeezy.

       "...he asserts missiles cannot fly in level flight because he doesn't understand basic physics..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming we are talking about old fashioned or wingless missles (where it's basically just an explosive rocket with guidance fins as opposed to a modern winged flying drone with built in warhead type missile), can missiles actually maintain level flight? I thought gravitational pull was always a consideration when calculating trajectories and what not because the only thing generating lift on a missile is the propulsion system? I googled "Can missiles maintain level flight?" and got all kinds of non-related stuff about aircrafts and pilot manuevers and such. Thanks in advance.

       Basically aside from cruise missiles which have winglets or lifting bodies like the LRSM most missiles use vectored thrust, control surfaces, or tines to slightly point the nose of the missile upwards so that some part of the thrust vector counteracts gravity while the control surfaces or directed thrust keep the nose of the missile pointed upwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is not terribly efficient but it helps with aerodynamics and maneuverability. Long range missiles like the LRSM were efficiency is more of a priority have mechanisms to generate lift but they are subsonic and very long range. Ballistic missiles rely on a ballistic or orbital trajectory for efficiency.

       He doesn't believe modern anti air/ ground/ ship missles can exist because they don't generate enough lift... send him videos of these missiles in flight and papers on missle theory and he yells at you about primary sources.

       The key to Google Twitter and Facebook is how they all promote group psychology. Apparently, it's pretty easy to manipulate large groups of people without them ever have a clue.

       Twitter promotes groupthink. So does Facebook. I think we've all got plenty of experience with how strongly Reddit does this too.

       If that's true, then isn't the government supporting a monopoly? Shouldn't someone be able to start their own version of these companies to compete in the free market and also be eligible for government funding or have a viable suit against the government for only supporting a monopoly?

       Yes, the government is supporting a monopoly, but I think it is mostly the CIA.  They are using these companies to perform unconstitutional acts that a government agency is not supposed to perform.

      <p>
       As soon as the CIA is dealt with, the MSM will change, and all of this (or most of it) illegal surveillance of U.S. citizens will cease.

       Because profit is dead. Investors put their faith in leadership and growth. Amazon is the most disruptive company in the largest economy in the world, and turns negligible profits at BEST. Snapchat has never made a profit, Uber doesn’t make a profit, but these are companies worth tens of billions. This is an indicator of a changing marketplace, not of a conspiracy.

       malls are weird because they have contracts and technically none of the businesses own their space. the owner of the mall is interested in the psychological feeling of being in a mall and doesn't want customers to think 'wow this mall sure has a lot of closed businesses" so you definitely get situations where small businesses get paid to keep their storefront open even if they don't make a lot of money
      </p>
      <p>
       also, those businesses cost basically nothing to run. you have the labor of maybe 3-4 people and almost all of your expenses are the lease payment/utilities, they figure they'd lose more money from the psychological impact of an empty storefront than paying three teenagers minimum wage to sell candles

       Situations where small businesses end up not having to pay rent in the mall? That's hard to believe. And even then, the store wouldn't be making enough to pay employees and still turn a decent profit.

       That happened with my BBQ place after 9 years as we were discussing closing down the landlord said the city did not want empty business's and the news did not want to cover another business closing so we could stay rent free for a while, that lasted about a  year....

       SAME HERE, I owned a BBQ joint for 9 years and scraped by working my tail off, I had a candy shop next to me that never had any customers, kids clothing shop, and several others that I knew had virtually zero customers ever.
       <br/>
       I did some digging most of them could be simply explained. Two of them in fact were losing money for years (this did not go over well when I asked basic questions about their overhead and sales as a fellow business owner)but run by wives of rich men. It is basically their "job" to play business owner in their little shop. They go to the Chamber meetings socialize etc....Just a hobby no differen than paying for a club membership somewhere...
      </p>
      <p>
       NOW, a furniture shop and a few others I determined were without question front companies for drugs, money laundering or any number of possible things.
Perfect example of the world is never what it seems on the surface. all these shops or eating places and only a handful turning an actual profit from the actual business.

       Reminds me of the 'King of the Hill' episode where Peggy tries to run a bookstore and doesn't make any money. Turns out the lady she bought it from had a rich husband that paid for everything so she could have her snobby book club. Peggy ends up letting a friend sell guns out of the basement of the bookstore.

       I guess we're learning about the way the FBI actually works now though. Instead of stopping money laundering companies, they're looking into presidential opponents.

       with furniture shops, mattress shops, and other low-volume high-price outlets that seem like they should never be profitable, basically their entire stock is borrowed. like dealerships. the manufacturer wants to have their products on display in a storefront because the purchasing experience is part of the reason why they can charge two grand for a chair
      </p>
      <p>
       the e-cigarette shops in my city seemed like they are drug fronts but a little digging makes you realize they were buying outdated stock wholesale and selling at insane markup. $40 'starter kits' are like five dollars worth of goods if you bought them online and who knows how low the price gets if you're buying wholesale

       Without knowledge of their exact history, accounting and tax code.
       <br/>
       Mom and pop small brick and mortar owner here.  From the viewpoint of the cash register and checkbook, I make a decent profit at the end of the year. 
After I do taxes, I’ve been loosing 300-10000 a year.  I think the biggest loophole is the personal vehicle deduction.  I pay for gas out of my own pocket, but get to take the base deduction per mile.  That changes my situation by $3000 a year.  There are other capital improvements and repairs that help. (New 13k hvac this year) that offset profits.

       We do.  And this year, it's only about $100.  Usually get 300-1000 back. 
So, diving deeper, the ~5000 of untaxed income from elsewhere didn't get canceled out with the loss from Schedule C.  Didn't affect the personal earnings as much as hoped.

       Somebody below mentioned these companies are propped up by taxpayer funded subsidies. I've heard it mentioned before? Is that true? If it is then isn't the government supporting a monopoly? Shouldn't someone be able to start their own version of these companies to compete in the free market and also be eligible for government funding? If not then wouldn't that hypothetical start-up have a viable suit against the government for only supporting monopolies?

       It's basically a giant (legal) Ponzi scheme.
They keep taking more and more venture capital to cover costs. As more and more capital has been injected, new valuations go up, which in turn lires in even more venture capital.
