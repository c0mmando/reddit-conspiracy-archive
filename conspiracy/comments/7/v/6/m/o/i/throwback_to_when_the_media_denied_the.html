       One overlooked issue with the FBI wiretapping was that the FBI was leaking info they gathered as fast as they could get it. If you think back to the first few months of the Trump presidency, you'll remember all of the leaks. At first it was whenever Trump was at the White House but his transition team's phones were obviously tapped. He traveled to Trump Tower and the same thing happened. It wasn't until he started operating out of the Mar a Lago compound that the leaks stopped

       Lol he has incompetent staff and is known to cause his own leaks by calling individuals he believes to be his friends as well.

      <p>
       I can’t honestly believe you’re trying to get a two for one by  excusing his trips down Mar a Lago — where he lines his own pockets, looks like a total hypocrite golfing, and puts stress on nat sec — by saying that where he ‘needs’ to be because ‘muh leaks’

       And the most important and often overlooked element of his frequent trips to Mar-a-Lago: There are no records kept of who he talks to while he's there.

       Jesus, how can a conspiracy sub can just blindly ignore a President currently under investigation for colluding with foreign nationals keeping us in dark about who he talks to?

       Agreed - not so simple. You're oversimplifying it by making Trump a messiah who's under threat by the deep state. I genuinely believe that most people are ready to accept it as truth if there's nothing uncovered that implicates Trump in anything. But are you ready to accept it if he is implicated? Because he sure is behaving like a guilty person. And I for the life of me cannot understand why anyone in a conspiracy subreddit would be fighting hard for any president.

       You said Messiah, not me. And he's not just any "President".

       You should watch some of his older interviews from the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s.

       Are you prepared to accept it if he's proven innocent, and it turns out that the Obama administration weaponized they government against a duly elected president?

       Yeah, I'm aware of who Trump is. I didn't like him in the 80s, 90s, or 2000s. There's nothing about him that appeals to me. But if he's proven innocent, so be it. I'm perfectly content to have an innocent president I don't particularly like. He's temporary and I will see many more presidents in my day. My question remains though, will you accept it if he's proven guilty?
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, "messiah" was hyperbole, but the notion that he's not just any "president" is exactly my point.  I don't care who the president is, our government was set up to not pin our hopes and dreams on any one person. It's something I really appreciate about our government.

       It's funny that Drain the Swamp is one of the mottos. DT literally is part of the swamp. He's the guy that bribes corrupt politicians. Now as a politician we see him continuously throw little tantrums when his attempts at corrupt behavior are rebuffed. Comical.

       Trumpians use the Deep State to shift any blame from trump and maintain a constant "enemy" for trump to rile the US against. It's classic dictator methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
       This time it's incredibly dangerous though, as Trumps made up "enemy" is part of the US government itself.

       In a way I agree, I just think it's more innocuous than it's made out to be. There needs to be continuity within our intelligence and law enforcement agencies across presidential terms. It can't all start over with a new president. There needs to be people within these organizations working independently in long-term US policy and strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, they still serve at the behest of the president. They can't just go against presidential authority. They can't assassinate or target presidents just because the president disagrees with them.

       But as we know from Snowden and other whistleblowers, the FBI and the US intelligence agencies have so much information on what's going on in the world that the FBI probably knew themselves from other technology there was no such meeting with Carter Page and these
Russians pretended otherwise just so they could spy on Trump people.
Exactly like a cheater who has stolen the answers to the exam questions ahead of the exam, the FBI has access to all the raw intel on everyone, courtesy of the NSA. When they need to "get" someone, and everyone is guilty of breaking
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       law, the FBI just pulls the "answer" from the NSA data. Then it creates the legal fig leaf of going thru whatever motions are still required to preserve the illusion that the country operates under a law of checks and balances with peoples' rights preserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through Hillary, the FBI was obsessed with spying on the Trump campaign. The FBI pulls the raw intel and finds... nothing of substance to use as a pretext. Apparently the best they could find was Carter Page talking to a Russian. But you can't go to the FISA court and say you need to wiretap the guy based on your wiretap info from the guy you want to wiretap. Doesn't look good. So they unearth the article in Yahoo news as their non-wiretap "source".

       That's a wonderful assumption you made there. Surely the most logical conclusion is not that Carter Page, who has openly bragged about his Kremlin connections, merited surveillance, but rather that Obama and the FBI conspired to spy on Trump through his super suspicious but totally innocent coffee boy.

       Spying on political opposition using foreign agent Intel that is salacious and unverified to obtain FISA warrants is the premise.   Focusing on the use of a word to dismiss the scale of the crime is a weak tactic.  Trump was spied on and he.  claimed Democrats and Obama did it. The MSM and the minion army laughed it off then and are trying to spin now the truth is out..  Truth hurts

       You do know of the three degrees of separation rule, right? The FBI sent Page to Russia, then sent him to infiltrate the Trump campaign, then asked FISA for a warrant on Page. Since he worked on the Trump campaign Trump and the entire campaign is well within the three degrees of separation. Would you mind if Trump did this next election? No? Then demand consequences now.

       Was it revealed recently that Page was an informant of the FBI or something? I'm asking because I haven't heard of this yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct. If Page was wiretapped, those he communicated with on the campaign trail would be privy to surveillance as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would certainly be floored if Obama was responsible for executing this sort of Trojan horse of surveillance. If this were revealed to have been the case, I would absolutely demand consequences—the same goes for Trump.

       I personally believe that the Military Industrial Complex will dig through a person's life if that person has shown interest in a significant position in politics. Perhaps the most targeted people for surveillance would be presidential candidates. Are we to believe that a certain faction of the government would just allow someone to become president without first conducting some surveillance? Anyone who believes that is naive and ignorant.
      </p>
      <p>
       William Binney (Former high level NSA analyst, also whistleblower pre-Snowden): “At least 80% of fibre-optic cables globally go via the US”, Binney said. “This is no accident and allows the US to view all communication coming in. At least 80% of all audio calls, not just metadata, are recorded and stored in the US. The NSA lies about what it stores.”

      <p>
       Nearly everything is recorded, and when someone becomes a target, all they have to do is look through already recorded communications.

       There is a documentary about Binney and other NSA whistleblowers on Netflix called "A Good American."

       "Voice print":
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The technology works by analyzing the physical and behavioral features that make each person’s voice distinctive, such as the pitch, shape of the mouth, and length of the larynx. An algorithm then creates a dynamic computer model of the individual’s vocal characteristics. This is what’s popularly referred to as a “voiceprint.” The entire process — capturing a few spoken words, turning those words into a voiceprint, and comparing that representation to other “voiceprints” already stored in the database — can happen almost instantaneously. Although the NSA is known to rely on finger and face prints to identify targets, voiceprints, according to a 2008 agency document, are “where NSA reigns supreme.”

       Do you think Carter page is a decent average American? The same as Johnny football? 
Hint: he's not. He was a known shady person, the same as Paul manafort &amp; Steve banon , and trump hired them all anyway.

       And it wasn't even Page IIRC. The wiretap in Trump tower was because they were surveilling Manafort.  These are Trump's "best people".

       There always changing the narrative and people  are too stupid and dumb to realize there doing it cuz they are already brainwashed, believing everything the media tells them. First it's we don't care about the memo, it means nothing. Now it's, CIA straight up saying that they are gonna take out Trump cuz they've been here longer

       But as we know from Snowden and other whistleblowers, the FBI and the US intelligence agencies have so much information on what's going on in the world that the FBI probably knew themselves from other technology there was no such meeting with Carter Page and these
Russians pretended otherwise just so they could spy on Trump people.
Exactly like a cheater who has stolen the answers to the exam questions ahead of the exam, the FBI has access to all the raw intel on everyone, courtesy of the NSA. When they need to "get" someone, and everyone is guilty of breaking
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       law, the FBI just pulls the "answer" from the NSA data. Then it creates the legal fig leaf of going thru whatever motions are still required to preserve the illusion that the country operates under a law of checks and balances with peoples' rights preserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through Hillary, the FBI was obsessed with spying on the Trump campaign. The FBI pulls the raw intel and finds... nothing of substance to use as a pretext. Apparently the best they could find was Carter Page talking to a Russian. But you can't go to the FISA court and say you need to wiretap the guy based on your wiretap info from the guy you want to wiretap. Doesn't look good. So they unearth the article in Yahoo news as their non-wiretap "source".

       So if Trump wiretaps someone in the democratic presidential campaign next election and incidentally surveillance his political opponents and leak/use that info to win the election, that won't be a problem to you?

       You do know of the three degrees of separation rule, right? The FBI sent Page to Russia, then sent him to infiltrate the Trump campaign, then asked FISA for a warrant on Page. Since he worked on the Trump campaign Trump and the entire campaign is well within the three degrees of separation. Would you mind if Trump did this next election? No? Then demand consequences now.

       Was it revealed recently that Page was an informant of the FBI or something? I'm asking because I haven't heard of this yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct. If Page was wiretapped, those he communicated with on the campaign trail would be privy to surveillance as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would certainly be floored if Obama was responsible for executing this sort of Trojan horse of surveillance. If this were revealed to have been the case, I would absolutely demand consequences—the same goes for Trump.
