<p>When the end time comes, a celestial object will appear in the sky, which bears resemblance to a red dragon. The star is followed by two moons, which glows with red light. When people witness such wonder, flood will ensue and wind will howl. Mountains will crack and oceans will be in chaos. Bird will have no place to rest and human have nothing to eat. War is endless and bloodshed is ceaseless. The virtuous will escape such disaster and the wicked will be doomed. </p>

The former star red flashes, after two stars of its light yellow and white, all the world to see, that is, &quot;end robbery&quot; came. As for the scene when the &quot;Last Doom&quot; came, the book states: There are floods, heavy rains, red and white do not show up, the mountains collapsed, and the ponds do their best to break. The world is in turmoil, the people are hungry. They have no food on the 10th. Soldiers compete, fighting fight, keep fighting. And &quot;heaven and earth uncertain, sun and moon stars flow, dark rivers and mountains dark, grass wild snake regardless of the six countries not smooth, bones pile mountains.&quot; Then, &quot;the good again by wicked people, angel devil lower bound Come, the family plus sorrow .Tail the tail of the head, the man to do the desert lying mound, the woman for the army 俦 .Ducky tiger, such as domestic dogs, day and night looking for the door to bite and pigs and sheep .In the world do harm to life, Affection.

<p>From what I can gather, 五公救世经 =  &#39;5 years of saving the world&#39; and it was an ancient Buddhist text giving predictions about the end of the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont&#39;t usually do this for free, but here&#39;s my rough translation. Opted for literal meaning over readability.</p>

<p>若逢末劫之时，东南天上有孛星出现，长一丈如龙之相，后有两星相随，昼夜奔驰，东出西落，放光红赤，前有一星红光闪耀，后有一星其光黄白，使天下万民见之，即时末劫到来。后有洪水飘荡，狂风猛雨，红白不现，高山崩裂，波塘尽打破，无依无倚鸟无宿处，怕观此末劫世界，若此年岁大荒，人民饥馑，十日无粮，刀兵竞起，战斗相争，干戈不停，善者可逃，恶者难以回避。</p>

<p>In the end times a comet will appear with the likeness of a dragon (the tail). Two stars will appear with the comet that shine during night and day, rise in the east and setting in the west, and shining red. First the stars will shine red, and later they will shine a yellowish white color. This will be seen by the people’s of the world. </p>

<p>This time will be marked with:
Massive floods, torrential downpours, massive confusion, mountains will burst apart, massive waves (tsunamis), no shelter for people, famine, starvation, 10 days without food, armies rising up and fighting endless wars.</p>

<p>The benevolent can escape, but the fate for the evil will be near unavoidable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>any other links to ancient Chinese texts, would love to read them. I sometimes do translation work and have been wanting to read ancient prohecy texts for a while but have not known where to find them.</p>

<p>Chinese characters are probably the only written language on the planet to stay relatively intact and continuous for 5000 years, meaning 5000 year old texts are still relatively readable if you can read modern Chinese, The problem is it is hard to find the text. A lot has been hidden or destroyed by the CCCP. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see what alignment and differences there are between ancient Chinese and the Vedas, Mayans, Incans, etc. Any links to stuff would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, most early religions were fraught with use of plant based hallucinogens. The Mayans and Aztecs are unequivocally known to have used them heavily. There&#39;s some speculation about Egyptian, Greek, and even early Judaeo-Christian usage. The Rigveda, an ancient Hindu holy text, makes repeated references to a substance called &quot;soma&quot; which seems to induce hallucinations. I would imagine the guy who wrote this was just meditating while tripping hard </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;d say this passage definitely lines up with the Babylonian map which shows the Nibiru red dwarf and two planets.</p>

<p>Scientifically a red dwarf and the planets would be visible as glowing red as they come around the sun. This would be visible from the southeast in the southern hemisphere of the earth. The red glow would transition to yellowish white as Nibiru and planets cool down after moving away from the sun. This is accurate.</p>

<p>It does seem to be a scientifically accurate description of what it could look like and where it would be visible in the sky.</p>

<p>Coincidentally there have been massive investments in infrared telescopes in the far southern hemishphere from a number of governments and organizations. I think even the vatican&#39;s LUCIFER telescope is looking for this in that direction.</p>
