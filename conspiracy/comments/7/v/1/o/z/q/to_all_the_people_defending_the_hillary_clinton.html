       Imagine if the Trump investigation were to end with Mueller saying that Trump did indeed collude with Russia, but they could not find any criminal intent behind it he didn't know that it was unlawful so they let it slide. How would you react? Well this is exactly what James Comey claimed happened to Hillary Clinton and Huma who stated that they "did not know they were commiting anything unlawful" when they found emailed classified information on Anthony Weiners laptop. Don't believe me read the official documents and listen to Comey be interviewed.

       I don't stand in defense of Hilary Clinton, but the scenario of "the Trump investigation ending with Mueller saying that Trump did indeed collude with Russia, but they could not find any criminal intent behind it he didn't know that it was unlawful" is a very real possibility in this investigation. But almost everyone around him and his administration would go down for it.

       Ok, so what's your answer to your own question? If the Trump investigation were to end with Mueller saying that Trump did indeed collude with Russia, but they could not find any criminal intent behind it he didn't know that it was unlawful so they let it slide. How would you react?

       it's not a narrative. Trump signed sanctions into law that were passed 98-2 in the senate and now refuses to enforce those sanctions as authorized by POTUS himself.

       well first off Putin doesn't really like his oligarchs, he certainly doesn't wine and dine them the way the americans do, Putins approach to them has always been get in line, or i will end you.
      </p>
      <p>
       second the russian sanctions have been a terrific windfall for russia outside of their cash reserves and gas industry. when you look at how it has diversified and actually strengthened the russian economy. its actually made him look even better at home. Most of the pain was directed to the nationally owned gas companies, which means the government at the pain not the people, meanwhile the sanctions have helped them become more domestically self sufficient, and harmed their European competitors. the russian agriculture industries have massively benefited from the EU basically shutting the door on their own exports.
      </p>
      <p>
       third, it was obama shenanigans in syria, and iraq that have ended up making russia appear to be more successful than the US at combating terrorism, with better results, less troops deployed, and less civilian casualties. mean while the US has been funneling weapons to these groups, and repeatedly having their "allies" turn on them and join isis/al-nusra.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you pull your head out of the propaganda farm for a minute and look at the reality of the russians position in the world, obamas era was a massive boon to russia. with out obamas clumsiness, Putin would have had a very difficult time restructuring russia economy (russians obviously arent big fans of central planning or government interference due to the soviet failures), syria was  a gift because it now proves russia can and will defend it allies, and the sanctions if anything have seriously divided the EU parliament by causing economic hardship to some countries and benefiting others, those divides will no doubt be exploited in the future possible tearing the EU apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump wont back the sanctions for some very obvious reasons, it only further chills relations, and it makes the US look even weaker than it already appears. the EU isnt going to keep blindly following and eventually it would lead to the US being even more isolated as the EU is already in pretty dire need of russian gas.

       This sentence makes me think you're 11 years old. Do you really think Putin's plans for a new Soviet Empire require that he gives a shit personally about the people he commands? It's about moving money and controlling people. Period. How you think it might be relevant that Putin "likes" his oligarchs, in a serious discussion about foreign policy is beyond me. Unless you're a child.

       Where did you get this idea? I'd like to see a link, if one exists. I have a feeling you didn't get this from
       <em>
        The Economist.
       </em>
       Maybe I'm missing your point here: are you saying that the Russian people, outside the oligarchies, saw a windfall from the sanctions? If that's what you're saying, then why are you against the sanctions? That would only enhance the reasoning behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the whole point of the Magnistky Act was to punish those people responsible for twisting the knife of injustice into the Russian people: the oligarchs. If you gave a shit about the Russian people, you'd all for the US sanctions.

       Again, I don't believe you here. Please provide a link or this will be disregarded as pure bullshit.

      <p>
       The problem with your approach, aside from making shit up, is that you must ignore the facts that multiple times, Trump campaign officials and family denied being in talks with Russian officials about lifting these sanctions. Then they got lifted. Then the Senate and House voted to enact new ones, which the POTUS has refused to enforce. And you think the POTUS is "sticking it to the Russians"? If that's your thoughts, you are delusional.

       as for sanctions look at how they have forced russians to step up and replace sanctioned goods, the old russian economy ran on oil and gas alone, the sanctions have birthed and revitalized dozens of industries to replace the blocked goods. the russian economy is more diversified than it has been in decades.

       Because it's happening all the time:
       <a href="http://time.com/4394178/hillary-clinton-email-fbi-investigation/">
        "In practice, however, law enforcement officials have set a high bar for prosecuting violations of those laws, looking for clear criminal intent, which Comey said was absent in the Clinton case. Because the government is awash in secrets, they are regularly mishandled unintentionally. In 2013, according to the National Archives, which tracks classification, executive branch agencies created more than 77 million documents with secrets in them, including 46,800 with newly created secrets."
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So this is a issue of any government. Even Trump personally is doing it.

       So if the entire government colluded with Russia it suddenly defends a public investigation into it? Since murder happens across the country does that defend a single murder case? Did she commit a crime or not? If so then anyone elses actions is just a weak deflection.

       No, she may have violated the law, but did not warrant criminal charges according to the Comey, who himself was breaking with a tradition (in order to generally avoid damaging the reputation of someone investigators aren’t prepared to prosecute) by going public with an investigation that didn’t result in charges. (Trump supporters used to love him for this move - how times have changed.)

       The articles he used argues about intent, which is not black and white.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's try a thought experiment:
      </p>
      <p>
       A burglar has been casing a house and finds that the target regularly leaves on Sundays for church, and plans his break in according to that time-frame. He goes this one particular Sunday to break in and smashes her back window in, but notices that the old woman isn't at church, she's face down, unconscious on the floor. The burglar, not wanting to be caught for attempted murder, flees.  Unknown to the burglar, the old woman had passed out because of a carbon monoxide leak that would have killed her. The burglar's act of breaking in had opened the room for ventilation, allowing oxygen a way in and giving a way for the carbon monoxide to get out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, how should one approach this topic with blame? Should the burglar be punished for attempting to break in, even if what he did ultimately saved her life and he didn't take anything? Or should he be called a hero for his actions, even though his intent was originally to break the law?
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the issues people are talking about when comparing intent. They are more complex than simply asking 'Did she commit a crime or not?'

       I never said this was a direct analogy. I'm using this particular example to provide insight as to how one issue can be viewed in different ways, such as Comey stating that there was a lack of criminal intent, therefore they would not pursue charges. It's a matter of one's meta-ethics why they ultimately make that call.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as when the government cares about intent, bribery has to be proven as
       <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/bennett-l-gershman/bribery-cases-_b_1590284.html">
        Quid Pro Quo
       </a>
       . In order to combat organized crime, the government had to pass the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racketeer_Influenced_and_Corrupt_Organizations_Act">
        RICO act
       </a>
       since it wasn't enough to convict another based on orders given to kill. When it's obvious the intent was to break the law in a RICO case, it doesn't matter if you pulled the trigger yourself or not, you were still a willing participant in the conspiracy of murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are other examples I could include, but my thoughts are that you'll attempt to refute this by whatever means necessary, and thus my efforts feel wasted, especially since you had the disrespect to answer my honest question about your personal meta-ethics with another question in turn. Sorry.

That is a serious crime and  I have yet to hear a valid explanation to how the intent matters here.

       If you read the articles I posted you would have seen where they aknowledge the joint fundraising agreement but that there was a separate agreement between HRC and he DNC which gave Clinton control.

       But it wasn't a fair primary! The agreement gave Clinton control over the DNCs strategies, methods, funding, pretty much whatever she wanted. She was in the driver seat from day one. That's not impartial. She literally owned the party she was running for. Anyone else running for the nomination stood no chance.

       It influenced enough people to taint their choice. What you don't seem to understand is the assertion that Russia exploited our divisions with specific information, correct or other wise, the contents do not matter but for the end game; to have enough people bickering and fighting over issues that affect American politics and that our sovereignty be damned. That we have done a similar form of political interjection has no baring on the fact that we are in serious political and social trouble because Putin helped stirr the pot.

       The only equivalences that are true are identities.  If something is not identical then it is not equivalent.  However, as a comparison or an analogy it is not false, but is very accurate, as both figures faced an investigation, and if both figures have the same judgment the question of the way the public would react is left open.

       By that metric, someone who got caught stealing $500 from their employer's cash register but who got off on a technicality, is comparable to someone who committed a double homicide but walked because the arresting officer muffled the report.

       A false dichotomy is when one presents two choices as they are the only choices.  For example if I stated that you are either lying or ignorant.  That would be a false dichotomy as there are more options that are available, like you were misinformed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The example you provided further underscores the point, as both the Clinton email server, and Russian collusion are cases  which involve questions of national security, and classification.  But more importantly we could make all sorts of accurate comparisons between the two cases you provided.

       From your first link...

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False equivalence is a logical fallacy in which two opposing arguments appear to be logically equivalent when in fact they are not
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To be logically equivalent can either refer to a shared form of an argument,  or an argument with the same form which is valid and sound.    An argument of the form IF A then B. A. Therefore B.  will be logically equivalent to any argument that has that form.  Irrespective of whether the premises are true.   The only think I get from the wikipedia page is that passing one false argument as true only because it shares the same form as different argument that is true,  is not a valid inference... which is true as far as it goes, but has very little to do with the case here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second link literally states the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A situation in which two alternative points of views are presented as the only options, whereas others are available.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Don't use Wikipedia for this stuff.  Use this as an entry for philosophically related subjects, it is much better.

       Yes, as in the arguments that share the same form, have the same form and are therefore identical.  Which is the only sensical thing from the wikipedia page.    Which again, has nothing to do with the case under discussion.

       What an intellectually dishonest lack of a real argument. You're just denying basic reality at this point.

       If society collectively says "here's this concept, and this is what it means", then that's a concept, and that's what it means. It's really as simple as that.

      <p>
       This is mistaken in two ways, the first is that we are taking about a concept that society gives a meaning through.  It is actually a repetition of mistake, that gets its force through the number of times it was repeated, and second is that it is true.  Things that are believed in the community at large are often mistaken, like in this particular case.  Because to repeat it, the only things that are equivalent are identities.  That means that all analogies are not equivalent.   Perhaps you meant to raise the objection of a false analogy, which is a real fallacy.  In which case we could argue about whether or not the analogy is justified or not.  However, you just repeated something you read before on an internet forum.

       I don't deny reality.  I think this is what reality of the situation is.  The claim of a  'false equivalence' is based on a misunderstanding that was thrown on the internet, and repeated.  First the argument, again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something is equivalent if and only if it is identical.   All analogies are not identical, therefore all analogies are false equivalences. This is absurd, as there are analogies that are true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, concepts that are believed by the public are often inaccurate.   This is trivial to show, one can look at the public's misunderstanding of evolutionary theory, or climate change.  This is one of those cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, the real meaning of the charge is 'I don't think you should compare this two things, because I don't like the comparison, I just don't have a good reason to object to it, so I am going to say it is a false equivalence."
      </p>
      <p>
       No reality was denied, just elucidated.

       This is going entirely over your head.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Something is equivalent if and only if it is identical. All analogies are not identical, therefore all analogies are false equivalences. This is absurd, as there are analogies that are true.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The term "False Equivalence" refers to a singular concept, not whatever literal deconstruction you're trying to make it mean.

        Secondly, concepts that are believed by the public are often inaccurate. This is trivial to show, one can look at the public's misunderstanding of evolutionary theory, or climate change. This is one of those cases.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This isn't about whether the concept is right or wrong, this is about the very definition of the concept. You can argue the merits of libertarianism all you like, but you can't argue the basic definition of it, because that's what society has decided that concept is called, so that's the definition of it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thirdly, the real meaning of the charge is 'I don't think you should compare these two things, because I don't like the comparison, I just don't have a good reason to object to it, so I am going to say it is a false equivalence."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No, you're just purposefully misunderstanding the meaning of a simple phrase, to go off on some pedantic case of deconstructing a concept into the meaning of its individual words, rather than what the phrase actually represents.

       It represents a pseudo-fallacy, as has been demonstrated to you multiple times by now.   You can keep on asserting that other people use it all you want, it does not change the fact that is based on a misunderstanding.   It really does boil down to an automatic response that is thrown when someone does not like a comparison or analogy.    Which is what you did.

       You can't call it a pseudo fallacy just because you want to. It's a very real concept that describes a clear cut fallacy. It's like you're trying to deny the sky is blue, or even the very accepted definition of what "sky" refers to.

       It absolutely is for a concept like "False Equivalence". It's really just ludicrous to say otherwise, when the very definition is the same on Wikipedia as it is in any other resource, because that's what society has deemed those words to mean.

       We are talking about something referred to as a logical fallacy.   More importantly we are talking about something that is used as an argument on internet forums, where this claim has its origin.  And it is based on a mistake.   As I have argued.  The only thing that is equivalent are identities.  Identities can consist in logical form.  If you don't know what logical form is, here is a nice overview.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-form/">
        https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-form/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So unless the argument is using the claim that two arguments have the same LOGICAL FORM, but they do not, a claim of false equivalence is meaningless.    Two arguments can have the same logical form, but one can be sound, and the other not sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is relevant to how the accusation is thrown around on the internet, and specifically it has nothing to do with the case discussed in this tread.

       As is, this article is of little value. Should the claims suddenly sprout substantiation or a credible on-the-record source, though, they are quite important. I am of course public enemy #1 in any sub that is likely to expend energy on what-iffing that event. Otherwise I'd be trying to round up a posse for the purpose because there are several possible resolutions to this crisis that could yield such substantiation.

       Counter question to the OP:
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you feel that after a year in power, controlling both Congress and the White House, this administration has not appointed a special investigator to look into Clintons crimes?
      </p>
      <p>
       More so, how do you feel about trump saying that his campaign promise to put Clinton into jail was nothing more than a lie to rally his base for votes?

       Good question that sounds like a topic that could use it's own thread. But to answer your question like all presidents I give them there full term to prove there worthiness and judge them be there entire legacy not selectively choosing especially when there's is still 3/4s of his presidency left.

       Do you have a source for that? If he said that then I think that is wrong. I have no allegiance to Trump if at the end of the 4 years he does not deliver what he said I will not vote for him again (didn't in the first place either) end of story.

What's more, he said the idea of prosecuting Clinton is "just not something I feel very strongly about."

       The irony of it all. So many words, memes, essays, and partisan propaganda, and it's all just words in the wind.
      </p>
      <p>
       The simplest answer staring us right in the face exists in the fact that Republicans
       <em>
        presently in power
       </em>
       have used that power for dozens of investigations and have yet to charge HRC with anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       They have the power -- they claim crimes were committed -- but they don't prosecute the crimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is garbage.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the DJT campaign investigation, it's the first one, and we shall see what happens.

       I think lying under oath to the American people is a but more than personal inpropriety, not to mention all of the crimes that the Clinton's have admited to and still walked away from. Giving State secrets to your best friend's pedophile husband or obstructing an investigation into sexual harassment cases in the State Department or money laundering or fraud or pergery. Those are just the things we KNOW the Clinton's have participated in. It's no wonder the shady stuff that happens around them is speculated to not be a coincidence.

       Actually, the simplest answer is that the Clintons and Trump play for the same team. For that matter, so do the Bushs, Obamas, etc.

       Here are a few things:
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama fought for years to restore Net Neutrality, Trump ended it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under Obama, ISPs could not use and sell your search data. Republicans and Trump reversed that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is trying to reverse the rights of LGBT in the military.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fifth vote on the Supreme Court held open under Obama has gone from someone who would have reversed corporate money=speech to someone who will entrench it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and the Republicans have escalated tensions with Iran and attempting to destroy the peace deal that Obama got with international agreement. This is no small difference. This is the final major part of the George W. Bush PNAC agenda which nearly everyone in conspiracy forums opposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I"m not sure what you mean by the "same team," but I know that "the Clintons and Trump" are not the same and that these differences matter.

       That's cute. You're still trying to push the left vs right propaganda? Here's a few things the Obama administration did that you seem to have conveniently left out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama sold his entire 2008 cabinet to Citigroup. A month before the election the Wallstreet bank submitted a list of "preferred candidates" for cabinet positions to the Obama campaign. A list, mind you, that almost exactly corresponds to the cabinet Obama eventually chose. Is it a wonder that his administration let the banks off so easy after they destroyed the American economy that year?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama's ties to big oil are equally obvious. Between lifting the 40 year crude oil export ban, the new refining subsidy, expanding offshore drilling, and fast tracking the TPP (which Trump ironically enough haulted on his first day in office), he made it very clear he appreciated all of big oil's contributions to his campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, since you brought it up, Obama promised to end American conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, he expanded those wars, as well as five other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama also deported more people than any other president in US history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to all of this the fact that the spying powers of the NSA were exponentially increased during his presidency, as well as the executive powers he handed off to the orange orangutan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama, like trump and every president before them, worked for the oligarchy. Not for you or I.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretending otherwise is naive.

       Libya/Syria/Jemen/Ukraine all happened under Obama. The Nato proxy war between Russia and Georgia was the last operation under Bush which was continued with Ukraine. To me Obama always looked like a continuation of Bush's geo strategical goals.

       If politicians and their fawning bureaucrats actually did a proper investigation and Hillary went to jail I think there be Republicans and bureaucrats in the cell next door to her. Plus if Hillary went down so would a lot of her operators which would mean rebuilding. Instead now Republicans got power of White House, any corruption will now be run by Trump i.e. Trump's private intelligence network

       The latter isn't an immediate issue for me because I understand how society works. I suppose you do too. How do you think it would look if the acting President of the United States started jailing his political opponenets starting with the runner up to the election? Even with all the evidence there, the political climate as it is now would lead to a civil war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, I honestly think that the Hillary investigations get bogged down because they implicate so many other people that a thorough cleanse would mean firing a lot of people in the government - a move that once again will be see (perhaps correctly) as a power grab
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter if it is a just move or a tyrant move - firing and jailing political opposition will be see as a tyrant move and it will lead to a full blown uprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best case scenario would be to keep investigating and slowly reveal full evidence on the corruption that has taken place so that people can start to become more involved and understand the depth of the corruption. Still, one half of the country does not believe the other half and it likely won't change.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't make stupid arguments like "well she still isn't in jail so checkmate Trump supporterd" as if things are that simple.

       Really shallow analysis. If he immediately tried jailing her, half the country would label him a dictator. Source: Him already being called a dictator for firing Comey, McCabe, and the 100% perceived certainty that Rosenstein/Mueller are next.

       We see proxy wars to weaken each other over the last few years because neither side wants to get at their throats directly as that means endgame. There might even be more than 2 relevant sides.

       You could also ask yourself why is Soros still alive and the people he works for? Because either they're all in bed together and it's just a huge puppet show(The hopeless total cynical perspective) or because that would result into retaliation?

       I'd be pissed. Why? The difference is her investigation, though she never went to jail, ensured that she didn't win the presidency. Let's be clear--but for the investigation into her emails/Benghazi/etc she would likely be president.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump? Well, he won the presidency. Either he goes to jail or he gets kicked out of office. If neither happens, then he really did get off scot-free. That should piss everyone off if it were to happen. However, I can assure you, conservatives won't be. They will pretend they are--but they won't be.

       That, my friend, is a shit comparison. You are acting like she was owed the presidency. She wasn't. Nobody is owed the presidency. It is something you win, and if you can't handle the loss, don't run.

       No one said she was entitled to anything. You simply added something to what I wrote. Point is, as much as some of you would like her in jail, at least the investigation(s) kept from getting what she wanted--becoming president. Which is huge. It essentially prevented her from getting a job.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the same thing happened to Trump (not guilty because of a lack of intent), he's still president. Nothing has changed. It hasn't affected him in anyway.

       Ill give another example.  Lets say Trump was on the campaign trail, and at an event, he started to pass out, went limp, was thrown into a van, and his shoe fell off.

       Yes but we all are very aware of it by now. The large "opposition" to Trump here that shows up with an obscene amount of downvotes and upvotes (when most users don't even bother to upvote or downvote in general) would never mention this because they're paid to steer you away from realizing just that

       So if the Trump investigation were to end with Mueller saying that Trump did indeed collude with Russia, they did find criminal intent behind it and he did know that it was unlawful, so they lock him up. How would you react?

       From your first link...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        False equivalence is a logical fallacy in which two opposing arguments appear to be logically equivalent when in fact they are not
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       To be logically equivalent can either refer to a shared form of an argument,  or an argument with the same form which is valid and sound.    An argument of the form IF A then B. A. Therefore B.  will be logically equivalent to any argument that has that form.  Irrespective of whether the premises are true.   The only think I get from the wikipedia page is that passing one false argument as true only because it shares the same form as different argument that is true,  is not a valid inference... which is true as far as it goes, but has very little to do with the case here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second link literally states the following:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A situation in which two alternative points of views are presented as the only options, whereas others are available.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Don't use Wikipedia for this stuff.  Use this as an entry for philosophically related subjects, it is much better.

       That, my friend, is a shit comparison. You are acting like she was owed the presidency. She wasn't. Nobody is owed the presidency. It is something you win, and if you can't handle the loss, don't run.

       You can't call it a pseudo fallacy just because you want to. It's a very real concept that describes a clear cut fallacy. It's like you're trying to deny the sky is blue, or even the very accepted definition of what "sky" refers to.

       That's cute. You're still trying to push the left vs right propaganda? Here's a few things the Obama administration did that you seem to have conveniently left out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama sold his entire 2008 cabinet to Citigroup. A month before the election the Wallstreet bank submitted a list of "preferred candidates" for cabinet positions to the Obama campaign. A list, mind you, that almost exactly corresponds to the cabinet Obama eventually chose. Is it a wonder that his administration let the banks off so easy after they destroyed the American economy that year?
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama's ties to big oil are equally obvious. Between lifting the 40 year crude oil export ban, the new refining subsidy, expanding offshore drilling, and fast tracking the TPP (which Trump ironically enough haulted on his first day in office), he made it very clear he appreciated all of big oil's contributions to his campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, since you brought it up, Obama promised to end American conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, he expanded those wars, as well as five other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama also deported more people than any other president in US history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Add to all of this the fact that the spying powers of the NSA were exponentially increased during his presidency, as well as the executive powers he handed off to the orange orangutan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obama, like trump and every president before them, worked for the oligarchy. Not for you or I.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretending otherwise is naive.

       Libya/Syria/Jemen/Ukraine all happened under Obama. The Nato proxy war between Russia and Georgia was the last operation under Bush which was continued with Ukraine. To me Obama always looked like a continuation of Bush's geo strategical goals.
