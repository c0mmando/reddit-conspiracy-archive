<p>This is regarding the recent memo released by Nunes which indicates that Trump was improperly surveyed (spied on, in layman&#39;s terms) by the FBI/Department of Justice using false/fabricated/biased information to justify FISA warrants. </p>

<p>During a Fox News interview, Nunes admits he did not read the FISA applications that the memo summarizes. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Did you read the actual FISA applications,&quot; Baier asked, referring to the documents that the memo cites in part as evidence of improper conduct by US law-enforcement officials.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I didn&#39;t,&quot; Nunes said, before adding that <strong>Gowdy was part of a designated group that reviewed the intelligence, took notes, and reported it back to committee members.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/371629-trey-gowdy-announces-retirement-from-congress">The same Gowdy that just announced their retirement days before the memo was released.</a>. </p>

<p>Also the same Gowdy that said <a href="http://insider.foxnews.com/2018/02/03/trey-gowdy-fisa-memo-does-not-any-way-discredit-mueller-investigation">The FISA memo does not discredit the Mueller investigation</a>.</p>

<p>So Nunes wrote a memo, based on a summary from someone else, based on the intelligence.</p>

<p>So, why is this a conspiracy? I believe that select politicians are actively trying to discredit the FBI and obfuscate the facts because they are afraid of what Mueller has/will uncover.</p>

<p>We have an unconstitutional surveillance apparatus that is routinely abused. </p>

<p>A political piece of opposition research was used to justify the utilization of a massive surveillance apparatus.  Just think if you would approve if it was Republicans that did this to Clinton, or if they did this to Bernie, to begin to understand what kind of scandal this is.</p>

<p>All of this to find something to peg against people that were already proclaimed guilty, for a crime that is unknown.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>The memo claims McGabe gave testimony where it was stated that there would be no FISA warrant against Page without the dossier.</p>

<p>Last week there was the talk of a second set memos that where also generated by a Clinton hack. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/30/trump-russia-collusion-fbi-cody-shearer-memo">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/30/trump-russia-collusion-fbi-cody-shearer-memo</a></p>

<p>Then there is the argument that the fact he had a previous FISA warrant is somehow in-itself a good justification for a new warrant, a scandalous claim in-itself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, why does the political motive of the dossier matter? Asking honestly.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it was used to activate a most intrusive surveillance apparatus know in human history.  Look, you either understand why politically commissioned works and allegations should be utilized or you don&#39;t.  On the side of why they should not be utilized the history of secret police and secret courts being utilized to suppress dissident political movements. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The memo doesn&#39;t dispute the information listed in the dossier, it disputes the neutrality of source.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because no investigation was done to corroborate the claims prior to its use in a politically instrumental manner, except for citing a yahoo news story, that itself was a product of Steele... </p>

<p>It is not just the neutrality of the source that is in dispute, rather it that this information was withheld from the FISA judge about the its origin. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This information came from democrats so it can&#39;t be used.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this information was created by an investigative firm commissioned by a law firm payed for by the OPPOSITION CAMPAIGN.  Whether the case involved the greens, or republicans or socialists does not matter.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why should partisan-sourced information not available to the FBI and DoJ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not my argument.  The information received from political sources, needs to be INDEPENDENTLY verified and corroborated.  </p>

<p>The memo claims that Comey called the dossier salacious and unverified despite it being a matter of public record that these comments were never made about the dossier but one specific claim within it.  The memo can provably not be trusted to present testimony in a manner that is representative of what was actually said.

<p>The claim you just made up so you could bash it down.  If Carter Page was targeted because he was on Trump&#39;s campaign as a means to get to Trump we wouldn&#39;t expect his targeting to have began before anyone could have known he was going to become involved with Trump.  Pointing this out is not asserting that prior surveillance justified a new warrant.  </p>

<p>So?  Is it your position that &quot;X has a political interest in harming Y&quot; should grant Y immunity from the law?  Because that premise is a necessity for your argument to hold.  </p>

<p>You are effectively arguing an ad hominem, attacking the messenger as an excuse to not even look at the quality of the message and you&#39;re advocating that law enforcement should formally operate accordingly.  Ridiculous.</p>

<p>If I am hired to go find out about X but not told who is hiring me or for what purpose, and my job and very comfortable living relies on my reputation for highly quality reliable investigation, how does that make my information less reliable than an acceptable source for tips to the FBI?  Don&#39;t they accept tips from anonymous phone callers?  Should they make such callers submit to a political poll first?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because no investigation was done to corroborate the claims prior to its use in a politically instrumental manner</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What&#39;s your source for that?  I hope you&#39;re aware the dossier never actually makes this claim but merely insinuates it.  That of course would be really weird if this accusation were actually true but makes perfect sense if it&#39;s not true but they really really want to manipulate credulous suckers into thinking it&#39;s true.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>this information was created by an investigative firm </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no evidence the findings were created rather than uncovered by or alleged to Steele.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>commissioned by a law firm payed for by the OPPOSITION CAMPAIGN. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is that relevant?  How could who supplied the funding possibly influence the investigator&#39;s quality of work and motivate them to go off to the FBI and lie when they have no knowledge of who is funding them?  </p>

<p>This is a classic ad hominem and a particularly absurd one that absolutely relies on being insinuated piecemeal or particularly vaguely and never outright explicated as a whole.  So here we go: a guy that has a demonstrated history of public service and a reputation he spent a life time building who is hired for a job where he doesn&#39;t know who is funding the company that contracted his (or for what purpose) is somehow psychically or magically compelled by the money to lose all ethics and professionalism and go off to the FBI and lie to them (a serious crime) putting his entire career/livelihood at risk while risking a prison sentence.  </p>

<p>What the actual ever-loving mother fuck?!!!  Complete and utter bullshit.  Not merely unlikely, but actually reliant on supernatural goings on.  And this is why no one pushing these sleazy weaselly ad hominem attacks on Steele and his dossier ever go beyond their vague insinuation and never actually spell out how the source of funding could have influenced the reliability of the findings.  It literally requires magic and they prefer which detail they prefer to avoid highlighting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot here to answer. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Here is the quote from Comey&#39;s written statement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The IC leadership 
thought it important
,
 for a variety of reasons
,
 to alert the 
incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious 
and unverified.<br/>
Among tho
se reasons were
: 
 (1) 
we knew the me
dia 
was about to 
publicly report
 the material and we bel
ieved the IC
 should not keep knowledge of 
the material and its imminent release fr</p>

<h2>om the President</h2>

<p>Elect; and (2) 
to the 
extent there was
 some effort to compromise an incomin
g President, we could blunt 
a
ny such
 effort with a defensive briefing
.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Tell me which specific claim Comey claimed this about? Because to me, it looks like he is referring to the dossier claims in general.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jcomey-060817.pdf">https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-jcomey-060817.pdf</a></p>

<p>So seeing how you claimed the comment was in reference to something specific, and we can see that they were not, one would have to wonder concerning your claims about McGabe&#39;s testimony.  I guess the only way to find out is to see the transcripts. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>. If Carter Page was targeted because he was on Trump&#39;s campaign as a means to get to Trump we wouldn&#39;t expect his targeting to have began before anyone could have known he was going to become involved with Trump. Pointing this out is not asserting that prior surveillance justified a new warrant. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>His targeting was in a case in which he was not charged with a crime, the case closed, and the underlying documents show that the Russians were going to pump and dump the guy, not engage in quid-pro-quo relationship.  That case closed.  Someone, who knew this about Page, had to UNMASK him.  Present this to FISA, and they leaked his name to the press.   The underlying documents would have not supported a FISA warrant.  That is why the argument that, well he had one before so that is a justification for being spied again is so egregious. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I hope you&#39;re aware the dossier never actually makes this claim but merely insinuates it. That of course would be really weird if this accusation were actually true but makes perfect sense if it&#39;s not true but they really really want to manipulate credulous suckers into thinking it&#39;s true.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because if they actually investigated it, they would have found that the claim that Page went to Moscow and met with Sochin was not true... either the FBI knew it was not true, and they submitted a FISA warrant with known false information, or they did not, but used the yahoo news story as corroboration.   Both ways, the FBI failed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is no evidence the findings were created rather than uncovered by or alleged to Steele.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was employed by a Fusion GPS, as in he was a subcontractor for Fusion GPS.  I don&#39;t understand what point you are making. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why is that relevant? How could who supplied the funding possibly influence the investigator&#39;s quality of work and motivate them to go off to the FBI and lie when they have no knowledge of who is funding them? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you really ask me how someone paying Fusion GPS, might influence the findings that Fusion GPS turns in?  I hope I am not telling you some kind of secret when I state that companies like to keep their clients happy.    Fusion GPS knew who was funding them.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So here we go: a guy that has a demonstrated history of public service and a reputation he spent a life time building</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That after this clusterfuck of a memo was released need to be re-evaluated.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>somehow psychically or magically compelled by the money to lose all ethics and professionalism </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Steele was/is a spook.   Moreover, there is evidence that he considered Trump&#39;s victory to be undesirable, so he had political motivation.  Obviously, all the inappropriate in this investigation was done by people who did not want one presidential candidate to win, and who thought that candidate was a shoe-in, and are surprised and might be facing further disciplinary actions. Steele included.  He is currently being sued. </p>

<p>Where is the support for your claim that Steele did not know who was paying Fusion GPS?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What the actual ever-loving mother fuck?!!! Complete and utter bullshit. Not merely unlikely, but actually reliant on supernatural goings on. And this is why no one pushing these sleazy weaselly ad hominem attacks on Steele and his dossier ever go beyond their vague insinuation and never actually spell out how the source of funding could have influenced the reliability of the findings.

    <div class="md"><p>the political motive of the dossier matters for the same reason that if someone who had never met you, who wanted their friend to get the job you were applying for, to the cops and said you were a drug dealer, who shouldn&#39;t be allowed to get your friend&#39;s job, was presented to a judge in a warrant application as simply &quot;an acquaintance of the target.&quot;</p>

<p>a judge will rubberstamp the &quot;acquaintance&quot; backed request, however, if the judge knew that the acquaintence (1) had never met you and (2) was motivated at least partially to benefit from your arrest, the judge, if he&#39;s honest, will refuse and tell the cops to come back with something more, because motivation always matters in matters of law. </p>

<p>this is why when testimony against someone comes from someone who received a lighter sentence or a reduction of their sentence, it must be disclosed in court.</p>

<p>the memo isn&#39;t about the dossier at all. it is about the legality of the, for all intents and purposes, search warrant. warrant abuse is a very big issue in america. if you ever get arrested and your lawyer doesn&#39;t challenge the warrant pro forma, get another lawyer. the warrant is the most important step in the criminal process. once it&#39;s issued, you are in the system and then your fate is in your lawyer&#39;s hands because of the very nature of the fact every defendant starts on their back foot.</p>

<p>no one has said partisan information shouldn&#39;t be avaialable to the FBI or DOJ. the issue isn&#39;t whether they have it. that&#39;s not the issue at all. the issue is that a judge should have as much information as possible before subjecting someone the legal system.</p>

<p>another example-in the salem witch trials, it turns out that the two main families involved had had a long standing feud and were fighting over ownership of a parcel of land. when little annie putnam fingered the first porter, the warrants issued based, presumably, on the fact that ann had no malice towards porter. back then it likely wouldn&#39;t have impacted matters, but if it was you, wouldn&#39;t you like the judge to know that ann and her family hated you and wanted your land, before the judge decided to act on their information?</p>

<p>This might be the case, it might not, it has not been demonstrated.  The memo really contains one thing that is new, and that is that in addition to using political opposition research to pursue a FISA and withholding pertinent information about its origin from the judge, the new piece is that a yahoo news story was used as a corroborative piece of evidence all the while it was a story using Steele as a source anyway.  A low level Trump campaign member, and more importantly an American citizen, had this surveillance apparatus turned against him for politically instrumental reason, and all you partisan hacks can scream republican vs democrat talking points.</p>

<p>I am agnostic about this claim.  As I stated it might be true, it might not.  I am not going to take Schiff&#39;s word for it however. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Not about FISA abuses, no, we do not wait.  The specific allegations here concerning an American citizen against whom the surveillance apparatus was used for an instrumental reason of undermining one political campaign.   That is a scandal for which there is much more evidence for than anything else. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nunes can claim that the moon is made of cheese.  What we need to know are the reason a FISA warrant was granted against Page, discipline those who abused it, discipline the judge for granting a bad warrant,  and find out if this was used as an indirect way of spying on a presidential candidate. </p>

<p>Here is a non Republican making it, you ready?  The FBI has a conflict of interest in this case, as it is the agency that was in contact with Steele, payed Steele, and utilized his output to pursue a FISA warrant in the first place.  It is neither unsubstantiated, nor is it nonsense, as it is perfectly sensical and more likely given both the history of the agency and silly claims of Russiagaters.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yes, so far we really have three things going for it. </p>

<p>We have the Steele dossier.</p>

<p>We have the fact that Page had a previous warrant.</p>

<p>We have the Shearer memo. </p>

<p>We have the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/30/trump-russia-collusion-fbi-cody-shearer-memo">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/30/trump-russia-collusion-fbi-cody-shearer-memo</a> </p>

<p>The fact that Page was previously caught in contact with someone under investigation,  is not probable cause, especially how that case closed, and Page was not charged with anything.   If you read the underlying court filings, Page was sharing information about the energy business with someone who was not a registered foreign agent, and the Russians are on record talking about how they will use this guy, and give him nothing. It does not show a quid-pro-quo.   </p>

<p>Using a claim that someone had a previous warrant is not justification for another warrant. </p>

<p>The Shearer memo and its existence should be an embarrassment. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why would using the FusionGPS report be illegal?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The illegal part is the FBI and the DOJ withholding information that the OPPOSITION CAMPAIGN  funded Steele, when they knew this fact.  That is pertinent information.  It opens up the FBI officials and the DOJ to contempt of court charges.  </p>

<p>Using the OPPOSITION RESEARCH from your political RIVALS needs to be INDEPENDENTLY vetted and corroborated, especially if it justifies use of the most invasive surveillance apparatus built in human history. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is the conflict of interest?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBI was the agency that used Steele&#39;s dossier, and is accused of withholding the fact that it was payed for by the CLINTON CAMPAIGN. </p>

<p>Actually it has been.  Comey&#39;s testimony where he used the phrase &quot;salacious and unverified&quot; in respect of something to do with the dossier is public record so we know this information that Comey uttered those words in testimony was misused by Nunes in this memo.  The memo misrepresented that Comey had commented that the dossier was &quot;salacious and unverified&quot; but it&#39;s a matter of public record that Comey said this about a single specific claim among the mass of claims made in the dossier.  Notably, even the memo doesn&#39;t even try to insinuate that specific claim was presented as evidence in any warrant application for Carter Page.  Nunes just outright lies about Comey&#39;s publicly available testimony.</p>

<p>That&#39;s obvious and easily proven misuse of information.  Nunes couldn&#39;t even stick to the truth on those elements that are a matter of public record.

    <div class="md"><p>The headline of this post is garbage. It implies Nunes is the author of the memo (he was one of many, and three of the authors read the intelligence), and anyone who goes to OP&#39;s first link can watch the video where this is all explained. This post implies that the memo was written without the author reading intelligence. How is this behavior any different compared to Trump supporters plugging their ears and misleading each other? The same thing is happening in this post. </p>

<p>Trey Gowdy, who read the intelligence and authored the memo, also stated that although the memo raises serious concerns about the FISA process, he still thinks the investigation into Trump is not discredited by the memo. I have the same belief. Even if they abused the FISA process to get the warrant, the investigation has to continue. There is enough circumstantial evidence to suggest Mueller is on the right track, so fuck it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are pretty cavalier about sanctions.</p>

<p>sanctions are a euphamism for blockade.</p>

<p>they are intended to hurt common people to force the uncommon people to do whatever the blockader wants them to do. and they do hurt common people. our sanctions on iraq in the 1990s caused the deaths of at least 500,000 iraqi children from starvation. and is always the case, the iraqi govt did not submit. the uncommon people fair fine in blockades. </p>

<p>a blockade on russia will not cause putin to bend. it will cause ordinary russians to suffer. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t give to pickled farts about trump, but anyone, including, bernie &quot;i supported every sanction on iraq in the 1990s and almost every sanction on upteen other countrues since then&quot; sanders, is a war criminal or supports a war criminal.</p>

<p>sanctions are a crime against humanity, designed speficially to hurt non-combatants.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t. I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t. but as a lawyer, i&#39;ve relied on other people going through the documents provided on discovery for me to write memos and motions based on what those who went through them told me about them. pretty standard.</p>

<p>as i said above to someone else, the memo doesn&#39;t discredit the investigation. it isn&#39;t about the investigation. it is about whether or not the FBI abused the warrant system by providing a misleading basis for to a judge for its issuance.</p>

<p>presumably, the investigation does not pinge on the information derived from the questionable warrant. presumably, meullar has many other information stems. if he doesn&#39;t, then he is discredited because it would be unheard of for someone of his stature, in so imporatant a case, with so nany resources at hand, to not have many more.</p>

<p>warrant application abuse is one of the biggest criminal justice issues that no one&#39;s ever heard of except for every lawyer, judge, cop, clerk, balif, court reporter and on and on. </p>

<p>I may be wrong about that.  So much information is flying around about this memo that it is hard to separate fact from fiction.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind Nunes was caught lying about how he received intelligence reports back in March 2017.  He keeps slipping into Unreliable Narrator territory in my eyes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nunes has explained this, if people care to pay attention at all. There are limits to the amount of people that can view a document in the SCIF at any given time, and he allowed Trey Gowdy to view it given his prior expertise along with two investigators on the committees team. They took notes on what they saw, didn&#39;t see, etc. and reported back to Nunes. </p>

<p>Then they all wrote the memo together. What is complicated about this to people? </p>

<p>I observed you criticize another poster for what you describe as ad hominem attacks, and you conducted yourself as though such attacks are beneath the standard you deem appropriate for posting here on social media. I directly asked you whether ad hominems were the kind of thing it would wrong to leave out of a FISA application and you indicated a particular ad hominem you think they should have included in the application for Carter Page&#39;s warrant.  It is a necessary implication (must logically be true) of these facts that you think this ad hominem is appropriate to include in a FISA application but that posters here shouldn&#39;t stoop to using ad hominems and I pointed that fact out.</p>

<p>It&#39;s my conclusion and it&#39;s solid.  In no way did I or my post attempt to give you credit for my logically sound conclusion.  You want credit for producing logically sound conclusions, do your own work instead of make-believing I gave you credit for mine.  Maybe lay off the hypocrisy and projection a little.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the memo wasn&#39;t designed to try to discredit the russia investigation. it was designed to provide grounds from every plea thus far entered to be expunged, and to prevent any further prosecutions of people based on information flowing from the warrant.</p>

<p>the dossier can be 100% true in this scenario. the memo has nothing to do with the dossier, other than the fact that the FBI used it in a warrant application to spy on american citizens. </p>

<p>when you hear people complain about someone getting off on a techinicality, it is usually from an invalid warrant. warrants are sacrosanct in anglo-american law, and as well they should be. they are what will haul you into the system, and once in the system, your fate has almost nothing to do with your guilt and everything to do with the quality of your lawyer.</p>

<p>this is a straight up day to day no frills warrant challenge. the like happens everyday in every jurisdiction around the country. my experience has been that cops cheat on warrants as a matter of course, and the FBI are just high falooting cops, with a well documented 75 year track record of corruption and abuse. the burden is always on the cop to prove the warrant was justified, not those who challenge it.</p>

Increasingly it looks like Obama may have been involved in tampering with the election.  This is worse than Watergate.

<p>So, why is this a conspiracy? I believe that select politicians are actively trying to discredit the FBI and obfuscate the facts because they are afraid of what Mueller has/will uncover.</p>

<p>Trey is their top member and has a solid legal background which is why he was sent. It was a contingent of 3 from the committee based on an agreement with the agency in control of the underlying documentation... the whole committee could not go.</p>

<p>Trey has resigned and while that is odd timing, it does not mean he misreported what was in the underlying docs. Those docs are expected to be declassified AND the Senate is also releasing a report next week that will shed further light on these issues.</p>

<p>Also, it is possible that the FISA memo does NOT discredit the Mueller investigation... remember, not only the House, the Senate and the Mueller investigation are digging into documentation, the Inspector General who is an Obama appointee is ALSO going through the same documentation. The IG tranferred over 1.2 million documents that they used over to congress at the beginning of Jan. 2018. </p>

<p>The documents will be exposed as will whatever is really or was really going on. We just need to be patient as truth eventually finds the light whether it is what we expected to see or not. </p>

<p>Even if someone believes that both the House and Senate are putting forth partisan stories, the Inspector General (IG) will not. Whatever his take is on all this will shine light on the truth and those who did not tell the truth will be exposed. The IG report is due in the next 4 -6 weeks from what I have seen.</p>

<p>Take heart. Whoever did wrong will be exposed. I care not which side of the political isle they are on... I just want the truth because power should never be allowed to cloak itself using the trust of the people who have given that power to them.</p>

<p>You&#39;re acting like the dossier was the sole reason for the FISA warrant, which is incorrect and exactly the narrative that Nunes is trying to drive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The memo claims McGabe gave testimony where it was stated that there would be no FISA warrant against Page without the dossier.</p>

<p>Last week there was the talk of a second set memos that where also generated by a Clinton hack. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/30/trump-russia-collusion-fbi-cody-shearer-memo">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/30/trump-russia-collusion-fbi-cody-shearer-memo</a></p>

<p>Then there is the argument that the fact he had a previous FISA warrant is somehow in-itself a good justification for a new warrant, a scandalous claim in-itself. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>In addition, why does the political motive of the dossier matter? Asking honestly.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it was used to activate a most intrusive surveillance apparatus know in human history.  Look, you either understand why politically commissioned works and allegations should be utilized or you don&#39;t.  On the side of why they should not be utilized the history of secret police and secret courts being utilized to suppress dissident political movements. </p>

<p>The memo doesn&#39;t dispute the information listed in the dossier, it disputes the neutrality of source.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because no investigation was done to corroborate the claims prior to its use in a politically instrumental manner, except for citing a yahoo news story, that itself was a product of Steele... </p>

<p>It is not just the neutrality of the source that is in dispute, rather it that this information was withheld from the FISA judge about the its origin. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;This information came from democrats so it can&#39;t be used.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, this information was created by an investigative firm commissioned by a law firm payed for by the OPPOSITION CAMPAIGN.  Whether the case involved the greens, or republicans or socialists does not matter.    </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why should partisan-sourced information not available to the FBI and DoJ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not my argument.  The information received from political sources, needs to be INDEPENDENTLY verified and corroborated.  </p>

<p>No they don&#39;t need to release all the information while the investigation is in progress. </p>

<p>Yes they do need to release all the FISA applications concerning Carter Page. </p>

<p>Do you believe Nunes who has falsified, by omission, the information he used for his making false charges against political opponents?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I am agnostic about this claim.  As I stated it might be true, it might not.  I am not going to take Schiff&#39;s word for it however. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Or do you wait until the investigations are complete.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not about FISA abuses, no, we do not wait.  The specific allegations here concerning an American citizen against whom the surveillance apparatus was used for an instrumental reason of undermining one political campaign.   That is a scandal for which there is much more evidence for than anything else. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nunes claimed this would stop the investigation and convict Obama and Hillary.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nunes can claim that the moon is made of cheese.  What we need to know are the reason a FISA warrant was granted against Page, discipline those who abused it, discipline the judge for granting a bad warrant,  and find out if this was used as an indirect way of spying on a presidential candidate. </p>

<p>Here is a non Republican making it, you ready?  The FBI has a conflict of interest in this case, as it is the agency that was in contact with Steele, payed Steele, and utilized his output to pursue a FISA warrant in the first place.  It is neither unsubstantiated, nor is it nonsense, as it is perfectly sensical and more likely given both the history of the agency and silly claims of Russiagaters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>actually, you&#39;re techincally wrong. while it true he and his team did not request the warrants, everyone of his pleas flows from information gained through them. if the warrant application was even a smidge out of order, it is invalid. it is a poisoned tree. and every bit of information resulting from must be surpressed.</p>

<p>this is a straight up day to day no frills warrant challenge. the like happens everyday in every jurisdiction around the country. my experience has been that cops cheat on warrants as a matter of course, and the FBI are just high falooting cops, with a well documented 75 year track record of corruption and abuse. the burden is always on the cop to prove the warrant was justified, not those who challenge it.</p>

<p>so, either you are ignorant about the topic, or you arevintentionally trying to mislead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the political motive of the dossier matters for the same reason that if someone who had never met you, who wanted their friend to get the job you were applying for, to the cops and said you were a drug dealer, who shouldn&#39;t be allowed to get your friend&#39;s job, was presented to a judge in a warrant application as simply &quot;an acquaintance of the target.&quot;</p>

<p>a judge will rubberstamp the &quot;acquaintance&quot; backed request, however, if the judge knew that the acquaintence (1) had never met you and (2) was motivated at least partially to benefit from your arrest, the judge, if he&#39;s honest, will refuse and tell the cops to come back with something more, because motivation always matters in matters of law. </p>

<p>this is why when testimony against someone comes from someone who received a lighter sentence or a reduction of their sentence, it must be disclosed in court.</p>

<p>the memo isn&#39;t about the dossier at all. it is about the legality of the, for all intents and purposes, search warrant. warrant abuse is a very big issue in america. if you ever get arrested and your lawyer doesn&#39;t challenge the warrant pro forma, get another lawyer. the warrant is the most important step in the criminal process. once it&#39;s issued, you are in the system and then your fate is in your lawyer&#39;s hands because of the very nature of the fact every defendant starts on their back foot.</p>

<p>no one has said partisan information shouldn&#39;t be avaialable to the FBI or DOJ. the issue isn&#39;t whether they have it. that&#39;s not the issue at all. the issue is that a judge should have as much information as possible before subjecting someone the legal system.</p>

<p>another example-in the salem witch trials, it turns out that the two main families involved had had a long standing feud and were fighting over ownership of a parcel of land. when little annie putnam fingered the first porter, the warrants issued based, presumably, on the fact that ann had no malice towards porter. back then it likely wouldn&#39;t have impacted matters, but if it was you, wouldn&#39;t you like the judge to know that ann and her family hated you and wanted your land, before the judge decided to act on their information?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not if the investigation is known to be corrupt, seems to have no concrete goal and already has been going on for a long time without any end in sight.  It is a distraction and a waste of taxpayer money.  Now we find out that the rationale behind the investigation was deliberately cooked by partisan interests.  Increasingly it looks like Obama may have been involved in tampering with the election.  This is worse than Watergate.  If Nixon did something like this -- or Trump, it would be all over the news and those involved charged with treason.  Obama and Hillary seem to be getting a get out of jail free card -- no questions asked. </p>
