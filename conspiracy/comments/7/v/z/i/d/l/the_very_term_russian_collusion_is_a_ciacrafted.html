It also keeps everyone arguing about stupid nonsense that will never be proven or disproven, instead of all of the obvious crimes of the CIA and their Manchurian candidate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_International_Corporation#Barack_Obama">Barack Obama</a>, or W going along with the 9/11 myth like a nice CIA director&#39;s son, or Bill Clinton protecting the CIA&#39;s cocaine airport in Mena, Arkansas, etc.</p>

<p>If you think Trump did something illegal, name the <em>specific</em> crime and the <em>specific</em> evidence proving the crime.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I absolutely believe that Bill Clinton &amp; eventually were nurtured &amp; pushed into the spotlight by CIA ex president Bush Senior.</p>

<p>Clinton &amp; Bush are way too close since before Clinton became governor &amp; politically they are practically the same in regards to selling out the jobs of the American people to slave wage labor countries.</p>

<p>In my opinion Prescott Bush &amp; George Bush Senior grew the Deep State &amp; since Bush Sr is
being kept in a state of Kissinger/Rockefeller in perpetuity I would say their is probably a power struggle going on trying to get rid of a &#39;populist&#39; president they thought they could easily dispose of.</p>

<p>The deep state wanted Clinton. She was the supposed perfect identity politics candidate in their mind. They built up Trump thinking they could take negative attn away from Clinton &amp; extinguish public attention towards massively popular socialist Sanders.</p>

<p>Didn&#39;t work the way they had planned.</p>

<p>I think Trump obstructed justice when he fired Comey and acknowledged in a recorded interview that he did so to impede an ongoing investigation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz said Wednesday that President Donald Trump &quot;exercised his constitutional authority&quot; in asking former FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.</p>

<p>&quot;You cannot have obstruction of justice when the president exercises his constitutional authority to pardon,&quot; Dershowitz told Anderson Cooper on CNN, &quot;his constitutional authority to fire the director of the FBI, or his constitutional authority to tell the director of the FBI who to prosecute, who not to prosecute.</p>

<p>&quot;Even if he did want to impede it – and even if he did impede it, that is his constitutional power,&quot; he said of Trump. &quot;He has the right to say, &#39;You will not investigate Flynn.&#39;&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that there is an ongoing obstruction of justice investigation demonstrates that the issue of whether or not a president <em>can</em> be indicted for it is far from settled. </p>

<p>Furthermore, saying that &quot;it&#39;s not illegal when the president does it&quot; is an incredibly weak excuse. Impeachment and most punishments that can be imposed on the president have no base requirement of technical criminality, so if it&#39;s determined that he met the definition of obstruction of justice he can still suffer consequences.</p>

<p>You&#39;re confused. <em>I</em> cited a Democrat Harvard Law scholar explaining why I&#39;m right, with direct quotation explaining the relevant issues. <em>You</em> just linked a 108 page document written by trial lawyers with a direct financial conflict of interest to their objectivity :</p>

<p>&quot;CREW is a party (and is providing representation to other parties) in active litigation involving President Trump and the administration. Barry Berke and Kramer Levin are outside pro bono 
counsel to CREW.&quot; (p.2)</p>

<p>Keep googling, though. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be able to find some hack lawyer out there that will claim the Constitution doesn&#39;t mean what it says.</p>

<p>There <em>is no case</em>. The President cannot be prosecuted for doing what the Constitution allows him to do. It&#39;s really that simple.</p>

<p>They&#39;re not. I cited a Harvard Law professor and the United States Constitution. You, meanwhile, are still here blathering on about nothing in particular, but insisting that Robert Mueller is going to bring a case that would be dismissed immediately if he ever brought it.</p>

<p>Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz:</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;I come not to praise President Trump nor to defend his policies, but to defend the constitution,&quot; Dershowitz said during an early morning legal debate with CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin on the network&#39;s &quot;New Day&quot; program. </p>

<p>&quot;The president of the United States should not be subject to criminal prosecution for merely exercising his constitutional authority.&quot;</p>

<p>In the absence of any specific statutes in the matter, a president not only has the right to fire an FBI director, Dershowitz continued, but has the power &quot;to tell the director of the FBI who to investigate and who not to investigate.&quot;</p>

<p>The only scenario where you <em>might</em> have a highly speculative case is if Trump was trying to cover his own ass. Otherwise, he can tell the FBI to stop pursuing any case he damn well pleases, as well as pardoning whoever he damn well pleases without explaining himself to anyone.</p>

<p>And no, Trump was not under investigation:</p>

<p>&quot;Former FBI Director James Comey has confirmed something that Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed - that he is not personally under investigation.&quot;</p>

<p>Seems like you should understand the relevant issue before mouthing off. Pretty soon you&#39;re going to want Trump impeached for negotiating treaties, or commanding the armed forces, or any of the other things that Constitution says he can do however he wants.</p>

<p>&quot;A federal judge on Thursday dismissed a lawsuit accusing the president of violating the Constitution through payments from foreign entities to his businesses. U.S. District Court Judge George B. Daniels in Manhattan deemed the lawsuit from the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and other plaintiffs lacked standing, and the plaintiffs had failed to prove injury.</p>

<p>The plaintiffs have alleged President Trump&#39;s &quot;vast, complicated and secret&quot; business interests — like the Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., blocks from the White House — have resulted in violations of the Domestic and Foreign Emoluments Clauses of the Constitution, intended to prevent bribery from foreign entities. The plaintiffs argued it was unconstitutional for Mr. Trump&#39;s businesses to benefit from foreign representatives staying at his hotels and eating at his restaurants while Mr. Trump is in office. </p>

<p>But Daniels said the plaintiffs failed to prove injury from the accusations. The judge did not elaborate on whether Mr. Trump was indeed in breach of the Emoluments Clause, saying <em>that was a case for Congress.</em>&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, the judge wasn&#39;t going to hear a case on a fundamentally political question.</p>

<p>Both. Mike Flynn is a national hero for calling out the US government&#39;s <a href="http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/headtohead/2015/07/blame-isil-150728080342288.html">support of ISIS</a>, and it was obvious the whole investigation of him was payback for making the CIA look bad (when they were giving support to people that will cut your head off for not being in their religion). He didn&#39;t admit to any wrongdoing other than misleading the FBI, and that will probably get overturned when it&#39;s proven that the whole investigation began with fake evidence.</p>

<p>I think there was and is enough evidence in the public information system to call for an investigation.  </p>

<p>You have condemned and found Hillary guilty. </p>

<p>and are refusing to consider  an investigation of Trump. </p>

<p>That is just so weird. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>See. 
Now there is an all Republican government in D.C. and the Supreme Court is very conservative,  so why isn&#39;t Hillary under arrest?</p>

<p>That was all just bull shit for you to now tell yourself, we don&#39;t have to punish the crook in the White House or any in Congress because, that crook Hillary is walking around free.</p>

<p>When was the trial?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don’t have to be embarrassed by your behavior I’m just embarrassed for you. I don’t have to go to law school I’m not the prosecuting attorney in the case. I’m confident the Mueller will bring the case when it’s ready and then (and only then) will we have specifics to talk about. You don’t have any special access or information to what Mueller has seen so it’s pointless to discuss complete fabrications of pretend cases that have not yet been brought.</p>

<p>Yeah. Meaning at least one federal judge thought this was stupid. Also, this is a civil suit, not a criminal one. Impeachment has to involve high crimes &amp; misdemeanors</p>
