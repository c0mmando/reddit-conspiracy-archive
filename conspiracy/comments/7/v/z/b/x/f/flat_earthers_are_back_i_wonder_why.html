       Anybody seeing this rubbish spewing out? We don't actively dig out space runs and tests. But there is some really bad evidence shooting about and it's all about the dumbing down. I don't even think it's flat earth v conspiracy anymore. It's fucking the companies who spread disinformation. It's stupid v stupid. It's so obvious to see I think the real people on here have gave up trying to even speak up about it now.

       It's because Space-X (Fake-X) just faked putting a car into the non existent "outer space" to perpetuate the hoax.  There is always going to be more talk about this stuff when they fake more nonsense.

       Unless I'm mistaken, the side of the object facing the sun would get hot - but only up to about 250ish degrees fahrenheit - while the side facing away from the sun would be a cool minus 150, give or take. The "average" temperature of space (and objects in near earth but outside our atmosphere) should be something around 50 degrees - one part hot and one part cold.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see, we're really, really damn far away from the sun. So much so that it takes light itself a bit over 8 minutes to get here from the sun. In that span of time, the heat (radiation) disperses and kind of spreads out which makes it so that our planet is a bubbling blob of magma.

       Ok, so lets say it's not hot enough to bubble or melt anything, there would still be a lot of strain from rapidly cooling and heating between +/- 120c and unfiltered UV/cosmic radiation.  You can see in the footage that it is rotating with respect to sunlight. The rapidly expanding and contracting metal body doesn't cause the paint to crack, the car looks pristine and unchanged and is according to Elon "literally" a normal car.
      </p>

       I look forward to future spacecraft where they don't bother with gold foil shielding etc and instead just pay for the ¬£500 metallic red paint option.

       Like...what do you expect? The "average" temperature as I mentioned would be about 50 degrees near earth and getting colder and colder the further away you get. Once you get sufficiently far enough away, the temp should be a balmy 3 or so degrees kelvin - just above absolute zero.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you pointed out, it's spinning. So even if 250 degrees is enough to make a car body "crack" (it's not) it's rotating like rotisserie instead of baking the same side constantly while keeping the other cold - it results in an even heat distribution of the average I pointed out in my first post of about 50F (but it's slightly cooler now since it's getting further away from the sun).

       You say that as if we're supposed to blindly believe that NASA fakes live feeds without a grain of evidence. What would anyone gain from continuing to trick the populace into thinking that space exists if it really didn't? Why go to all the trouble of staging all of these fake launches and spending man hours and money instead of simply saying "It's not worth going back."

       As for why they do it: I am not a part of TPTB so there is no way I could possibly know but if I had to guess and seeing as to how they are tied to Satanic groups, I would say it's to subvert the belief in God and the Bible. The fact that they can swindle us out of are hard-earned tax dollars is just icing on the cake.

       If you take a moment to objectively step back and comprehend your statement with a fresh mind, you'll understand just how ludicrous that sounds.

      <p>
       I promise you, I'll watch the videos here in a bit. I'm at work at the moment and YouTube is blocked by our network. I'll give it a shot because as I mentioned earlier, I'm all for questioning the narrative and not blindly falling prey to the narrative. Space exploration and travel is just one of those topics I'm passionate about and have been since I was a little boy, and I literally cannot fathom a coverup of this size taking place - would make the 9/11 coverup look like a childhood secret in comparison.

       I'm not overly religious yet the evidence that our Gov, our entertainment industry, our medical industry, etc. are run by an elite group of Satanists is too much to ignore. It really doesn't matter if we believe in this spiritual war or not, they sure do and have been lying to us about the world we live in for centuries. Our media is controlled by 6 main corporations and their fingerprints go into many smaller corporations/businesses that effect all aspects of our lives.

       Satanic handsigns/gestures throughout all entertainment/media, emails exposing worshipping of Moloch, annual Bohemian Grove retreat with Moloch worship and fake ritual sacrifices, belonging to groups like Skull and Bones and Freemasonry, etc. Maybe look into it on your own if you really want to learn.

       A Google search of "celebrities covering one eye" is not a fucking source, what planet are you on? That doesn't prove anything. It proves
       <em>
        some
       </em>
       celebrities
       <em>
        sometimes
       </em>
       cover one eye.

      <p>
       That Bohemian Grove quote doesn't have a source.

      <p>
       That URL doesn't even work.
      </p>
      <p>
       A YouTube video is not a source (flat earthers post YouTube videos too, but the earth obviously is not flat)
      </p>
      <p>
       And that supposed Freemasonry source doesn't prove anything either...it's baseless conjecture at best using
       <em>
        Bible quotes
       </em>
       to "prove" some vague point about freemasonry, and it fails. Have you actually read your sources? The fact that one of them doesn't even work tells me no, you haven't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post some real sources please, the only legitimate thing there was Moloch, which is a little odd (although if they were supposedly using "code" for pedophilia, wouldn't they also use "code" for worshipping Moloch?

       Massive amounts of photographic evidence of mulitple celebities and politicians covering one eye, putting the 666 symbol over their eyes, throwing up devil horns, etc. is definity reliable evidence whether you want to believe it or not. They are examples for you to see. Look around and you will see them flaunting these symbols everywhere: on TV, in the movies, during concerts/speeches, on ads, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the bohemian grove link, it wouldn't highlight the whole link even though I tried to redo it multiple times. Highlight and copy/paste the whole thing and try it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the Freemason stuff, while you may see baseless conjecture, others do not. That's your right but that doesn't make it untrue. Any evidence to debunk it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Youtube vids are valid sources as they can contain valuable information. Whether you want to believe them or discount them just because of Flat Earth vids is your choice, but a rather head in the sand kind of thing on your part. You can easily research what the vids claim to see whether you believe it to be true or not.
      </p>

       Maybe you grew up or maybe you just closed your eyes. Different perspectives I guess.

       How is I evidence? Evidence of what, that it's a common sign for a photoshoot? And you haven't mentioned why this supposed all controlling group has random celebrities do it. Not to mention why all of these celebrities with the knowledge of this so called secret society havent went to the press for the biggest story of the century, or confessed in their deathbed.
       <br/>
       It's not evidence I'm afraid, you'll have to try harder.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried that link again, and it's the same as the other one...using Bible quotes as "proof" (despite the Bible's known inaccuracies, that it's been translated and re-translated and proven wrong).
       <br/>
       How is that proof? It's like flat earthers using the "firmament" Bible verse to prove flat earth, or the Bible mentioning the age of the earth and taking that literally, despite the fact that carbon dating conclusively disproves it. So why should I take it seriously?

      <p>
       I don't need evidence, the burden of proof lies son you claiming Freemasonry is an all powerful secret society. That's like me saying "the moon is made of cheese...any evidence to debunk it?"
       <br/>
       That link is at best an opinion piece, again for some reason using Bible quotes. Not a good source.

       Celebrities are mind controlled using MK Ultra and are tools to be worshipped and emulated by the masses. They do these symbols so that we imitate them. These symbols are also stored in our subconscious minds. They use subliminal messaging in media as a form of mind control. Celebrities have spoken out before through music mostly but others have made comments you can look into if you really want. I believe you have already made up your mind so I won't waste either of our time.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't have to believe me and I don't expect you to take one source as complete evidence in regards to Freemasons. You can use that source to fuel your own research or dismiss it because it contains Bible verses. Up to you. However,  seeing as to how you avoided the Skull and Bones information both times, I assume you agree or at least cannot debunk what I say about them.
      </p>

       As for Alex Jones, he is obviously controlled opposition, but he does provide truth from time to time. This was one of those times.

       I have done my own research, lots of it. I concluded it was nonsense. Using Bible quotes as evidence is shooting yourself in the foot.

       Skull and Bones is definitely somewhat legitimate, it helps people into the Senate or become President. I'm just not convinced they somehow rule the world.

       Celebs and MK Ultra:
      </p>
      <p>
       When a lot of this horrific information came out in 1977, the project was supposedly scrapped. But a growing number of people believe that the project continued underground, and began focusing on the only people who could truly influence the mass population: Celebrities. In fact, any time a tangentially famous person begins to act slightly odd, MK Ultra truthers come out of the woodwork claim that the breakdown is evidence of their MK Ultra programming failing. Today we‚Äôre taking a closer look at those celebrities who just might be under MK Ultra mind control.

       Celebrities like Kanye West, Britney Spears, Carrie Fisher, Lady Gaga, Marilyn Monroe, Nicki Minaj, Roseanne Barr, Martin Lawrence, and countless others have all had breakdowns where they have said very strange things about the inner workings of Hollywood culture. Roseanne Barr, the famous sitcom comedian, has openly said that there is a lot of MK Ultra in Hollywood. You will find many testimonies of satanic and dark occult practices being pushed on celebrities by powerful elite groups. Time and time again we see performances that even someone with an elementary understanding of magic rituals and symbolism can easily recognize. A recent example is Beyonce's 2017 Grammy performance.

       Secret Societies and Symbolism

       The ironic fact is both evangelical and Masonic authorities are at complete agreement on the deceptive nature of secret society symbolism. The most authoritative Masonic writer ever, was held to be Albert Pike (1809-1891). He rose to Sovereign Grand Commander of the Supreme Council of the thirty-third degree (Mother council of the World) and Supreme Pontiff of Universal Freemasonry. In his book ‚ÄòMorals and Dogma‚Äô (accepted universally as ‚Äòthe bible‚Äô of Freemasonry) Pike admits: ‚ÄúMasonry like all religions, all the Mysteries, Hermeticism and Alchemy, conceals its secrets from all except the Adepts and Sages, or the Elect and uses false explanations and misinterpretations of its symbols to mislead those who deserve to be misled; to conceal the Truth which it calls Light, from them, and to draw them away from it.‚Äù
      </p>
      <p>
       He further states, ‚ÄúThe Blue Degrees are but the outer court or portico of the Temple. Part of the symbols are displayed there to the Initiate, but he is intentionally misled by false interpretations. It is not intended that he shall understand them, but it is intended that he shall imagine he understands them‚Äù (‚ÄòFinal Notice‚Äô by Barry Smith pp. 328-329).

      <p>
       In today‚Äôs culture, there are many hidden symbols which we may or may not notice. There is evil symbolism in certain types of fashion, print, hand gestures, video games, movies, books, tattoos, music videos, etc.¬†The evil culture of people in society cowardly use symbols to show whom they belong to. Ultimately, anybody influenced to live a wicked life is influenced by Satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also a secret society of Satanic people called, ‚ÄúThe Illuminati‚Äù. There are several Illuminati and Satanic symbols which many celebrities use to show their allegiance to evil. Such celebrities do not worship the true and living God of Heaven; rather, they worship Satan and/or they worship themselves and their riches and fame.¬†The secret society of the Illuminati (founded by Adam Weishaupt in Bavaria in 1776) has been manifested in popular culture.¬†Their desire is to create a New World Order and to dominate the world with evil.

       Subliminal Messaging
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears that subliminal messages are everywhere, from children‚Äôs cartoons to mass media advertisement. However, while some of the messages are evidently true, are all of the messages what the critics say they are or as the companies explain to be plain coincidences? Or perhaps most of the so-called subliminal messages are simply a Rorschach effect where the critics are analyzing the film, videos and posters and seeing what they hope to see.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how effective subliminal messaging really is? Some countries including the United Kingdom, United States of America and Australia banned the practice of inserting subliminal messages in their advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apparently, everyone is susceptible.

       You still haven't mentioned why the so-called elite Freemason group has all of these celebrities making people aware of this "secret" society. That's a bit backwards, no? And "subliminal messaging" DOESNT work, it's been debunked. See my link, yours is just a blog post lmao, not very credible

       Post sources that aren't fucking wordpress, do you know what wordpress is? It's a blog. Not helping your argument
I have done my research, as I said. I concluded it was all nonsense, and your "sources" full of conjecture and Bible verses, most of which I've already seen before just confirm my belief.

       These are conspiracy THEORIES, correct? If we could prove anything 100%, they would no longer be theories, would they? Not sure what link you are talking about as you have yet to provide any sources, just crying that mine are not legit or have Bible verses as if that somehow makes the information unreliable. As I've stated, you already made up your mind which is fine, more power to you. Take care.

       Yes, the Bible does make it less reliable when it talks about stoning virgins, a firmament above the earth, the earth being a few thousand years old, etc. It absolutely makes the information reliable, what a joke.

       Go for it. Provide some examples of why you believe it to be so as I did with my views by supplying photographic evidence, explanations from history, testimonials, etc. and I am sure you will go far until someone comes along and rejects everything you say because it doesn't fit their burden of proof no matter how well sourced because some pages include Bible verses.

       My evidence is because I say so. In my opinion, the moon is made of cheese - because it kind of looks like it, and I personally believe it could be made of cheese. And I think some people 1000 years ago said it was made of cheese too.
      </p>
      <p>
       There, that is about the same as your blog post "evidence."
       <br/>
       I rejected it because it doesn't make any sense and isn't proof in the slightest. Sourcing it from an opinion piece on a BLOG isn't a source. It's just that, an opinion.

       Good luck with your close-minded attitude. I see you do a wonderful job going beneath the surface questioning why they are covering one eye or throwing up devil horns and 666 signs constantly in all forms of media. Just take everything at face value and you will go far in life bud!

       LOL questioning things doesn't mean accepting whatever nonsense you read online. Are you a flat earther too? Because they supposedly "question everything" but their evidence is just as weak, not to mention nobody can explain why for some reason they'd have they're secret symbol everywhere in public.

       I am lost. You posted that you believe Flat Earth, used the Bible to confrm the Earth is flat as well as the firmament, talked about NASA's lies, etc. Are you saying you were joking? Your comments look serious to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe there is no actual proof the Earth is a globe just as there is no proof it is flat. However, my eyes show me it is flat and there is more evidence it is not a globe than that it is. Take that for what it's worth.

       What about the pictures of it being a globe? Not just from NASA, but Japanese and Russian satellites? Or sunsets? Or the coriolis effect? Or different star constellations in different hemispheres? That definitely qualifies as definitive proof the earth is a globe. There is absolutely no reason to believe the earth is anything else.

        113) The idea that people are standing, ships are sailing and planes are flying upside down on certain parts of Earth while others tilted at 90 degrees and all other impossible angles is complete absurdity. The idea that a man digging a hole straight down could eventually reach sky on the other side is ludicrous. Common sense tells every free-thinking person correctly that there truly is an ‚Äúup‚Äù and ‚Äúdown‚Äù in nature, unlike the ‚Äúeverything is relative‚Äù rhetoric of the Newtonian/Einsteinian paradigm.

        A hypothesis is either a suggested explanation for an observable phenomenon, or a reasoned prediction of a possible causal correlation among multiple phenomena. In science, a theory is a tested, well-substantiated, unifying explanation for a set of verified, proven factors.

       I‚Äôm baffled bro... I see space related content on r/all every day reminding everyone about it. Then when you post anything iffy as proof of something going on, ‚ÄúGTFOOH you uneducated imbecile‚Äù while they stroke their egos to paid actor scientists. Neil, bill, sagan. People don‚Äôt understand that all knowledge from all schools is part of a one world (UN) education curriculum. If I was leading that curriculum, I‚Äôd easily fake history on a daily basis. In 1543 lived a man named Cornelius Asparagus and he discovered the law of xxxxx and billions become hypnotized.

       There are a ton of occult overtures with his work. For instance, the All-Seeing Eye of Sauron. There are many other references and similarities.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.illuminati-news.com/tolkien-occult.htm">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many similarities to Freemason imagery as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       "A symbolic arch is supported by 2 pillars, themselves wrapped by climbing vegetation.¬† The arch bears an inscription written in an ancient form of Elvish, saying ‚ÄúThe Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.¬† Speak,¬†friend, and enter.‚Äù¬† Drawn below the arch are seven stars and a crown, and below these can be found a much larger star (the ‚ÄòStar of the House of Feanor‚Äô).
      </p>
      <p>
       This motif is very similar to the Royal Arch of the¬†Freemasons, who also incorporate seven stars into the space below the arch.¬† Their arch is comprised of 7 houses of the zodiac, whose position in the sky binds the Duat.¬† As such, the seven stars cannot denote the Pleiades star cluster in Taurus, nor the Corona Borealis, or Northern Crown.¬† They are also not suggestive of any stars present in the Duat itself, specifically around Sirius or Orion.¬† The ‚ÄòStar of the House of Feanor‚Äô, however, may be analagous with Sirius if we compare the Door of Durin and the Freemasonic Royal Arch.¬† This then gives us a very specific sky location, into which are incorporated a crown and seven stars."

       There's a huge uptick because of the Falcon Heavy launch which was accompanied by loads more footage than we usually get.

       There are plenty of flat-earth believers here. Remember that there are lots of people who would laugh at some of the theories you believe in, and they probably don't think those are pushed to distract them.

       Exactly why do you want FE trolls here? Their posts and comments get massively downvoted every single time. That's proof that nobody wants them here... except the mods (and their alt accounts?). Anyone who claims otherwise is full of BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get real yourself. Then again, you guys have chased off all of the legitimate users here and just about all that's left are trolls and spammers so I can see why you let them post. If not for them this sub would be empty. It's been a month since I looked in on this sub and it's spammier than ever and so very few actual conspiracy posts compared to a year ago. Since that appears to be the goal of all the new mods then great job!

       Because getting rid of Flat Earthers is censoring a conspiracy. The people behind the username may believe what they're saying so the mods of a

       definitely should delete lightly.

      <p>
       Let me put it this way: If a Nigerian prince posted here saying he would share his inheritance of millions of dollars with anyone who would put up only a few thousand to help pay his legal fees then would you leave it up just because some people believe it? Same thing. A hoax by any other name is still a hoax.

       It's flat, get over it. Go find, document and demonstrate the curvature if you can. Yes there's tons of disinfo regarding flat earth beliefs and models, just like there's plenty of pictures of drug addict neonazis yelling and making ugly faces while promoting nationalism (when nationalism is a perfectly reasonable idea). You're right however in the sense that dumb people gravitate to wacky ideas, and flat earth has become a bit of a 'goofy subject' for shitty news sites and shows to cash in on clickbait consumers. Everyone loves being sold the idea that he's really smart and there's people out there dumber than him, so there's money to be made by media companies running segments on flat earth. Naturally they have no interest in presenting the ideas, just in generating revenue via traffic/clickbait so they sell a garbage flat earth concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the curvature of the earth is still missing. The earth is flat. Sorry if that upsets your stomach. I can point you in the right direction if you want to study this.

       Just ask the Flat Earther if they've done anything to objectively prove their position, then offer them this link:

       For an objectively cheap price you or anyone else can prove definitively whether the earth is flat or round, you can control all the variables, including the camera, lens, and GPS used.

       You simply don‚Äôt understand how perspective works. Photos taken with round fish-eye lenses will distort the image; the same principle applies to concave or convex windows...

       The lens in the human eye is a CONVEX lens...

       The horizon can also be called the ‚Äòeye line‚Äô or the  ‚Äòskyline‚Äù...  in basic geometry, the definition of a ‚Äòline‚Äô dictates that it must be ‚Äòstraight‚Äô with ‚Äòno curves‚Äô.

       Divide and conquer is working as the elites are planning it. What was the fucking point of sending a ‚Äútest flight‚Äù car to space and now it seems like it‚Äôs not a test anymore. This is to divide and conquer. They know FE will argue about this and globalists are gonna argue back. Man the video editing softwares have gotten really good tbh. You all fail to put into consideration why FE are FE. Check it out from their perspective.

       Exactly why do you want FE trolls here? Their posts and comments get massively downvoted every single time. That's proof that nobody wants them here... except the mods (and their alt accounts?). Anyone who claims otherwise is full of BS.
      </p>
      <p>
       Get real yourself. Then again, you guys have chased off all of the legitimate users here and just about all that's left are trolls and spammers so I can see why you let them post. If not for them this sub would be empty. It's been a month since I looked in on this sub and it's spammier than ever and so very few actual conspiracy posts compared to a year ago. Since that appears to be the goal of all the new mods then great job!

       What about the pictures of it being a globe? Not just from NASA, but Japanese and Russian satellites? Or sunsets? Or the coriolis effect? Or different star constellations in different hemispheres? That definitely qualifies as definitive proof the earth is a globe. There is absolutely no reason to believe the earth is anything else.

       I mean check out these posts from that link, flat earthers are a joke there's no way they're serious:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        113) The idea that people are standing, ships are sailing and planes are flying upside down on certain parts of Earth while others tilted at 90 degrees and all other impossible angles is complete absurdity. The idea that a man digging a hole straight down could eventually reach sky on the other side is ludicrous. Common sense tells every free-thinking person correctly that there truly is an ‚Äúup‚Äù and ‚Äúdown‚Äù in nature, unlike the ‚Äúeverything is relative‚Äù rhetoric of the Newtonian/Einsteinian paradigm.
