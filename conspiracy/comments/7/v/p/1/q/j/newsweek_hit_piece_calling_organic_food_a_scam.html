    <div class="md"><p>To be fair the mammalian toxicity of DDT is not that high. The problem is its persistence and its related ability to bioaccumulate. </p>

<p>I have some in a 50% formulation which I&#39;m assuming is from the 60&#39;s or early 70&#39;s. As an experiment I should really try it out on some unsuspecting insects to see if it is still effective after half a century.</p>

That&#39;s the premise that angers humanity everywhere and is ethically and also morally sickening. The chemicals produced that are known to be toxic and instead of discontinue or research to decrease risks what do they do?

    <div class="md"><p>Not all, depends on where in the city you live. Also, you can grow them inside as long as they get the right amount of sunlight, which in larger cities I would recommend. I lived in Savannah, GA for a bit and didn&#39;t have issues other than people stealing when the plants were outside. I ended up bringing them in because I had some weird big windows  (old house). Now a place like Hong-Kong, London, NYC I would most likely recommend you grow them inside. </p>

<p>An aside: People grow pot indoors all the time, why couldn&#39;t you grow veggies? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grow all the food for myself, my family, dogs, etc. It took a bit to settle into a productive and *mostly problem free system. Over the years I have narrowed down specific varieties that do well in my area and very specific planting times to avoid pests and the like. I am to the point now where I rarely if ever have a crop failure and produce thousands of pounds of produce every season without any commercial inputs. I use cover crops, make my own compost, and add all the organic matter I can find around my little chunk of land. Point being... it&#39;s to the point now where I am only spending a little money on seed and feeding 10 plus people. It&#39;s possible. Keep at it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>EWG was being very misleading.</p>

<p>They only used measurements for synthetic pesticide levels. So, vegetables grown with synthetic pesticides obviously have a higher level of synthetic pesticides than food grown without them, but EWG didn&#39;t include the opposing measurements of organic pesticides on organic produce. </p>

<p>One reason they only used synthetic is that those levels are closely regulated by the USDA, and easy to measure molecularly, so the data is available online. The USDA organic program doesn&#39;t regulate organic pesticide levels at all, so organic food has unknown amounts of organic pesticides of various toxicities. Most/many people buy organic because they think organic=no pesticides, so it&#39;s not in EWG&#39;s organic industry funder&#39;s interests to tell the public this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greenhouses are great.</p>

<p>But I think the pesticide vs. no pesticide battle misses the forest for the trees focusing on added pesticides. Every plant naturally produces pesticides, because plants really don&#39;t want to be eaten by insects. Insect defense chemicals are why bitter greens are bitter, citrus smells like citrus, and peppermint is peppermint. All these are metabolites that are super toxic to insects, but not to us, so we eat them. So, everything already contains pesticides, and I generally don&#39;t expect the small amounts of pesticides maybe left on produce to hurt me any more than the phytoectysones in spinach do.   </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a great <a href="https://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/topics/Pages/OverviewOfPlantDiseases.aspx">info page</a> on plant defenses (go to the section &#39;Chemical Defenses&#39;)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main problem is that our food supply is dominated by large corporations that demand food only be grown in huge quantities for the best margins, and therefor must be able to be shipped large distances and still look good on a supermarket stand.  To achieve this we have ruined the fresh food industry by shipping unripened and heavily treated product, then artificially ripening it just to look good.  It&#39;s all tasteless garbage except for those few times a year when you actually can get local-ish stuff at proper ripeness because they can actually get the qualities needed for profit.  I&#39;m sure the same companies have lobbied the FDA and state governments to put up barriers to protect their supply chains.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it comes to &quot;organic food&quot; I have two words for ya <strong>food fraud</strong></p>

<p>How can you guarantee the provenance of any of the food you eat? You can&#39;t.  For example, there was a roadside seller of &quot;fresh, local, organic produce&quot;.  Late one night I saw the guy at a Walmart buying up huge quantities of veggies.  My thinking was, if this guy is growing enough to sell, why is he buying?</p>

<p>Also, 1/3 of organic produce comes from china. Only about 3% (correct me if I&#39;m wrong) of the country&#39;s land is arable. And of that, much or most is contaminated with heavy metals. Think that produce is truly organic?  <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/chinas_dirty_pollution_secret_the_boom_poisoned_its_soil_and_crops">https://e360.yale.edu/features/chinas_dirty_pollution_secret_the_boom_poisoned_its_soil_and_crops</a></p>

<p>Pretty much all produce and meat could be called &quot;Organic&quot;, because it is. Certified organic must meet a series of standards in that country, before it can be labelled as such.

<p>Also your argument is garbage, I in no way doubt that many people that sell vegetables, bought those vegetables at a retail/wholesale locations, and I also have no doubt that some companies blatantly lie regarding the quality of their products, though I don’t think this is limited to Organics. 
Even if 50% of the organic food I eat is “regular” food that’s still better that eating 100% manufactured chemically latent garbage food.

This is a myth. There are no &quot;terminator seeds&quot;, and the seeds are completely fertile. Farmers who purchase licensed seed sign a contract promising to not replant them. If they don&#39;t want this, they can purchase generic seed and replant it as much as they want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s so hard to sort through. Big marketing budgets on both sides too. I try to follow lots of academics in the area on twitter, since they tend to be pretty even handed, and definitely criticize industry &amp; Monsanto when they deserve it (<em>cough dicamba</em>). </p>

<p>The IARC report though is the outlier among like a dozen reports by multiple agencies and countries. They also say hot beverages are probably carcinogenic, but since they don&#39;t actually evaluate risk, dose, and exposure, there literally zero actionable information. The EPA and the NAS reports are way more comprehensive and transparently assembled. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean generic seeds with lower yields and lower profits that most granaries don&#39;t even take because they have to be cleaned and processed completely separate from patented seeds? Granted gmo or patented seeds do have higher yields but also are conveniently lacking or needing certain nutrients ratios that only a fertilizer produced by the same company can address and give the crops optimal yields. Not to mention MONSANTO IS SUEING THE STATE OF ARKANSAS for trying protect the rights of farmers who want to be able to use &quot;generic&quot; seeds that arent resistant to thier herbicides. Because if you spray round-up on a field of round-up ready seeds and the spray drifts in the wind it kills everything else it lands on. Another example in my home state which is not Arkansas fyi is of a farmer who planted &quot;generic&quot; cotton seeds in fields near fields of Round-up  ready seeds and cross pollination is alleged to have occured. He&#39;s in litigation currently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the concept you make of &quot;you get what you pay for&quot; completely. The free market or sale for profit of seed strains that individuals  work hard to create is a good thing. Competition leads to progress and let&#39;s face it we as a country and as a planet don&#39;t have enough arable land to feed the current population let alone one that&#39;s growing exponentially. My issues with Monsanto are wide and varying.  But one that people often overlook for GMOs or carcinogenic pesticides and herbicides is who&#39;s the competition of Monsanto? We both mentioned generic seeds but what&#39;s their name? Who distributes and created the strains? Monsanto is a monopoly that has cornered and controls US agriculture and we as a country and hell a species to be honest are at thier mercy</p>

Those I knew of what I somehow missed or forgot and on a search of dupont and dow to confirm merger is Bayer buying out Monsanto? 6 have become 3 apparently. Open source seeds are strains and varieties that are good for the backyard garden or hobby farm but they can&#39;t shake a stick at the bushels per acre of the big corporations GMO strains. Simply because most heirloom or  open source seeds are from when yield productions weren&#39;t as vital. Variety and regional specificity have gave way to strains that are market wide and temperature zones as well. Thats dangerous when you consider what would happen if blight or pest were to hit a certain type of crop. Example I use is bananas. Memory is sketchy but I know in the last century or so a insect or mold struck the global banana industry and killed off all but one  strain of banana trees that were commercially viable. In the ensuing rebuild of plantations and industry that strain was replanted globally and the strains that died off or suffered were allowed to die off and go extinct. No back up plan now is my point. </p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t hold any water for a few reasons.</p>

<p>First, almost nothing you eat is the result of &quot;evolution.&quot; Everything we eat has been bred not for survival of that organism, but to express the traits we see as desirable in them as a food source. It&#39;s not like you are going to find the strawberries we eat in the wild, they would never survive. They can only grow if we are protecting them and creating the just-right conditions. So we have already been intefering in &quot;preserving their evolutionary existence.&quot;</p>

<p>Second, in the case of GE, we didn&#39;t just come up with the idea and then do it ourselves. Transgenesis, the main GE practice, is found in nature. If you&#39;ve ever eaten a sweet potato, you&#39;ve eaten a naturally occuring GMO. Just like with cross breeding and hybridization, we took what we saw occuring in nature and used it to create artificial organism for our consumption.</p>

<p>So your exact arguments can be used against any type traditional type of breeding as well. The distinction is arbitrary.</p>

<p>But we don&#39;t need GMOs for them to pollute the worlds genome to preserve a corporate monopoly. These are entirely separate issues and your claim can be reached in many ways. I agree that GMOs are probably more efficient at this, because it is a more efficient way of doing what we have been doing for thousands of years, but if your issue is with coporate monopolies, that is separate from GMO. If your issue is with polluting the earth&#39;s genome, then you should only be out foraging for food because every breeding technic runs this risk.</p>

<p>Monsanto is evil - correct. </p>

<p>GMOs are not evil - correct - however GMO&#39;s seeds can be produced with an evil intent, like Monsanto has. They can also be beneficial if created with a good intent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let us not forget that &quot;organic&quot; is a certification that is costly to get and requires you to deal with red tape issues. A lot of the small farms that are actually producing the best food are not able to get the certification due to issues with bureaucracy.</p>

<p>Best way to get to get the best food is to grow it yourself or to get it from a good local farm. CSAs and farmer&#39;s markets are becoming more and more popular. Go meet the farmer, visit the farm, ask lots of questions, and see what they&#39;re up to. No local farms? Make friends with your gardening neighbors and see if you can make a deal with them. It is worth it. </p>

<p>I try to buy produce from within 50 miles of my house and that excludes most farms that would use GMO ingredients and triazines and VOCs and other hippie boogymen that I try to avoid. The first problem I have with modern farming is Monsanto, and the second is being called anti-science by online kool-aid drinking propagandists. This is a consumer economy, I am a consumer, and I have a preference, and these people (especially on Reddit) go absolutely INSANE and fly completely off the handle when I say I choose not to eat GMO veg. I don&#39;t like being told what to do, and I can afford high quality artisan goods.</p>

<p>And to all those opposed, I&#39;ll make you a deal. Socialize the agriculture industry and I&#39;ll eat whatever GMO you want. I&#39;m not sure the boycotting for health reasons. I have no problem with Frankenfood unless it&#39;s Al Franken. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just Eat Real Food and do the best you can. Buy organic and hope. I worked in the food industry for a spray company. Spoiled food is lost sales and lost profits. Bacteria on meats can kill and law suits for death are in the multi millions. Money and power make every decision made. They spray so much on food it is sickening to see. They spray in the bags prior to the food going in them, even bread. They can spray and hit every slice of meat coming off a meat slicer prior to packaging, yes every slice. They spray on the conveyors as food passes by. We ingest hundreds of chemical compounds every day added to the food so we are safe after we eat but they do not worry about long term effects just safety immediately. These chemicals mixed with the acids in your stomach form new chemical compounds and over time guess what????? CANCER. They don’t care as long as you do not get sick immediately. Long term sickness can be blamed on genetics, environmental/heavy metals anything but not them. Also view it as you can pay more now for food or pay a lot later for health care. Health care in USA is the number one cause of bankruptcy. Cancer is now at over 50% and there is one thing every American has in common, their diet. Your choice if you want to save a few bucks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As with everything, it&#39;s caveat emptor.  However, to say all organic food is not organic is simply wrong.  I would never buy produce from China, organic or not.  They&#39;ve poisoned their own children for chrissakes.  Buying organic from a road stand is also not smart unless the farm is certified organic.  Also, there are name brand organic companies that can be researched and trusted for their products. </p>

<p>For certain products you can readily tell an organic from a non-organically grown piece.  However, growing and foraging your own is always the best bet.</p>

<p>Like, I could grow blueberries conventionally, pay some $$$ to the Non-GMO project, add their label to the box, and increase the price 20%. The price point becomes about the same as actually organically produced blueberries, just by having the Non-GMO Project label, even though there GMO blueberries don&#39;t exist. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty harmful to organic farmers, since their production costs are higher than conventional, and now they have to compete with all these zero-effort Non-GMO labeled products.</p>

<p>The scam if you want to call it that is the misleading of the consumers. Grocery store science seperates the organic by price, location and merchandising it better. They are the ones scamming people. They know USDA Organic does not mean 100% organic but big playerslike Albertson&#39;s play on the limited time it&#39;s customers have to research. The placement is tohelpspeed you along but get you to pay the higer price tag. I have been in Albertson and they have 100% Pesticide Free signs. This is just false and if it was some small vitamin company saying these pills were good for you they would be shut the fuck down. If you pay to play you can get away with whatever you want. Play for free and you might end up in jail or ruined finanically.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way of knowing if the &quot;organic&quot; food you buy is actually organic, whatever that means to you, there&#39;s no standard system you can trust. There is no evidence to suggest that there&#39;s some additional nutritional value offered by foods identified as organic either. Double blind taste tests tell us that flavor isn&#39;t a compelling reason to prefer &quot;organic&quot; either. I&#39;m not saying GMOs are good either though, obviously there&#39;s evil on that side too, but slapping a &quot;organic&quot; label on a product doesn&#39;t make that a better product. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me, I think its important to eat as much organic labeled food as I can. Yes, you have to trust the sticker. I try to get locally grown food as well. Why put your body at risk and consume products that were sprayed with all sorts of lab created chemicals or consume non-natural types of food (GMO). Just my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was killing my liver with food. Now I have a healthy liver because of food. It is possible to eat clean. Grass-fed meat, responsible farming etc. The whole farm to table is good if you know the farm. </p>

<p>The most important thing I forgot to mention is Fuck your cancer!!!! I hope you KICK its ass. Your body is strong, stay mentally strong and look at UK and other countries that have some great medical advancements, We are not the only leaders in medical science. I hope you get through this. It is scary to be looking at the end of our time here. Diseases do not just attack the body they attack the loved ones and friends of the infected. It is traumatic. I hope science defeats all forms of cancer. You sound like you are focused on doing what your body needs and I am a stranger rooting for you!</p>
