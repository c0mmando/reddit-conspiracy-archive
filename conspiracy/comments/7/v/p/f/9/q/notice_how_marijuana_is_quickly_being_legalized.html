They are making the masses more prone and accepting to drug use and are desensitizing them and making them more willing to try harder drugs. Marijuana is a proven gateway drug and has scientific studies which linked marijuana use in adults to contribute to harder drug use in the future. people who smoke marijuana are more likely to become passive and are easier to subject to get government manipulation. 
Soon we will have a nation of heavily sedated drug addicted people if we don&#39;t wake up</p>

<p>Yeah,  i felt like i&#39;d fallen through a timewarp to 30 years ago. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve used it for 20 years, for most of that time using it daily and never progressed to anything harder.   I have on the other hand drunk less and less alcohol over the years because you really DON&#39;T want to get addicted to that.   </p>

<p>I&#39;ve stopped for a month and apart from finding it hard to sleep again (that sucks... ) and minor annoyances there is practically no withdrawal to speak of.</p>

<p>The real issue, that OP somehow ignores, is prescription drugs.  I&#39;ve been on them and holy fuck they change your personality, and are hard to come off.  They are also super easy to get (prescription drugs are free here). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for answering one of my 2 questions. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>high numbers of impaired drivers police are reporting in states where it has been legalized.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s because police are claiming that you are considered impaired up to 24 hours+ after smoking which is actually laughable.</p>

<p>The reason they are making up this lie is because you have butt-hurt cops that can&#39;t slap you with a possession charge once they find a legal patient with weed. So what&#39;s their loophole? Get the patient to admit they have smoked ANYTIME recently so they can get slapped with a DUI instead. Cops have hit there numbers too you know....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have had however too many friends who went from casual MJ use to full blown addiction, derailed careers, damaged health and infertility and/ or kids with birth defects.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m sorry about your friends. I&#39;m not going to say your friends had other underlying issues because I don&#39;t know them, but I will tell you about me and my friends. Me and my friends use MMJ daily and have been for the past 15 years. We EACH hold good careers, and last I checked I was healthy as can be for my age. Mind you we hardly smoke often (use vapes &amp; edibles mostly). </p>

<p>I do not have any EXTREMELY debilitating disease and do not NEED MMJ by any means, but it does alleviate my migraines and minor pains. And if something came up to where I had advanced pain... I definitely wouldn&#39;t want to use anything other than weed for it. I&#39;m actually curious as to what your idea of safer pain management techniques are. Anything I&#39;ve found is never safer and usually less effective. </p>

<p>Also you never answered my second question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This post reads like you’ve formed your opinion from Nixon/Reagan-war-on-drugs propaganda. The reasons it was illegal in the first place are underhanded and nefarious. Keeping it illegal all that time prohibited good research for the most part (unless research was government sanctioned, it wasn’t done). Any results frm research that showed any positive effects was surpressex to aid the propaganda.</p>

<p>Marijuana doesn’t dumb down the masses. The whole reason Nixon targetted the counter-culture and created the war on drugs to begin with was to marginalize the counter-culture (Hippies and African Americans, id’d as the potheads by Nixon et al). The reason for shitting these folks down was because they were actually seeing past Nixon’s bullshit and he was worried that they would lead more people to think for themselves.</p>

<p>Your ‘proven notion’ of marijuana being a gateway drug has been long debunked as well. Cannabis is actually helping people get off hard, addicting narcotics that have horrible side effects. Check the opiod crisis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is idiotic.  While there are tons of data out there to counter your ridiculous claims, I&#39;ll only now offer my anecdotal experience over the last 20 years:  I have consumed at a near-daily frequency during this time and have maintained a professional career, am raising kids, and paying my fair share of taxes. I have NEVER thought &quot;man, this weed isn&#39;t doing it anymore, maybe I need something stronger&quot;. Never.  </p>

<p>Maybe...just maybe, the real reason it&#39;s being &#39;legalized&#39; widely now is that people are waking up to <em>actual</em> facts:
1. It&#39;s therapeutic and medicinal.
2. It&#39;s safe (no OD potential, no serious dependency threat).
3. It&#39;s actually more economic for a state entity to regulate the legal production, sale/taxation than it is to incarcerate users and deal with the black market/cartel issues.
4. People seem to like it.</p>

However, one study has recently been getting a lot of media attention and some rather outrageous claims.  According to Scientific American, March 2013, heavy use of marijuana among adolescents can do permanent damage. According to Neurology Today (Oct 4 2012), smoking marijuana as a teen could lead to lower IQ as an adult according to a decades long study of more than 1000 New Zealanders. And, the authors themselves title their work, “Persistent cannabis users show neuropsychological decline from childhood to midlife.” Hmm..this is interesting - a large, longitudinal sample. If this is true, they have some pretty convincing evidence. I better look into this. What are their findings? What is the evidence?</p>

<p>I contacted the author, Madeline H. Meier, at the Center for Child and Family Policy, and asked for a reference to the original research.  She directed me to an article titled, “Persistent cannabis users show neuropsychological decline from childhood to midlife” and published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) 2012. I read this article very carefully and here is what I learned. To measure IQ, the authors used a very good psychological test. They tested children on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R) and repeat tested a small sample of adults (n=38) on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV). The group of regular users did indeed show a statistically significant decline in test scores on Vocabulary, Similarities, Information and Full Scale IQ which is heavily correlated with these verbal tests. However, the much more surprising thing is that the non-verbal scales, such as Arithmetic, Block design, and Picture Completion showed no statistically significant decline. If cannabis causes cognitive decline shouldn’t the ability to do arithmetic slow down? Shouldn’t block design and other non-verbal measures of intelligence be affected? One possible explanation for the discrepancy in their findings is that the first testing of the subjects was when they were in school and reading a lot of books, and taking a lot of vocabulary and spelling tests. The subjects were used to taking verbal tests. Out of school for at least twenty years and tested again at age 38, they may have stopped reading. Certainly, they are no longer taking vocabulary tests. The subjects were simply out of practice.This is just one possible alternative explanation that cannot be ruled out due to the correlational nature of the data.&quot;</p>

<p>Control of the media is much more effective at dumbing down people than giving them a choice in what they do to their bodies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound incredibly ignorant. Marijuana is NOT a gateway drug and this is one of the biggest MYTHS human ever created. if anything, you are more aware of harder drugs under the influence of weed. Weed does not dumb you down, it actually makes you smarter imo and from personal experience. Before I started smoking weed, I was much easily manipulated, especially by mainstream media. But after smoking weed and now smoking a joint daily, my critical thinking is back and sharper than ever. Weed is actually what made me join the &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; because I realized that the world and how THEY make it appear to be is so far from the truth. Weed makes your brain work faster. It intensifies your senses. Smell, vision, hearing, taste. Question, have you even tried weed or are you just spewing BS? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it’s the opposite you retarded product of DARE.  </p>

<p>Pot being illegal allows the state to punish normal, people who are non violent and throw them in jail on lengthy prison terms because prisons are privatized.  This means that those prisons get a nice paycheck PER prisoner.  They will spend .001% of said check on the prisoner.  The rest lines pockets of share holders. </p>

<p>You think them making pot legal helps this?  Yoh lack common sense. </p>
