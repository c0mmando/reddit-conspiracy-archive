       Why can't the DOJ which his headed by Trump appointees file charges? Because they don't have what it takes in court. It's that fucking simple. Trump runs the DOJ. It's part of the executive branch.

       It's just political grandstanding. These people do not actually want to dispense justice, odds are they would be up on the chopping block next. They're trying to call out dirt on the opposing side, but not enough to show that the whole process is just one huge corrupt corporate being, and both sides play to the tune sung.

       Interesting take. Almost every administration has indictments though. Some more than others. Some less. The previous one had less in 8 years than Trump had in 8 months.

       Obamaâ€™s administration got a pass on a lot of scandals.  Holder should have faced charges for perjury at the very least over fast and furious.  Lynch May still face charges, but I doubt it.

       <p>
        when FBI agents submit a FISA application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, they use information from multiple sources, according to current and former FBI officials. Whatâ€™s more, the same informationÂ is not used over and over to extend surveillance under FISA. Instead, every 90 days, the FBI, as a matter of practice, shows evidence to the court that agents are obtaining foreign intelligence informationÂ through the surveillance that is in line with the initial FISA application.

       Yeah,  its a grey world,  but this made up Cold War against Russia by the party that just took down Libya and was trying to take down Syria is outrageous.     They didn't make all this war risk up for you and me,   they made it up for themselves.

       Nothing like your assumption that the Steele dossier was a valid basis for a FISA warrant.    You have been exposed.

       The FISA warrant requires more evidence than one dossier.
      </p>
      <p>
       FISA warrants require new evidence every time they are renewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter Page had at least 3 renewals.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's 4 different times the FBI had to convince FISA judges that the warrants were necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The judges agreed with the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, for your theory that FISA courts are corrupt to be true - a dozen or so FBI agents working in tandem with several DOJ personnel conspired with the judges of the FISA court to unnecessarily monitor Carter Page, who had already left the Trump campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the FBI and DOJ wanted to taint Trump - why didn't they reveal publicly that they had a counter intelligence operation open because of Papadopoulos? Why did they not publicise Carter Pages FISA warrant before the election?

       Agree,   some parts do not make sense unless you realize this is not about the rule of law,   it is about politics,  a battle between two factions of elites against each other neither of which have any true commitment to transparency or the law,  BUT both of which have very strong survival instincts.
      </p>
      <p>
       A book could be,  and will be written on the last weeks before the election,  probably starting with the Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch a week after one of Fusions reports was issued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other books have already been written that cover Trumps rise from a joke of a candidate to his surprise win and the huge reaction that followed.     But no book can cover what was really going on with Comey in those last weeks before the election.    We do know that Peter Strozek was privy to the way the investigation into Hillary email scandal had been handled and that the NY authorities handling Wiener were a loose cannon.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know the timing of the Wikileaks releases of material on Podesta and Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election was close enough and the voting system obscure enough that we will never know how much some of the dirty tricks swung the outcome,   redistricting,   precincts with more votes than registered voters,   Russia adds on facebook,   there were issues on the margins.    But the bigger elephant in the room is that a rich white male biggot could grab votes from a population the Republicans had long written off or why so many who had supported Obama wouldn't raise a finger for Hillary.    The Democrats and liberals in general are wasting their time as if Pence would be any better except cosmetically.

       The real issues are not in the orange idiot.   Rome is burning.

       It appears he was able to put his personal bias aside and judged the matter on its merits. Which is exactly what you want from law enforcement.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does this tie in with your battle of the elite factions?
      </p>
      <p>
       To me this suggests the FBI was non-partisan in its work, it is only since Trump took office and repeatedly attacked the FBI that this issue even arose.

       He's not here to agree with you. He's here to take a shit on you. It's not okay what the FBI/DOJ did with that dossier. It was in fact illegal. Some of these cats perjured themselves. It is coming out. Ever so slowly. And the misinformation/distraction campaign is overwhelming. But there are rational people who see what this is. Anybody who can overlook Trump and can handle watching and comparing CNN and Fox with an open mind, will see the truth.

       you say it appears, while we already know it wasn't. the dutch intel started the investigation. hillary nor obama started the investigation on their own for political benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
       hillary was already anti-putin. as a career politician she has the money, knowledge and duty to take an extra step to see what's going on in the world. if she paid a company to

       looking into something that was already started for a republican group, how is that inappropriate?

      <p>
       hillary is twice removed in all of this.

       you got nothing else there would be charges filled even without the fbi.

       The Dutch are one of the most willing enablers of the US.    We already know there are thousands of corrupt Russian expats lending money to casino mobsters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why isn't it obvious that the oligarchs have taken over everywhere,  that the Podestas and Manaforts and Fusions are willing to take money from any filthy hand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially now that it looks like Obama was personally harvesting over at the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any real charges start getting filed,   the will have to shut down Washington DC its a farce.    Taking sides with Trump or Hillary/Obama is looking stupider by the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could have been fixing the basic system instead of feeding in by playing along with this fake drama.

       Interesting take. Almost every administration has indictments though. Some more than others. Some less. The previous one had less in 8 years than Trump had in 8 months.

       Typical partisan rant.    The bullseye hasn't shifted and you are living in make believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The proof:   If the shoe was on the other foot and it was Trumps admin caught spying on Democratic opposition,   you would have your pitchforks out to an even greater degree than what we are seeing right now.    Hypocrite.

       And everyone knows who Kallstrom is and that its former,  but there are limits to how long you can make a title.

       Again,  you fucking partisan trolls are so predictable.    I voted for Jill,   I hate Trump,   but I do give a shit that you trolls are helping to crash down any rule of law shreds we might still have in this country.

       So,  you agree its ok to have a partisan agenda controlling the FISA warrants and the witchhunt by partisan elements in the Justice department and FBI involved in the work of a special prosecutor? Got it.

       But when Trump gets caught doing the same thing,  your holy righteous indignation will shrill out like any prime snowflake.   Yup.   Got you figured.

       Agree,   some parts do not make sense unless you realize this is not about the rule of law,   it is about politics,  a battle between two factions of elites against each other neither of which have any true commitment to transparency or the law,  BUT both of which have very strong survival instincts.

       A book could be,  and will be written on the last weeks before the election,  probably starting with the Bill Clinton meeting with Loretta Lynch a week after one of Fusions reports was issued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other books have already been written that cover Trumps rise from a joke of a candidate to his surprise win and the huge reaction that followed.     But no book can cover what was really going on with Comey in those last weeks before the election.    We do know that Peter Strozek was privy to the way the investigation into Hillary email scandal had been handled and that the NY authorities handling Wiener were a loose cannon.
      </p>
      <p>
       We also know the timing of the Wikileaks releases of material on Podesta and Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election was close enough and the voting system obscure enough that we will never know how much some of the dirty tricks swung the outcome,   redistricting,   precincts with more votes than registered voters,   Russia adds on facebook,   there were issues on the margins.    But the bigger elephant in the room is that a rich white male biggot could grab votes from a population the Republicans had long written off or why so many who had supported Obama wouldn't raise a finger for Hillary.    The Democrats and liberals in general are wasting their time as if Pence would be any better except cosmetically.

       The real issues are not in the orange idiot.   Rome is burning.
