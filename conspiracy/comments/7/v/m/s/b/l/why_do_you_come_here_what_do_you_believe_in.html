       I come here now to pilfer through to look for possible nuggets of truth. What do I currently believe in, since you brought up reality, is a version of "The Egg Theory."
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we are part of a higher collective concious, that we can tap into, and gain everything from higher knowledge, to superhuman/supernatural abilities. We can gain everything from
       <a href="https://youtu.be/hBl0cwyn5GY">
        ESP,
       </a>
       to being real life versions of
       <a href="https://youtu.be/GC2TzspJn5A">
        Jedi Warriors.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The powers that be don't want us to know what we are all actually capable of. We are supposed to believe we are meaningless sacks of meat, on a meaningless speck of dust in an ocean of other meaningless (but beautiful) celestial bodies. And here's Tom with the weather.

       We probably do. Depending on who who ask, there may be other gods, angels, demons, interdimensional beings, or other versions of us in other layers of dimensions. I'm probably nuts, but I've heard as long as you question your own sanity, and occasionally worry about it... You're probably ok.

       I’m here to keep training myself to have an open mind, to keep learning new things and be aware of things that may not get enough spotlight outside of Reddit. Reading the Conspiracy subreddit keeps my mind on it’s feet so to speak. Ultimately I believe in truth and change, for the most part I think this subreddit encourages those two things.

       I come here because I call myself a sceptic but sometimes I just enjoy others doing the scepticism for me, while I sit back smiling at the creativity of some people on this forum. I do not believe alot of the theories (ufos, everything on infowars ever, random blogposts) but I always enjoy reading them anyway.

       To fall victim to ridicule is to do your own mind a disservice.
      </p>
      <p>
       All people should trust in their own ability to draw conclusions, even if they are wrong.  That is your own thoughts and your own opinions, nobody should have power over you not to have them.

       I believe that our human lives are short and temporary, but that we may have a "cosmic lifespan" to worry about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that the cosmic lifespan can be infinite, but god forbid it to be finite.  I feel that the determining factor to our long cosmic well-being might tie in to the innate nature of our own free will, so I try to be mindful of harnessing love, good intention, and confidence in my life - though it is the most difficult thing to do of all things especially confidence.

       I come here because it's a place of information coming from other people, other than just the news. I would rather the people ran the news than the big wigs. It's also a place of critical and challenging thinking. Since I've been lurking I can say I've grown mentally. I feel like I see and speak to people differently now, more out of Love than hostility. I come for the laughs from other users, or cool comments people make. I love when I can make connections in my own mind gathering pieces from each thread to build my own story of a scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       My beliefs have been crippled a bit since being here. But that's why I said critical and challenging thinking. I believe I'm here right now. In my home. I think of other humans doing their daily living in their specific space and time as I. I don't know what world or planet or environment this is. (Never been on a plane, haven't traveled except to Disney as a kid) I don't know man, I'm just here. I soak it all in and continue my path.
The one thing I do believe, is one day things will become pivotal. Things will be very bad outside. Fighting or whatever it will be but I don't want that day to come. When the day comes, I want to see us all love each other and not kill, look passed our physical forms. I'd hate to see us go into groups that they mentally conditioned us into.

       I view the forum because people post news that won't get posted, or be allowed to stay, on other threads.  Also, if I see something that I consider interesting or newsworthy, this is the only thread that allows me to post it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What conspiracies do I believe?  9-11 is my biggest.  I am totally convinced our own government was involved to some extent, and it makes me ill.  I also don't like the consequences of 9-11, which seem to be mostly the "security" state, and I'm starting to think those effects will never be reversed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Love is a complicated thing.  There are always conflicts between two things that are both loved, and then what?  Like abortion - you love the baby, but you also love the mother.  Where do you draw the lines?  Like 9-11 - someone attacks your country and kills 3000 people.  You love the country and are angry, but is 1.6 trillion for the Iraq war, 1.07 trillion for the Iraq war, over 7 trillion added to the debt, and more than 7,000 DEAD (never mind wounded, disabled, or generally f'ed up) Americans worth it?   Never mind the crash of America's reputation worldwide.  I guess I want to say that love, once it leaves the cosy confines of a feeling, and you translate it into an action ...

       As of spring 2017 I am a born again King James Bible believing Christian.  This happened after I realized God was real from diving down the conspiracy rabbit hole from 2012 until spring 2017.  It all started with Ron Paul getting screwed over by the media in 2012 then kept going from there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The short story is everything led to me discovering the world is not what we were taught as kids and "outer space" is a hoax.  This was evidence to me of a supernatural deception.  I delved into studying the Occult and found it's connections to the heroes of modern science.  Queue Spirit Cooking, Pedogate, False Flags, Hoaxes, and this caused me to logically conclude Lucifer is real and therefore God.  After praying for the first time in my life and researching I discovered that Jesus Christ is God who died for our sins and that all the religious groups that profess Christianity are actually deceptions.  True Christianity can only be found by reading the King James Bible for yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       After realizing this most important truth I confessed to God I knew what he did for me and my life started drastically changing.  I researched the Bible version issue and was hungry to read the King James Bible which I had never done in my life.  I had an urge to tell everybody about what had happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am here because so many conspiracies tie back to the deceptive Luciferians who run the world.  So much of what is happening in the world follows the scriptures.  It is a supernatural book of history and prophesy.  I enjoy giving my theories coming from my new perspective.  Ultimately I want people to get saved by the grace of God as I have been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Getting saved is so simple and is the end of the rabbit hole.  All that one needs to do is understand what they are, where they are headed, and how to get out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are all sinners and the wages for sin is death:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom_3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom_6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
      </p>
      <p>
       the Word of God came to earth as a human manifested as Jesus Christ and paid our penalty for us.  All we must do is repent of our rebellion ageist God and of our sinful nature and believe the gospel which is:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ paid our debt in full with his blood.  There is nothing left for us to do.  No going to building called Church, no donating money, no nothing can make up for the debt that we owe.  We cannot rely on what we do, we can only rely on what God already did for us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you realize this simply tell God the best way you know how:
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom_10:13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you do this and truely belive the gospel in your heart you will receive the Holy Spirit and he will guide and teach you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Joh_16:13  Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.

       It's a deep rabbit hole like everything else.  It's part spiritual discernment as well but if you got the time you can start here:

       The newer versions all change key verses and you can compare verse to verse and see exactly what they are doing.  Like the NIV removing Lucifer and giving him the title of Jesus Christ from Revelation.  Anyone who seriously studies the NIV will think the Antirchist is Jesus Christ when he shows up.  Many other versions (including the NIV) had Jesuits involved in their translations.  KJV has no copyright and there is so much that you can get out of it with a dispensational understanding of the scriptures that you can't come close to with other versions.  Another big one is the mark of the best being "in" the right had or forehead and all other versions say "on".  We now have a future where chips can be implanted into the body like this:

      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a perfect example of something that didn't make sense when modern translations were being made and it was "corrected" by men yet the KJV had it right all along.

       So it's more a case of the KJV being the best of the available English translations. Would that mean that reading the source material in the original Greek (assuming that's a possibility) is an even better option?

       I believe the authorized King James version is the pure word of God.  I believe the earlier translations and manuscripts in it's linage are great but they were the process of it being purified:
      </p>
      <p>
       Psa_12:6  The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really can't get your hands on the originals.  They are just fragments.  The KJV translators had access to everything available and the protection of a King and his Kingdom.  God's government is a Kingdom and he used Kings to enact his will all throughout history.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ecc_8:4  Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?
      </p>
      <p>
       For me it comes down to the idea that I know God knew English would be the predominate language and he can speak it just fine.  He does not expect us to learn Hebrew and Greek to understand his word.  Getting saved is very simple, so simple in fact that people can't believe it.  They want to complicate it with works so they can feed their human pride.  It's the same with the Bible issue.  Everything is simple!
      </p>
      <p>
       2Co_11:3  But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.

       Because growing up in a cult like religious environment and since moving on due to looking at 'outlandish conspiracy theories and the devils lies'  and realizing i was wrong about nearly everything i thought i knew... I cary over a sense of skeptical or inquisitive view of any narrative that is widely accepted. I like questions more than answers, i get board like that.
