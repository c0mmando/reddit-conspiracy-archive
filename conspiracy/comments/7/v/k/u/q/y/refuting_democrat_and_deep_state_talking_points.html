      <p>
       Yet another Democrat talking point is shown to be false. The disingenuous Adam Schiff has been spewing this on every interview he gives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schiff, ranking minority member of the committee, told CNN’s Anderson Cooper last week, “the chairman never bothered to go read these underlying materials. After months and months of making this argument that the FBI and DOJ are involved in some sort of conspiracy, he didn’t even bother to read the materials himself.”
      </p>
      <p>
       According to congressional sources familiar with the process, Nunes could not read the documents and applications associated with the memo. Under the DOJ agreement to review the FISA documents, the House Intelligence Committee was only allowed to select one lawmaker from the majority and minority, along with a select staff, to review the FISA application. The FISA application was on Carter Page, who worked for a short period of time as a volunteer for President Trump’s then campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       The committee selected Gowdy to view the documents associated with the FISA application based on his legal background and understanding of FISA warrants.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a January 24 letter, from Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd demanding that the committee not make the memo public as they had not reviewed it, Boyd states “the terms of access stipulated that the review of the documents would be limited to the Chairman or his designee, the Ranking member or his designee, and two staff members each (Mr. Gowdy reviewed the documents for the majority. Mr. Schiff reviewed the documents for the minority.)”
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, Schiff was the only member, other than Gowdy, to review all the documents. The question then is, why if he knew this did he slam Nunes publicly for not reviewing the documents?
      </p>
      <p>
       Schiff could not be reached for immediate comment.

       Yeah when I posted that I was correct. I didn’t see Nunes posting that. If you look into my history, which you obviously did, you missed my post about when I Nunes finally claimed he actually didn’t read memo.

       I don’t understand what your argument is here. It’s kind of confusing.   Are you arguing that Nunes did view documents and Schiff is wrong in claiming that?  Or that Nunes didn’t read documents and Schiff is wrong for pointing that out?

       The argument is that Schiff knew very well why Nunes didn’t read the underlying documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the stipulation was that only one person, along with two aides, were allowed to view the underlying documents according to the deal they worked out with the FISA court.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Nunes decided that Gowdy would view the documents because he had over a decade of experience as a Federal Prosecutor.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when Schiff goes on the LSM, he says that Nunes never read the documents knowing that that was the agreement.

       The user is saying Schiff is being dishonest. Schiff is making it seem like Nunes didn't bother reading the source of his own memo. It is an effort to discredit the memo. Only one member per party was permitted to view documents. Gowdy viewed for the majority and Schiff viewed for the minority.

       Doesn't this mean 4 people reviewed them meaning Nunes could have potentially been one of them? Seems like if you're spearheading this thing, it would make sense to be 1 of the 4 to take a look.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus at this point, I feel like Nunes is more entrenched with the deep state than Schiff. They've both been in congress for about 15 years, and between secret midnight meetings at the whitehouse, and repeatedly seems to put protecting his party over telling the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I don't get how he could have taken a look at that document and tried to pretend it was going to be worse than Watergate.

      <p>
       The hype he created around what amounted to a false statement reminds me of the hype the Bush administration built up over false info in the lead up to the Iraq war.

       I don't really watch cable news, but I can't really find any quotes on Nunes and from what I hear, he didn't make any appearances to defend his memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it does seem like a lot of the talking points he pushed out either weren't backed up, or were outright falsified by the document he released. Seems like he was the one basically resorting to fear mongering in the lead up to this. This is starting to seem like a pattern of behavior for him since it's not the first time he's done something like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a fan of just about anyone in Congress, but it seems like you're saying a guy with very recent ethics violations, who over hyped a document with not much substance is being honest and transparent, and a guy who made a factually correct statement is resorting to deceit and fear mongering.

       I don't really understand why he considers this FISA abuse, or why he feels its politically motivated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI first approached Page in 2013 saying Russians might be trying to recruit him. The FISA court was made aware that the dossier came from a political source (or they'd be pretty stupid to assume an opposition research document wasn't politically motivated), but that was only one part of the evidence. And even if that was the lynch pin, the warrants can't get renewed unless you prove you gathered information that the person was acting as a foreign agent. So not matter what hypothetical you're going off of, it definitely points to some strange stuff going on.

       Page may have been approached in 2013. I have seen no information saying that fisa warrants continued till the one taken out mentioned in memo. Nor do I see facts about 2013 mentioned in memo. If Page was

       Having a tough time following your comment, but I'll try to reply the best I can.

       They didn't get a FISA warrant in 2013. Just approached him to warn him that Russian may be trying to recruit him which could put him in a legally compromising position.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't mentioned in the memo, but seems relevant because there really couldn't be any anti-trump motivation for warning him in 2013, but shows he'd been on their radar for quite some time.
      </p>
      <p>
       They got a FISA warrant after he left the Trump campaign, and it was renewed several times. From what I understand, the warrants have to be renewed every 90 days, and can only be renewed if the surveillance reliably showed somebody was acting illegally as a covert foreign agent.

       And so what of 2013? If Page was under investigation then or not is irrevellent. I see no mention of it in Mempio. Fisa warrants are renewed every 90 days with further actions needed to approve its renewal I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Example is as search warrant. I may have had a search warrant issued years ago on my premises.
      </p>
      <p>
       If police later have reason to suspect im doing something illegal on my premises they go to the judge and present their evidence. They are not allowed to go before judge and make u p stories cause I have had a warrant issued before.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Page was under surveillance prior to memo saying he was, and whole thing was a renew on previous fisa, the reasons for renewal suck. A dossier that amounts to a news story found in a tabloid, and a meeting drunken meeting with a corrupt, war mongering Aussie diplomat.

       Page wasn't under surveillance in 2013. That was just when he was warned that the gnu had Intel Russians were trying to recruit him. Surveillance began at the time specified in the memo and could not be renewed unless they found something shady while they were watching.

       As for Page not being under a FISA in 2013 tell it to the people who claim it. Spent a day trying  to find out where they got that info and copped a migraine.

      <p>
       First CIA picks our leaders. Has been since Whitlam was fired. Downer was opposition leader. Bloke got his seat in parliament cause his father was the member of that seat. As foreign minister was a big pusher of Iraq WMDs and the invasion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Downer is an example of how Aussie pollies make it by crawling to those above them, supporting their masters causes, and then sticking the knife in when their masters faulter,
      </p>
      <p>
       Reason why Aussie politicians crawl and are at the moment more  pro-Syria and pro-neocon &amp; premptive war then their masters. They'll remain this way till America faulter and they plunge the knife into you guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       That or whoever replaces America as the world powwer invades Australia using Bush logic that our dumb leaders have made legit in their crawling to America

       What I got from your post is the memo is 100% factual and Devin Nunes (Noony Tunes) who was on Trumps transition team, who also pulled a bogus stunt last January, is to be believed THIS time. Despite Trumps pick for FBI director and his own DOJ have said the memo is lying by omission and inaccurate... Not to mention Trey Gowdy even said this memo does not imply anything against the Mueller investigation and it should carry on. If I'm wrong please explain it to me

       It’s about the lie told by Adam Schiff that Nunes hasn’t read the underlying documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only the majority and minority leaders
       <strong>
        or their designees
       </strong>
       are allowed to view the classified documents.
      </p>

       Schiff knows the deal and he’s being a partisan smear hack when he goes on television and makes the statement that Nunes hasn’t read the underlying documents.

       I can’t wait to see their response “memo”. I guarantee you it will be ripped apart and exposed for what it truly is.

       Propaganda.

       Sooner or later we’re going to get the FISA application itself and I’m pretty confident that it will confirm everything in the Nunes memo.

       Because he knows that Gowdy, acting as the majority designee, read the underlying documents as he has a decade of experience as a Federal Prosecutor. Nunes compiled the memo, Gowdy provided the legal expertise required to vet the FISA court documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schiff is being a disingenuous shitbag by repeating that obvious, provably false lie.

       It's like there's a sheath preventing you from saying that Nunes didn't read the underlying docs...although that shouldn't change the validity of the memo as Schiff wants to imply, it seems to be the truth here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody is denying that Gowdy read them, staffers read them, and that staffers wrote the thing. Nunes seems to have just signed his name to it. But for some reason, you can't admit that Nunes himself didn't read the source material.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does "compiled the memo" mean? It sounds like a slippery way of admitting that not only did he not read the source material, he also didn't write the memo summarizing what was discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can admit that Nunes didn't read the source material
       <em>
        but
       </em>
       that doesn't discredit the allegations made in the memo itself, as Schiff wants us to think.
