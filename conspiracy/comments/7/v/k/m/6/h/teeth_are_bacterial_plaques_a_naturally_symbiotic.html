       Just a thought I've had for a few years. Obviously if you can avoid having any bacteria living on your teeth or in your mouth you will maintain those pearly whites, and if plaque mineralization gets out of hand it will put pressure on your gums resulting in gingivitis.
      </p>
      <p>
       But does some of that bacterial "bio-film" actually act in a somewhat symbiotic relationship within their habitat (your mouth) like they do on your skin or in your gut?
      </p>
      <p>
       We've all heard studies about how proper gut flora aids digestion of essential nutrients, and even helps to create
       <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/news/microbes-help-produce-serotonin-gut-46495">
        serotonin.
       </a>
       We've heard about how antibiotics kill that flora/fauna and result in
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3605651/Asking-doctor-antibiotics-prescription-just-ONE-course-raises-risk-depression.html">
        depression.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And as dermatologists
       <a href="https://www.comfortzone.it/en/mag-news/skin/good-bacteria-protect-our-skin/">
        know,
       </a>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora">
        skin flora
       </a>
       is an important barrier to infection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that by completely eradicating natural mouth flora, with constant rinsing ( listerine/scope ) and constant brushing with fluoride based toothpastes that result in
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/fluoride-recommendations-buck-decades-dental-health-practices/story?id=12564884">
        brittle teeth,
       </a>
       and flossing into the gum bed.. might this all just be hurting us?
      </p>
      <p>
       Brush your gums gently and scrape away those that would impinge against them.

       I have been thinking about this very topic quite a bit myself.

      <p>
       Thank you for raising the issue here in this manner.

       ?

       We are being deceived on a grand scale. Too grand for most to ever understand.

       Yeah it's just simplifying averages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Infant mortality rates were super high until we figured out how to save babies from dying at birth or shortly (possibly a couple years) afterwards and save old people from dying earlier than we wanted.
      </p>
      <p>
       People 1000 years ago were able to live into their 60's, 70's, and 80's if they had a way to support themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Life expectancy today is just whatever people care about and science and economies will support supporting.

       If I did not believe the laws of logic, I wouldn't be a science advocate now would I?

       Empiricism as a philosophy is fundamentally flawed, but that can be amended rather easily by accepting empiric evidence only within a rationalist framework. Of course, one could say that the entirety of science is faked, but the task of developing a theory that explains every-day occurences remarkably well while simultaneously introducing untrue premises to further some nefarious goal is much,
       <em>
        much
       </em>
       more daunting than you might imagine.

       Perhaps that's to blame on the fact that you Americans are supposed to cough up your medical bills yourselves, instead having them be paid by the state like in a proper nation. The goal of competition is to maximise profit,, so privatised health care will lead to the highest acceptable prices for the lowest acceptable quality of service. Does that remind you of anything?

       It's a bit silly to blame faulty economic policy on medicine itself.

       Not if you do it properly. Get the floss picks and don't use string floss. Everything new in dental care, use. Otherwise, you're doing damage.

       Love sting floss. Much better than picks. With a string I can get a new part of the string for each tooth. With picks your just moving the dirt from crevice to crevice. I use the picks in my car though.

       Between each tooth? I'm am supposed to wash it 32 times? That's a bit a pain, yes. Once you know how to use string properly (most people don't) it's so easy. Takes me about 2 mins to get each side of each tooth down below the the gum. My gums are much healthier now.

       Honestly, I had to add A LOT of peppermint oil drops because the baking soda is so salty. The drops don't take the saltiness completely away either. So my homemade toothpaste is an odd combination of salty/peppermint.

       After I used it the first time, I made my husband kiss me and tell me what he thought. He said, "You taste salty, but your breath smells minty." LOL!

       I know what you meant. It's okay. Still, I am going to buy a good "fluoride free" holistic toothpaste because I don't really like the baking soda taste. Even though I added peppermint oil drops, it doesn't take away the saltiness of the baking soda entirely.

       Interesting train of thought! Also, diet -- we're supposed to be eating mostly fruit. I don't think tooth decay is much of a problem for chimps.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you may say, their teeth are all brown and ugly! Well if everybody's teeth were off-white, it wouldn't be a big deal. So culture, not health, determines that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Side thing: Does anybody else think the whole super-white teeth thing is a bit over the top?

       I mean, technically, but let's look at the connotative version of animal. Typically used in the context of lack of sentience. We posses sentience can can overcome the evolution our bodies went through to address other mental needs animals don't have. People won't be happy living off mainly fruit

       Sentience does not magically change your digestive system. A horse that became sentient couldn't live off hamburgers

       I'm not saying live off of hamburgers. Stop being difficult. I'm stating the fact that there are more specific needs than a diet of mostly fruit. Also, dude... It's not about the digestive system. Are you aware of how strong our stomach acid is? Its about proper nutrients. Evolutionary survival ≠ a balanced diet. Thus, we are not animals scourging for food. We have choices. We have developed food. Hell, we even have vitamins. You assuming we need fruit because that's how we evolved is asinine. You also got that whole situation backwards, but I'll address that later
      </p>
      <p>
       Sentience has nothing directly to do with it, it's just a major aspect you're ignoring. Then honing in on as if sentience = lust for objectively unhealthy food.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when you mentioned "developing cones to see fruit" you had it completely backwards. Our body doesn't change based on what we need, its just that those with less developed cones died off at a higher rate than those with more developed ones. So, its a byproduct of evolution. Our eyes didn't change to see fruit, the ones who couldn't find sustenance just died and took their bad genes with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand you think you're correct, but I've just clearly explained why you aren't. Do you require further elaboration or can you see where your logic was flawed?

       I eat mostly fruit, have for nearly 2 years, perhaps you missed that? I'm speaking from real life experience. My overall health is excellent. My immune system, in particular, is fantastic. At this rate, I'll never touch another pharmaceutical for the rest of my life. (And there's the problem, eh?)

       We're still animals. Our digestive systems didn't magically change once we developed written text. And our body's cells run on simple sugar. It's what we were designed for. It's why we have color vision (to spot ripe fruits) and sweet tastes good (indicates the fruit is fully "charged").

       Yep. Our cells run on simple sugars. Eating fruit instead of, say, bread and meat saves a whole lot of work and toxic byproducts.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah unless you're a professional athlete I'm probably in better shape than you, no offense -- 6'4", 190lbs, 10%bf, 47yo. I mean who cares, but my fruit diet is a big part of it. I don't lift, just BJJ once or twice a week and pushups in the morning when I feel like it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Protein is well overblown; we can get plenty from dark leafy greens -- just eat a salad every few days. Gorillas eat mostly fruit and they're jacked. Myself, I supplement my fruit with eggs and fish once a week or so. Too much protein is very hard on the kidneys.

       Regarding brain growth, you're doing the "correlation = causation" thing. Brains developed because people lived in the wrong, non-tropical environment and they had to adapt their surroundings just to survive -- learn how to hunt, keep warm, build strong shelters, etc. None of that is necessary in the tropics. You can just chill here.

       Fruit was only ever a small part of any primitive diet, as most fruit bearing plants only bore fruit seasonally.  Also, wild fruit is much lower in sugars -- modern grocery store fruit has been selectively bred for very high fructose levels so its sweetness is on par with candy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, from a macronutrient perspective you can't survive on fruit.  You need fats and protein more.

       Humans are a tropical species -- look at our body hair, we could not survive outside of that Garden of Eden. Fruit bears year-round in the tropics, where I now live -- different fruits for different times of the year. Keeps me from getting bored from the same thing all the time. And thanks to modern distribution, we've more or less flattened that out nowadays.

       Granted supermarket fruit is less than perfect, but consider your alternatives: chemical-laden kibble, hormone/antibiotic injected animal flesh... Fruit is still the best food you're gonna get at a supermarket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ideally, you're growing your own fruit, but we do the best we can in our circumstances.

       Hah, you ever tried it? I have. I lost weight, but I was very sedentary at the time. I still eat
       <em>
        mostly

       fruit, but since I'm a bit (not even a lot. just BJJ once/week) more active I've put on a lot of muscle weight -- 6'4", 190lbs, 10%bf, 47yo if you care.

       There are many people who have been fruitarian for decades. Not to mention other primates, with nearly identical digestive systems to humans. You better get down to Costa Rica and tell all the monkeys they can't survive on fruit

       I had problems with gingivitis and my dentist told me to use a CPC-based mouthwash twice a day.  It's basically an oral debriding agent and it has worked miracles -- no gum problems or cavities since I started using it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've known some people who were over-vigorous flossers and brushers who ended up needing gum surgery because they damaged their gums.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do remember stories of a vaccine being developed to immunize people against major plaque-causing microbes.  I don't know where that went, but it's easy to see that dentists might oppose that if it cuts out some large percentage of their business.

       Only tangentially related, one thing I've noticed is that the furry biofilm stuff you get on your teeth if you don't brush only really forms after eating certain foods. Typically this is any grain like rice, wheat, oats, etc. or dairy. Vegetables have no such effect, but oddly fruits really don't do it either despite the sugar content. Honey also doesn't result in much of it, despite being pure sugar. Maybe nature is hinting at an ideal diet here, if we are so inclined to pay attention. Coincidentally this is basically what closely related primates eat, primarily veggies and fruit.

       It's well known that glycerin in Toothpaste keeps your teeth from remineralizing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of brushing my teeth 2 times a day (mostly natural Toothpaste) after getting a cavity , I decided to brush with regular commercial toothpaste every single time after I ate or drank anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within about six months I had about four or five holes starting to appear in different teeth. They literally started to hole what felt like over night.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would not be at all surprised if they put something in Toothpaste to cause cavities or ruin your teeth.
