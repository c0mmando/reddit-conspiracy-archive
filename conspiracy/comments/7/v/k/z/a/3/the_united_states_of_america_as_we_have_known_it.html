        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It&#39;s finished. It has collapsed.</p>

<p>You have a two party federal war happening as we speak. The executive branch is being held hostage and there are traitors on each side.</p>

<p>The entire state mechanism from the very top is rotten to the very core. It has all been exposed. Americans are completely polarized. This cannot continue. This cannot continue. The dam is cracking, and when it goes, the great state will fall because it is all interconnected.</p>

<p>Trust not one thing. Trust nothing in Washington. Trust nothing you see on TV. This cannot continue.</p>

<p>This system is broken and shattered. There is no future in such a state. There is no making anything great again in such a state.</p>

<p>There would only be one way to enact a true &quot;reset&quot; and it&#39;s the one thing no one wants to talk about. But we have come to the point as a society of complete impasse. It is a zero sum deadlock.</p>

<p>A house divided against itself cannot stand. We have never had a situation quite like it in the USA where conspiracy theory has truly been proven to be conspiracy fact.</p>

<p>We are in the throws of a slow coup even at this hour. And the 4th branch of government, the news media, is up to their necks in complicity.</p>

<p>You cannot remain long in such a state. One side has to go. Do you understand what I mean? I mean that one, or both sides have to go en toto. That has far reaching implications to what any kind of future may look like. This deep state mechanism, along with the complicit state actors, private sector actors, and voting bloc has to go. They have to go! There is no other option. You cannot maintain a party that is bent on overthrowing the very constitution under which it functions.</p>

<p>Does this look like representative government to you when your elected officials are being held hostage in federal houses of state? Does that not look very close to a coup d&#39;etat leading to a real and actual totalitarian police state?</p>

<p>If the US ever becomes a police state truly, it will be the worst one that has ever been because it has a vastly more far reaching state mechanism than any other ever has. It won&#39;t be bad, it will be horrific. A veritable hell on Earth in invisible chains and fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That shit&#39;s been over since 9/11/01 - and honestly, it&#39;s a good thing it&#39;s over.  The US has been a pretty heinous, country-destroying place for a long, long time.  To be sure, almost all other countries have been as well, but this one&#39;s been the worst since it&#39;s been the strongest for a while now.</p>

<p>Good bye and fucking good riddance.  Not saying that the next world super power will be any better, but Western global domination has way overstayed its global welcome as far as I&#39;m concerned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you familiar with the differences between <em>styles</em> of domination?</p>

<p>I.e. The beligians were very different overlords than the Germans than were the French than are the Chinese. </p>

<p>Look at how Africa is being managed and I think you&#39;ll have to re-estimate your outlook. </p>

<p>The fall of &quot;western&quot; hegemony will undo us all, non westerners included. Without anyone to sell their crap too, Chinese have nothing. And seriously - look at the way they manage Africa compared to European colonialism. </p>

<p>They won&#39;t leave schools hospitals or any type of development behind and they sure as hell don&#39;t care about &quot;inclusive diversity&quot; standards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nihilism is a stepping stone everyone must cross. Try to be positive. Things aren&#39;t collapsing and the world isn&#39;t ending. This is for the most part all by design. The only thing collapsing is your mind so I will ask you again to try to be positive. The world had seen much worse and for most people today is just business as usual in their day to day rat race we call life. Be grateful that you have free access to food, shelter, and the laundry list of luxuries that most poodle today take for granted. We are living in a golden age but you are being told the opposite and to be afraid because everything is going to shit.  Try to be positive. Take a step back and look at the world from a new angle and rejoice in what you do have in your world today.</p>
