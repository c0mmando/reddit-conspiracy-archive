        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>First thing to be noted. The fact that r/politics and r/conspiracy 
 have essentially became the opposite side to the same coin is unfortunate. r/conspiracy is no longer about conspiracy theories, it is now political conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>While there isn&#39;t anything wrong with posts in the political realm, the comments and users in this sub do not belong here. </p>

<p>We have so many people from t_d and politics because their echo chambers have gotten too redundant, or rather they don&#39;t get paid to post on their home turf. The fact is that people are here not for rational discourse or thought provoking conversation.</p>

<p>I must admit I am guilty of it as well. I feel we all are. This is the worst case scenario. </p>

<p>Conspiracies should not be things that can be won in black and white. Winning in this sub is causing someone to think critically.</p>

<p>There is no critical thought on this sub anymore. It is I&#39;m right, and you are wrong. No matter the side you are on. </p>

<p>To my title, as of now, in order to see organic thought provoking conversation, you have to sort all comments by controversial. To see quality non brigaded threads you have to sort by new. </p>

<p>This is the exact path politics went down when it was fully coopted. </p>

<p>For this reason, I suggest that every thread automatically be put into contest mode. I know we can&#39;t do anything regarding posts, but to continue to browse by new. </p>

<p>This is my last hope for remaining a member of this board. </p>

<p>You can disagree, but I know for a fact that its true. I saw the exact same thing happen in r/politics.

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://www.fec.gov/updates/foreign-nationals/">FEC regulations regarding foreign nationals and their participation in elections.</a></p>

<p>&quot;Commission regulations prohibit foreign nationals from directing, dictating, controlling, or directly or indirectly participating in the decision-making process of any person (such as a corporation, labor organization, political committee, or political organization) with regard to any election-related activities&quot;</p>

<p>I find that bit very interesting since we have people who work for political campaigns around the globe.  We have them, so do other countries like Russia.  And our candidates have been employing these foreign nationals during their campaigns.</p>

<p>Also, nearly everything listed on that link has either been broken or has a work around.  </p>

<p>Foreign anything should not be allowed to work for our candidates.  As long as we allow that, the door will always be open for influence.  </p>

<p>Just the fact that nations have people who work on campaigns in foreign lands is a form of globalism or the NWO, if you will.  We would be wise to do something about it before they perfect their methods and this practice grows.  But who am I kidding?  That has not and will never happen.  Global control of money is as bipartisan as it gets</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gowdy was the only one that saw the source intelligence, that the Nunes Memo is based on. Nunes wrote the memo based on Gowdy&#39;s notes.</p>

<p>Gowdy Quotes: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is a Russia investigation without a dossier&quot; </p>

<p>&quot; To the extent the memo deals with the dossier and the FISA process, the dossier has nothing to do with the meeting at Trump Tower, the dossier has nothing to do with an email sent by Cambridge Analytica. The dossier really has nothing to do with George Papadopoulos&#39; meeting in Great Britain. It also doesn&#39;t have anything to do with obstruction of justice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I actually don’t think it has any impact on the Russia probe&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;As I have said repeatedly, I also remain 100 percent confident in Special Counsel Robert Mueller. The contents of this memo do not - in any way - discredit his investigation.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I agree with all that. The Dossier is largely unrelated to the Russia probe. Of course, we have no idea what evidence, if any, they are using in the Russia Probe. If they were using the Dossier, then the probe would lose any credibility it still has.</p>

<p>There is one thing I do disagree with him on, there. That is that Rosenstein, the acting AG who decided to appoint a Special Counsel when Sessions stepped aside (very shady imo), was one of those who signed off on an effectively fraudulent FISA renewal. To me, this indicates pretty massive bias that most likely contributed into his appointing a Special Counsel. So, in that way, I do think the FISA scandal could/should have an impact on the Russia probe.</p>

<p>They used a Yahoo article to prove that the information was now public and was being corroborated, but didn&#39;t disclose that the source of the article was also Steele, so it corroborated nothing and by all appearances was simply a ploy to get the renewal.</p>

<p>If it wasn&#39;t unverfied at the time, then the FISA warrant would be used to verify it.

<p>Supposedly Carter Page was picked up when surveilling other Russian nationals. This isn&#39;t surprising or incriminating, since lots of people interact with Russian nationals. Its important to note that Page hasn&#39;t been charged or accused of any crime.</p>

<p>Except they weren&#39;t just Russian nationals. They were Russian spy agents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5) <strong>Why did US law enforcement officials start looking into Carter Page’s ties to Russia?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well, it depends which time you’re referring to.</p>

<p>In fact, the FBI interviewed Page because of his contacts with a Russian intelligence operative all the way back in 2013.</p>

<p>The bureau was looking into a suspected Russian spy ring and learned that one of their suspects, Victor Podobnyy, had met with Page in hopes of finding a potential recruit. In fact, Podobnyy was caught on a wiretap discussing Page:</p>

<p>He writes to me in Russian [to] practice the language. He flies to Moscow more often than I do. He got hooked on Gazprom thinking that if they have a project, he could be rise up. Maybe he can. I don’t know, but it’s obvious that he wants to learn lots of money. ...</p>

<p>... I will feed him empty promises. ... You promise a favor for a favor. You get the documents from him and tell him to go fuck himself.</p>

<p>Podobnyy said one more thing about Page on the tap. “I think,” he said, “he is an idiot.”</p>

<p>Page did end up giving some energy business documents to Podobnyy, and the FBI interviewed him about it in June 2013. But they decided Page didn’t know Podobnyy was a spy, and didn’t charge him with anything.</p>

<p>For FISA applications, you need probable cause. Apparently, their first application for Page was rejected (very rare). So they had the Dossier created, and then went back and used that.</p>

<p>But, there are a few users who just spam political submissions attacking the left constantly every day</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If the &quot;left&quot; didn&#39;t want to be mentioned so much on conspiracy forums maybe they shouldn&#39;t have committed so many conspiracies. Rigging the primary election, uranium on, pedo stuff, NWO agenda, FISA, Clinton foundation pay to play....and the list goes on. </p>

<p>If Clinton foundation is pay to play why hasn&#39;t the current majority Republican government nailed both Clintons to the cross and burnt them in some great conservative orgy?</p>

Seems anything on these threads there can be deemed &#39;political&#39; because guess what? The government runs and controls things in a country because that&#39;s what a government does and so there will be things connected to politics or government. That&#39;s not what is being complained about.</p>

<p>Specifically people complained there were too many bi-partisan threads that leaned far-right or far-left. For example, lots of Hillary and Trump threads. I don&#39;t see that now.</p>

<p>How about Iran Contra Drugs to African Aermican neibhborhoods in the 80s, political? </p>
