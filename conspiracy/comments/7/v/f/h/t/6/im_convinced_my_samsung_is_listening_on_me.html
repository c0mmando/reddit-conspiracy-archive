       So, I've always read about the theories of our androids/smart gadgets spying and listening in on us, but I never encountered something that would convince me that it's definitely happening. Until yesterday. 
  I had just finished work and driving back home(with a friend in the car) and the radios played the song Scandalous, by Mystique. It was a big hit back in the early 2000s and I hadn't heard the song in YEARS. And I was surprised the radios played it and I talked about this with my friend, while in the car. 
  I get home and i sit on my laptop, reading about some stuff and I put on a random youtube song and just let youtube play. Then suddenly, I hear Scandalous playing from youtube. I have never watched the video/song on youtube and It was random songs being played, chosen by youtube. In all these years, youtube had never suggested the video, nor was it selected to be played when I just put a random song and let it play. I mean, this just cannot be a coincidence.

       thats an absurd statement to make. No not every internet connected device is listening to you. Many are, but it is extremely silly to think that my lightbulb with no MIC in it is somehow listening to me.

       even every connected "smart device" is not listening to you. It is likely just ignorance, not malicious intent to misinform, but on this sub, facts are pretty important.

       Not sure if you are being pedantic or if you think privacy concerns around smart devices are unfounded.  If it is a smart device it may not be "listening" directly but it is definitely compiling data on everything you do with it.

       Absolutely. It’s ridiculous to think devices without input mechanism can take anything in, but whatever device can generate any data out of you, is listening. For example, devices with a mic or camera can hear and see you, smart TVs without mic or camera can gather data from your viewing habits, cars connected to GPS or emergency services can gather data on your whereabouts, etc.

       sure, but there are also things as mundane as lightbulbs and light switches, coffee makers, etc. They perform automated tasks without being "spying devices". I know this a community of skeptics, and thats exactly what it should be, but not all of these devices are designed to spy or listen in on their users.

       Nothing has to be designed to spy on anyone.  If it has sensors for inputs from the environment it could easily also have back-door access to those sensors.  Anything that has the capability can be used to spy on you.  Does that mean it is necessarily? No.  But the only way to be sure is to either not use these devices or disable the hardware physically.

       The perfect example is those motion sensors that inadvertently exposed covert or unknown military and intelligence sites. Even when anonymous, the data can have huge implications. “Hey, look how cool all these people around the world using our stuff!!!!

       that is a blanket statement that you have no proof of, other than speculation by others. Dont get me wrong, it could be accurate, but you have no way of known it is true that every single device that is connected to a cloud service is harvesting your information and selling it to advertisers. Do you think it means much to an advertiser how many times a light bulb is turned on and off, that corresponds to an email address that may tell them nothing about the user and have no idea who it actually is?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alexa, Google Home, Siri, etc. Sure they are taking in all sorts of inputs (audio, text searches, viewing habits, etc), but random devices like connected light bulbs or light switches, simple appliances etc. they are not all just selling data on you. And if they are, unlelss you work for those companies, you are full of shit if you claim to know definitively that they are doing so.

       I suggest that it's pretty naive to think that makers of internet connected devices don't collect data from their systems and at least use that data to sell more products to their customers.  They'd be incredibly foolish not to do that, and The evidence is overwhelming that it's happening.

       This is arguable.

       Mics can be made smaller than you can easily notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure this is a bit out there, but not impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with so many computers, TV's and cell phones out there, I don't see why anyone would bother.

       Not just listening.  Even if there's no mic, your data is being sent to the owners.  Nest was a wifi enable home thermostat company with $80M in sales when Google paid $3200M for them.  40 times
       <strong>
        gross revenue!!
       </strong>
       .  Companies are valued at multiples of earnings, not gross sales.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now Google has millions of devices around the world that can tell them when you're home, where you are in the house, and even how many people are there.

       I posted the other day that my native language is Spanish, but I don’t speak Spanish with any friends, coworkers, etc and I don’t watch any shows or videos in Spanish. The only Spanish I handle these days are “WhatsApp” messages with my mother. Now YouTube keeps bombarding me with Spanish spoken or targeted ads.

       You live in Texas? Because I started getting Spanish lawyer ads on YouTube, and I have not done anything that would indicate I understand Spanish. Might just be regional targeting.

       That said, I do believe that Comcast is selling/targeting me via my browsing history. Recently started looking at houses on the market, and suddenly we are getting mortgage/realtor ads on Cartoon Network...

       Facebook is the same, but they read your texts via "messenger". I have messenger installed, but it is not used for SMS. Regardless, a friend texted me asking if I wanted to go to a concert. The band was some obscure band I've never heard of, never thought of, never googled. I said I was busy and moved on.
      </p>

       Then a day later, I get targeted Facebook ads for that band.

       Playing the devil's advocate; plenty of other people in your general area also heard the song and when they came home they looked it up on YouTube, thus creating a bit of a localized trend. Auto-play gets told by it's algorithm to play it for you as well, it's the sensible thing to do after all.

       This song was an old song not some FRESH/NEW jewish propoganda music so it would be very rare to have been a coincidence as it most of the times isn't. The original poster said "It was a big hit back in the early 2000s and I hadn't heard the song in YEARS" but remember 2000s, not 2014s+ and based of how many times phones and computers are actually spying and listening to us, I doubt it was a coincidence!

       How did you see proof of it on phones that were in your hands for a few hours tops, and that you werent digging through and violating user privacy? I'm not saying this doesnt exist, it definitely does, but id love for you to clarify that point.

       They have devices in grocery stores as well. Went pass this isle of food. Next thing I know i get bombarded with x item on my ads. They can prob. read you contacts list as well. Why does my car need to know my contact list and messages? I get a few updates SMS about getting eye subscription... Two weeks later every other ad on YT is about the online website, GlassesUSA. Same thing happened to this game I'm playing. I used to have random ads. After researching cyrpto last few months. Now every ad in the game I'm playing is an crypto ad. They are listening!

       I had a Samsung galaxy. One day I went looking through audio files and there were probably close to 100 files recorded and stored in my phone that I did not create. There were some that were minutes long, others that were 10s. It was startling but think about all the apps you download and permissions that you are granting them legal rights to in fine print.

       Don't forget to cover your cameras.

       I use a shitty old laptop that definitely has spyware, and I've caught it on countless occasions opening my camera program for a split second, usually if I have an image file open. If I were on a faster computer, I might have never noticed.

       Has anyone tried to instrument the software on their phones to prove this?
I don't think doing so would be very hard, try setting a breakpoint on API calls involving the mic. You can use this:
       <a href="https://www.frida.re/">
        https://www.frida.re/
       </a>
       for android or iOS.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, the code runs on your phone. It is in your sphere of influence, so feel empowered to go and research it!

       Definitely a thing (I work in a company that does information security)
The other day my wife was complaining about our vacuum and said she really wanted a Dyson (I hate those vacuums, btw) and we discussed it verbally in the presence of my Pixel 2 XL and Google Home. 30 minutes later I was taking a break from cleaning and opened Facebook (don't use the mobile app, use the mobile  browser version) and sure as shit there was an ad for a Dyson waiting for me. Ive grown to accept that anything we do in this virtual world is watching and learned from.
