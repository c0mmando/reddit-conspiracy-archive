       <p>
        Khalid Abdullah Tariq al-Mansour is a Muslim lawyer and a black nationalist who made news in 2008 when it was revealed that he had been a patron of Barack Obama and had recommended the latter for admission to Harvard Law School in 1988.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the mid-1970s al-Mansour met Saudi Prince Alwaleed bin Tatal ......Al-Mansour's relationship with the prince eventually led to al-Mansour's hiring as attorney to King Saud. He has since been an adviser to Saudi billionaires who fund the spread of Wahhabi extremism in America.

        Sutton described al-Mansour as ‚Äúthe principal adviser to one of the world‚Äôs richest men,‚Äù Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal. This was the same bin-Talal whose $10 million offer to help New York rebuild after 9/11 Mayor Rudy Giuliani rebuffed. In September 2001, Giuliani was in no mood to hear out ‚ÄúIsrael knew‚Äù theories even from a benefactor.
       </p>

        What the New York Times is not reporting is that this is the same Alwaleed bin Talal who helped Barack Obama get into Harvard Law School.

       I've been here for close to 2 years I guess.

      <p>
       And yea a majority of the shit you just listed are actual basically verifiable conspiracies. Those ones are the good ones.
But this sub hasn't been about that stuff in a bunch of months now. Sad.
The rest of reddit mocks and makes fun of this place now, when at one time it was a goto for sought after answers to taboo questions. I digress.

      <p>
       If I see blatent disinformation or pushing of a narrative that's just absurd, I'll step in and say something. I don't much anymore, cause I'm a lone fella at times arguing with a foreign backed intel agency. So I pick and choose my battles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to see some posts about the topics you newly mentioned. Reminds me of what this place was like a year or so ago.

       I'd rather keep it that way. We were always tinfoil nutrers to be laughed at, until all sorts of conspiracies were being proven true in the last 2 years. This is why a lot of T_D folks came here, they saw the media biased to the left, lying polls, Seth Rich Murder, leaked emails, Spirit cooking, Soros funding to Hillary, and all sorts of shit we have known/discussed here for a years before that, and for decades for some of the older folks here

       There are narratives from both sides. I was debating with a Democrat yesterday on this sub, which has been going on for 2-3 days, and he just refuses to look at any of my sources, flat out, 100% refuses because of his mental narrative, and has posted zero rebuttals/sources/links to win the debate.

       Its quite sad

       You need to watch these. Also Soros, Rothschilds, Brzezinski et al all were behind him as well as a super shady cabal of folks. This Historian breaks it down in 2008. Fascinating watch:

The company, according to documents on WikiLeaks, ‚Äúsubmitted to the Obama campaign a list of its preferred candidates for cabinet positions in an Obama administration [2008]. This list corresponds almost exactly to the eventual composition of Barack Obama‚Äôs cabinet.‚Äù Having had a direct hand in Obama‚Äôs college education and cabinet selection, Al-Waleed is far from uninvolved with American politics.

       You become Prez, Saudi Arabia owns you because they made the USD the oil reserve currency, and can either uphold this so everything remains as it is, or change the currency, which would collapse the UDS and American economy.

       Well if 4chan believes and supports this, it unequivocally must be true.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you take away the back alley websites, anon sources, and lack of concrete and credible information, then yea, small chance Obama was puppet. But I highly doubt it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know who is a puppet, who's backed and manipulated by a foreign power. But unlike you those claims come from reputable sources like professionals, intel agencies, news agencies, and that during course of the Russia investigation there has been 4 criminal charges laid. All mentioned is what is called tangible evidence. Which means its based on facts. Concrete facts. Your claim here, not so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       The game plan is to redirect? Redirect all day. At least it's not about hillary anymore. But the fact remains redirect or not it doesn't make the Russian investigation remove or redact criminal charges laid. And all this when the current government is Republican controlled. If there was a stich of it not being true, it would of been shut down long ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now Trey. Only republican to see the evidence stacked against trump, and he retires after seeing said evidence. How many Republicans are retiring? It would almost seem like a bunch of them don't wanna be apart of the current administration. I wonder why.
      </p>

       This OP is about Obama, if you have proof of Obama's russian connections, please post them here. For example if you want to post about Hillary and the Russian Uranium 1 deal, Bill Clinton's paid $500k speech in Moscow, and Clintons paying steele $160k for a British Spook to contact Russians for info which results in election meddeling, please post here as well. However this is about Obama, not the Clinton Russian Connections

       If you are posting media matters, share blus, snopes, politifact or CNN, then none of those will work. Any other sources, sure I will 100% give them a look and see if there is proof there. This is how you do a professional debate, using sources, links, rebuttals

       I'll make a effort to get to look through all this thoroughly and get back to you.

      <p>
       Saying that, the claims you make are basically a educated assumption on your part. I think I'd have a hard time finding a source that contradicts you. I won't find a source claiming Obama ever did zero wrong doing, or a article how he got in to university and the payment methods.
