And this is the general area where where it happened although roaming around I wasn&#39;t able to find the exact location as in the video: <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@41.6173267,-87.5397278,3a,60y,261.05h,70.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1dnKVfTQfm9EvcPAiIA8ag!2e0!7i13312!8i6656">https://www.google.com/maps/@41.6173267,-87.5397278,3a,60y,261.05h,70.4t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s1dnKVfTQfm9EvcPAiIA8ag!2e0!7i13312!8i6656</a></p>

<p>UPDATE: Here&#39;s a link to the US Gov&#39;t indictment against Bryan Protho: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/press-release/file/1028921/download">https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndil/press-release/file/1028921/download</a>
I still can&#39;t find his mugshot. </p>

<p>Regarding the kidnapping of that girl by Bryan Protho of Chicago:</p>

<p>There&#39;s a video that was all over the internet of an alleged kidnapping of a girl by Bryan Protho in Chicago. Here&#39;s one link: <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/crime/ct-sta-calumet-city-kidnapping-st-0128-20180126-story.html">http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/crime/ct-sta-calumet-city-kidnapping-st-0128-20180126-story.html</a> but there are many others with the same video.</p>

<p>I saw the video and it gave me a bit of fear and worry, and kinda made me want to keep my kids at home and safe. That&#39;s... just my honest subconscious takeaway from the video. I think a lot of people react that way whether they know it or not.</p>

<p>My wife saw the video and said, &quot;That isn&#39;t real. They put that video out to scare people into keeping their kids at home where they will consume more content. Videogames. TV. People at home are easier to program, easier to control, and there&#39;s no money being made when kids are outside playing when they should be at home consuming media.&quot;</p>

<p>I said, &quot;Ahh come on. Law enforcement is a real thing.&quot; So I did a search trying to find Bryan Protho&#39;s mugshot - and I got nothing.  I see thumbnails of random black people associated with the articles but when I click them - there&#39;s never a mugshot.</p>

<p>In every other case like this we always get mugshots of the accused. Why not with this one?</p>

<p>Ever notice kids don&#39;t play outside like we did when we were kids? I just assumed people didn&#39;t have kids anymore until power went out in my neighborhood and suddenly the streets were crawling with kids. Maybe there&#39;s something to my wife&#39;s crazy theory...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If there were more kids outside playing in groups, it would be harder to commit crimes like this.  Not sure if it&#39;s intentional though.  Could be a generational thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up in Calumet City and asked people who still live there about this.  Cal City was ( and to a degree still is) a small town, everyone used to know everything.  Out of the four people I talked to who live there three hadn&#39;t heard of this.  I have been gone for 25 years, so maybe things have changed, but this is the kind of town that if you shit yourself in kindergarten 40 years later someone you never met will come up to you and ask you if you are the dude who shit himself in kindergarten . </p>

<p>The three people I asked are smart, and on top of things.  Two of them have kids.  I know as a dad I constantly worry about this shit, so I notice it.  </p>

<p>I am not sure at all what is going on with this, I am curious.  I lived 6 blocks from here, this is the quiet part of town.  I am so disgusted with the Superb Owl this year I may take a ride and go see what I can see, it has been a long time anyway. </p>

<p>thanks for the interesting post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. It probably really happened - it just seems bizarre to me that there aren’t more followup stories which include mugshot photos. It’s a pretty basic thing.</p>

<p>Then I started thinking... is that even a real name?</p>

<p>My wife said it was odd that the camera framed the kidnapping perfectly but I thought it might be a crop of a larger video.</p>

<p>The kidnapping itself is bizarre... but it explains how and why she got away and was able to report it to the police.</p>

<p>Just... no mugshot.</p>

<p>Thanks for the info.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a mugshot, not a picture on the internet.  The reason I find this disturbing is that this guy lives nearby in East Chicago.  He has to cut thru Hammond to get to Cal  City.  </p>

<p>If I was law enforcement (and more important as a parent)  I want his photo in every paper so parents in the area can do a quick mind search to see if this asshole was around their kids.  In my mind he is a suspect now in every missing children case in Lake County Indiana and Southeast Cook County.  Where is his photo?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Remember the new &quot;Deep Fakes&quot;? Any image or video clip should be suspect now. It is too easy to fake now. We genuinely are in a time where we can&#39;t nor should we trust anything we see unless it&#39;s right in front of us.
