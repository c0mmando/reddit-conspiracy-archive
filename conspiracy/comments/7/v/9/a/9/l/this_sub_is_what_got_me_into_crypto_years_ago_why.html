A few years ago there would be the one-off post here about bitcoin taking power from the bankers. As a conspiracry theorist, I was all over that and figured others here would be too.</p>

<p>Why do the same people in this sub who distrust the government and the banks defend the current system when it comes to decentralized currencies (assets)? </p>

<p>I could argue the pros and cons of both systems until the cows come home, but I&#39;m more interested in the psychology of the users here who tend to think like me when it comes to economics, politics and social issues. </p>

<p>A lot of users here don&#39;t subscribe to the crypto fad when I would assume most here would have been early adopters. </p>

<p>I know it&#39;s gone up a lot in the past year, and most would be crazy to get in now with all the hype, but 1-2 years ago... why wasn&#39;t this sub all over it? It seems to be something that was designed for people like us.</p>

<p>Looking forward to a deep, honest discussion. Let&#39;s keep it civil if we can :) </p>

<p>You&#39;re right if you&#39;re talking about something like bitcoin (and a handful of other coins).</p>

<p>A lot of them now are completely centralized. Xrp, xlm, xvg, trx as far as I know can all increase their supply whenever they want. That&#39;s why investors need to do their DD as these coins go against the original major benefit of cryptocurrency as expressed in bitcoins whitepaper. </p>

<p>There is nothing special about a centralized crypto currency. If everyone moved to a system like xrp (Ripple) or xlm then we would all be beholden to a corporatized global federal reserve which would be much worse than our current system. That&#39;s my biggest fear.</p>

<p>Understanding of current banking system (this community should have this) </p>

<p>Understanding basic technology (iffy) </p>

<p>Understanding basics cryptography.(rarely unless they got into cicada 3301 which what got me interested in cryptography. So when I came across bitcoin I had all the tools necessary to understand how important this is.) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point, but I personally didn&#39;t know anything about cryptography. I understood the vision and importance of decentralized currency and figured if all of the programmers and cryptographers approved the tech, then there wasn&#39;t anything I could argue with.</p>

<p>I studied finance and understood how corrupt the current system is, which eventually lead me to this sub. I completely understood the economic importance of bitcoin without fully understand the tech behind it. For me that was enough to take a chance on it.</p>

<p>I do agree with you, but think that by understanding only part of it is enough to see why it could be important. I expected more people here to understand the financial/social aspect of it as that&#39;s the basis for a ton of conspiracy theories (tptb, big banks, 0.1% etc..)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, two things: </p>

<p>One, a lot of people are actually interested in crypto but don&#39;t understand how it works. They haven&#39;t taken the time to research and the research itself is very daunting because no one knows what to actually research. There are about a million videos on YouTube. Not everyone has studied Finance.</p>

<p>Two, can you please teach me about crypto? Seriously, I&#39;m smart enough to realize the system is fucked and I am tired of the one percenters taking everything while I am left in the dust but technology is not exactly my forte. I&#39;m good with words and sociology. Teach me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the basic idea (imo) is to cut out the middle man when it comes to storing and transacting wealth, and to have a financial system built on a decentralized free market rather than a debt based financial system controlled by governments, banks and federal reserves.</p>

<p>The basic problem with the financial system (besides centralized control which leads to corruption) is trust. To mitigate the trust issue, we have established financial institutions. We know if someone&#39;s debt card is approved at the point of purchase, then the money will be transacted. We trust that if we put $10,000 in a bank account, it will be there when we go to take it out. This concept of trust comes at a cost. The fees you pay to the banks the fees merchants pay on credit card transactions.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency is trustless in the sense that so long as you trust the bitcoin system as a whole, you will have the ability to spend, accept and store your currency without the need for a paid intermediary. You do pay a fee for verification with the transaction fee that goes to the miners - the verifying computers within the network. The difference is the miners are decentralized so not one entity has the power to control the system and there is no trust required between the miner and the user.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a bit of a rant, and I&#39;m sure tons of people have plenty of other (better) explanations, but that&#39;s the way I&#39;ve been looking at it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Correct answer. The big finance shills even make their way into crypto subs to promote BoA et. al policies towards crypto. </p>

<p>Any true, or long time proponent of the fundamentals in the conspiracy realm would salivate over the idea of a widely used, decentralized currency. Fiat is a trash system and this has been a major theme in the conspiracy world for a very long time.</p>

<p>I should also add of the 1100+ cryptos out there, a small portion aim to be used as currencies. If you look at supply chain based cryptos that aim to give clarity to the origins of your food or medicine - I have no idea why anyone would be against that. Conspiracy follower or not. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>ripple just in case</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the best argument for buying ripple I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>

<p>Anyhow, those are all really good points. I do find it suspicious that satoshi is anonymous, but at the same time, that&#39;s why bitcoin works so well. Also the plethora of bitcoin knock-off offers an alternative if bitcoin ever ends up being a govt. project. It would be a disaster for anyone with btc, but could easily push people to a more trusted coin.</p>

<p>I agree that tptb always wanted a one world currency but again, there are always alternatives if one gets too popular. Their ideal currency wouldn&#39;t be bitcoin, it would likely be something like ripple or a more obvious bank/govt issued coin. </p>

<p>Overall I like bitcoin the best, but the free market of alternative coins is a necessity to keep the concept of crypto safe. So long as there are other options like ltc, xmr, eth whatever, I don&#39;t see the possibility for an easy takeover by even the most powerful entities, as developers could simply make a new coin if shit hits the fan, just as bitcoin was created when our current system hit the fan. Every currency will need faith, if not utility, for it to have value. Crypto just proves that an everyday person can create their own currency, and if others trust that coin and have faith, then it can succeed. That&#39;s a powerful concept in itself and extremely liberating for humankind. It sounds dramatic, but everyone here knows that whoever owns the money has all of the power, and if we, as people, can own our money, we can take back that power.</p>

<p>Good question. I would hope enough miners are using solar. Since in that situation, most users wouldn&#39;t be using bitcoin, the remaining solar miners could hopefully carry the load temporarily. Phone batteries can be charged on solar as well for the users perspective. Also that situation would also be troublesome for our current system as more than half of transactions are using credit/debit cards and most people don&#39;t have much cash on hand. So no matter what transactions would be difficult on either system, but assuming the outrage isn&#39;t global, the crypto system would probably be a better option.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does it have the same appeal as cash or gold? (NOT credit/debit)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cash - btc can be used for transactions
Gold - non-inflationary safe store of value</p>

<p>It kind of has the best of both worlds imo.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is the inherent value if it’s not pegged to an existing currency?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Like our dollar, value is based on faith and usage. Our dollar has no intrinsic value since the gold standard. This is a tough question because some would argue the dollar is backed by the faith of the govt and potentially oil. I might have to think about this one a bit longer :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally I think btc is being bought up to create a barrier to entry for people without money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can you expand on this more? It&#39;s an interesting idea. Who is buying it up and why do they want poor people to be barred from it? Do <em>they</em> expect btc to go up and they&#39;re trying to avoid a wealth transfer?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>BTC isn&#39;t really convenient for transactions that aren&#39;t somewhat shady.  If I want to buy a gallon of milk in a deli, I doubt that I would/could use BTC for it.</p>

<p>An ounce of gold today will still be an ounce of gold tomorrow. This is absolutely objective.  Cash/btc/fiat all fluctuate wildly and like you said - rely on our good faith.  </p>

<p>Back when BTC was &lt;$5 and people were busy using it nearly exclusively to buy goodies on Silkroad or whichever onion site - BTC was still accessible to the general public and (almost) any Joe Schmoe who wanted a piece could get some.  </p>

<p>This also meant that Mr. Joe Schmoe could purchase any number of shady items and not have any real record of purchase other than the proof of transaction - just like cash.  Imagine giving regular folk those kind of possibilities. </p>

<p>Now it&#39;s made the jump to 4-5 figure prices.  It didn&#39;t do this solely on the drug market.  It would have taken big money in the form of big investments/data centers to make such a leap. It also means that it will be harder to buy untraceable items for people who don&#39;t have the necessary capital.</p>

<p>Once all ~21 million btc have been mined and the circulation is complete, I can only imagine what final value it will settle in at or where the USD might even be at that point relative to where it is today.</p>

<p>I could say - &quot;bitcoin is not and never will be controlled by TPTB and it will be worth $1mill by 2020.&quot;</p>

<p>I could say that, but I won&#39;t because I don&#39;t know anything for certain. I&#39;d challenge you to back that up with fact and sources. I&#39;ll play along, but need something more than pure speculation to build a valid defense..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For one it&#39;s Biblical prophesy being fulfilled.  I&#39;ll a response I made on a similar thread:</p>

<p>It&#39;s going to be the &quot;one world currency&quot; everyone was afraid of when it was being peddled as physical thing like the Amero. Since crytopcurrencies are on the &quot;light side&quot; of the dialectic it is going to be accepted as the rebel when it is actually what was intended all along.</p>

<p>This then fits in with the Mark of the Best:</p>

<p>Rev 13:16 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: Rev 13:17 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</p>

<p>Combine this with the move toward chips and you have the precursor to the Mark. Our credit cards used to be strips that were swiped, now they use chips. Soon they will move sub-dermal:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTBJ6OIGkzc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTBJ6OIGkzc</a></p>

<p>A key point here is that the King James Bible is the only one that uses the word &quot;in&quot; the hand or forehead instead of &quot;on.&quot; It was right all along even though it made no sense to people 400 years ago.</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;

<p>God (via the Word of God made flesh as his only begotten son Jesus Christ) did all the work for you.  He took the punishment that we all deserved.

<p>Joh_14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</p>
