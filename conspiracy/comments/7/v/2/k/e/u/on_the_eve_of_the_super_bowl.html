        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those who may not be aware but this Sunday will be the Super Bowl, played between the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots. This will be the 8th Super Bowl appearance for the Patriots, which has been the most successful NFL franchise int the past 20 years. </p>

<p>Reading &quot;The Fix is In&quot; by Brian Touhy (2010), I found an interesting tidbit about Robert Kraft, the owner and the architect for the Patriot juggernaut. </p>

<p>Pages 294-296</p>

<p>&quot;It all rests on the shoulders of Patriots owner Robert Kraft. Since buying the Patriots in the 1994, Kraft has muscled his way into becoming the most influential owner in the NFL. He was the chairman of the NFL&#39;s finance committee, and sat on the league&#39;s audit, investment, broadcasting, business ventures, and expansion committee, as well as the special committee on league economics, and the Los Angeles Stadium working group. What&#39;s more, Kraft was very involved in securing the NFL&#39;s prized contracts with major television networks which gives the NFL the bulk of its money every season. Kraft also brokered a deal in 2001 with his friend Paul Fireman valued at some $250 million for Fireman&#39;s company Reebok to provide uniforms to every team for the NFL for the next 10 years.</p>

<p>Kraft was also instrumental in bringing the Texans to Houston as an expansion team, basically telling Texas owner Bob McNair that his investment in the NFL wouldn&#39;t just give him the team, but would guarantee the rights to the Super Bowl in 2004. Kraft was correct in making that promise. As fate would have it, Kraft&#39;s Patriots won the same Super Bowl played in Houston. </p>

<p>Does such standing with the league mean Kraft&#39;s team gets some preferred treatment? It&#39;s known that Kraft, thanks to his role on the league&#39;s finance committee, authorized a league program that allowed teams in the NFL&#39;s six largest media markets $150 million each in low interest loans to build new stadiums (every other team was allowed up to $100 million). Unsurprisingly, Kraft&#39;s own Patriots were one of those six elite teams to which the $150 million was available. He immediately seized the opportunity for the loan, and then leveraged another $70 million out of Massachusetts&#39; infrastructure (under the threat of moving the team to Connecticut where he already had a deal in place, but later rebuked) to build his Patriots a $325 million stadium to which he already owned the valuable parking lots. From the loans came the dynasty.</p>

<p>In 1998, the New England Patriots were valued at $252 million by Forbes Magazine. Ten years later, the same source claims that the Patriots are worth $1.2 billion. Meanwhile, Kraft’s work for the NFL reaches around the world. Kraft met and gave Russian president Vladimir Putin one of his Super Bowl Rings (or Putin simply took it in a misunderstanding, depending on which version of the story is read). He took the Vince Lombardi trophy from the Patriot’s third Super Bowl victory with him to Israel for a meeting with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. It was there in Israel where Kraft has spent’ some $500,000 to dedicate the Kraft Family Stadium—the only stadium in Israel dedicated to American Football. Kraft also helped build what’s known as “American Football in Israel”, a flag football with some 900 active players.</p>

<p>All of this stems from a man who hasn’t been in an owner in the league for more than 15 years. Was the Patriot’s success just a coincidence and a prime example of parity at work? Was Kraft simply a great owner, who realized from the start what it takes to run a successful NFL franchise and create a winning formula? Was he just lucky to fall into players in the draft like Tom Brady or pick up forgotten veterans like Corey Dillion, Junior Seau, and Randy Moss while casting off such stars as Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy at the right times? Did Kraft’s hard work behind the scenes with the NFL earn his teams its on-the-field success? The more Kraft immersed himself within the ranks of other NFL owners, the more the Patriots succeeded as a team. That cannot be questioned. What can be is how such success was possible.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The NFL is fake as fuck. Rigged as fuck and a waste of time to watch. Do not give your hard earned money to millionaires and billionaires. They have enough.  The average american &quot;family&quot; has a hard time putting food on the table and yet can find the time to waste watching sports, spend money on tickets and apparel?</p>

<p>People, you are being fooled into wasting your money on this fake entertainment.  Do something productive with your lives instead of sitting around getting fatter, dumber and lazier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well his argument is stupid in the first place and could be used for literally anything. Nfl is rigged because it’s a business and has shareholders and licensing people to think about. Like you guys aren’t making arguments, you’re stating how businesses work and are structured and using that to defend your argument and flatly say the sport is rigged. How do you argue against “nfl has investors and tv deals to think about” kind of argument? You’re not even saying how it’s rigged really, just that it is, for the reason of having investors. If it’s totally rigged why would they just keep having the same teams win? If it was rigged the Dallas Cowboys wouldn’t be hot garbage every year since they’re the team worth the most money, right? Oh no maybe you’ll spin it in an argument against that. Point is your argument is weak to begin with, and you have no actual point you’re trying to make by saying it’s rigged other than to say it’s rigged. Who are they rigging it in favor of? Why them? You use standard business structure as the backbone for the argument that the game is rigged. It’s just nonsense and makes for good larping but rigging the nfl just isn’t even necessary for the guys up top to make profits.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But like, not to sound pretentious here, but at the end of the day does the average fan feel really confident about who is going to win? Sure for the gamblers who get inside tips it&#39;s all well and good, but at the end of the day those families and friends who come together, aren&#39;t they still just watching the sport? It&#39;s the thought that counts. That&#39;s corny and you can call them drones for getting so ramped up over a game. Yes a game that has so much riding on it that it seems more likely to be fixed than not.
Depressing none the less though, to know that most likely this is a fixed sport, even so, the notion is still there that people are spending their time or money in a valued way that sort of emulates a part of the United States&#39; culture.
I&#39;m a Canadian so I&#39;m looking at this from a sort of outside. I guess I&#39;m making my argument out to be like a philosophical form, so like, if I believe the game isn&#39;t fixed then I&#39;m going to see it always as: &quot;SUPER BOWL! OH YEAH! I LOVE THIS TIME OF YEAR!&quot; and not be cynical about it, so I retain the feeling it gives me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that they are both rigged but NBA is harder to rig due to the legitimate skill of players. For example, the refs could call all the calls they want to against him and try to make him lose, but Steph Curry can still hit a 3 pointer basically whenever he wants.  I think the ref calls are less impactful as the NFL and players seem less “in on it” due to how upset they get about bad calls/missed calls In The NBA. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would argue soccer is the most rigged ball game. The scores aren&#39;t variable enough and the refs can control the outcome of the game much easier, goalkeepers must get hit up all the time to be a bit slow in reaction times.

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s one issue with this. </p>

<p>The Patriots are easily the most fined/punished team in league history. They literally haven&#39;t had a first round pick in like 3 years. </p>

<p>Kraft is just a great negotiator, all the owners work together to make the league more money, this isn&#39;t a secret or conspiracy. Its a fact.</p>

<p>Kraft and the 31 other owners pay the Commissoner of the league. Goodell is literally an NFL Employee. They are very transparent about this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You sound like someone who hasn&#39;t watched much football. </p>

<p>The Patriots simply are better than every other team, do they get favorable calls occasionally ? Sure, but so doesn&#39;t every other team.</p>

<p>Was it rigged when the Seahawks called a pass play on the goal line and Butler made that play ? Was it rigged when Hightower stripped sacked Matt Ryan and kept the Falcons out of field goal range ? </p>

<p>Was it rigged when the Jaguars decided to kneel with :55 seconds left and two timeouts ? </p>

<p>Teams pee down their leg in big time situations because the Patriots coach situational football better than any other team in league history. It&#39;s kind of funny that because they&#39;re so good there&#39;s these sort of conspiracy theories that have come up to explain it. </p>

<p>Sorry, they are just a well run organization and most other teams cannot duplicate it because the coach, QB and front office are the most disciplined in football.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES! Obviously rigged. Who throws on first down at the 1 yard line when you have Marshawn Lynch? Why did the Falcons keep calling dropback passing plays when they were within field goal range which would have won them the game? Why wouldn&#39;t the Falcons commit to running the ball to kill the clock in the 2nd half when their dynamic duo tandem were tearing the Pats apart? Were you to look at those plays with unbiased eyes, you would see the Pats were given those games by the teams they were playing.</p>

<p>You kind of sound like someone who doesn&#39;t watch much football if you believe the Seahawks and Falcons made such obviously self-destructive decisions because they felt it was the best chance for them to win their respective Super Bowls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your debate is hot garbage and all you do is look at what happened and say there’s no way they would’ve done it if it wasn’t rigged. Want to know why the Seahawks passed instead of ran with Lynch? Because Pete Carrol was going against the best coach of all time and was overthinking and trying to be fancy and unpredictable. Going with Lynch is exactly what everyone expected him to do in that situation and Carrol tried to do something different and unexpected against Belichick. Coaches aren’t perfect, the entire thing is a big game of chess when it comes to play calling. Carrol tried to be sneaky and unpredictable and paid for it. If it went the other way and they ran with Lynch and it got stopped, you could be having this exact same argument but you’d be saying WHY WOULD YOU RUN LYNCH EVERYONE KNOWS THATS WHATS GOING TO HAPPEN. Your argument is impossible to argue against because you’re just taking the result and saying it’s only possible because of some conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because it&#39;s extremely far fetched to believe that even trying to outsmart Belichick, Carroll would call a pass to begin with. Take into account Butler was in perfect position to make a pick on a play call designed to catch everyone off guard when they would of been at the line attempting to stop an obvious run call on first down against Lynch at 1 yard which would have been an automatic score and win to begin with.</p>

<p>So we have a smart coach in Carroll making a drastically dumb decision while in prime position to win, Wilson missing his target, and Butler (a big unknown at the time) being in the right spot to get the game stealing interception. While you believe it was all some boneheaded coaching decision and miraculous play by Butler, those of us unbiased enough know it was a perfectly executed set-up.</p>

<p>Marshall Faulk seems to agree with me. These are professional football players and coaches who know when something fishy is happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah look, we have differing views on this. </p>

<p>Your position comes from an emotional resentment and you anchor that with testimony from players who the Patriots have embarassed on the largest stage. With zero proof to leverage your argument.</p>

<p>My view is supported by facts, supported by the fact that not a single former player, coach or executive of the Patriots had ever come forward to substantiate what you&#39;re saying. Despite leaving the team under bitter contract disputes, locker room toxicity or poor performance. </p>

<p>Your free to believe your side, I just happen to think you&#39;re exceptionally foolish. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s fine. Just wanted to show you what professional players think of the patriots and I side with them. It&#39;s not like they haven&#39;t been caught cheating and received fines and penalties. it&#39;s just that I believe they do more than what they have been caught doing.  Facts are funny because it&#39;s much easier for the NFL to hide evidence (destroying tapes) than it is for average joes like me to uncover it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well to know and understand something you have to research it. Spygate wasn&#39;t the Patriots taping practices or anything of the sort.</p>

<p>They were recording The Jets defensive signals (which was legal at the time) from the field as opposed to the stands. Thats it. Every other team was asked to stop recording from that spot, the Patriots continued to record from that spot and got caught. </p>

<p>They weren&#39;t doing anything different than other teams were doing, they just got caught.</p>

<p>Zero proof of stealing playbooks, recording practices, walk thrus etc...thats all conjecture. </p>

That&#39;s all you can do since we don&#39;t personally get to investigate the NFL or see the tapes.  Taking the NFLs position is no better than the position of players and coaches. Perhaps data analysis would make a stronger argument. I&#39;ll have to pull up some data for you. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep an open mind and you can keep a closed one.

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of the players in the nfl are not smart enough to uphold a conspiracy. If these safety&#39;s and linebacker are taking dives for Brady then they deserve Emmys at how real they make it seem.</p>

<p>Also Brady has an insane arm. You can&#39;t fake that. You could fake maybe bellicheks calling and plays by just having the opposite team do dumber shit. But Brady is very clearly very mechanically and athletically gifted. There genuinely doesn&#39;t have to be a conspiracy to explain the patriots success.</p>

<p>But who knows maybe I&#39;m wrong maybe they wanted a team called the patriots to form a dynasty so people would love nfl, love patriotism, and forget about 911</p>

<p>I expand on this on my previous post which focus on how much gambling dictates pro sports. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7sobbf/professional_sports_are_rigged_probably_the_most/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7sobbf/professional_sports_are_rigged_probably_the_most/</a> </p>

<p>Also from Steven Smith, an Arizona State basketball player busted for point-shaving:</p>

<p>&quot;Its not what most people think it is, you know? Most people think you have to, uh, don&#39;t score, miss a shot, throw the ball in the stands. That&#39;s obvious.&quot; </p>

<p>That&#39;s things that makes its look obvious. An outfielder plays ever-so-slightly out of position to allow a fly out to become a double. An offensive lineman misses a blocking assignment, costing the team a drive-sustaining first down. A small forward gets picked during a set play giving his man just enough space to him a jumper. All of these are subtle actions, all unnoticed, all costly. When they are the results of fatigue or loss of concentration, when are they something more sinister? The only person to know for sure is the player.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair point, but a lot if them are also too stupid too keep it hush off the field. Were talking hundreds and hundreds of players, most out if college I doubt not a single one would spill the beans. Especially given how much the superbowl and jerseys mean to them growing up. I feel like at least a few would be pissed enough to come forward especially if they have to play the role of the bad players. This would be a harder conspiracy to keep quiet than 911 imo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read Brian&#39;s book and another great book called Bookie, Fixer, Gambler Spy about Cricket.  The reason I read both is that I origially cut my teeth in statistics and was making decent money playing horseracing, cricket, and football.  I went into it thinking that horse racing is fixed but other sports were legit.  The only thing I bet on now, and it is only casually, is horse racing, and that is because a good horse can overcome a cheating jockey.</p>

<p>It is one thing to feed us mass media sports to dull our senses.  It is another to take the panacea, the anodyne that we are given and stick it up our ass. </p>

<p>I am convinced we are lied to all the time, and by everyone in authority.  My sincere hope is that people like myself, and there are a lot of us, who shrugged off other conspiracies will realize that when someone will go so far as to fuck up our distractions, the one thing that makes us happy on Sundays, there is no chance that the other shit we walk through the other 6 days a week, the days we work for a living, arent fixed either. </p>

<p>A lot of people woke up with 9/11.  Others with a wide variety of other lies.  I feel bad it took me so long, and that I was such a dimwit my take on life was as long as you don&#39;t fuck with my sports you aren&#39;t fucking with me.  I was so wrong, and I am so committed to your message.  Thanks for a great post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is hilarious.  If you&#39;ve actually followed the Pats during Kraft&#39;s ownership you would realize that they have been treated much more harshly than other franchises.  More sour grapes.  Go watch soccer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why did the NFL burn the spygate tapes? We&#39;ll start there and move to the next. No doubt the NFL is fixed the entire country saw the officiating all post season. No holding calls since week 16......coincidence? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the fix was in, what possible reason would there be to continually have the Pat&#39;s win?  How did they manage to get the Falcons to blow a 28-3 lead?  Did they use electrogravitics to allow Edleman to make that catch?</p>

<p>Get real.  I understand the losing mentality, I rooted for the Pat&#39;s when I couldn&#39;t even watch their home games because not enough tickets were sold.  I watched the Red Sox lose every year until my 36th year on earth.  I get why people hate the Pat&#39;s but there is simply no question that Brady and Belichik are GOAT&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, and the tapes they burned were videos of coaches giving hand signals on the sidelines.  It was illegal to video them from your own sidelines beginning the year before.  Before that it was legal.  And it was legal to videotape the very same thing from the coach&#39;s booth.  So if that&#39;s your excuse for losing it&#39;s pretty lame imo.</p>

My concern for you is it seems like they&#39;ve got you hook line and sinker my friend. A grown man living vicariously through others and their success? Who cares really as you have nothing to do with a win. Focus on you and the things you can control don&#39;t let sports distract you. Do you get defensive about your wnba team down at Mohegan sun? Monday morning you&#39;ll have to do you and non of those overpaid guys making millions wearing spandex know or root for you. </p>

I enjoy reading and yet do not live vicariously through books.  </p>

I personally know people that listen to weei all day and think they are part of the patriots organization. It&#39;s unhealthy and if they focused their energy on what they could control they&#39;d be better off. There was a study done about people who put sport decals on their vehicle after a team was successful hence pats fans and the pike after 2001, I&#39;ll find it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Too hard to fix games with 22 men on the field. It’s impossible to script. </p>

<p>A more plausible theory is the kneeling controversy coincided with scathing reports of CTE in players and consequently drowned out the findings in the media. </p>

<p>FYI, the NFL pulled their funding for the study but it’s still undergoing without their endorsement. They even released findings of Aaron Hernandez’s brain. Again this was overshadowed. </p>

<p>The NFL is in the unique situation where they are facing sapping ratings. If it becomes public knowledge football is inherently dangerous on the level of boxing, public interest will wane. </p>

<p>Also the NFL tv contract is due for renewal in 2020. Look for more off-field controversies to pique public interest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>YES! Obviously rigged. Who throws on first down at the 1 yard line when you have Marshawn Lynch? Why did the Falcons keep calling dropback passing plays when they were within field goal range which would have won them the game? Why wouldn&#39;t the Falcons commit to running the ball to kill the clock in the 2nd half when their dynamic duo tandem were tearing the Pats apart? Were you to look at those plays with unbiased eyes, you would see the Pats were given those games by the teams they were playing.</p>

<p>You kind of sound like someone who doesn&#39;t watch much football if you believe the Seahawks and Falcons made such obviously self-destructive decisions because they felt it was the best chance for them to win their respective Super Bowls.</p>
