        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Things I witnessed that I originally thought would dramatically shift Americans trust and compliance with our government. </p>

<p>I used to think well if enough corruption is exposed and or admitted it will essentially cause mass non compliance with our current two party system. 
I now  think anything short of an entire electrical grid collapse and or economic total collapse would have any effect. 
Just wanted to get others thoughts on this. 
I may come back in and edit and add links and sources for everything I post later when I am on my laptop. But not sure it&#39;s even necessary. </p>

<p>--Iran Contra 
Watching as a kid trying to understand what was going on. Remembering the anger and silence from my dad, uncle and grandfather as they refused to talk or explain any of it to me. They refused to watch it on TV and didn&#39;t want me asking or talking about it. </p>

<p>--Waco 
Watching the attack on Koresh and the families on television was an early psychological imprint on me. Asking my dad why tanks and troops were attacking a church of people in Texas. Dad being a Vietnam veteran and watching his face and the look of shock he had as tanks rammed into the buildings and all those people were murdered . It was the first time I genuinely realized this so called freedom had strings attached. </p>

<p>--WMD&#39;s in Iraq.
 The lies around the Iraq war was the turning point for me personally in completely leaving the two party paradigm and began doing deep research into the &quot;Deep State / New World Order&quot; Oklahoma City, 911 and JFK etc... </p>

<p>There are many more I&#39;m not mentioning because I&#39;m talking about specific events to me. I have spent extensive amounts of time on Oklahoma City, 911 and the Underwear Bomber (friends with Kurt Haskell who blew the whistle on that)</p>

<p>--TARP and the 2008 bailout (Congress threatened with martial law if they did not switch their vote) 
As an adult the crash and bailout of the too big to fails was one of the most sobering and scary things I have ever witnessed. 
The House voted no. They dropped the market 600 more points. Then Rep Brad Sherman stated on CSPAN &quot;they told us unless we went back and voted yes there would be martial law in America.&quot; (many others admitted this including Gresham Barret SC and many more) 
On record Congress was forced by not the people but banking and intelligence interests (Paulson) to change 57 votes and pass TARP under threat of martial law. 
Despite 90% or more of Americans opposing the bailouts both Barack Obama and John McCain voted yes for TARP and suspended their campaigns against the will of the people. When I confronted Lindsey Graham face to face on camera about his vote to give the banks billions, he simply said &quot;the workers economy was going to collapse&quot; (video channel was deleted from YouTube years ago) </p>

<p>It was at this point I realized the American people were essentially zombies, ignorant, scared or simply apathetic. Possibly a combination. 
How could anyone successfully argue the people had any control over the Republic at that point. 
Discussion of this with almost anyone was met with confusion or blank stares. Where was my bailout as a business owner? </p>

<p>--28 pages and Saudi funding of 911
of course this is only the tip of the iceberg with 911. Just focusing on a bombshell admitted in mainstream media. 
I&#39;m thinking wow they have called us crazy disrespectful you name it for daring to question ANYTHING about the official narrative about 911 . 
Bottom line this would prove BARE MINIMUM the White House and US Government lied about the root funding of the largest attack on American soil. 
It was released...... Nothing, LITERALLY NOTHING. 
If I did bring this up yet again I either got confusion or blank stares. 
The media glossed over it as if it was part of the official narrative all along. Just a passing news story. </p>

<p>Then there is Snowden, Wikileaks, Libya, the IRS targeting people for their political beliefs admitted, trillions missing literally from the Pentagon, 20 trillion in debt, insolvent, Fast and Furious, insider trading within Congress, police state, Hillarys emails, Trump etc.... the list continues on and on... 
This is all just off the top of my head. </p>

<p>My wife looked at me last night while I was watching the memo coverage and said
&quot;Seriously! PEOPLE DO NOT CARE. They can admit everything. They can hold a press conference and give a video presentation on how they killed Kennedy and ran 911! As long as the power doesn&#39;t go out and their phones work it&#39;s literally irrelevant to most people&quot;</p>

<p>I can&#39;t disagree with that. There really isn&#39;t anything I can see happening short of total absolute economic or infrastructure collapse that the general population would cause the general population to make or cause any real change. </p>

<p>I have always looked at other countries and protests, strikes etc.. Americans, walking dead. </p>

<p>I&#39;d be interested to know what others think. Right now you can&#39;t convince me anything short of an apocalyptic event would have any bearing on the American population as a whole. </p>

<p>This is just a steam of thoughts and frustration I thought I could air in this sub for feedback. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It seems like he could plausibly be describing not a direct threat, but more of a scare-tactic (I.e. economy will crash, people will panic, people will riot, people will die, and martial law will be necessary).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hank Paulson from Goldman Sachs specifically is the primary person. However threat or scare tactic is splitting hairs when it is effective to constitute a revote where 57 &quot;representatives&quot; change their vote to transfer an initial 700 billion dollars to criminal banks because they threatened you with economic terrorism. </p>

<p>The end result is 57 of them were hijacked by private entities threats for the largest single transfer of wealth ever. 
Of course your folks like Ron Paul knew exactly what was going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it’s less a case of being exhausted and more a case of not being organised enough to start rebelling against governments. We need awakened leaders rallying people locally so that they can eventually become groups that are national and even international that actually make shit happen, rather than having small protests here and there on the steps of parliament/the White House/wherever, or even on Reddit with people constantly complaining. Simply put, the elite need to be culled, but we can only do that when most of the public is on board with it. I think we’re decades away from that kind of possibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is actually why Pizzagate got so popular. So many huge conspiracies that <em>should</em> have woken people up, like the Iraqi WMDs lies and the Snowden revelations, had no lasting impact after exposure. People went right back to trusting the government and going about their lives. It&#39;s frustrating. If it could ever actually be proven that the political elite were sadistic child-trafficking paedophiles, that <em>might</em> just spark enough outrage to actually bring down the corruption we already know of and bring about meaningful change for once. At least it&#39;s tempting to think so. It makes people desperately want it to be true, because regular government corruption and lies, despite their <em>horrific</em> consequences, are too easily brushed off, with the help of the complicit mainstream media -- it feels hopeless. The lack of accountability is maddening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are right on the money with Pizzagate.  People really bought into it.<br/>
If we look at the timing on when Pizzagate started 10/31/2017) to be big news, it was right after wikileaks published the Podesta emails (10/7/2017).  The public needed a smoking gun, and one was fabricated for us so that we (public) felt closure. It was all just a distraction - to take us away from the revelations in the wikileaks published document.  The media published a couple things about the emails and pulled in the whole pizzagate thing and forgot all about Podesta and frankly, never went back to it.<br/>
Another example of this - 2.3 trillion goes missing from the pentagon and 24 hours later, 9/11 happens.  No one ever went back to the 2.3 trillion, the 6.5 trillion last year, the 21 trillion found by MSU in december.  </p>

<p>To support the awakening, I struggle. I fully admit, I don&#39;t want disrupt my life.  I just wish my younger self knew all that I knew now at a time when I was more willing to rock that boat.  </p>

<p>What I have tried to do is educate people on the world around them with facts and let them draw their own conclusions.  That is how I try to help propagate the awakening... is it enough? No.  Should I try to do more for helping humanity awake? Yes. Am I willing to sacrifice everything for that? No. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is an awakening in process. It is on all levels of society. It is growing, but what wakes up one person will not wake another. Each is on their own personal journey. Politics will only wake some people. UFO sightings others. Chemtrails another. GMOs another. </p>

<p>Remember that while it appears that people are asleep en mass, what keeps them asleep is very individual. What wakes them is unique to them. No one can awake unless something knocks on the door of their consciousness that causes them to question.</p>

<p>Can you wake people up? Perhaps. But, that only happens if they are ready, willing and able... and if what you are trying to wake them up to is something that will rock the foundation of their existence to know is not as they believe. They have to agree so much with the point of their awakening that they are willing to push past cognitive dissonance, possible ridicule by people in their world and stand in the new belief. </p>

<p>Nothing exists in a person&#39;s world until and unless they believe it does. While belief creates reality most of the world believe it works the other way... that you must see it first to believe it. </p>

<p>You want to know the absolute fastest way to wake up others? It&#39;s going to rock your world if you even look into it. What if I told you that everything in your world originates in you? What if every conspiracy, every cruelty in the world, every injustice, everything that comes into your awareness... sickness, disease, death... originates in you? Would you be willing to awake to that? Most are not ready and believe that is just crazy talk... probably like others believe even confirmed conspiracies are crazy talk.</p>

<p>If you are interested and willing to go down this rabbit hole, check out Ho&#39;oponopono and the shocking story of how a doctor emptied a hospital of criminally insane men simply by recognizing somehow he had created this situation for these men in his consciousness. And, by working on his own consciousness those men were &quot;cured&quot; and the hospital emptied. It is a true story. As we work on ourselves through this practice, we heal others/wake others.</p>

<p>I have no financial interest in this, I have simply found it to be one of the most powerful truths in existence. However, it is so &quot;out there&quot; for most people, they will brush it off as crazy and go on about their lives never discovering that this is one of the most profound truths in existence and is perhaps our greatest opportunity to change everyone&#39;s lives for the better. </p>

<p>Peace and love to you</p>

I agree with you totally. 
Alan Watt once said the simple reality is most people are simply not capable of being woken up. It would literally destroy or even kill them if even possible. Usually the only people who are capable of  awakening are those who can handle it which is why they are awake. </p>

<p>Very interesting you mentioned that story about the hospital. I had literally just saw something about that recently somewhere when ready about meditation and law of attraction etc.. I had meant to look into it more and forgot until I just saw your post on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people ARE awake, the problem is we have no leader and are not organized, so we don&#39;t know what to do.  Let&#39;s say your &#39;mad as hell and not going to take it any longer.&#39;  So, what are your options.  First, you sign a petition, but that does nothing because the gov&#39;t ignores it and plows right ahead.  Then, you write/call you congressman/woman and are given the short, rote reply that changes nothing.  You go to the polls and vote in a better candidate, but this one soon becomes sucked into the machine and is a carbon copy of the last one.  So, even though you have a full time job, perhaps a family to support, and are exhausted from the long hours you have to work due to cutbacks and downsizing, you go out into the streets and protest with others like yourself.  If you&#39;re lucky, it is peaceful or perhaps it&#39;s not and you get arrested.  Now you have a police record.  This follows you to some extant.  Want to get security clearance for that better job - nope.  Oh, you graduated law school finally and want to pass the character section in the bar - nope.  You just got your master&#39;s degree and want to be licensed in your field - nope.  Now you have to spend time and  money to get that record expunged.  And what did your protest do - nothing.  How many of us here have seen a successful protest, where actual real change took place, in the past 20 years?  Not to mention all the corruption we see in Washington and Hollywood and Wall Street and no one seems to be going to jail.  The most that happens in Washington is someone has to resign but then they usually end up with a private sector job making even more money.  On Wall Street, no one even really resigned.  In Hollywood, some people were fired, but still no real arrests and I wonder how long it will take for these same people to be re-hired secretly and work behind the scenes again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be a downer, but these are some of the reasons that people who are awake do nothing.  Mr. Smith isn&#39;t going to Washington anymore.  And if someone charismatic comes along that even begins to lead the people...well, you know what happens to them.</p>

<p>So, I ask you, serious question...what can anyone really do?  It is going to take something very major to get the proles to go after Big Brother.  It will have to be something that disturbs the very essence of people&#39;s daily lives, if not, they will continue to stay in their warm homes, go to their 9-5s, watch tv and try to ignore the unpleasantness going on in the world around them.</p>

<p>Most people are too attached to their victim pictures and victim games to step into this level of spiritual neutrality. Note I did not say responsibility, which is another game.

    <div class="md"><p>There is a single problem with this, and who knows, maybe all &#39;awakenings.&#39; It is not simply enough to say &#39;you seem to think this from your perspective, and I think this from mine, and though they&#39;re different we&#39;ll just agree to be cool.&#39; </p>

<p>It&#39;s more than that.</p>

<p>It also requires a way to figure out how to hear the core of it without having to accept all of the above--chemtrails, ufo, 9/11 false flags of schemes ranging from the logical to the preposterous. I&#39;ve found that often there&#39;s a simpler--much simpler explanation for most things. That doesn&#39;t mean that explanation&#39;s not hella weird sometimes.</p>

<p>I like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because people can read deeply, and consider many different really off-the-wall ideas and actually consider them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s it&#39;s own kind of faith. I want to believe.</p>

<p>It is both within you and external--that&#39;s the thing. You can change yourself, but you also can, and in some cases MUST change the world around you, to the best of your abilities, without destroying yourself or others. That&#39;s more than just looking within yourself. You get answers within.</p>

<p>Automation and the resulting lack of employment.</p>

<p>The protracted death of social security. </p>

<p>Climate change. Global warming.</p>

<p>Technological advances.</p>

<p>2.5 billion more people globally by 2050.</p>

<p>The paths? Automation lifts everyone up and the relationship we have with our jobs and income will fundamentally change. Socialism of some form will fit around the full automation of (most) jobs like a glove. If the fundamentals of capitalism&#39;s profit value cease to exist because no one will &quot;work&quot; anymore as we know it today and won&#39;t then be able to earn income so they can buy things then socialism  is the only option.</p>

<p>The second path is that the few who own the automation machines and the businesses will rule and dictate. The masses will be extremely poor or enslaved even. </p>

<p>Part of it is propaganda.  The CIA-run media controls the mind of the masses.  Only in hindsight and after overwhelming evidence does the public say, &quot;Hey, the good looking TV news anchors in the expensive suits lied to us.&quot;  They never question it as it is happening.  They can do this over and over again because the public has such a short memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I firmly believe there is no level of corruption or conspiracy that will drive changes and dissent in the masses. </p>

<p>Take the Democratic primaries. I was obvious our Democracy was undermined. It was obvious Hillary was a criminal willing to sink the ship to be called captain. Scandal after scandal, and people were still willing to vote for her. Then, it was clear she undermined our Democratic process, one of t he fundamental principles we hold dearly. </p>

<p>Most people didn&#39;t care. They still voted for her.</p>

<p>We see the same thing with the way it appears they have attempted to undermine Trump.  </p>

<p>And if the level of corruption is so high that it might cause a revolt, or change in behavior for the masses, they dismiss it was not believable and not worth considering. Look at 9/11. Majority of people are not willing to believe the Govt. would do something like that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My wife voted for her. It baffled me. She said she simply hated Trump; he is pompous, arrogant, entitled, He said &quot;grab em by the pussy&quot;,and on and on with unconfirmed personal traits. I reminded her we care voting for the person we believe will do the best job, not who we like personally.</p>

<p>So, I asked her; &quot;We all know she stole the election from Bernie. She has been involved in too many scandals to count without paper. Givenb that the evidence is overwhelming that the primary was stolen, which undermines the fundamental fabric of our Democracy. Is there any level of corruption you will not vote for?&quot; I mean, suppose a politician killed me, and all the evnidence is there. At what level would you refuse to vote for someone because of the confirmed corruption?&quot;</p>

<p>Her answer? <strong>there is no level</strong></p>

<p>It does not matter how corrupt a politician is, she will vote for them if she likes them. She is a Brown Grad. that had an academic scholarship. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you see is brainwashing into a cult.  Call it whatever you want, &quot;conquest cult&quot; is my favorite at the moment but the fact remains: it&#39;s a cult.</p>

<p>The solution to cult brainwashing is physical separation and exposure to alternative sources of information.</p>

<p>This means people have to turn the TV off.  Anyone who turns the TV off will begin waking up.  Nearly everyone who continues to watch TV remains asleep, in a dose-dependent way.  The more TV you watch, the more asleep you are.</p>

<p>There will never be any real awakening nor any change in society brought about by people who remain in thrall of their television.</p>

<p>Social media is quickly gaining a similar status in controlling people&#39;s minds but I don&#39;t think it is quite there yet.  Soon, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s pretty simple. If you contradict the <em>current version</em> of the mainstream narrative, say on 9/11, then you are saying one of two things: 1) that some <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/">globally dominant cabal</a> has the ability to keep 100% of the mainstream silent around the world for 15 years, or 2) you are smarter than all of the world&#39;s experts combined.</p>

<p>Both sound batshit crazy, which will make people avoid you because most people are genetically programmed to conform for pretty obvious evolutionary reasons. </p>

<p>Given how hard it is now to deny that a globally dominant cabal exists, <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/mainstream-crazy-extreme/">it is now the mainstream that is crazy and extreme</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think a lot of people ARE awake, the problem is we have no leader and are not organized, so we don&#39;t know what to do.  Let&#39;s say your &#39;mad as hell and not going to take it any longer.&#39;  So, what are your options.  First, you sign a petition, but that does nothing because the gov&#39;t ignores it and plows right ahead.  Then, you write/call you congressman/woman and are given the short, rote reply that changes nothing.  You go to the polls and vote in a better candidate, but this one soon becomes sucked into the machine and is a carbon copy of the last one.  So, even though you have a full time job, perhaps a family to support, and are exhausted from the long hours you have to work due to cutbacks and downsizing, you go out into the streets and protest with others like yourself.  If you&#39;re lucky, it is peaceful or perhaps it&#39;s not and you get arrested.  Now you have a police record.  This follows you to some extant.  Want to get security clearance for that better job - nope.  Oh, you graduated law school finally and want to pass the character section in the bar - nope.  You just got your master&#39;s degree and want to be licensed in your field - nope.  Now you have to spend time and  money to get that record expunged.  And what did your protest do - nothing.  How many of us here have seen a successful protest, where actual real change took place, in the past 20 years?  Not to mention all the corruption we see in Washington and Hollywood and Wall Street and no one seems to be going to jail.  The most that happens in Washington is someone has to resign but then they usually end up with a private sector job making even more money.  On Wall Street, no one even really resigned.  In Hollywood, some people were fired, but still no real arrests and I wonder how long it will take for these same people to be re-hired secretly and work behind the scenes again.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not trying to be a downer, but these are some of the reasons that people who are awake do nothing.  Mr. Smith isn&#39;t going to Washington anymore.  And if someone charismatic comes along that even begins to lead the people...well, you know what happens to them.</p>

<p>So, I ask you, serious question...what can anyone really do?  It is going to take something very major to get the proles to go after Big Brother.  It will have to be something that disturbs the very essence of people&#39;s daily lives, if not, they will continue to stay in their warm homes, go to their 9-5s, watch tv and try to ignore the unpleasantness going on in the world around them.</p>
