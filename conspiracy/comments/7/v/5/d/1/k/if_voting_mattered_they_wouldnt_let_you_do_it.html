    <div class="md"><p>I think it was absolutely true in Carlin&#39;s time, and pretty much up until 2016, when both Sanders and Trump did way better than they were ever &quot;supposed&quot; to. Then, those unexpected successes put the political establishment into panic mode. Remains to be seen whether all their manoeuvring since then to clamp down on social and independent media and bring back McCarthyism will render 2016&#39;s populist uprising nothing but a blip, or if it&#39;s an irreversible trend. </p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s worth noting that Trump&#39;s election hasn&#39;t actually changed all that much yet. They did everything they could to rein him in. So even with his unexpected victory, I&#39;m still not so sure it will have &quot;mattered&quot; from the viewpoint of his right-wing populist supporters who wanted him based on how he differed from other Republicans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>His SOTU  could of been done by Jeb or Marco. It was the typical republican “America is good” speech.  I’ll agree with you there. </p>

<p>While I don’t think that the populist movements are going to be something in the wind. I think the TRUE left are very active along with the “alt right/alt lite/what have you”.  Trump and Bernie spoke to people.</p>

<p>We live in an era where everyone is treated they are still in elementary school. Your boss can call you in and punish you just like the principle. You call your tech customer service provider and the infatuate you like a child. Bernie and trump were the grandpas that told you what the fuck was up. I still think it resonates with people, and as long as the depression we are living in gets worse and worse, people will be pushed to the far right or the far left. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Living in South Carolina and watching every Republican primary for 30+ years I knew something was off script when Jeb Bush came here and couldn&#39;t pull in more than a dozen people at a rally. </p>

<p>Meanwhile Trump is packing out arenas. 
The folks in the state GOP establishment I talked to were in an ABSOLUTE panic. 
Trump is out there talking about Bush lying about Iraq and the 911 stuff. I could not believe he was getting away with it. People were truly fed up with the Bushes establishment etc.. </p>

<p>It was one of the few  if not only organic grass roots political swing I have ever seen. </p>

<p>Saying all that am I declaring Trump is not controlled opposition. Of course not. I do think it was supposed to be Jeb Bush vs Hillary with a Hillary victory. </p>

<p>So.. what you&#39;re saying is that the vote didn&#39;t really matter, because there was an establishment candidate on both sides of the ballot?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The US has huge leverage over the economy of Mexico. I honestly have no idea why people think this claim was silly. Border funding and protection are routine parts of trade deals. For example the French trade deal with morroco consists of forcing morroco to bot pay for and maintain a fortified border. Similarly the British deal with France has long required the border responsibility and protection to be at the cost and responsibility of France.</p>

<p>I think Donald is keeping most of his campaign promises. Though for your information on my bias I continue to be a supporter of his despite his idiocy. So take that belief as you will.</p>

You’re never going to “recoup the cost” all it means is that shit that’s made in Mexico now...Xbox’s, fridges, air conditioners, etc. will now increase in price to offset the Mexican tariffs so not only will the American people be paying for the wall through taxes they’ll also be paying more for goods.

    <div class="md"><p>Ah the isolationist dumbass rightwinger.</p>

<p>So, you want to limit trade with a bunch of shit hole countries. What this does is forces America to shop elsewhere or manufacture themselves.</p>

<p>But remember, these are shit jobs worked by uneducated people, that is not what you want to be focusing resources on. If America suddenly needs to produce a load of new product, it requires a workforce to do so. Now you have a large portion of your workforce tied to low skilled, low paying(possibly subsidised) jobs creating a labour shortage for more profitable ventures.</p>

<p>It should be seen as stages to a countries development. Eventually you become rich enough that old methods of income aren&#39;t worth the time or effort - so you outsource that industry to worse off countries which you can buy from at a discounted rate. So not only does it work out cheaper, it&#39;s more economically beneficial to have the lowest member of society earning higher amounts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say that at all. I said that the consumption economy is far too valuable for Mexico or the companies importing goods to lose. So the adjustments will occur on the supply side as it does when dealing with any valuable consumer base. Hence Mexico will eat the cost to keep the jobs or the companies will relocate, one solution or the other, to the gap, will occur. What won&#39;t happen is a rise in costs for the American consumer as rival trade partners will seek advantage in trade with the US if Mexican prices raise.</p>

<p>I will add manufacturing jobs are still important in a first world economy though, and your dismissal of them as not well placed in a highly developed economy shows a huge misunderstanding of the way a global economy functions compared to the familiar national models. There are always low skilled sections of a population and easy access work is often the best way to raise these communities up. Again this is only to correct your uneducated assumptions about modern economic focus for countries, not what I was arguing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s such a lazy comparison, that’s why. Obama and Sanders were two completely different movements - Sanders was an actual complete outsider running a legitimate grassroots campaign. Obama compromised his ideals early on. He gave up on the grassroots network that got him elected. </p>

<p>To put it simply, when Obama tries to pass healthcare reform he immediately started negotiating to placate the same lobbyists who he was vilifying during his campaign. When Sanders tries to pass healthcare reform he’ll have hundreds of thousands of people descending on DC backing up his agenda. It would be unlike anything you could imagine. Anyone saying Bernie would have just been another Obama is either lazy or not paying attention or both. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Democratic establishment has already rigged the 2020 Presidential election. They won&#39;t let another &quot;Bernie&quot; happen. They don&#39;t want us to have a choice that doesn&#39;t include them.</p>

<p>The Democrats moved the California primary elections to very early in the year. California is such a huge state both in population and geography wise that whoever wins the California primary will have a huge advantage over the other candidates. It will take a lot of money to campaign effectively in California so the only candidates that have a chance are the establishment candidates that start out with a huge war chest.</p>

<p>Watch for Kamala Harris the junior Senator from the Great State of California to be the Democrat&#39;s choice for President elect in 2020. Kamala Harris is really good friends with Hillary Clinton and Nancy Pelosi by the way. (Just a coincidence ya know!)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well...The reason that I mentioned Kamala&#39;s connection with Hillary and Nancy is because you will not hear it mentioned in the mainstream media very much. Hillary and Nancy both come with a lot of baggage and negatives so they will start to pretend to distance themselves from Kamala even though they are the true puppet masters. Hillary and Nancy will ensure that Kamala gets the financial support to win California in 2020 and we won&#39;t know about it.</p>

<p>So...It&#39;s really great news if you like Kamala and want her to win but if you want an outsider or more left leaning candidate to win the primaries the Democratic establishment has already taken that choice away from you.</p>

<p>I believe the elite are afraid of death. With the invention of AI they can live forever and their memories and knowledge can be downloaded and uploaded over and over. Either they can live as a computer generated AI or through another human who has been cloned and farmed to house their ongoing thoughts and memories. These people know that the earth only has a certain amount of resources and with the invention of recycling there’s no need for mining therefor they do not need us anymore. They only need us for another 10-20 years because the probability of a genius with a breakthrough is higher with a higher world population. Once they have figured out how to live forever population control will get rid of a lot of people.</p>

It is sent to a computer, which reworks it to the level needed for those who need to control the man, and the modified information is then reinserted into the brain.&quot; These weapons are used against the mind to induce hallucinations, sickness, mutations in human cells, &quot;zombification,&quot; or even death.</p>

<p>With the invention of AI they can live forever and their memories and knowledge can be downloaded and uploaded over and over. </p>

<p>TIL AI = I can live as a computer. No, that&#39;s a fundamental misunderstanding of Artificial intelligience. AI could aid that, but it&#39;d require serious advancements in brain interfacing for a start. </p>

<p>Of course people have been searching for a cure for death, that&#39;s literally the holy grail. That doesn&#39;t make it any more realistic, nor does it come as a surprise that the richest want to extend their lives - that&#39;s an evolutionary trait, to avoid death.</p>

<p>Then he goes onto human cloning, in the realm of possibility, though it&#39;d still require massive advancements in tech. not only that, but it&#39;d also require massive advancements in order to switch bodies.</p>

<p>Then he goes onto recycling, which in his world is 100% perfect and doesn&#39;t require mining anymore.</p>

<p>Then he mentions the elite will have no need for us in 20 years. Possible, but it&#39;ll be because of advanced robotics rather than a miraculous breakthrough.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not far fetched if you own a time machine. And saying that isn&#39;t that far fetched as scientists are working on it as we speak, gotta be close - right? /s.</p>

<p>Everything he says requires sci-fi level breakthroughs in the next 20 years. We&#39;re close to the tech singularity, but no where near 20 years close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess your school never taught you why secret ballots were important in a democracy. Let me help:</p>

<p>1) So that you can&#39;t be persecuted for voting the &quot;wrong way&quot;.</p>

<p>2) So that you can&#39;t sell your vote (being able to prove you voted a certain way in return for payment).</p>

<p>Those are two very fundamental reasons why secret ballots are essential to a democracy.</p>

<p>As for voting, Stalin had it his way, employ the counters directly and they will count accordingly. An added bonus is that those who voted for an opponent can be identified and disenfranchised.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a reason many nations&#39; who wish to play more than lip-service to democracy seek independent or even outside observers to oversee the democratic process.</p>

<p>Liberal democracy is divide and conquer for the rich that achieves very little over minimal differences under a weak foundation of capitalism. All parties in a liberal democracy bend to the whim of these interests by design, and if not they&#39;re either not allowed to win or are deposed or murdered afterwards. It creates an inefficient government and a hopelessly, endlessly divided population.</p>

<p>Some things had to be done, otherwise murderous bastards like Stalin would&#39;ve been calling the shots.</p>

<p>Never heard of them so don&#39;t care.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>McCarthy never happened? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Didn&#39;t go far enough in my opinion, far too many cultural marxists were left to fester resulting in the counter culture war that was encouraged by the KGB foreign operations desk, but hey, that US Constitution even protects the free speech of seditious bastards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How about all those death squads and dictators &quot;liberal democracy&quot; happily supported if it meant socialist purges? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Reagan said, &quot;He may be a bastards,  but he&#39;s our bastard, and so in the geopolitical sphere, no big thing considering the cost of doing nothing would have been hundreds of millions of deaths in Communist purges.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>CIA and FBI don&#39;t infiltrate trade unions worldwide?</p>

<p>Spies and their ways are dirty by nature. So another reminder, the KGB did exist too and did exactly the same. They helped groups like CND and left wing terror groups throughout the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Commies never killed or enslaved 30% to 60% of any population at any point in history. Stop parroting fascist propaganda without citing sources. </p>

<p>Capitalism is built on class hatred, as was feudalism before it. Capitalism itself is a necessary stepping stone to socialism, but I doubt you&#39;ve read Marx. Communism is a classless society, so there inherently cannot be any class hatred. Socialism is largely based on the &quot;dictatorship of the proletariat&quot; but can you please explain how this is worse than our current dictatorship of the bourgeoise? As you so arrogantly say, &quot;geopolitics is a horrible game but a necessary one.&quot;</p>

<p>Orwell fought with anarchists. He never saw anything firsthand as it was not a &quot;communist&quot; war. In fact most anarchists today would blame the USSR for why they lost despite them reverting to tribalism quite quickly.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t dislike Orwell, but a propagandist is a propagandist and he was paid to inform on socialists. That doesn&#39;t make his literal fiction into reality, to say the least.</p>

<p>Stalin was not a murderous tyrant, nor were Guevara or Mao. Historical revisionism might provide validation but it helping you feel good doesn&#39;t make it true.</p>

<p>My country has a strong <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/connolly/1908/03/socinire.htm">socialist</a> history, as did the US until it was exterminated. There was this little conflict called &quot;The Troubles&quot; that Northern Ireland in particular still suffers from mass shellshock from. Living in a country where white people are racist and murder other white people grants one an interesting perspective.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no &quot;all powerful state&quot; under socialism since true socialism is unachievable without true social democracy (which the USSR had), and communism is a stateless society yet to exist. This is mythology that only demonstrates your basic lack of actual tangible knowledge. You keep parroting someone else&#39;s propaganda and it&#39;s so blatant.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want an anarchist revolution, no. Though I sympathize with the cause, anarchism has no practical application on a societal level though I would advocate for it in certain circumstances because I believe strongly in the individual, but I also believe strongly in society. I&#39;d rather more along the lines of the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that made the USSR the first in the world to give women the right to vote and ensure employees could unionize, among other little things like raising life expectancy by 65%, eradicating unemployment and homelessness, ending famine that occurred like clockwork under the Tsar and kulaks, achieved full literacy from a starting point of 56%, eliminated the gender pay gap, heavily subsidized child daycare, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Capitalism needs to be enforced and <em>actually</em> leads to fascism. I would rather enforce upon exploiters than the working person, for whom capitalism does not care about and only the struggles of socialists have garnered even decent working conditions for them.</p>

<p>Socialism and fascism are incompatible and there is no crossover, they are fundamentally opposed. It&#39;s possible for someone to originally be a socialist and then become a fascist, like Mussolini, but they aren&#39;t a shared state of mind. Capitalism is fundamental to fascism, hence why enslaving and exterminating communists, socialists, trade unionists etc and declaring war on &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot; was the Nazi MO, was it also justified by the Nazis? Because if you wanna agree with the fundamental philosophy of the Nazis... might want to start calling yourself a Nazi.</p>

<p>The capitalist nations in WWII were hoping that socialism (USSR) and fascism (Italy, Nazi Germany) would destroy each other because they are natural opposites. There is no overlap unless you are completely uneducated on both, which I suspect.</p>

<p>The only way to enforce any collectivism type system is through repression.</p>

<p>The fact that you can propagate communism in the West is testament that the Soviet model was inferior in every way.</p>

<p>The USSR model could allow no dissent. That is why hey had a gulag system, re-education camps and purges.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re full of shit and trying to mask it with blind malice and hatred.</p>

<p>The USSR model allowed plenty of dissent, you need to start citing sources because you are only making yourself look foolish. They had gulags just as America has prisons, prisons which hold more than the gulags ever did, and the purges have not only been conducted by America on nationwide scales across the world by your own admission (it&#39;s just okay when it&#39;s against socialists), but did not target innocent people.</p>

<p>&quot;Re-education&quot; is not an invalid concept. It is rehabilitation, there is simply no money to be made in rehabilitating people. In your eyes the USSR was somehow different from the US and things like imprisonment, rehabilitation and the death penalty are suddenly unacceptable. The author of &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot; had his cancer cured twice in the gulag and had a desk job that allowed him to write it in the first place. Yet apparently these gulags were so cutthroat and careless.</p>

<p>It really is amazing how much you&#39;ve been suckered by propaganda. There is a good video series on the purges which I&#39;ll <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBY_aDd5knE">leave here</a> but sincerely doubt you&#39;d bother listening because you&#39;re only interested in things which validate your preconceived biases.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Wikipedia but fuck it, I ain&#39;t digging out the library card to explain to an idiot that rain is wet. Go there for the citations you so much crave.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the declassified Soviet archives, during 1937 and 1938, the NKVD detained 1,548,366 persons, of whom 681,692 were shot – an average of 1,000 executions a day (in comparison, the Tsarists executed 3,932 persons for political crimes from 1825 to 1910 – an average of less than 1 execution per week).[6]</p>

<p>According to NKVD statistics, from July 1937 to November 1938, 335,513 persons were sentenced by troikas in the course of the implementation of the National Operations. Among them, 247,157 (or 73.6%) were executed by shooting.[83]</p>

<p>Several experts believe the evidence released from the Soviet archives is understated, incomplete, or unreliable.[6][84][85][86] For example, Robert Conquest claimed that the probable figure for executions during the years of the Great Purge is not 681,692, but some two and a half times as high and cited a figure of 1,750,000 given by both the Head of the Russian Archives and a spokesman for the Security Ministry. He believes that the KGB was covering its tracks by falsifying the dates and causes of death of rehabilitated victims.[7][87] A common practice of falsification for lowering the execution numbers was disguising executions with the sentence ten years without the right of correspondence. All of the bodies identified from the mass graves at Vinnitsa and Kuropaty were of individuals who had received this sentence.[88] However, the lower figure did roughly confirm Conquest&#39;s original 1968 estimate of 700,000 &quot;legal&quot; executions and in the preface to the 40th anniversary edition of The Great Terror, Conquest claimed that he had been &quot;correct on the vital matter—the numbers put to death: about one million&quot;.&quot;[89]</p>

<p>Historian Michael Ellman claims the best estimate of deaths brought about by Soviet repression during these two years ranges from 950,000 to 1.2 million, which includes deaths in detention and those who died shortly after being released from the Gulag, as a result of their treatment therein. He also states that this is the estimate historians and teachers of Russian history should use.[8] Soviet Professor Iosif G. Dyadkin estimated 1.42 million unnatural deaths were brought about by the Great Purge during 1937–1938 in his demographic study on unnatural deaths in the Soviet Union under Stalin.[90] Jonathan Brent and Vladimir P. Naumov were less specific simply saying &quot;Millions perished in the Yezhovshchina.&quot;[91]</p>

<p>The extent of the Great Purge has been questioned by revisionist scholars in the West, especially after the (partial) opening of the relevant Soviet files of the period in the early 1990s.[92][93][94] Jerry F. Hough claims, regarding the numbers executed in the Great Purge, &quot;a figure in the low hundreds of thousands seems much more probable than one in the high hundreds&quot; and that a lower figure of only &quot;tens of thousands&quot; was &quot;even probable&quot;.[95] Sheila Fitzpatrick also placed the numbers executed in the &quot;low hundreds of thousands.&quot;[95] Robert W. Thurston allows for 681,692 executions.[96]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Robert Conquest has been thoroughly debunked by historians on all sides of the spectrum (and was a British agent and propagandist) and your own source even refutes his numbers by saying it was probably hundreds of thousands less. That&#39;s a lot of made-up people. Hooray propaganda!</p>

<p>The purges did not target innocent people and it was during a time of high tension due to Nazi Germany and its propaganda, spy and collaborative campaigns with the likes of Trotskyites. I have already provided you a whole video series that goes very in-depth into the purges starting from the trials themselves, it is no surprise you have yet to watch it.

<p>Property rights are better served in collective hands and communism enables personal liberty to far greater extent than capitalism ever has, can or will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good comments ITT.
However, here&#39;s some info on Nazi Germany:</p>

<p>Adolf Hitler - The Man Who Fought The Banks (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=froTxqKSqc4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=froTxqKSqc4</a>)</p>

<p>Haavara Agreement (&quot;Transfer Agreement&quot;) (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement</a>)</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s essential to note that the majority of gassing locations were debunked by mainstream western historians in the 60&#39;s. In the 40&#39;s there were 10+ locations in Germany, Austria and Belgium (<a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/2unh6d/locations_where_poison_gases_were_allegedly_used/coaisk7">https://np.reddit.com/r/holocaust/comments/2unh6d/locations_where_poison_gases_were_allegedly_used/coaisk7</a>) where it was claimed that the Nazis gassed people, and there were witnesses and even Nazi &quot;confessors&quot; who swore this was true. Today, there are but six gassing locations, and all are in Poland. Importantly, the Soviets would not allow western inspection of the Polish camps in the 60&#39;s. In other words, the current allegations of &quot;Nazi gas chambers&quot; rely entirely on Soviet claims from the 1940&#39;s.</p>

<p>You may, for example, wish to look into the initial Soviet claims after capturing Auschwitz (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/auschwitz-walendy">https://www.reddit.com/r/holocaust/wiki/auschwitz-walendy</a>), where they said they discovered an electrocution conveyor belt, blast furnace, and placed the &quot;gas chambers&quot; on the opposite side of the camp as is now believed. Similarly, at Nuremberg, 19 months after capturing Belzec, the Soviets were still claiming that electrocution was the method of killing there (<a href="http://winstonsmithministryoftruth.blogspot.com/2010/06/electrocuted-to-ashes-at-belzec.html">http://winstonsmithministryoftruth.blogspot.com/2010/06/electrocuted-to-ashes-at-belzec.html</a>). Then there are the infamous &quot;steam chambers&quot; of Treblinka, the human soap and lampshades, shrunken heads, etc -- an enormous number of erroneous and debunked claims which are always omitted by the Holocaust industry.</p>

<p>Similarly, the footage and pictures of dead bodies in the western camps (since debunked as &quot;extermination camps&quot;) are repetitively shown without informing the viewer that they were the result of disease in the last weeks and months of the war, as supplies dwindled with the collapse of the German state under the barrage of Allied bombing. US Army doctors confirmed this at the time (see the article on the liberation of the camps(<a href="http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml).">http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml).</a>)</p>

<p>Next, regarding links: there&#39;s a giant cache of material at the <a href="/r/holocaust/wiki">/r/holocaust/wiki</a>. I&#39;d recommend starting with a few short videos by a French historian who is about to go back to prison a second time for his research:</p>

<p>Vincent Reynouard: Holocaust? What They Hide From You (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjqf-vNq6I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bpjqf-vNq6I</a>) (30min)</p>

<p>Vincent Reynouard: Argument 1 - Nothing proven at Nuremberg (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChaMQFkqXyw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChaMQFkqXyw</a>) (9min)</p>

<p>Vincent Reynouard: Argument 2 - The dishonesty of the official historians (<a href="https://vimeo.com/90766157">https://vimeo.com/90766157</a>) (9min)</p>

<p>Another good introductory video is about the use of the western camps by US psychological warfare units:</p>

<p>Dean Irebodd: Buchenwald - A Dumb Dumb Portrayal of Evil (2009) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVZ_5yWmBRk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVZ_5yWmBRk</a>)</p>

<p>This video by Jewish revisionist David Cole is a classic which many credit with opening their eyes to the dishonest presentation of Auschwitz:</p>

<p>David Cole Visits Auschwitz (1992) (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHzWo79dCHs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHzWo79dCHs</a>)</p>

<p>There are a few articles which are essential introductory reading:</p>

<p>&#39;Extermination&#39; Camp Propaganda Myths (<a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/1170/">http://codoh.com/library/document/1170/</a>)</p>

<p>Liberation of the Camps: Fact vs Fiction (<a href="http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml">http://www.ihr.org/leaflets/libcamps.shtml</a>)</p>

<p>The Nuremberg Trials and the Holocaust (<a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/2369/">http://codoh.com/library/document/2369/</a>)</p>

<p>Eye Witness Testimony of Gassings (<a href="http://codoh.com/library/document/969/">http://codoh.com/library/document/969/</a>)</p>

<p>And there&#39;s a short book that is a good starting point also, which is an evaluation of the preeminent Holocaust scholar&#39;s use of evidence:</p>

<p>(pdf) The Giant With Feet of Clay: Raul Hilberg and his Standard Work on the ‘Holocaust’ - Jürgen Graf (<a href="http://holocausthandbooks.com/dl/03-tgwfoc.pdf">http://holocausthandbooks.com/dl/03-tgwfoc.pdf</a>)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As some redditor mentioned on Communism, Socialism, Comintern, and Lenin:</p>

<p>Communism=workers own the means of production, the fruits of production are distributed by workers on a union by union basis (originally); 20th century modification by lenin at COMINTERN, the state owns the means of production on behalf of workers, the fruits of production distributed to all citzens by the state.</p>

<p>this is actually how the USSR&#39;s domestic economy functioned in practice. in the USSR there where no homeless people, everyone was fed, housed, and employed, however none but the corrupt elites had luxury of any kind. stalin was a sociopath who permanently destroyed quality of life in the soviet union, not because he was a communist, but because he was insane, like all rabid ideologues.</p>

<p>socialism=the workers own the means of production, the fruits of production are distributed on a union by union basis (until COMINTERN, socialism and communism had been regional synonyms). in socialism the state&#39;s purpose is to protect the unions and the people through progressive income taxes and anti-corporation laws from counter-revolution by capitalists and situations where the fruits of one&#39;s labor are insufficient to support oneself. </p>

<p>socialism has never come closer to implementation than social democracy, which is just kinder, gentler capitalism. </p>

<p>despite his cynical insistence on calling himself a democratic socialist, bernie sanders is no more socialist than russ fiengold, and considerably more imperialistic. he is a social democratic capitalist, i.e. a kensyian.</p>

<p>socialism and communism do not address or involve anything but economic liberation and economic class struggle based on combating the 1%&#39;s econo ic hegemo y and exploitation. any social/culutral identity/morality issues, like being pro-life or a pink pussy-hatter for instance, appended to either is like putting a flag pin on your lapel. it has nothing to do with your jacket.</p>

<p>anarchism is the abrogation of the state, the means of production, and property altogether. we&#39;ve been linked to distributive statism for going on 200 years, but we are closer to pro-property anti-statists (libertarians), than we are to them. </p>

<p>the four political quadrants:</p>

<p>aquistive statism (ecocomically liberal capitalism to neoliberal facism) (top right)</p>

<p>distributive statism (socialism to communism) (top left)</p>

<p>pro-property anti-satism (libertarianism) (bottom right)</p>

<p>anti-propery anti-statism (anarchism) (bottom left)</p>

<p>culture war affliations, both &quot;right&quot; and &quot;left&quot; (aside: restrictive/permissive, exclusive/inclusive are more accurate terms), are moral convictions/philosphies, not political orientations. </p>

<p>most believers in either camp are statist in their personal approach, demanding everyone do as they do, that everyone agree with them. </p>

<p>both right and left economic anti-statists are also morality/personal conviction anti-statists. we could care less what you believe so long as you don&#39;t impose it on anyone else. you can be a racist, but you cannot harm others because of it, for example.</p>

<p>we need to stop using terms incorrectly and imprecisely and stop falling into the purposefully divisive, simplistic false left/right dichotomy trap. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anarchism, then, really stands for the liberation of the human mind from the dominion of religion; the liberation of the human body from the dominion of property; liberation from the shackles and restraint of government. Anarchism stands for a social order based on the free grouping of individuals for the purpose of producing real social wealth; an order that will guarantee to every human being free access to the earth and full enjoyment of the necessities of life, according to individual desires, tastes, and inclinations</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you or anyone else manages to be elected mayor. In fact it actually makes the point more poignant. Because you, as Mayor, have no power, you will be controlled by someone who does have power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I honestly don&#39;t even know what to think anymore...
When I was a kid, everything seemed so black and white. Our votes don&#39;t seem to really count, so why bother wasting 15 minutes of my time doing it? I mean, I did it anyway, but I could understand why some folks didn&#39;t. In my youth, I couldn&#39;t conceive of a hidden hand that used man&#39;s hubris against them. Nefarious types couldn&#39;t possibly be capable of outsmarting us, could they?</p>

<p>Now with all the layered deceptions going on, it almost makes more sense that all these campaigns of complacency encouraging lackadaisical voters to stay home from the polls, is more of an attempt to just keep certain types of voters from showing up. Easier to control a person&#39;s actions, if you control their mind first. </p>

<p>Instead of having to take a biased test that caters to the 1% before being allowed to vote, they just plant their seeds of complacency, and let them spread like a cancer. </p>

<p>Like anything else though, that&#39;s just a theory. Regardless, I&#39;ll spend 15 minutes voting. If for no other reason than to do my part to prove beyond the shadow of a doubt how fucked the system is. I mean, if we all voted for one guy and the other guy wins, I can&#39;t help but feel it would at least spark some conversations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love George Carlin, but he was wrong on this. The money in politics doesn&#39;t grow massively every election because both parties are the same. It grows because the party of oligarchy keeps gaining more power over the &quot;opposition&quot; party -- while also gaining more control over the opposition party.</p>

<p>In fact, one of the dumbest things that too many people believe is &quot;both parties are the same.&quot; No two people are the same -- how is it even possible that both parties are the same? It&#39;s not. This is the theory.</p>

<p>Then, there are the real world facts. One party gave us retirement, disability, welfare, wage rights, worker protections, unemployment, etc., the other gave us virtually none of this, and actively works to take it <em>all</em> away.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no coincidence that a few billionaires spend huge amounts of money in elections, and especially since the <em>Citizens United</em> corporate speech case. </p>

<p>Except that its been consistently that way. When Democrats had control for long stretches, things improved in every area, especially economics. When Republicans had control, things slowed and even reversed. The current people make no secret that their goal is to tear down progress and bring us back to the 1920&#39;s or earlier. It&#39;s plain as day.</p>

<p>Too many smart people fervently <em>believe</em> something so dumb that a pre-schooler should know it. I can put it up a second time, but then people may either accept reality or reject it:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie takes a lot less corporate money than most politicians, but a lot of his &quot;no corporate money all small donors&quot; brand uses smoke and mirrors to make him look cleaner than he really is. </p>

<p>You know how he says his average donation is $27? It&#39;s not $27 per <em>donor</em>, it&#39;s per <em>donation</em>. So instead of having a rich person give him $2700, he had them give him $27 one hundred times. So his average &quot;donation&quot; would be small, but it was a gimmicked number. That&#39;s why he had <a href="http://docquery.fec.gov/pdf/847/201605100300045847/201605100300045847.pdf">so many FEC violations</a>, people would miscount and give him more than the legal amount of money by accident. All of those donations in that link are above the legal maximum.</p>

<p>And while it&#39;s true that Sanders takes less money from Wall Street specifically than is normal for a politician, it was <a href="http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-na-pol-sanders-donors/">still a good 2% of his haul</a>, with the healthcare industry being one of his big supporters.  </p>

<p>And while Sanders didn&#39;t have a Super PAC of his own, he was willing to take support from and endorse Super PACs that supported him, like the <a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/01/bernie-sanders-super-pac-218478">National Nurses United for Patient Protection</a> (1.3 million), Progressive Kick ($245k), or Reclaim Chicago ($150k) (Link is source for all three). Even if Sanders wasn&#39;t telling corporate donors to make a lot of little Super PACs instead of one big one so he&#39;d look to have more grassroots support than he did, he could&#39;ve done that (and the idea obviously occurred to him, because he was pushing his supporters to make multiple small donations)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I ran in a local election. I&#39;ve spoken with local representatives. There&#39;s far fewer lives being saved by local bureaucracy than threatened by it.

<p>The system was purposefully designed to be unresponsive to the needs of the constituents. A system designed to address those needs would involve direct democracy and direct action.</p>

<p>Representative democracy keeps the afflicted out of office and away from the legislative process. Hierarchies of executing that legislation make direct action illegal and prevent upwards persecution of corrupt politicians. </p>

<p>Let me say I love love love target shooting and plinking/blasting stuff, and have a small collection of neat firearms. </p>

<p>But </p>

<p>the idea that gun owners are a threat to the government is laughable. Things that actually could pose a threat, (Modern) Rocket launchers/manpads, bombs/explosives, machine guns, artillery, military aircraft, access to military intelligence, electronic signal jammers - are all prohibited. </p>

<p>Your pop gun militia with all your buddies wild firepower- including your custom AR15s, big bore revolvers, Weatherby rifles with the 60x scope ain’t jack shit when compared with a unit of military. </p>

<p>All of those things are fun to shoot, but it’s absolutely ignorant to think they’re some kind of protection against an authoritarian government. How’s your crew going to fare when an AH-64 sees you with night vision from 3miles away? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like how gerrymandering and voter fraud laws are making our votes count less? Yeah, basically. I&#39;ll be honest though, Trump kind of showed me how a thin margin of a few people can determine the fate of a nation. The way I see it, you lose more by not exercising voting than not voting at all, in the off chance that your vote might actually make a difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree w/ Carlin here thoroughly. He&#39;s actually dissuading from people being engaged in the democratic process.  VOTING MATTERS. If the 99% actually came out to vote, it wouldn&#39;t matter how much dark money the 1% pours into elections.</p>

<p>Carlin is actually promoting apathy, and that only emboldens the corrupt who already have too much power.</p>

<p>By the time a general election rolls around the slate&#39;s already been populated by the bought and paid for candidates.</p>

<p>The truth is our vote does matter.  The problem is lack of participation in the process and general apathy has resulted in about a 50% voter turnout in America.  Half the country has become so cynical they dont even participate and let themselves be rolled over.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I love carlin but he&#39;s simply wrong here.  Voting matters, just not as much as we&#39;d like.  It&#39;s a fairly unambiguous truth that a benevolent dictator is the best form a government, it&#39;s just that sort of system has no way of <strong>reliably</strong> perpetuating itself in perpetuity.  So the next best system is one take takes public opinion into &quot;consideration,&quot; but fundamentally a representative form of government recognizes that people do not possess the knowledge and expertise to conduct direct democracy themselves.  </p>

<p>Issues of corruption at least have the potential of being exposed, even within our own very flawed system of corporate news and new world order elite dreams, which is very much a 0.1% issue that they obsess over generation after generation.  The fact you as an individual do not find illegal immigration helpful to your own life, they honestly don&#39;t give a fuck.  They don&#39;t consider your tiny opinions to be serious enough to give much weight.</p>
