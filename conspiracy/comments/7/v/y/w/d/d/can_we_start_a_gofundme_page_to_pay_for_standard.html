       I really would love to see standard lenses accompanying the good old fisheye on board of rockets; however, unfortunately, the budget is quite tight, as I have been informed time and time again, thus they cannot provide us with standard view of our home planet. My tax farm American friends, let us give them more of our money so we get a chance to see our planet, from deep space, with standard lenses. Who is down for this?

       Well, your feelings are not correct. They're just feelings. Show me a standard lens view of my planet...or at least a big enough chunk of it to confirm the curve. I'm CERTAIN this is possible and doable in 2018. No?

       Prove it. Also, what are 'your own ideas'? Show me what ideas I am promoting besides the fact that I do not believe in NASA and SpaceX or any other central bank owned space program. My own ideas of what earth looks like? I do not have one. I do not subscribe to dome flat earth either. I simply reject your globe based on evidence and evidence of the ball earth that is nowhere to be found without the fisheye.

       I watched a live iss feed the other week for a couple of hours spaceman was out there fixing something on the ship there was no fish eye lens there man. Mentioned it in a comment apparently it's CGI to a flat earther. Take months and months to make a CGI video for a film like transformers etc.. but NASA can have this technology 24/7

       It is what it is. I know what is it not...a ball. I'm not a subscriber to dome flat earth. It is as outlandish as your globe. I believe the ocean is full of water, and water finds its level and takes the shape of its container. Furthermore, water makes up 75% of this 'planet', thus, it is safe to say, we are not on a ball. That is using common sense, but no, of course, we are too dumb for that.

       DIY. Get a weather balloon, attach a camera to it, fill it with helium, and set up some sort of system where it would take pictures every few seconds and post them on the net. Very simple, I don't know why Flat Earthers haven't done this yet. It's just one of a thousand simple experiments that can be performed to show the curvature of the Earth.

       Dude I actually own a secret space program. I'm coming out now to confirm that we have landed on the moon and it is actually flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       We did accidentally destroy all of our shuttles and telemetry data.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we did leave a reflector on the moon, but it's too small so you have to trust me unless you have a multimillion dollar laser. And even then, you don't know he location of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would go back in a nano second but it's too hard to build those ships back up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are going to make the ridiculous claim that I didn't land on the moon, you better have overwhelming evidence for that.

       If Usain Bolt claims that he can run 100m in less than 10s, it's not an extraordinary claim because we have thousands of videos of him doing it, and thousands eye witnesses who saw it with their own eye, and it's what top athletes can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, if I claim that I can run 100m in less than 10s, then I am making an extraordinary claim. And yet the claim looks exactly the same ! Bu there is no video of me, no witness, and it sounds pretty unlikely given the average performances of a human being.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you start to claim that Usain Bolt never ran any 100m in less than 10s, and say that all his videos are fake, and all eye-witnesses were paid by Puma for advertisement, then you are making an extraordinary claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you claim that I cannot run 100m in less than 10s, and that I'm lying, then you are not making an extraordinary claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, the same claim can be extraordinary or not depending on the person who makes the claim. In conclusion, your argument is not really good ...

       I get that fisheye captures more within the frame; however, it is still FISHEYE. Let us rig a regular, standard lens right next to that and see what it looks like. Put 5 of 'em in a row such that they capture a bigger view. Are you not at least interested/curious to know what it looks like without fisheye?

       Your post said to put standard lenses on the rocket. So what focal length would have in mind? 17mm like the human eye? or a more traditional 50mm like in stock lens kits. Maybe somewhere in between lets say 35mm.

       Put one of each, put 5 of each. Let them show us space with standard lens. Is that so damn hard to accomplish in 2018? I'm not the one charging the American tax payers an arm and a leg for space fakery. Charge us another arm and another leg, but please put a damn standard lens on board; a focal length that captures the most within a frame.

       You should've just googled it and said "50 mm." That's what's called a "normal lens" because (on an 8-perf camera) it has a field of view similar to the human eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, wider lenses are

       fisheye lenses. Fisheye lenses are

       lenses that produce a hemispherical or near-hemispherical lens. The stuff you're calling "fisheye" is not fisheye.

       The lens that distorts reality is a fisheye lens and we all know what it looks and feels like. You want to be specific, fine, that's great, but you know exactly what I mean.

       I'm sure it is as real. It is out there for us to see; however, it is not equal to NASA's CGI, artistic depictions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I love how they want to conquer Mars, yet the moon is right there in our vicinity...unconquered and untouched since their poor attempts at faking the 'moon landings.'

       "We'll need more of your money, sheeple. Here's CGI post LEO for confirmation of our space superiority. Isn't this CGI depiction of stage 2/3/4/5/6... all nice and dandy? Here's a 'thumbnail' for more confirmation. Are you not entertained!?"

       They tell me it is not 'cost effective' to put standard lens cameras on rockets because of 'payload.' Their budget is quite tight lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to look at it from a business perspective, it costs them less money to fake going to space, then to actually go to space. A huge sum of the money they'll probably spend on technologies that are being used against us as we speak. Perhaps a portion for hiring trolls and shills to defend them and fill in their blanks online; attacking people who question their bullshit and attempt  to kill their confidence, intuition, and common sense. The sad part is, many sheeple do this for FREE!

       Your post said to put standard lenses on the rocket. So what focal length would have in mind? 17mm like the human eye? or a more traditional 50mm like in stock lens kits. Maybe somewhere in between lets say 35mm.

       You should've just googled it and said "50 mm." That's what's called a "normal lens" because (on an 8-perf camera) it has a field of view similar to the human eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, wider lenses are
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       fisheye lenses. Fisheye lenses are
       <em>
        ultra-wide-angle
       </em>
       lenses that produce a hemispherical or near-hemispherical lens. The stuff you're calling "fisheye" is not fisheye.
