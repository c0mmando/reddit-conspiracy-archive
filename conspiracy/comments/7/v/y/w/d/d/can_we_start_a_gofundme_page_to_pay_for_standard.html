I believe the ocean is full of water, and water finds its level and takes the shape of its container. Furthermore, water makes up 75% of this &#39;planet&#39;, thus, it is safe to say, we are not on a ball. That is using common sense, but no, of course, we are too dumb for that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Usain Bolt claims that he can run 100m in less than 10s, it&#39;s not an extraordinary claim because we have thousands of videos of him doing it, and thousands eye witnesses who saw it with their own eye, and it&#39;s what top athletes can do.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if I claim that I can run 100m in less than 10s, then I am making an extraordinary claim. And yet the claim looks exactly the same ! Bu there is no video of me, no witness, and it sounds pretty unlikely given the average performances of a human being.</p>

<p>If you start to claim that Usain Bolt never ran any 100m in less than 10s, and say that all his videos are fake, and all eye-witnesses were paid by Puma for advertisement, then you are making an extraordinary claim.</p>

<p>If you claim that I cannot run 100m in less than 10s, and that I&#39;m lying, then you are not making an extraordinary claim.</p>

<p>In other words, the same claim can be extraordinary or not depending on the person who makes the claim. In conclusion, your argument is not really good ...</p>

<p>I get that fisheye captures more within the frame; however, it is still FISHEYE. Let us rig a regular, standard lens right next to that and see what it looks like. Put 5 of &#39;em in a row such that they capture a bigger view. Are you not at least interested/curious to know what it looks like without fisheye?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok. You want specifics...Good. Thank you for making that point.</p>

<p>Put one of each, put 5 of each. Let them show us space with standard lens. Is that so damn hard to accomplish in 2018? I&#39;m not the one charging the American tax payers an arm and a leg for space fakery. Charge us another arm and another leg, but please put a damn standard lens on board; a focal length that captures the most within a frame. </p>

<p>16-28.8mm. 35mm. Just put a standard lens on board!! lol</p>

<p>You should&#39;ve just googled it and said &quot;50 mm.&quot; That&#39;s what&#39;s called a &quot;normal lens&quot; because (on an 8-perf camera) it has a field of view similar to the human eye.</p>

<p>Similarly, wider lenses are <em>not</em> fisheye lenses. Fisheye lenses are <em>ultra-wide-angle</em> lenses that produce a hemispherical or near-hemispherical lens. The stuff you&#39;re calling &quot;fisheye&quot; is not fisheye.</p>

<p>Spend an hour on Wikipedia or something learning how lenses work. Unless you don&#39;t really care about this and you&#39;re just trolling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure it is as real. It is out there for us to see; however, it is not equal to NASA&#39;s CGI, artistic depictions. </p>

<p>I love how they want to conquer Mars, yet the moon is right there in our vicinity...unconquered and untouched since their poor attempts at faking the &#39;moon landings.&#39; </p>

<p>&quot;We&#39;ll need more of your money, sheeple. Here&#39;s CGI post LEO for confirmation of our space superiority. Isn&#39;t this CGI depiction of stage 2/3/4/5/6... all nice and dandy? Here&#39;s a &#39;thumbnail&#39; for more confirmation. Are you not entertained!?&quot;</p>

<p>They tell me it is not &#39;cost effective&#39; to put standard lens cameras on rockets because of &#39;payload.&#39; Their budget is quite tight lol. </p>

<p>If you want to look at it from a business perspective, it costs them less money to fake going to space, then to actually go to space. A huge sum of the money they&#39;ll probably spend on technologies that are being used against us as we speak. Perhaps a portion for hiring trolls and shills to defend them and fill in their blanks online; attacking people who question their bullshit and attempt  to kill their confidence, intuition, and common sense. The sad part is, many sheeple do this for FREE!</p>
