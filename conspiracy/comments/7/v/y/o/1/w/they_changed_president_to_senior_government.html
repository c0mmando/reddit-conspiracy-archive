It seems more likely the point was just to cost hillary votes, and they got that, and there wasn&#39;t anything done wrong about the laptop to resign over/leak</p>

<p>&quot;Clinton’s standing in the polls fell sharply. She’d led Trump by 5.9 percentage points in FiveThirtyEight’s popular vote projection at 12:01 a.m. on Oct. 28. A week later — after polls had time to fully reflect the letter — her lead had declined to 2.9 percentage points. That is to say, there was a shift of about 3 percentage points against Clinton&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Also forgot 30 years of unfounded republican smear campaigns that she had to endure. Smear tactics that would have certainly felled Bernie Sanders - aka socialist, aka not a democrat - had he somehow won the nomination. Who cares if he&#39;s had all the momentum? We all know the Republican Hate-Machine is impossible to overcome. Even Hillary Clinton couldn&#39;t defeat it, and she&#39;s the greatest!</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, the fault truly lies with people like me who chose to not vote for Hillary Clinton. The <em>reasons</em> are hardly worth exploring because there&#39;s no way to get inside a person&#39;s head and truly understand why would make such a self-destructive decision. I did, and I didn&#39;t really ask myself why, but now I understand that I was brainwashed by expertly crafted Russian propaganda, so I&#39;m actually a victim too. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s just stop the blame game. Point the finger at your fellow American and tell them they made the wrong choice. Tell them that they&#39;re what&#39;s wrong with America. Remember to call out not only that traitorous lot of Trump voters, but anyone who didn&#39;t vote for Clinton, because 2016 was <em>not</em> the year for protest votes. </p>

If it&#39;s an official draft, then we can easily connect the Strzok/Page text to the draft, then to the final Comey statement. But we&#39;re missing that middle link so all we can do is assume the texts are in reference to the Comey conference and I don&#39;t like assumptions.</p>

<p>Is the AP reporting on actual documents or Ron Johnson&#39;s report, which also makes assumptions about Comey&#39;s statement?</p>

<p>Moral equivalence is a form of equivocation and a fallacy of relevance often used in political debates. It seeks to draw comparisons between different, often unrelated things, to make a point that one is just as bad as the other or just as good as the other. It may be used to draw attention to an unrelated issue by comparing it to a well-known bad event, in an attempt to say one is as bad as the other. Or, it may be used in an attempt to claim one isn&#39;t as bad as the other by comparison. Drawing a moral equivalence in this way is a logical fallacy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Also forgot 30 years of unfounded republican smear campaigns that she had to endure. Smear tactics that would have certainly felled Bernie Sanders - aka socialist, aka not a democrat - had he somehow won the nomination. Who cares if he&#39;s had all the momentum? We all know the Republican Hate-Machine is impossible to overcome. Even Hillary Clinton couldn&#39;t defeat it, and she&#39;s the greatest!</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, the fault truly lies with people like me who chose to not vote for Hillary Clinton. The <em>reasons</em> are hardly worth exploring because there&#39;s no way to get inside a person&#39;s head and truly understand why would make such a self-destructive decision. I did, and I didn&#39;t really ask myself why, but now I understand that I was brainwashed by expertly crafted Russian propaganda, so I&#39;m actually a victim too. </p>

<p>So let&#39;s just stop the blame game. Point the finger at your fellow American and tell them they made the wrong choice. Tell them that they&#39;re what&#39;s wrong with America. Remember to call out not only that traitorous lot of Trump voters, but anyone who didn&#39;t vote for Clinton, because 2016 was <em>not</em> the year for protest votes. </p>
