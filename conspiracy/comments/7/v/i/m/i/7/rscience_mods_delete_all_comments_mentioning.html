       It is not surprising considering the gate-keeping, authoritarian nature of academia at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people don't want to hear about Graham Hancock because he isn't using their method of inquiry, and therefore is a lesser being than they. He could not possibly uncover truths that they don't accept as doctrine.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is rather unfortunate to watch, especially as a scientist.

       Just go watch that interview with Graham, Randal &amp; Michael to get an idea of what Graham's dealt with.  What kills me about Michael Shermer, is when he calls himself a skeptic but only points to mainstream science... That's not a skeptic by definition:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a person inclined to question or doubt all accepted opinions.

       For sure, same with "conspiracy', I've run into so many users who think once a conspiracy is revealed it isn't a conspiracy anymore.  They don't seem to understand It's the act of conspiring.

       It's funny how even as kids in school, we were taught about how there were always people who called people crazy under the exact same circumstances. People are so sure of themselves today. It's sad to hear the kind of language they use in these forums when they "debunk" 911 and other easily provable government conspiracies.

       . It was literally you saying pizzagate is real and politicians are corrupt +/yada yada, and better yet it was in a post about hypocrisy. Don't get me wrong, I actually agree 100% with that comment which is why I'm so surprised at what you're saying. Honestly it actually sounds like that thing where old accounts were being bought up and used to discredit conspiracies or for advertising or whatever. Seriously what is going on here...

       Firstly, your response is half the reason this sub is in such a poor state at the moment, in my humble opinion. I mention my opinion and you go on a rant accusing me of being a sold account or shill or whatever. Why are you so combative?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just my opinion, just like every comment here is just a person's opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll accept that rereading what I wrote, I wasn't clear: 
What I meant was proven or unproven conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       rather what I meant was if something is proven, it's not an unproven conspiracy... as such. I know that's poorly written: what I'm saying is if we had a smoking gun that 9/11 was a government/CIA orchestrated event, it would be as you put it "something that is true". Out would be a conspiracy proven to be true
      </p>
      <p>
       However, while doubt remains, "it's not easily provable" : then it's an unproven conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       My example: 2 criminals decide to embezzle. They leave no proven trace of evidence= a conspiracy. Potentially even named "conspiracy to commit..."
They leave evidence which can prove their guilt= not a conspiracy, a crime.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I 110% believe 9/11 was orchestrated by elements of the US government. But it's not been proven thus far. Hence it is an unproven conspiracy. A true conspiracy is the context of conspiracy theories, in the corrupted context the term has taken thanks to their CIA or whoever. I'm into unproven conspiracies, they're more fun.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I didn't search your user history, because I literally don't care. I take what every account says on face value and in context to the thread/conversation. In my opinion, it's a huge pat on the back from you to me, that i have differing opinions regarding differing topics. That's a huge problem with "society today" (digital society), people thinking they're all one side or the other. So, thank you.

       Just curious how much proof you need for a conspiracy to  to be proven? People accept have assed MSM news and science with a tenth of the proof 9/11 has. It's long since cross the boundary from conspiracy to conspirafact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Big issue here is conspiracy theories , even when well developed. Are almost never taken seriously by the authorities(usually because authorities are part and parcel of conspiracy theories) , pizza gate was a month in and not one law enforcement agency even glanced at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think we are hitting a point sadly where personal truth barometers are all people have to go by. There certainly isn't a trusted authority remaining (name one not embroiled in some type of controversy)

       I think you answered the question yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't matter how much evidence I need, it will still remain an unproven conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Terms like 'conspriafact' are just as demeaning to the truth seeking cause as the twisted meanings of the term conspiracy theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 is a perfect example where I'd assume 90% of this sub and around 50% of the population at large think that there was some level of government involvement, however until the 'silver-bullet' piece of evidence comes to light, it's an unproven conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sucks, but that's the world we live in. To believe I or anyone else, KNOWS the truth (besides the perpetrators of a particular conspiracy), is confirmation bias and a dangerous path in my opinion. Truth seeking means even questioning your own beliefs. Ask any religious person how difficult it is to truly question their own beliefs.

       But what if the silver bullet that proves beyond doubt, is never acted upon? That's where we are at with many conspiracies today. When the people who are CONSPIRING are in control,  shouldn't you question why these lingering questions never get answered? Like you say , half or more of the American citizens have alternate beliefs about the events of 911.. the commission reports, engineering reports etc, all counter MSM storyline.  Yet... court cases are blocked, war crimes tribunals are not set up. Noone has ever answered for any of the NSA or CIA bullshit... actually
      </p>

       While I'm thinking of CIA, have you not ever viewed their FOIA room? They literally confirm dozens upon dozens of conspiracies in there. They released like 16 millllion documents in 2016/2017 . Conspirafact isn't a buzzword, it's a name for theories that  are beyond doubt... consider the recent recognition of Canadian mk ultra victims as a example, but feel free to look at the court proceedings yourself. Conspiracies happen everyday...

       I'm not disagreeing that plenty of conspiracies are true, just that we ourselves can't just say, "This happened" and accept it as fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all simply look at the evidence presented and have our own opinion on what occured.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the truth of being a conspiracy theorist, we will never (Or at best very rarely) get emotional closure in the form of disclosure.

       You’ve perfectly stated my biggest issue with the “skeptic” movement. Why are all these skeptics fighting fringe theories and just outright accept mainstream science? Yes, there is evidence backing much of mainstream science, but there’s literally zero attention aimed toward mainstream science from the skeptic community.

       I'll tell you, as someone who's kicked rocks around this place for years, it's the fake conspiracy theorists that show up pushing their agends.  Let me preference this, I'm not a fan of Trump, but regardless the 'skeptics' that show up telling me I need to swallow Trump Russia story the MSM has been pushing is laughable... Especially when you ask further questions, heres my rendition of what I have encountered:
      </p>
      <p>
       U: You can't recognized the biggest conspiracy to ever exist?
      </p>
      <p>
       Kit8642: what's your thoughts on Bilderberg?
      </p>
      <p>
       U: It's just a meeting of people, what's the big deal?
      </p>
      <p>
       Kit8642: What's your opinion of Syria?
      </p>
      <p>
       U: What? Are you an Assad supporter?
      </p>
      <p>
       Kit8642: What do you think of 9/11?
      </p>
      <p>
       U: Osama Bin Laden got what he diserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kit8642: What makes you think OBL was at that compound?
      </p>
      <p>
       U: Because That's what the media reported!
      </p>
      <p>
       Kit8642: What do you think of Bush?
      </p>
      <p>
       U: What do you mean? He was so much better than Trump!
      </p>

       Yup. They make it very obvious too. My personal favorite interaction from them is when they make a claim that you know is false and when you ask them for sources, they just say “I’m not going to research for you.” Happens nearly every time.

       Or the, "There is 4 indictments, how don't you buy it!".  I literally (and can source) 2 days in a row I asked swjpussy about Gate &amp; Manafort and how their indictments were from 2013 on laundering money from Ukraine as lobbyists with Tony Podesta some how related to Trump.  Straight crickets, but sure enough, next days was saying the same shit.

       Yours and the post you responded to demenstate exactly why mainstream science works and why Shermer and skepticism are good ways understand reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shermer is skeptic of ideas that havnt been thoroughly vetted. The years of vetting main stream science does to new ideas if what makes mainstream understanding so strong.

      <p>
       But even the idea that have been vetted can still be wrong.  To me, the general idea behind science should be disapproving ideas.  But the way It's used now is to standardized belief.  For instance, a couple years ago it was revealed that most pharama tester were only on males (because their hormones were more stable).  That alone should make anyone question the medical/science standard, especially if You're a female.  Just saying, when someone presents an idea as fully vetted and basically the bible of science, I scoff at it, because I persoanlly think someone could find why they are wrong in a couple years.

       This is very true. I call this new dogma "scientism." It basically brainwashes people into accepting authority and shaming and labeling those who dare step out of line.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the very antithesis of science, something that most Critical Thinking Skeptics™ conveniently ignore. Group think is addicting, as is feeling superior to "those ignorant people."

       I was thinking/speculating about this last night, how reddit is one of the best platforms for group think.  I was specifically thinking about r/politics and how it's a perfect big mind control sub for the kids coming up and It's why you don't see topics like surveillance, humble foriegn policy, and so on discussed over there.  And if you propose those ideas, you are hammered with downvotes to created the groupthink that those topics are stupid to talk about.

       Evolution does not come from limitations. We as a society have been dormant for far too long! We need to remove these restrictions on our perspective and our mind. I hope the revelation of the comet can finally make people know that it is our time to know. It is our time to shine in the light of knowledge, all knowledge. For those that keep us ignorant are destroying everything and everyone!!!!

       This whole thing seems analogous to heretical ideas I've encountered in the last year regarding contemporary astronomy, which are truly fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       As others have said elsewhere down thread, in another world, these ideas could be considered 'Skeptical', but not in this one, where a 'Skeptic' is one who upholds the status quo from anomalous evidence / new directions of inquiry.

       I know people who knew nothing of Graham Hancock until his Ted X talk.  When the buzz about his talk being hidden it led to people looking at his body of work and digging deeper, Streisand Effect works.  If the idea is to bury the work it is too late, and I hope r/science actions lead to more people critically thinking about Hancock's work.

       Its certainly not a pharaoh. Have you seen it in real life? I have and the head is way too small for the body and has obviously been reshaped. Egyptians were very very good artists and its unlikely to be made like that. Whether it a lion or not is a different matter. The body is certainly feline

       I want to upvote you for mentioning that the sphinx has been reshaped (from Anubis the dog, as it points at Sirius "the dog star" during the equinox), but I disagree with calling Graham a gatekeeper. He comes off as a very honest person who's simply come to his conclusions based on the evidence he's seen, as most people do. Have you got any links to where he talks about the Sphinx before it was reshaped though? Because I haven't heard much from him on that apart from something I heard a while ago in passing, so I know I could do with a mental refresher anyway.

       He definitely comes off as honest, but the Sphinx... man that's a huge, HUGE mistake which completely throws off our understanding of history and astrophysics. I think he's one of those 90% truth / 10% deception guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have any links but I remember him (on several occasions) dating the age of the Sphinx by estimating when it would have been facing Leo. I mean come on -- that passes for science??

       Hancock is completely irrelevant to the "establishment" (do you mean actual scientists by that?), and it's the actual academics that came up with the theory and found the evidence that supports it.

       Why are you focusing on him and giving zero credit to the actual scientists?
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to the U of A where a lot of the theories about the mass extinction were being researched.  The black mat is all over Arizona, as was Clovis culture:

       And who mocks Graham Hancock?  I don't understand why this has to do with GH at all just because he liked the idea.  I never even knew he supported the ET impact theory (and that's after reading a lot on it) until this sub exploded about him today.

       Marc Defant was one of the scientists who attacked Hancock. Quite unfairly too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hancock received the worst of it because he isn't in the scientific mainstream and doesn't have the label of academic to protect him. No one is saying that the researchers don't deserve credit. That's solely an assumption you are making about what people are saying.

        Let's see what he has to say about Hancock, shall we?

      <p>
       Oh look! He criticizes Hancock for his claims about lost civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       He dos mention the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis and correctly points out that the matter was not scientifically concluded yet (even though he obviously was not a supoprter of the hypothesis at that point".
      </p>
      <p>
       In his own words: "...the reason the YDIH extraordinary claim has yet to find consensus is that extraordinary evidence has yet to emerge to support it. To be clear, the debate is not over lost civilizations."
      </p>
      <p>
       So, Hancock piggybacked his unproven and pseudoscientific idea about a lost civilization on the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis after for decades claiming that the civilization got lost because of catastrophic pole shifts.

       How would you differentiate him from a kook who latches onto many fringe ideas and then attempts to cash in when one turns out, through other's original research, to be true? Keep in mind there are large numbers of such kooks so it should be expected that one is noticeably right about something every few years.

       From your own link. It was not an accepted hypothesis whatsoever. 
Other research has shown no support for the impact hypothesis. One group examined carbon-14 dates for charcoal particles that showed wildfires occurred well after the proposed impact date, and the glass-like carbon was produced by wildfires and no lonsdaleite was found.[47] Analysis of fluvial sediments on Santa Rosa Island by another group also found no evidence of lonsdaleite, impact-induced fires, or extraterrestrial impact.[28]
      </p>
      <p>
       Research published in 2012 has shown that the so-called "black mats" are easily explained by typical earth processes in wetland environments.[6] The study of black mats, that are common in prehistorical wetland deposits which represent shallow marshlands, that were from 6000 to 40,000 years ago in the southwestern USA and Atacama Desert in Chile, showed elevated concentrations of iridium and magnetic sediments, magnetic spherules and titanomagnetite grains. It was suggested that because these markers are found within or at the base of black mats, irrespective of age or location, suggests that these markers arise from processes common to wetland systems, and probably not as a result of catastrophic bolide impacts.[

       Yes, that was 10 years ago.  The big to-do at the time was they didn't like Firestone's evidence of the ET event, and there were a lot of papers against his use of nano-diamonds and microspherules in the black mat to prove it:
       <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016.short">

       I've seen Vance Haynes give a bunch of talks on the subject.  The problem wasn't that they were so opposed to a possible ET event for the YD.  As Haynes put it - "we all know SOMETHING happened".  He thought that Firestone's data wasn't enough to prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only am showing you this to show that there have been a lot of researchers working on this for decades.  Haynes was the first one to find the black mats and that was in the 60s with the Murray Springs kill site:

       I read Fingerprint of the Gods in HS, so I'm not that familiar with Hancock's work.  He is good at pulling together different ideas an making a story, I remember enjoying his book.  But that wouldn't pass peer-review.  You need cold hard facts, not just circumstantial evidence.  The latest data that supports the ET impact for the YD onset is high levels of Pt associated with YD deposits:

       And this latest article linked today which shows evidence of  biomass burning:

       Where's Hancock's evidence?  Because all I see in this sub is him getting credit for what he had nothing to do with.  I don't think even he would agree with that.

       No one is giving him sole credit for anything. It's you that's inferring that. Like it or not, Graham has been talking and writing about this theory for decades and was ridiculed by mainstream scientists for it. Some of us have been following his lectures and such for years, and this vindicates him.

       I didn't mean they were exclusively his theories or that he came up with them. But they
       <em>

       his theories in the sense that he believes them. You're trying to misconstrue the ambiguous nature of language to misrepresent what everyone here is talking about.

       Hancock had plenty to do with popularizing it. If he didn't have something to do with it, why did
       <em>

       many people bring him up?

       I'm pretty neutral on GH.  I actually really liked watching him on Rogan's podcast.  I read one of his books, but a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for me who has been following the ET impact/TD onset theories for the last 10 years, I don't think it's appropriate to bring up GH on a science sub.  He added absolutely nothing to that debate. Plus r/science is focused on peer-reviewed science, not popular books.

       A comet was one of the theories he proposed in the book. After the book, he gave many lectures covering this hypothesis. People on conspiracy subs have been talking about this for over a decade.

       Dude, not even GH claims it is his theory:

       </a>

      <p>
       People have been kicking around that theory a long time, mostly because a lot of people didn't think overhunting could explain the megafaunal extinction. The first one to try to prove it was Firestone (who Graham Hancock cites).

       You're not getting what's being said. He has been consistent about this theory for nearly two decades despite ridicule, and when as shown even in one of your own links, the theory had been "debunked."

       1 - you claim it is his theory, it was not.
2 - he hasn't supported this theory for two decades.  He used to think it was a pole shift, not an ET event.  That is not consistent.
3 - the article I posted was to show that this debate has been going on a long time, without Graham Hancock.  If you read the article, they aren't debunking the ET impact theory, they are debunking Firestone claiming he proved it with his analysis of the black mat.

       That's because you're more worried about "proving me wrong" and avoiding giving graham even an ounce of credit because he's not a "mainstream scientist' than actually reading and processing what I'm actually saying.

       My not giving him credit for the ET impact theory is because he has added absolutely nothing to prove it. So he deserves no credit for that. I've explained that to you multiple times as well.  Being a "mainstream scientist" has nothing to do with it.

       I'm pretty sure he meant it as Hancock put forward the idea for discussion, not that he originated it. If you're going to quibble over his word usage instead of what he was

       In the sciences if you say you "propose" a theory is is that you came up with it and are putting it forward.  Maybe he didn't mean it that way, but that is how it is typically used for hypotheses.

       Cool cool. Maybe he's not a scientist though and didn't know that. By harping on a point he's not making, you're not convincing him (or anyone else actually). It doesn't matter if he used the word wrong. What matters is what he meant.

       This is why I hate academia, they think without their blood stamp on a college degree that you're rendered incapable of doing real science.  When hilariously the best scientists in history are awarded honorary degrees they never took a class for so that they have credentials to then teach people.

       "Of course"? How is anyone who is not a scientist, or prospective scientist, to know this if they have not submitted? I've read your other posts in this thread, and it would be nice if you toned it down a bit. Specifically, the very obvious indignation pouring from your language toward those who are unaware of the facts you're bringing. Few people have even heard of any of these things. Please don't be surprised when people are unaware. If you're actually looking to educate anyone, rather than simply prove yourself right, you might want to keep this in mind. Just a thought.

       Not exactly offensive, but presumptuous. You started your points by throwing shade on the very person responsible for introducing alternative theories on these mysteries to large segments of the population. I understand, and agree with, the need to give credit to whom it is due. Graham Hancock is a writer, journalist, and popularizer in the same sense that Carl Sagan was. Though he often spoke of it, Sagan did not discover biological evolution or microwave background radiation, yet he spoke authoritatively on the subjects and produced plausible conclusions of his own. I will accept your point, however, that it would benefit him and others to mention who did the prior research that made their theories possible. I am asking that you not "throw the baby out with the bathwater".

       Hancock didn't add anything to the ET impact theory for YD onset/megafuanal extinction.  He heard about it and incorporated it into his own theories, which are unrelated.  Archaeologists finding evidence to support ET impact does not vindicate Hancock at all.

       Sagan was never given credit for such a thing, correct. Now who gives Graham credit for "ET theory"? I heard you say that the first six times. And I've never heard anyone say such a thing, until now. I have never heard anyone credit him with the origination of any of his data, nor him
       <em>
        accept
       </em>
       credit for being the
       <em>
        first

       Also, I don't know what those acronyms mean. Can you spell them out so everyone is not in the dark with the shop talk? Typing "ET theory" into google is worthless. That is to say, to quote my previous comment, "if you're actually looking to educate anyone."

       The whole point of this post is to say that Graham Hancock has been vindicated for his theories.  It's in the title.
      </p>
      <p>
       For what I'm talking about - for a very long time it's been known that the mammoths and other megafauna went extinct during a mini ice-age called the Younger Dryas (YD).  Since the 60s what archaeologists saw - especially in Arizona, where there is a lot of study of Clovis/mammoth hunting - was that the YD is a dark dense layer, what they call the 'black mat' (the dark thin layer):
       <a href="http://www.scientificpsychic.com/etc/carolina-bays/black-mat.jpg">
        http://www.scientificpsychic.com/etc/carolina-bays/black-mat.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Mammoths
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       occur after the black mat. So for decades people have been speculating about this. It is such a distinct geological time frame when mammoths go extinct, the early theories that megafaunal extincti on was only due to overhunting didn't make sense (if it were, you'd expect variation in when extinction occurred).  There were tons of theories - disease, the climate change itself alone - as well as the possibility that a comet (or an extraterrestrial impact - ET) was the cause of the YD and megafaunal extinction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Researchers have been looking for a smoking gun to link YD/megafaunal extinction to the ET theory.  Firestone was the first to publish:
       <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016">
        http://www.pnas.org/content/104/41/16016
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       But, a lot of archaeologists thought his evidence was crappy.  Not because they were adverse to the ET theory so much, as they didn't think he he actually proved it and his data wasn't reproducible.  The best evidence is so far is the finding of platinum in the black mat layer (or YD in general, it doesn't always look like a black mat):
       <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44031">
        https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44031
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This post is in reference to a more recent study that showed evidence of biomass burning in ice cores samples, further supporting ET impact.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway, this whole tale is just to show mainstream science wasn't trying to suppress these theories or anything - it was one of the main alternatives to overhunting.  And also, all of this has nothing to do with Hancock.

       Ah, very good. That sheds a hell of a lot of light on everything. ET = extraterrestrial impact. YD = Younger Dryas. Thank you for explaining. Until recently, I had never really questioned the "hunted into extinction" theory. In fact, a few years back, I wrote a poem as part of a larger work about paleolithic hunters causing the extinction of mammoths. Recently revised to introduce it as "mythological".

       Well, overhunting has to have played a role.  Actually there are still some other things they don't have neat answers to - like the fact that a lot of megafauna were going extinct even before the YD.  So your poem is still valid ;)

       Good to know, much thanks. Another question: In your opinion, does the glacial-era overhunting compare to present-day wildlife reduction? If so, are there any comparisons we can draw?

       I really have no idea, I've not read anything on it.  I know there is a lot of work that's been done on modeling wildlife populations and effects of hunting but they are usually focused on trying to understand ancient cultures, I don't know of any that have tried to compare it to today. I'm sure there is probably some research related, especially with sustainability being a hot topic.

       You don't need a college degree, just an affiliation to an accredited institution, clear lab membership, well known past authorship, and if you don't you need a few well known scientific advisors on the paper, just to get it looked at, much less accepted. Yup no degree REQUIRED...

       He is dismissed as nonsense because none of his claims are testable.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an example of something being testable:
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple experiment on special relativity, something Tetryonics claims to disprove:
      </p>
      <p>
       I fly a satellite around the earth at high velocity. It has a clock. By knowing the speed of the satellite as it orbits, and using the equations for time dilation given by special relativity, I can predict how many milliseconds the clock will be off. I can predict it will be off because special relativity predicts that time slows down the faster an object moves, and also provides an equation to calculate how much slower.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you perform this experiment in real life, the results should match the prediction or special relativity is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a lay person who has no specialized knowledge of special relativity, yet even I can form a testable experiment to prove or disprove special relativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       you know more about Tetryonics than me, so show me an experiment in the real world that has results that can only be explained with the principles of Tetryonics.

       You misunderstand the entire thing and took the strawman position of it "disproves general relativity" it's like saying it disproves "electricity" and then go on to explain how electricity is measured in amps. It doesn't disprove time dilation, it explains it in a way that incorporates all the fundamental forces.  The misunderstanding comes from  the misapplication of lorrentz contraction to objects with Matter, where in reality this should only apply to mass and waves. You have to think that all Matter has waves (black body radiation) surrounding it (think of a boat with wakes, like this
       <a href="https://youtu.be/WIyTZDHuarQ">
        https://youtu.be/WIyTZDHuarQ
       </a>
       ), currently we apply the contraction to the whole thing, boat included. 
It doesn't disprove  any observed experiments at all, it explains things like dark matter and dark energy which current theories are unable to, it also explains gravity on a quantum level, which current theories are unable to, and quantum entanglement in a much more intuitive manner.
The inherent misunderstanding comes from the belief Tetryonics "disproves" current experiments, it doesn't. And yes it predicts observable phenomena that can be found in data from CERN, just noone has looked for the specific signal. It predicts a whole host of observables as well, including observed phenomena like ball lightning.

       Kelvin already has created ball lightning (albeit more as a byproduct during energy conversion than intentionally). I'm not an electrical engineer so i took a different approach to "proving", being a computational biologist I decided to build biological molecules from the ground up, something that no theory of physics can currently do, you're welcome to go check out what i've made so far. The simulations involving 2D waves are a bit more complicated due to the intricacies of overlapping 2D planar fields and how current graphics engines treat them, but i'm working on it.

       You're confusing the speed of electricity with the speed of light... You can transfer information FASTER than the speed of light, and that's what was measured by Charles Wheatstone, the measured speed wheatstone got was never "debunked", but if your goal is to measure the speed of light more accurately (sorry i dont know how to put snarky italics in my comments), you will do that more accurately with better devices, as you pointed out.

       The man attempted to explain how such destruction could pass.
      </p>
      <p>
       We shouldn't look to how this one event occurred. It could be a systematic failure. Randal talked about how flash melting of the glaciers caused weight displacement, the destruction from the earth recompensating weight would look alot like "pole shift theory". As north america decompressed and rose it caused other landmass to sink.

       Hancock doesn't really make that claim. If you read his latest book, he places the meteor hypothesis in the context of flood myths all over the world. In this context it is true that he brings up the myth of Atlantis, as a submerged island society fitting the dating described by Plato, as well, but he does not state "Atlantis existed and meteoric disruption caused it to drown."

       They haven't even found a single tool at Gobekli Tepe and Yonaguni Monument is 150 feet below the sea. Don't spread misinformation.

       You don't know the nature of the technology that was lost.  Maybe the tools are there and we dont recognize them for what they are.  Looking for tools you would recognize is not a good starting point.

       Yeah... That's not totally true. While
       <em>
        some

       of his critics cite that as the discrepancy but let me tell you, bringing up GH's work anywhere outside of this sub and a few others will get you lambasted for bringing it around because GH "has been proven wrong by the mainstream consensus."

       Sadly some people don't care about the information as much as telling people how wrong they are.

       You should check out "The Master Game". Pretty interesting departure from his more normal stuff. Oh, and "Supernatural", which I always describe as the bravest book ever written, by a guy that's always been on the fringe of credibility.

       There appears to be some pesky evidence that a somewhat advanced civilazation existed 12-13000 years ago. Sove very advanced buildings that carbon date to that period have been excavated in Turkey and other parts of the world. The Sphinx in Egypt may date to that era also.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to mainstream anthropology, Humans were still in the hunter/gatherer stage. Having advanced buildings that far back turns the current model upside down - hence the establishment resistance.

       Plenty of discoveries have challenged Christianity before but they always manage to stick around. Evolution, the age of the earth being more that 6000 yrs, Egyptian paid workers building the pyramids not slaves, and even the discovery that there is no firmament around earth. I don't think this is enough to end religion.

       It was the tower of babel ,which upon its completion, everyone in the world spoke 1 united language. Since the god of the bible is extremely wrathful and vengeful, he puts and end to it. The tower was supposedly where Babylon was, which is now Iraq, and was called Etemenanki. Tower of babel story is in genesis, i believe..

       Which interpretation is that from? Also, replenish doesn't mean "re-establish advance societies." But the most important part is where the term replenish came from since the original wasn't written in English and the English was translated from the translation of a translation.

       It's from King James. I understand how the various translations can bastardize the meanings of the original text, anyway. I'm not saying this is necessarily correct; I'm just providing an example. I remembered this one specifically because Randall Carlson mentioned it during one of his podcasts with Joe Rogan. I would say that replenish does imply a return of something, but then again, maybe it's not the right word at all.

       While I could point to the Tower of Babel, I'd rather not push that as "The Bible directly and clearly supports hyper-advanced civilizations." Rather, I called it a hypothesis because it's a proposed extrapolation of (particularly pre-flood) biblical history.

       The religious always find a way to justify their beliefs, this will be no different.

       In fact, that's sort of the issue in academia. Beyond just being a point of pride, this discovery invalidates
       <em>
        decades
       </em>
       of some of these people's careers. Because academics don't have the luxury of saying "it's open to interpretation" like the religious do, it's just easier for them to pretend the inconvenient information doesn't exist than it is to accept it and throw away everything they've worked on in the past. It's very anti-intellectual, but also very human.

       That seems oddly rigid in comparison to science where it's all just theories and (as far as I'm aware) it's widely accepted that a lot of things that we take for granted are still just theories based on all currently available evidence, but open to change if proved wrong. Why can't archeology/anthropology/history be the same? If some new evidence comes to light, re-evaluate the existing model to fit with the updated kmowledge

       It's possible, but a lot of the people who try to discredit Hancock are in the scientific community. It's hard for me to imagine their main goal is preserving religion like that, they usually have lots of disagreements with fundamental religious folk as well. It's not completely out of the question though.

       30 years ago Graham Hancock wrote a great book Finger Prints of the Gods where he examined ancient megalithic sites and stories and revealed that many of them are way too sophisticated to be built by the supposed levels civilization had achieved yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       He supposed that civilization did not progress in a linear fashion, but that our progress had risen quite far and was somehow "reset" back to almost stone age levels some 13,000 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many megalithic site have that date of 13,000 years ago encoded into them.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We are a species with amnesia."
      </p>
      <p>
       He was harshly ridiculed for decades with critics main argument being that there is no evidence that megalithic construction that old and no evidence for the cataclysm that reset humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then not long back Gobekli Tepe was discovered to be a megalithic site 13,000 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now the second part, the cataclysm, has been confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Academia does not seem to want to consider that humanity's progression might not be linear. That we were once perhaps as sophisticated as we are today, but fell.
      </p>
      <p>
       And just maybe, the are entire chapters of advanced civilizations lost to us.

       I don't know if the argument is that we were once sophisticated as today but he is suggesting that there was a roman level or slightly higher, (think 1800s style steam engines and beginning to understand complex properties about the world like electricity) that was founded on a coast line around southern europe ("Atlantis"). He thinks this civilization was wiped out by a cataclysmic event, and they have strong evidence of an event (comet hitting the water near western coast of europe) that fits the timeline and location.

       We're just getting to the point where we could either confirm or refute an ice-age civilization.  Any significant remnants of such a thing would necessarily be under a hundred feet of sea water.

       I remember hearing him say that we weren't advanced as in the same way we are today, but rather advanced as if we simply went down a different path. Like we'd have had advanced knowledge of science and technology, but it was simply gotten to and applied differently.

       His ideas about lost advanced technology type stuff starts before Fingerprints. His first book on any sort of non-mainstream thought (afaik) was The Sign and the Seal, which although wildly speculative, discusses evidence suggesting the removal the ark of the covenant from Jerusalem to its eventual, and (at the time it was written) current place of rest in a church in the Ethiopian capital Axum.
      </p>
      <p>
       As well as tracking the timeline and route the ark is believed to have taken, he goes into some detailed analysis of the stories of the ark, and the properties and fats attributed to it when Moses coming down from the mountain literally glowing and reddened and its use as a weapon making it sound like whatever was in it was at the very least HIGHLY radioactive and maybe some kind of 'death ray' akin to how it's portrayed at the me of raiders of the lost ark.

       What if we found evidence suggesting that making was once a unified species? That would let people know that we can once again become one.

      <p>
       Instead, were fed the notion that we're all inherently violent.

       Do you mean 'unified species' vs me saying 'one species'? Unified implies singular. Unified species implies we are all one species. I'm not sure what meaning I lost.

       Science vs science. One is incredibly concerned with distancing themselves from anything that's not anthropocentric, and therefore hinting at a higher being due to the historical context of how Science came about, they were very worried about distancing themselves from the church (for good reason) as much as they could.

       The scientific method is just a series of rules for how to carry out observations of the world. It is a process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Science is also an industry and academic pursuit. The scientists who use science in industry and academics are organized into groups. These organizations are entities.
      </p>

       The process of science encourages constant re-evaluation. The organizations made up of fallible people resist new information that doesn't fit with their preconceived notions.

       Everyone does seem to still be bringing up some of his relevant points like Gobekli Tepe but it's horrifying they're actively trying to keep Hancock away from modern "Science". To me it's undoubtedly his views on reality and use of psychedelics (in addition to his archaeological beliefs) that have made him a target, he's a kook to any self respecting materialist reductionist who listens to Sam Harris so his personality lands him in the trash folder. This isn't just reddit though, lets not forget the famous TED disaster he had with Rupert Sheldrake.

       Yes, that is exactly what happened. They lost those construction methods because the Spanish conquistadors killed all their leaders and destroyed all their records. It didn't help that the Inca empire was in the middle of a civil war when the Spanish came. The Spaniards were able to exploit these existing divisions to conquer the Inca extremely quickly.

       True! For a second I thought you were talking about the Aztecs because I'm far more familiar with their fate but after a wiki visit you make a good point.  My only point I guess would be the narrow timeline in which things like Sacsayhuaman were built: Inhabited in the 9th century, first structures built 11th century and all of the real peculiar features in the 13th by the Inca
       <a href="https://www.peru.travel/Portals/_default/Images/News/sacsayhuaman_valle_sagrado_03_max.jpg">
        (namely the transition to
        <strong>
         massive
        </strong>
        blocks with skew geometric joints)
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       While less than a century before:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Inca people began as a tribe in the Cusco area around the 12th century AD. Under the leadership of Manco Cápac they formed the small city-state of Cusco Quechua Qosqo.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It just seems silly (to me) that tribal folk who may have had advanced knowledge of medicinal herbs and astrology could start building structures like that within one hundred years of forming (and only 200 years before their collapse).

       I'm agreeing with him, lots of my points are straight out of Magcians of the Gods. The canonical view of this 'Incan" architecture is that the most impressive structures were all built in the first 200 years after transitioning from Hunter/gatherer and in the next 300 it significantly degraded.

       No one wants to say it but it's because both of those subreddits are run by left-leaning mods. Authoritarian moderation seems to come with the territory. Try posting anything that contradicts your typical left-wing understanding of human biology. The comments will be fine, but the mods always step in.

       Nope, humans to quantem science and reality. The time between destruction events seems to point to an cyclus within a cyclus.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quantem mechanics tells us that all particles are always in motion. could it not be our world and all on it are part of a cycle within a bigger cycle? Coincidently enough just as is told by many ancient sources and religions.

       I do not follow and part of that is that I'm not fully up to date on quantum research. My understanding is that (at least in the double split experiment) an observer was required to cause a wave collapse essentially forcing the particle to pick one path. What is this about a cyclus within a cyclus?

       The cycle within the cycle is mentioned in ancient calanders like the sumerian or maian ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       It looks like there is a circa 13.000 year short cycle within a 26.000 year larger one. And propably the shorter one is also dived into smaller cycles but i am not fully invested in this topic, it is just something i came by while re-searching something else.

       I literally left that 'r/science post' that hit front page yesterday open with ctrl+f to graham, just because I thought the conversations around it would be interesting to a lot of people. Yesterday there were already 10+ mentions, and some people hearing for the first time of his work/interesting theories etc. I was alittle excited, to be honest. Went back today and hit refresh to barely find 1 hit, and only if I filtered a certain way. Safe to say they want nothing to do with conversation over there.

       Science in modern times has become corupt. It has become it's own religion in much the same way scientists in Galileos time refused to look through his telescope. 
No one should be surprised that Graham Hancock is vindicated as he has done the research. Nor should anyone be surprised that there are forces in the word that wish to cling to creationist and Darwinian theories for their livelihoods.

       I use to like Graham until I heard him basically have mental breakdowns anytime Michael Shermer questioned him on JRE.  I expected better from him, but sadly I think his attitude is what causes him the most problems with mainstream scientist. If you can't handle your theories being vigorously question then you are a fraud in my eyes.

       Not everything he's saying is being accepted, I still think even the suggestion that the Ark of the Covenant is real is laughable and probably the sort of thing people turn to when accusing Graham of being a hack/snake oil salesman etc however it fucks me off when people use this to attack him as a person rather than his ideas.

       We'll his fascination with the numerously time debunked John Anthony west, constantly using him as a source when he's nothing more than a science fiction writer is another negative for me. 
I've read ALL of his books and was sucked in, now I feel like a sucker. I understand he has super fans, I was one but that doesn't make him correct on everything.

       I don't think he's correct on everything. That was the point of my comment. But if someone is doing something valuable, you don't have to reject that valuable work over some other disagreement. Nobody is perfect and nobody is ever going to agree with you 100%.

       Its certainly not a pharaoh. Have you seen it in real life? I have and the head is way too small for the body and has obviously been reshaped. Egyptians were very very good artists and its unlikely to be made like that. Whether it a lion or not is a different matter. The body is certainly feline

       No one is giving him sole credit for anything. It's you that's inferring that. Like it or not, Graham has been talking and writing about this theory for decades and was ridiculed by mainstream scientists for it. Some of us have been following his lectures and such for years, and this vindicates him.

       I want to upvote you for mentioning that the sphinx has been reshaped (from Anubis the dog, as it points at Sirius "the dog star" during the equinox), but I disagree with calling Graham a gatekeeper. He comes off as a very honest person who's simply come to his conclusions based on the evidence he's seen, as most people do. Have you got any links to where he talks about the Sphinx before it was reshaped though? Because I haven't heard much from him on that apart from something I heard a while ago in passing, so I know I could do with a mental refresher anyway.

       None of those things are true.  I've published without them, you do realize that people in industry publish, right?  They aren't in accredited institutions.

       Haha, basically the standard top comment during the Snowden leak "If you didn't know the Goverment was doing this, you were living under a rock"... which the government lied about every week, and then Glenn would release more showing they lied.

       You're going to have to clarify your question (and probably add some sources) if you want a better answer.
