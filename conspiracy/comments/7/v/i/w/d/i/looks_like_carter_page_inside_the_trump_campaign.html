<p>In March 2016 Carter Page Was an FBI Employee – In October 2016 FBI Told FISA Court He’s a Spy…
Posted on February 5, 2018  by sundance
In 2013 Carter Page was working as an under-cover employee (UCE) of the FBI, helping them to build a case against “Evgeny Buryakov”.  In March 2016 Carter Page remained their informant pre-trial. [Note – Pay attention to the names in the following citations]</p>

<p>Sources:  ♦ In 2013 the U.S. Department of Justice, Southern District of New York, announced an indictment against a Russian Operative Evgeny Buryakov.  LINK HERE In March of 2016 Buryakov pleaded GUILTY:</p>

<p>Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, announced that EVGENY BURYAKOV, a/k/a “Zhenya,” pled guilty today to conspiring to act in the United States as an agent of the Russian Federation, without providing prior notice to the Attorney General.</p>

<p>[…]  The FBI obtained the recordings after Sporyshev attempted to recruit an FBI undercover employee (“UCE-1”), who was posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company. In response to requests from Sporyshev, UCE-1 provided Sporyshev with binders containing purported industry analysis written by UCE-1 and supporting documentation relating to UCE-1’s reports, as well as covertly placed recording devices.(more)</p>

<p>♦ In 2016 Reuters published an article, based on the ongoing court case, going into detail about court records.  LINK HERE</p>

<p>NEW YORK (Reuters) – The FBI eavesdropped on meetings involving Russian intelligence personnel in New York City, including a suspected spy posing as a trade representative, by hiding recorders in binders containing supposedly confidential information about the energy sector, U.S. prosecutors said.</p>

<p>The hours of covert recordings from 2013 were disclosed in papers filed in Manhattan federal court on Tuesday in the case of Evgeny Buryakov, a Russian citizen who U.S. prosecutors say posed as a banker while participating in a Cold War-style spy ring.</p>

<p>[…] According to prosecutors, in April 2012, Sporyshev met an undercover FBI employee posing as an analyst at a New York energy firm at an oil and gas industry conference.</p>

<p>Over the next two years, they met to discuss the industry and other economic and political issues, prosecutors said, with Sporyshev providing gifts and cash for information.</p>

<p>In 2013, the FBI employee began providing Sporyshev with the binders containing purported industry analysis he wrote, supporting documents, and “covertly placed recording devices,” prosecutors wrote.  (more)</p>

<p>♦ In April 2017, writing a story about Carter Page, and trying to enhance/affirm the Russian narrative, they outlined Page’s connections to the Trump campaign, the New York Times referenced Page’s prior connection to the operation. [Notice how the story is shaped] LINK HERE:</p>

<p>Russian intelligence operatives tried in 2013 to recruit an American businessman and eventual foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign who is now part of the F.B.I. investigation into Russia’s interference into the American election, according to federal court documents and a statement issued by the businessman.</p>

<p>The businessman, Carter Page, met with one of three Russians who were eventually charged with being undeclared officers with Russia’s foreign intelligence service, known as the S.V.R. The F.B.I. interviewed Mr. Page in 2013 as part of an investigation into the spy ring, but decided that he had not known the man was a spy, and the bureau never accused Mr. Page of wrongdoing.</p>

<p>The court documents say that Mr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital, provided documents about the energy business to one of the Russians. […] To record their conversations, the F.B.I. inserted a listening device into binders that were passed to the Russian intelligence operatives during an energy conference, according to a former United States intelligence official.  (more)</p>

<p>It is transparently clear that Carter Page was the Under-Cover Employee (UCE) of the FBI in the 2013 case.  Carter Page was working for the FBI.  However, in 2017 the New York Times, using information from “a former intelligence official“, conflates that fact. Heck, the NY Times tries to entirely change the relationship between Carter Page and the FBI.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Because on October 21st 2016 the FBI claimed to a FISA Court; to gain a “Title I” surveillance warrant; that Carter Page was working on behalf of a foreign government.</p>

<p>(Full Memo pdf)</p>

<p>Carter Page was an FBI Under-Cover Employee in 2013, and remained the primary FBI witness through May of 2016.</p>

<p>If Carter Page was working as an UCE (FBI undercover employee), responsible for the bust of a high level Russian agent in 2013 -and remained a UCE- throughout the court case UP TO May of 2016, how is it possible that on October 21st 2016 Carter Page is put under a FISA Title 1 surveillance warrant as an alleged Russian agent?</p>

<p>Conclusion:  He wasn’t.  The DOJ National Security Division and the FBI Counterintelligence Division flat-out LIED.</p>

<p>Now, go back to the March 2016 DOJ Press Release of the guilty pleading for Evgeny Buryakov, announced from the New York office:</p>

<p>…”Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and John P. Carlin, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, announced”…</p>

<p>Because “FISA Title I” surveillance authority against a U.S. citizen is so serious (the U.S. government is essentially calling the target a spy), only a few people are authorized to even apply for such surveillance warrants.  One of the four people authorized to make such a filing is the Asst. Attorney General who is head of the National Security Division of the DOJ.  That person is John P Carlin.</p>

<p>The same John P Carlin who, together with the FBI counterintelligence unit, hired Carter Page as an FBI Under-Cover Employee, turns around and six months later accuses Page of being a Russian Spy – because the DOJ-NSD and FBI CoIntel needed to find a legal way to spy on the Trump campaign. The 2016 FISA Title 1 surveillance of former FBI employee Carter Page became that legal way. [“The Insurance Policy”]</p>

<p>In October of 2016, immediately after making the FISA Court filing, claiming Page was working for a foreign government and successfully gaining the surveillance warrant,  Asst. Attorney General  John P Carlin resigns as head of the DOJ-NSD.    –SEE HERE–</p>

<p>The entire FISA Title I surveillance authority over Carter Page was cover, most likely retroactive cover, for the DOJ and FBI conducting surveillance on the Trump campaign.</p>

<p>Clear enough?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Flynn is actually a hero. His lawyers just filed a motion to dismiss all charges, I imagine this will happen.</p>

<p>What do you think Flynn was doing talking to the Russians during the transition?</p>

<p>He was talking them off the ledge. Obama was doing his damndest to goad the Rooskies into a war. They accused them of an act of war (falsely), kicked out their diplomats. Their Turkish Ambassodor was shot live on television, and a jet full of Russian military musicians was shot down just outside Syria. All Flynn said was &quot;be patient, we will be in soon&quot;. </p>

<p>It&#39;ll be interesting to see why Flynn pleaded guilty, however. It&#39;ll also be interesting to see which, if any, FBI 302s were edited. Fun times ahead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If Carter Page was essentially an intelligence asset then that would also validate the “compromises methods and sources” complaint repeatedly lodged against the release of the memo.</p>

<p>I’d like to see the author of this line up these claims with the timeline related to the whole unmasking issue.</p>

<p>If Obama era appointees had knowledge of this (and what’s claimed is actually true) then by unmasking the individuals caught up in Carter Page’s monitoring you have a situation wherein you can use a FISA warrant on one individual to indirectly monitor communications of Trump campaign officials IF/WHEN they had any communications with Page.</p>

<p>I’m referring to these statements as claims because they would need to be proven, I’m not making any assumption as to there validity.</p>

<p>What’s proposed is certainly interesting. If true, then it opens up so many questions and concerns.</p>

It’s taken forever just to have it confirmed Page was the FISA subject despite numerous articles from months ago claiming that and everything related to the FISA court is shrouded in secrecy. It’s worth looking into just what exactly they’re entitled to collect based off the specific classification of his FISA warrant.</p>

<p>If it’s really anyone within 2 degrees of him then I’d expect Republicans to start hammering that home. If it’s true then you can’t deflect this surveillance as “not spying on team Trump”, since I’d assume working on the same campaign is “1 degree” or whatever you’d want to call it.</p>

<p>media has been so dishonest presenting Page as being a willing accomplice to the russians in 2013, he worked undercover for the fbi to pass off bugged materials to the russians. So many people getting caught up in the lies and most people would rather laugh with late night comedians than face what went on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You didn&#39;t answer my question. Why are you and the left afraid of FISA abuse committed by the FBI/DOJ being disclosed to the public by the oversight committee?</p>

<p>Maybe your unaware, but the FISA Schedule VII (702&#39;s specifically I believe) that was just renewed was NOT the same thing as what Carter Page was monitored under, Schedule I.</p>

<p>Also for the record, Democrats have been on board for the very same surveillance. Remember the Freedom Act, Obama signed? Its not just a right vs left thing my friend. Although I&#39;d almost be willing to bet you know this and are only trying to intentionally mislead folks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apparently your comfortable with powerful agencies doing whatever the fuck they want. The only political attack is that it&#39;s becoming increasingly clear that the DNC/Clinton campaign teamed up with the Obama administration to take out a Republican candidate. If the shoe was on the other foot you and the rest of the leftist media would be crying from the top of your lungs. Step back and really think about this. Do you want this type of thing to take place again, or would it be best for everyone to get to the bottom of it and fix what went wrong in 2016 so that it doesn&#39;t happen to your candidate next?
When the Republicans passed it it was called the Patriot Act.
Obama signed the Freedom Act.
Two sides of the same shit coin.</p>
