       According to the “official” report, Sargent Yeakey parked his Ford Probe on an empty country road, then slashed himself 11 times on both forearms, before he cut his own throat twice near his jugular vein. Next - after losing about 2 to 3 pints of blood – the report says he crawled approximately 8,000 feet (about a mile and a half) through rough terrain crossing under a barbed wire fence, waded through a culvert, and laid in a ditch just before shooting himself in the head with a revolver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oklahoma Chief Medical Examiner filed the “official” report after ruling Yeakey’s death a “suicide."

       SS: His name was Terry Yeakey. A patriot and a hero who was scheduled to receive the Medal of Valor 2 days after his death on May 9th, 1996.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        OCPD (Oklahoma City Police Officer) Terry Yeakey was on a routine traffic stop in downtown Oklahoma City, near the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building just before 9:00 am on April 19, 1995. He was one of the very first responders, credited with saving several people’s lives, and worked for 48 hours straight without sleep.
       </p>
       <p>
        After rescuing several people, the 6' 3" 275 lb Yeakey, fell two stories down through a hole in the Murrah building while carrying a 300lb man named Randy Ledger. After the harrowing 2 story fall, Yeakey accompanied Randy Ledger, after rescuing him, to the Presbyterian hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hospital staff wanted to admit Yeakey into the hospital, but he refused because of what he had seen inside the Murrah building and had - along with other first responders - been threatened with death by Federal agents to “keep their mouths shut” about anything they had seen or heard in the Murrah building.
       </p>
       <p>
        From the hospital, Yeakey called his wife, Tonia. “It’s not what they’re saying it is, Tonia. It’s not what they’re saying it is. It’s all a lie. It’s all a lie. It’s not true. It’s not what they’re saying. It didn’t happen that way”.
       </p>
       <p>
        At 9:00am on May 8, 1996, this same morning just before his “suicide”, Officer
Yeakey was seen by neighbors leaving his Ok. City apartment with 9 boxes of videos
and files. Then he drove to the Ok. City Police station where he had an argument
with his bosses. He was told by his supervisors to “drop it”, or he’d “wind up dead."
       </p>
       <p>
        In his last known conversation, he told a friend that he was “being followed by the Feds and had to shake them”, because he had been getting threatening phone calls.
       </p>

       Thanks. So the explosion exposed the bombs and people happened to notice them while walking through smoke fire and chaos? How many have made this claim or is it just him? I'm not shooting down the conspiracy just trying to understand.  I've never paid attention to the Oklahoma bombing conspiracy.

       So the idea is someone else wired the building to blow, McVeigh's bomb was a decoy/fake, but some of the bomb's didn't go off or at least left enough visual clues?

       Or McVeigh wasn't involved at all.

       They found an extra leg they were never able to account for. The only person it could have belonged to was a bomber.

       That doesn't take McVeigh out, and it only possibly counts as another bomber.
      </p>

       If you have McVeigh as a patsy, it works better if he does some (in)action you can get him for.

       If I remember correctly there was also stippling inside the building that strongly suggests a bomb inside the building. There was also a second suspect with mcveigh who has never been identified.

       There are also questions as to whether or not McVeigh was even there at all. The Third Terrorist by Jayna Davis is the book about the person you're referring to and McVeigh's lawyer wrote about it in his book too.

       Really? I thought by adding the smoke fire and chaos would make it seem more LIKELY of it being real.  Have you ever been in public when a massive disaster occurs? You don't know where the fuck you are going because landscape is different and not visible. So much is happening but you walk away remembering tiny very specific details.  Accuracy is much greater in some cases of first responders who pay attention to those details.  So bias your ass out of the convo

       That whole plot was a sham from the beginning. From McVeighs ties to the military to his defense team being barred from the building to take samples which would have proved his innocence.

       I strongly suspect OK City bombing was nuclear as well. No way in hell a crude fertilizer bomb took at a semi-circular chunk of the building like that.

       And whaddya know, the same world-record holding demolition company that did "cleanup" at OK City also did "cleanup" for 9/11: Controlled Demolition, Inc.

       That’s iodine 131. It’s used in nuclear medicine and hydraulic fracturing but not as a fissile material. You’re right it’s half life is very short but it would not be the only isotope released by a nuclear explosion so...doesn’t really apply here.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During the Cold War in the mid-1940s through early 1960s, the U.S. government conducted about 100 nuclear weapons (atomic bomb) tests in the atmosphere at a test site in Nevada, more than 100 in the Pacific, and one—the first ever—in New Mexico. The radioactive substances released by these tests are known as "fallout." They were carried thousands of miles away from the test site by winds. As a result, people living in the United States at the time of the testing were exposed to varying levels of radiation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the numerous radioactive substances released in fallout, there has been a great deal of concern about and study of one radioactive form of iodine--called iodine-131, or I-131. I-131 collects in the thyroid gland. People exposed to I-131, especially during childhood, may have an increased risk of thyroid disease, including thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is uncommon and is usually curable. Typically, it is a slow-growing cancer that is highly treatable. About 98 out of 100 people who are diagnosed with thyroid cancer survive the disease for at least five years after diagnosis.

       Yes it is a result of nuclear tests however it is not the only isotope released. The radio-biological hazard of worldwide fallout is a long-term one because of the potential accumulation of long-lived radioisotopes (such as strontium-90 and caesium-137). Both of these isotopes have half life’s of greater than 25yrs.

       How so? You mentioned it as evidence that fallout would not be detectable. I then countered that it’s not the only isotope released in fall out. I then offered that i131 is not a fissile material and would not make a good bomb.

       An ammonium nitrate bomb could've definitely done that damage, look up the Waco fertilizer plant explosion, I don't buy the official story either but a nuclear blast would've been too easy to detect.
