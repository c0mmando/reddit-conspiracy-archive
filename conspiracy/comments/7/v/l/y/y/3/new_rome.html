These people are likely servants of our maker species, who, as the Sumerian texts say, developed a pity for us upon leaving us - their creations -  before an impending meteor attack on Earth. With an ark given to us by a sympathetic maker (or purposely for future harvest), we survive the subsequent flood and spread genetic materials to repopulate the earth starting with the sumerian civilization. The africans and asians in ethiopia and the yellow river are also other versions of genetic splices they came up with besides the indo europeans to make a completely unnaturally evolved but industrious tool-using workers. Neanderthal mixes in with some indo europeans, leading to the white caucasean and scandinavian peoples. </p>

<p>Perhaps our makers will return to use,uplift,or enslave us? </p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably my favorite theory because it makes a lot of sense. I don&#39;t believe we are the only slave planet because if you&#39;re that powerful, why have one? Doesn&#39;t make any sense at all when you can just do something like that with practically a snap of a finger. </p>

<p>I believe another presence is already here on Earth working with TPTB and I believe something might be on the way or it might be in the Earth(hard to say, lots of theories because of texts and carvings). I just hope we some day find out but not in the way they want us to find out. I am hoping there will be someone who will be the one to break out everything and many will follow. It&#39;s a pipe dream at this point but we can&#39;t lose hope.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or maybe we are the decendents of a traitor off-shoot of a galactic proto-human empire that rebelled from the colony of mars, but then the first humans came over and destroyed mars, and these off-shoot protohumans were basically ex-imperial colonial space pirates. So they ran away to earth, a supposedly neutral zone protected by non-intervention pacts. And these were the Sumerian &quot;fathers&quot; or so called gods cultures around the world built pyramids for. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it depends which being takes control. If Yahweh/Enlil rules humans are as good as dead. He won&#39;t fail a 4th time.  If Lucifer/Enki and his son Thoth take control it would seem like we&#39;re in for some kind of advancement in our consciousness. This is assuming the Sumerians were telling the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, he&#39;s the lesser of 2 evils basically. He created man with his personal DNA and mixed it with a primitive hominid. After a few tries it says we were made to be a slave race that mined gold. His brother Enlil/Yahweh was a psychopath that tried killing man 3 x and absolutely despised us.</p>

<p>I like this guy&#39;s work. Gerald Clark. He wrote a couple books as well. This will get you started</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are they based on the 22,000 bc Aratta culture&#39;s art that shows the Annunaki?  So that&#39;s 2 civilizations that acknowledge the Annunaki. I saw some of your posts about your belief in Jesus and you&#39;re entitled to your beliefs. For me including the Sumerians works,which are clearly the inspiration for parts of the Bible, along with the Bible a clearer picture of what took place begins to show itself.</p>

<p>Again to me, now the virgin birth story makes perfect sense. If these beings were messing with DNA it&#39;s completely plausible that Mary was artificially inseminated by a God and he became the son of God. Funny that the scientist God that is claimed to be our creator is Enki/Lucifer and both he and Jesus are known as the light bearer. Coincidence I&#39;m sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should read the book of enoch to understand who these old beings actually are. Sumerian esoteric knowledge stemmed from babylon, the multiple gods, the human sacrifices, blood rituals, etc.</p>

<p>Babylon was all pagan/occult worshippers, mainly Baal and ISIS. Stories of Nimrod also reveal many pagan practices of his leadership, along with his wife.</p>

<p>So while you&#39;re belief on these certain gods as fact maybe true to their culture, it&#39;s origin is dark occultism - which is working with spirits, or demons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you suggesting that the Sumerians were influenced by the Babylon civilization which came after them? I&#39;m confused by that comment.</p>

<p>Multiple God&#39;s were common until Akhenaten created his &quot;monotheistic&quot; worship of Aten/Aton, the solar disc. He was eventually thrown out of Egypt and the  Amenists reclaimed power. Many scholars now believe that Akhenaten or his brother actually was Moses because the story and timeline match up. We all know how the single God concept has influenced Christianity, Judaism and Islam to this day.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not concerned with dark occult practice or demons. I don&#39;t worship them. I simply want to know the truth about the creation of man. In fact I would consider myself more of a Buddhist than anything and I actually do love the story and teachings that Christ lived by. Thanks for the chat, I appreciate intelligent conversation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree that besides from the cross, the pine cone was also of significance. But emblems are a difficult things to connect to each other. There are all kinds of crosses unrelated to each other. Same with the concept of Rome. Id consider the US closer to Rome than the Holy Roman Empire. The HRE is a little controversial thing to Rome itself. </p>
