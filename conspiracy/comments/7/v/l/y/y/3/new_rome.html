       I believe the US is establishing a new roman empire (symbolic transfer of mantle) where a theocratic dictatorship will take control. These people are likely servants of our maker species, who, as the Sumerian texts say, developed a pity for us upon leaving us - their creations -  before an impending meteor attack on Earth. With an ark given to us by a sympathetic maker (or purposely for future harvest), we survive the subsequent flood and spread genetic materials to repopulate the earth starting with the sumerian civilization. The africans and asians in ethiopia and the yellow river are also other versions of genetic splices they came up with besides the indo europeans to make a completely unnaturally evolved but industrious tool-using workers. Neanderthal mixes in with some indo europeans, leading to the white caucasean and scandinavian peoples.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps our makers will return to use,uplift,or enslave us?

       What do you think?

       Probably my favorite theory because it makes a lot of sense. I don't believe we are the only slave planet because if you're that powerful, why have one? Doesn't make any sense at all when you can just do something like that with practically a snap of a finger.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe another presence is already here on Earth working with TPTB and I believe something might be on the way or it might be in the Earth(hard to say, lots of theories because of texts and carvings). I just hope we some day find out but not in the way they want us to find out. I am hoping there will be someone who will be the one to break out everything and many will follow. It's a pipe dream at this point but we can't lose hope.

       Or maybe we are the decendents of a traitor off-shoot of a galactic proto-human empire that rebelled from the colony of mars, but then the first humans came over and destroyed mars, and these off-shoot protohumans were basically ex-imperial colonial space pirates. So they ran away to earth, a supposedly neutral zone protected by non-intervention pacts. And these were the Sumerian "fathers" or so called gods cultures around the world built pyramids for.

       I think it depends which being takes control. If Yahweh/Enlil rules humans are as good as dead. He won't fail a 4th time.  If Lucifer/Enki and his son Thoth take control it would seem like we're in for some kind of advancement in our consciousness. This is assuming the Sumerians were telling the truth.

       They were most definitely the 4th or 5th generations following a previously genetically engineered &amp; uplifted human race who now only remember oral histories and underground structures under pyramids. They must have been telling an accurate story or at least a symbolically relevant story.

       Yes, absolutely. I'm obsessed with this topic. My post was just to show that the oldest civilization we know of ,the Arrata also directly mentioned the Annunaki. Confirming the story in my world.

       Can you recommend a book or videos on this? The stuff I've watched implied Enki kept humans enslaved on Earth for gold. Is this in line with what you've read?

       Yeah, he's the lesser of 2 evils basically. He created man with his personal DNA and mixed it with a primitive hominid. After a few tries it says we were made to be a slave race that mined gold. His brother Enlil/Yahweh was a psychopath that tried killing man 3 x and absolutely despised us.

       Are they based on the 22,000 bc Aratta culture's art that shows the Annunaki?  So that's 2 civilizations that acknowledge the Annunaki. I saw some of your posts about your belief in Jesus and you're entitled to your beliefs. For me including the Sumerians works,which are clearly the inspiration for parts of the Bible, along with the Bible a clearer picture of what took place begins to show itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again to me, now the virgin birth story makes perfect sense. If these beings were messing with DNA it's completely plausible that Mary was artificially inseminated by a God and he became the son of God. Funny that the scientist God that is claimed to be our creator is Enki/Lucifer and both he and Jesus are known as the light bearer. Coincidence I'm sure.

       You should read the book of enoch to understand who these old beings actually are. Sumerian esoteric knowledge stemmed from babylon, the multiple gods, the human sacrifices, blood rituals, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Babylon was all pagan/occult worshippers, mainly Baal and ISIS. Stories of Nimrod also reveal many pagan practices of his leadership, along with his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while you're belief on these certain gods as fact maybe true to their culture, it's origin is dark occultism - which is working with spirits, or demons.

       Are you suggesting that the Sumerians were influenced by the Babylon civilization which came after them? I'm confused by that comment.

       Multiple God's were common until Akhenaten created his "monotheistic" worship of Aten/Aton, the solar disc. He was eventually thrown out of Egypt and the  Amenists reclaimed power. Many scholars now believe that Akhenaten or his brother actually was Moses because the story and timeline match up. We all know how the single God concept has influenced Christianity, Judaism and Islam to this day.

       I'm not concerned with dark occult practice or demons. I don't worship them. I simply want to know the truth about the creation of man. In fact I would consider myself more of a Buddhist than anything and I actually do love the story and teachings that Christ lived by. Thanks for the chat, I appreciate intelligent conversation

       My pet theory is very similar.  I think there were competing human slave breeding programs.

       It's already been here for hundreds of years.

       Why do you think the iron cross, first seen in Babylon, then Rome, then the knights templer...also appeared on Hitler's chest and is now seen on the popes robe and on the Vatican.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the mix of iron and clay seen on the shoes of the statue in Daniels dream after the other layers: Babylon, Persian, Grecian empire, Roman Empire, and then lastly the Holy Roman Empire.

       All roads lead to Rome.

       I do agree that besides from the cross, the pine cone was also of significance. But emblems are a difficult things to connect to each other. There are all kinds of crosses unrelated to each other. Same with the concept of Rome. Id consider the US closer to Rome than the Holy Roman Empire. The HRE is a little controversial thing to Rome itself.
