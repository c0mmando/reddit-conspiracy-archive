    <div class="md"><p>That depends almost exclusively on the circumstances. Of course there are predispositions such as sociopathy, psychopathy, and other pathologies that might raise one&#39;s readiness for aggression or &quot;evil&quot;, but the proposition that everyone is fundamentally capable of every action depending on the circumstances they find themselves in is correct in my view. </p>

<p>Abuse is probably the most difficult thing to reconcile with a peaceful mind. The fact that most abusers of all stripes have been themselves abused is a good indicator that it too is largely a result of bitter circumstances surrounding the abuser&#39;s early life.</p>

<p>A fun exercise is to put yourself in the shoes of the most vile personas, and imagine what it would take for you to follow in their footsteps. How many people have to tell you that you will be &quot;the salvation of the German people&quot; before you start to believe it and act on that presupposition? How many followers do you have in your commune before you go full-on Jonestown or Manson?</p>

<p>The battle between good and evil is fought within every individual, and our experiences tip the scales any of many ways. That&#39;s how we&#39;re fundamentally sharing one-and-the-same experience across individuals and across time, in my estimation.</p>

<p>Which is what non-thinking outrage junkies never stop to consider.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Walk through an airport and get your crotch groped? That&#39;s not fun, but the authorities tell you it&#39;s necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>In bed with your girlfriend and she gropes your crotch? Awesome.</p></li>
<li><p>Walking down the street and a stranger goes for a feel? WTF!!??</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So the point is, how you feel about many things is entirely dependent on the circumstances. The actual thing itself is the same, but your perception of it changes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a great point and something Jordan Peterson talks about a lot. He has a lecture where he goes through the descent of Germany to the Nazi&#39;s and shows that any one uf us would have likely ended up a Nazi soldier based on the circumstances of the place and time. It&#39;s important to direct society and humans away from ideologies and circumstances that lead to these negative actions, because anyone is capable of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been watching his material for several months now, and I&#39;ve noticed that even my language is starting to emulate his speech... </p>

<p>But yes, it is a very powerful point to understand, especially if we truly want to avoid repeating the horrors that both ideological extremes have caused in the 20th century. I&#39;m really beginning to grasp Peterson&#39;s urgency with which he states his case, because we are indeed rushing towards ideological extremes once again, and nobody seems to notice or care. If they care, they tend to care about their opposition&#39;s positions only, which is precisely the thinking that is driving this insane radicalization.</p>

<p>When liberals turn towards communism and conservatives turn towards fascism, then we desperately need strong voices coming from the middle, because that&#39;s always where the vast majority of people see themselves. </p>

<p>I tend to think of myself as a radical moderate, which is pretty funny in its own right, but I do think it&#39;s true, too. And it&#39;s funny too, that when you start building bridges between opposing radicals (at the family reunion, say) you&#39;ll notice quickly how fragile the arguments on both extremes really are.</p>

<p>Peterson&#39;s point that the differences within groups/ethnicities far outweigh the differences between groups/ethnicites is so obvious that people who hold racist views (no matter how reasonably argued) simply don&#39;t know how to respond. On the other hand, if you have someone arguing that we should increase immigration of refugees even more (an all-too-common viewpoint in central Europe), then all you need to do is play it through. How many more? For how long? Under which prerequisites? Only refugees of war, or also of hunger, disease, and corruption? Only Syrians, or Yemenis, Pakistanis, and Venezuelans? Is this really the best solution of the problems they are fleeing from? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPjzfGChGlE">Is it even a solution at all?</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve found that there is so much to talk about in the center of the debate that virtually nobody ever talks about! It&#39;s maddening, really. So much noise and nonsense on the extremes, and so much silence from the center. Fuck that shit right in the pussy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I could get really deep on this but I’ll keep it short. Reincarnation is a part of evolution. Your intuition is the sum of all previous life experiences, intuition is knowing without thinking. You have free will, you can choose to party this life and carry the karma of drug abuse or weight issues etc. into your next life or not; you can choose to deal with problems this life and treat your body/soul well and not have to spend life after life as a damaged soul. People who do deep thinking about this kind of thing believe it takes a minimum of 80 million lives to become human (for your soul to handle the complexity of our human meat robot avatar). So in previous lives you were probably a bird or snake or cat (less complex thinking life form). We may have reincarnated on other planets in other galaxies as other life forms, but it could be a more local kind of a thing and perhaps all our lives were on earth. The ride never ends.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do we know why we are on this ride? Or why we inherently seek knowledge and or why we are thrusts into being exposed to it and thus obtaining it?</p>

<p>Also, if the ride never ends, does this infer that at some point the ride itself repeats or is it literally an eternal ride?</p>

<p>Because for something to be eternal, it would assume that a starting point would be required and or have taken place. Which poses the idea that a measurement of some kind was (the past form is important here) implemented - if indeed our intelligence or existence really &#39;began&#39; in a raw-inept form. </p>

<p>I ponder this, because the eternal ride theory would presume that an intelligent ladder / filter was put into place for a species like ours to overcome or eventually achieve. Whether that be a higher state of consciousness, manifesting a greater physical existence or whatever the purpose may be. </p>

<p>TL:DR - Why does it exist? And for what reason was it put into place?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this viewpoint is often considered pseudoscience, but I think it is an inherently quantum phenomenon. For example, electrons are not distinguishable because they are not distinct objects. They are each part of a vibration (loosely speaking) of an underlying field. I think down at the level of quarks, there is a universal connection between all molecules and systems. We feel this connection internally and it is very similar to the feeling that we are all somehow the same person living different lives. The reason is that at some unified field level, we are all vibrations (roughly speaking) of a single universal object. I feel that the incorporation of gravity into a quantum perspective is the missing ingredient to explain why massive systems like planets or people or bacteria seem irreducible in some strange way. The quantum particles of the unified field include things which are very complex and exist as their own unique irreducible particles in a limited amount of space over a limited period of time. Let&#39;s call these particles &quot;lives&quot; because it generalizes our concept of a life, but I am including systems which many people would not call living. But at the bottom, all of these lives come from the same source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So are romantic and familial love and attachment. Buddhism is akin to spiritual suicide. Existence is equated with suffering, and the ultimate goal is to alleviate that suffering. You can&#39;t just kill yourself, though, because that won&#39;t escape the cycle of reincarnation. You must detach yourself from all things, becoming an inhuman shell, before you are finally allowed to die (nirvana). The goal is annihilation of the self, and by extension, annihilation of all living beings. I won&#39;t accept that. When you vilify life, you worship death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are mistaken about a lot of those buddhist beliefs. They actually encourage and talk about how to live a buddhist life in a family and while married. Its not about running away to be a monk alone, however that can be a path as well. And it is in no way close to worshipping death. I encourage you to read more into it while being open. You are correct on some things, but the way you are incorrect paints buddhism very differently from what it really is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We&#39;re all part of the same consciousness, think Carl Jung&#39;s unified unconscious, that reside in a vessel. </p>

<p>The way I visualize this is with fractals. The fractals have to have a point of origin (some people call this God or the great constant and everything in between) from there, to inhabit a vessel, a fractal MUST spin off. </p>

<p>Everytime someone is born this is what happens, so much like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>attempting to understand how the earth rotates on it&#39;s access, from there the odd way the earth revolves around the sun, from there how the Sol system revolves, from there how the Sol system moves through space relative to the milky way, from there how the milky way rotates, from there how the milky way dances with the andromeda galaxy, as we hurl through space being affected by even larger items such as dark matter</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s hard for the kind to visualize, but it&#39;s easy to grasp when you think on it.</p>

<p>This has interesting implications, such as the phenomenon where certain people believe so much in the identity their vessel that it becomes the ideology they understand the world with, and those who believe in the collectivism of the unconscious and use that ideology instead. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the conundrum of mankind. Instead of being rational and discussing it, we divide ourselves into tribes based on how we interpret those two halves, and war with each other even though there is more than enough to go around if we cooperate. </p>

<p>People would actually have to sit and think about things, but our society isn&#39;t set up to allow the typical person to be able to do more than what society demands of it.

    <div class="md"><h1>The Egg</h1>

<p><strong>By: Andy Weir</strong></p>

<hr/>

<p>You were on your way home when you died.</p>

<p>It was a car accident. Nothing particularly remarkable, but fatal nonetheless. You left behind a wife and two children. It was a painless death. The EMTs tried their best to save you, but to no avail. Your body was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.</p>

<p>And that’s when you met me.</p>

<p>“What… what happened?” You asked. “Where am I?”</p>

<p>“You died,” I said, matter-of-factly. No point in mincing words.</p>

<p>“There was a… a truck and it was skidding…”</p>

<p>“Yup,” I said.</p>

<p>“I… I died?”</p>

<p>“Yup. But don’t feel bad about it. Everyone dies,” I said.</p>

<p>You looked around. There was nothingness. Just you and me. “What is this place?” You asked. “Is this the afterlife?”</p>

<p>“More or less,” I said.</p>

<p>“Are you god?” You asked.</p>

<p>“Yup,” I replied. “I’m God.”</p>

<p>“My kids… my wife,” you said.</p>

<p>“What about them?”</p>

<p>“Will they be all right?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I like to see,” I said. “You just died and your main concern is for your family. That’s good stuff right there.”</p>

<p>You looked at me with fascination. To you, I didn’t look like God. I just looked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe. More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry,” I said. “They’ll be fine. Your kids will remember you as perfect in every way. They didn’t have time to grow contempt for you. Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fair, your marriage was falling apart. If it’s any consolation, she’ll feel very guilty for feeling relieved.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” you said. “So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?”</p>

<p>“Neither,” I said. “You’ll be reincarnated.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” you said. “So the Hindus were right,”</p>

<p>“All religions are right in their own way,” I said. “Walk with me.”</p>

<p>You followed along as we strode through the void. “Where are we going?”</p>

<p>“Nowhere in particular,” I said. “It’s just nice to walk while we talk.”</p>

<p>“So what’s the point, then?” You asked. “When I get reborn, I’ll just be a blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in this life won’t matter.”</p>

<p>“Not so!” I said. “You have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives. You just don’t remember them right now.”</p>

<p>I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders. “Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are. It’s like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it’s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourself into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you’ve gained all the experiences it had.</p>

<p>“You’ve been in a human for the last 48 years, so you haven’t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you’d start remembering everything. But there’s no point to doing that between each life.”</p>

<p>“How many times have I been reincarnated, then?”</p>

<p>“Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.” I said. “This time around, you’ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD.”</p>

<p>“Wait, what?” You stammered. “You’re sending me back in time?”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess technically. Time, as you know it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come from.”</p>

<p>“Where you come from?” You said.</p>

<p>“Oh sure,” I explained “I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there are others like me. I know you’ll want to know what it’s like there, but honestly you wouldn’t understand.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” you said, a little let down. “But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don’t even know it’s happening.”</p>

<p>“So what’s the point of it all?”</p>

<p>“Seriously?” I asked. “Seriously? You’re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn’t that a little stereotypical?”</p>

<p>“Well it’s a reasonable question,” you persisted.</p>

<p>I looked you in the eye. “The meaning of life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.”</p>

<p>“You mean mankind? You want us to mature?”</p>

<p>“No, just you. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect.”</p>

<p>“Just me? What about everyone else?”</p>

<p>“There is no one else,” I said. “In this universe, there’s just you and me.”</p>

<p>You stared blankly at me. “But all the people on earth…”</p>

<p>“All you. Different incarnations of you.”</p>

<p>“Wait. I’m everyone!?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re getting it,” I said, with a congratulatory slap on the back.</p>

<p>“I’m every human being who ever lived?”</p>

<p>“Or who will ever live, yes.”</p>

<p>“I’m Abraham Lincoln?”</p>

<p>“And you’re John Wilkes Booth, too,” I added.</p>

<p>“I’m Hitler?” You said, appalled.</p>

<p>“And you’re the millions he killed.”</p>

<p>“I’m Jesus?”</p>

<p>“And you’re everyone who followed him.”</p>

<p>You fell silent.</p>

<p>“Every time you victimized someone,” I said, “you were victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you’ve done, you’ve done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any human was, or will be, experienced by you.”</p>

<p>You thought for a long time.</p>

<p>“Why?” You asked me. “Why do all this?”</p>

<p>“Because someday, you will become like me. Because that’s what you are. You’re one of my kind. You’re my child.”</p>

<p>“Whoa,” you said, incredulous. “You mean I’m a god?”</p>

<p>“No. Not yet. You’re a fetus. You’re still growing. Once you’ve lived every human life throughout all time, you will have grown enough to be born.”</p>

<p>“So the whole universe,” you said, “it’s just…”</p>

<p>“An egg.” I answered. “Now it’s time for you to move on to your next life.”</p>

<p>And I sent you on your way.</p>
