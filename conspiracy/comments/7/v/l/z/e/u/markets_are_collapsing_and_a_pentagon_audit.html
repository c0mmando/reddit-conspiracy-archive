<p>I really really hope that, if shit does hit the fan, people would be there for each other. I think the majority of people would help a fellow human. Most people want to do the right thing. Most people also want to be accepted and supported by others, and this is specifically what has me worried. If the interactions we’ve been seeing all over social media, this sub included, it’s not going to be good. People insulting and ridiculing each other simply because of thought differences, “if you don’t agree with me, you’re a cocksucker” type of reactions, “if you like this party you’re a racist homophobe, if you like that other party you’re a satanic pedophile vampire”, “you’re a fucking idiot if you think this way, you’re a moron if you think that way”. It’s tough getting along these days. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a dip at this point, not a collapse, and has rebounded some already.</p>

<p>My fringe theory is that globalists liquidated much of their stock because their time is drawing near as Trump admin tightens the noose. Look at executive order on seizing property in connection with human trafficking.</p>

<p>I think they&#39;re liquidating and spreading money around to friends and family and various bank accounts offshore. The mass sell off triggered others to follow suit and created somewhat of a cascade effect. If this is the case, the market should resume its upward trajectory as it looks like it may be. </p>
