       both owned/controlled by Rothschild
      </p>
      <p>
       And now some fun!
      </p>
      <p>
       In the year of 2000 there were seven countries without a Rothschild owned Central Bank:
*Afghanistan
*Iraq
*Sudan
*Libya
*Cuba
*North Korea
*Iran
It is not a coincidence that these country, which are listed above were and are still being under attack by the western media, since one of the main reasons these countries have been under attack in the first place is because they do not have a Rothschild owned Central Bank yet.
The first step in having a Central Bank establish in a country is to get them to accept an outrageous loans, which puts the country in debt of the Central Bank and under the control of the Rothschilds. If the country does not accept the loan, the leader of this particular country will be assassinated and a Rothschild aligned leader will be put into the position, and if the assassination does not work, the country will be invaded and have a Central Bank established with force all under the name of terrorism. Rothschild owned Central Bank:
Central banks are illegally created private banks that are owned by the Rothschild banking family. The family has been around for more than 230 years and has slithered its way into each country on this planet, threatened every world leader and their governments and cabinets with physical and economic death and destruction, and then emplaced their own people in these central banks to control and manage each countryâ€™s pocketbook. Worse, the Rothschilds also control the machinations of each government at the macro level, not concerning themselves with the daily vicissitudes of our individual personal lives. Except when we get too far out of line. The only countries left in 2003 without a Central Bank owned by the Rothschild Family were:
*Sudan
*Libya
*Cuba
*North Korea
*Iran
The Attacks of September 11th were an inside job to invade Afghanistan and Iraq to then establish a Central Bank in those countries.
The only countries left in 2011 without a Central Bank owned by the Rothschild Family are:
*Cuba
*North Korea
*Iran

       The Rothschild family loans out the money, therefore they have the right to call in the loan for repayment therefore they control the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an example of how power like this would play out:
       <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/26/party-funding-conservatives-rothschild">
        https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2008/oct/26/party-funding-conservatives-rothschild
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Conservative party faced demands last night to repay a huge loan from a member of the Rothschild banking family made through a company set up with the sole purpose of protecting her anonymity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ironmade's accounts reveal the firm has been dormant since it was created in April 2005. According to the accounts, 'the ultimate controlling party of the company is Victoria, Lady de Rothschild, by virtue of her control of the entire issued share capital'. Prior to the loan, de Rothschild gave the party almost Â£130,000 via a series of donations made between 2002 and 2005 under her own name.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rothschild banking family was calling in the loan 2 years early. Uh oh!

       You have not explained how the banks are owned, or how you know the ownership structure.  Why don't you just admit that you use "Rothschild" as a proxy for "Jew"?

       I am well aware of who the Rothschild family are.  I am seeing
       <em>
        no
       </em>
       evidence that they
       <em>
        own any Central Bank

       . Repeating it doesn't make it true.  It gets repeated a lot, because "Rothschild" functions as well as "Globalist" for people who are ashamed to say "Jews".

       First you open up the capital markets. That is, you sell off your local banks gold to foreign buyers. Then you go to whatâ€™s called market-based pricing or even silver. Thatâ€™s the stuff like in California where everything is free market and you end up with water bills no one can pay. Then open up your borders to trade. Itâ€™s like the opium wars. This isnâ€™t free trade; this is coercion trade. This is war. They are taking apart economies through this system. China has a 50% to 60% tariff on the U.S. but the U.S. has a 2% on them. Thatâ€™s not free and fair trade. Itâ€™s to force all industry into a state of one world order that the globalists control 100%.

       The Rothschild banking family of England was founded in 1798 by Nathan Mayer von Rothschild (1777â€“1836) who first settled in Manchester but then moved to London. Nathan was sent there from his home in Frankfurt by his father, Mayer Amschel Rothschild (1744â€“1812). Wanting his sons to succeed on their own and to expand the family business across Europe, Mayer Amschel Rothschild had his eldest son remain in Frankfurt, while his four other sons were sent to different European cities to establish a financial institution to invest in business and provide banking services. Nathan Mayer von Rothschild, the third son, first established a textile jobbing business in Manchester and from there went on to establish N M Rothschild &amp; Sons bank in London.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the home base in Frankfurt, Rothschild sons not only established themselves in the UK but also in Paris, Vienna and Naples in the Two Sicilies. Through their collaborative efforts, the Rothschilds rose to prominence in a variety of banking endeavours including loans, government bonds and trading in bullion. Their financing afforded investment opportunities and during the 19th century they became major stakeholders in large-scale mining and rail transport ventures that were fundamental to the rapidly expanding industrial economies of Europe.

       During the early part of the 19th century, the Rothschild's London bank took a leading part in managing and financing the subsidies that the British government transferred to its allies during the Napoleonic Wars. Through the creation of a network of agents, couriers and shippers, the bank was able to provide funds to the armies of the Duke of Wellington in Portugal and Spain, therefore funding war. In 1818 the Rothschild bank arranged a Â£5 million loan to the Prussian government and the issuing of bonds for government loans. The providing of other innovative and complex financing for government projects formed a mainstay of the bank's business for the better part of the century. N M Rothschild &amp; Sons financial strength in the City of London became such that by 1825â€“26, the bank was able to supply enough coin to the Bank of England to enable it to avert a liquidity crisis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nathan Mayer's eldest son, Lionel de Rothschild (1808â€“1879) succeeded him as head of the London branch. Under Lionel the bank financed the British government's 1875 purchase of Egypt's interest in the Suez Canal. Lionel also began to invest in railways as his uncle James had been doing in France. In 1869, Lionel's son, Alfred de Rothschild (1842â€“1918), became a director of the Bank of England, a post he held for 20 years. Alfred was one of those who represented the British Government at the 1892 International Monetary Conference in Brussels.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rothschild bank funded Cecil Rhodes in the development of the British South Africa Company and Leopold de Rothschild (1845â€“1917) administered Rhodes's estate after his death in 1902 and helped to set up the Rhodes Scholarship scheme at Oxford University. In 1873, de Rothschild FrÃ¨res in France and N M Rothschild &amp; Sons of London joined with other investors to acquire the Spanish government's money-losing Rio Tinto copper mines. The new owners restructured the company and turned it into a profitable business. By 1905, the Rothschild interest in Rio Tinto amounted to more than 30 percent. In 1887, the French and UK Rothschild banking houses loaned money to, and invested in, the De Beers diamond mines in South Africa, becoming its largest shareholders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The London banking house continued under the management of Lionel Nathan de Rothschild (1882â€“1942) and his brother Anthony Gustav de Rothschild (1887â€“1961) and then to Sir Evelyn de Rothschild (b. 1931). In 2003, following Sir Evelyn's retirement as head of N M Rothschild &amp; Sons of London, the UK and French financial firms merged under the leadership of David RenÃ© de Rothschild.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond banking and finance, members of the Rothschild family in UK became academics, scientists and horticulturalists with worldwide reputations.

       If you have specific issues with specific monetary policy you should state them.  But that is not the matter we are discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The claim flies in the face of reality, especially when you understand that the BundesBank are the Dutch CB are 100% public institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to claim that you know the ownership structure of some specific institution, don't paste a wall-of-text historical diatribe.
       <em>
        Show me how you could possibly have the information being claimed

       The Rothschilds are a blip in that field.  Abigail Johnson alone probably controls more than all the "Rothschild family" put together.

       I get it.  You don't like the basic ideas of contemporary monetary policy.  You might even have specific aspects of macro policy which you would change if you had the power.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this "Rothschild family controls everything" nonsense overstates their influence pretty comically.  If they have enough wealth for that to even be considered possible, they are hiding most of it.  Hiding trillions of dollars.  For the purpose of making it look like there are a whole lot of other institutional investors involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       And what about the public institutions they supposedly own?  Am I to understand that this family owns entire
       <em>
        governments
       </em>
       ?  They own
       <em>
        The Netherlands
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        Germany
       </em>
       ?  I'm not buying this but that's okay.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's say tomorrow you take over. What specific change do you make in what policy, and what effects will your plan have?

       Not sure, but I think you said something along the lines of "all but seven of the world's central banks are owned by the Rothschilds".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't care as much about that as I am interested in what "they" are doing or not doing to which you object, what you would do (or not do) differently, and what the expected economic impacts of your plan would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't expect you to actually have a plan, though.  I think this is just one more case of "Rothschild" being used because you are too chicken to just say "Jew".

       Proposed solutions to our current IMF/Rothschild troubles:
      </p>
      <p>
       Step one: the dollar is detached from the global reserve currencies. America exits from the IMF and other organizations keeping the entire world in serfdom.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step two: nationalisation of the dollar and correction of the legislation regulating its functions and tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Step three: American goods are traded only for American dollars.
If someone wishes to commodities, he is welcome at the American stock exchange, where everything is just as it should be: no dictatorship, no totalitarianism. Do not worry, it is the absolute market system here: just change your dollars to our rubles and there you go.
      </p>
      <p>
       The nationaliation of the dollar is the shortest way to its complete convertibility and stability.

       The Rothschild family loans out the money, therefore they have the right to call in the loan for repayment therefore they control the money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an example of how power like this would play out:

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Conservative party faced demands last night to repay a huge loan from a member of the Rothschild banking family made through a company set up with the sole purpose of protecting her anonymity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ironmade's accounts reveal the firm has been dormant since it was created in April 2005. According to the accounts, 'the ultimate controlling party of the company is Victoria, Lady de Rothschild, by virtue of her control of the entire issued share capital'. Prior to the loan, de Rothschild gave the party almost Â£130,000 via a series of donations made between 2002 and 2005 under her own name.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Rothschild banking family was calling in the loan 2 years early. Uh oh!

       If you have specific issues with specific monetary policy you should state them.  But that is not the matter we are discussing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The claim flies in the face of reality, especially when you understand that the BundesBank are the Dutch CB are 100% public institutions.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to claim that you know the ownership structure of some specific institution, don't paste a wall-of-text historical diatribe.
       <em>
        Show me how you could possibly have the information being claimed
       </em>
       .  Or tell the truth: you don't know.
