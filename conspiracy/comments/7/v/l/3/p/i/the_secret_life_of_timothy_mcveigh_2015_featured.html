       Trentadue's brother, Kenneth Michael Trentadue, was found hanging in his cell while in federal custody, and his death was ruled a suicide. Kenneth Trentadue, a convicted bank robber, had been picked up in California after violating his parole and was transported to Oklahoma City for further proceedings. During this time, the FBI was investigating the bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Kenneth Trentadue's body was sent to his family, it was covered in blood and bruises, leading them to believe he was murdered, according to Jesse Trentadue. He believes his brother was killed by FBI agents who mistook him for a bombing suspect and subjected him to fatal interrogation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trentadue's family ultimately received close to a $1 million judgment after a federal judge in Oklahoma found that the federal government intentionally inflicted emotional distress on family members by withholding information about Kenneth Trentadue's death..."

       misunderstand what? where government money comes from? I mean I know its obviously not all tax money that wouldn't create the defecate needed to run the country into the ground but essentially government money should all be considered tax payer money. I mean for the people by the people these public servants are supposed to be representing us etc etc. not really that big of an umm wtf. if you didn't get what I was getting at then the joke is really on you.

       Which is why the courts should ignore any vague and unsupported claims about "National Security" in their entirety.  Only where an agency can show by clear and convincing proof the the security of the

       <p>
        “‘Sheep-dipped’ is an intricate Army-devised process by which a man who is in the service as a full career soldier or officer agrees to go through all the legal and official motions of resigning from the service. Then, rather than actually being released, his records are pulled from the Army personnel files and transferred to a special Army intelligence file. Substitute but nonetheless real-appearing records are then processed, and the man ‘leaves’ the service. He is encouraged to write to friends and give a cover reason why he got out. He goes to his bank and charge card services and changes his status to civilian, and does the hundreds of other official and personal things that any man would do if he really had gotten out of the service. Meanwhile, his real Army records are kept in secrecy, but not forgotten.”

       I might give this a watch, I'm not big into video, but the FBI's release on the OKCITY bombing leaves much to be desired... 100 pages covering McVeigh's militia background... some weird shit about David Koresh still being alive... and then it peters out before anything gets blown up.

       My suspicion is that John Doe #2 was an undercover Federal agent who pushed McVeigh and helped him every step of the way.  Back in the 90's the militia movement was gaining popularity so I've always thought that the bombing was a false flag attack to vilify militias and encourage people to leave them.

       I'm not convinced McVeigh wasn't in on it from the very beginning. He was going to gun shows for years giving out FBI Sniper Lon Horiuchi's personal details trying to bait someone into saying they wanted to shoot him. I'm also not convinced he was actually executed.

       Having murdered over 100 people, including children, he got pulled over and peacefully arrested in spite of having a gun on him. People that are willing to blow up buildings and kill innocent people would have no qualms about shooting a cop.

       Cooper's recently declassified FBI file reveals one very alarming detail that I
have not seen anyone else mention about who really pulled off the OKC bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me blow your mind about what really happened in OKC and demolish the
Official Narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go to page 335, and look at these 2 pages:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2kyn.png">
        http://i.magaimg.net/img/2kyn.png

       <a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/16xg.png">
        http://i.magaimg.net/img/16xg.png
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI met Cooper to ask if he knew anything about McVeigh.  Instead, Cooper
told the Agent about 2 mystery men who visited him in November 1994.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cooper said the FBI's first sketch of John Doe #1 resembled one of the men who visited him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cooper said neither men looked like McVeigh.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cooper said one of them men told him to "watch Oklahoma."
      </p>
      <p>
       Cooper said he could tell the men were under surveillance, because there were 2
vehicles following them, and he implied to the FBI Agent that the Agent
already knew as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cooper said one of the men gave him a copy of The Turner Diaries, but that he already possessed a copy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is where it gets weird and this is the crux of my entire post.
See how Cooper describes for the FBI Agent the physical appearance of John Doe
      </p>
      <p>
       But his words are REDACTED!
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is almost certain that Cooper's redacted sentences on page 338 refer to one
of the men having a military style tattoo of a dragon, and both men having a military
demeanor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the FBI redact the physical description of the 2 OKC bombers? McVeigh
is dead, so according to the FBI's own rules, they can't redact anything about
him for privacy reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only 2 possible explanations:
      </p>
      <p>
       a) McVeigh and Nicols didn't do the OKC bombing, but were instead set up as patsies,
and whoever these 2 mystery military men who met Cooper were, they did OKC. Classic
case of "blame it on the dead guy(s), case closed."
      </p>
      <p>
       b) The 2 men were McVeigh and Nicols, but FBI redacted their details to conceal
that the FBI had them under surveillance the whole time, which means the FBI
sat back, watched and even helped plot the OKC bombing without lifting a finger
to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lean towards option b) because creating the terrorists using vast networks of informants
to influence unstable paranoid types into cracking under the pressure and setting them off
sure seems to be one of the only things the FBI does well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI did the exact same thing during 9/11 and the first WTC bombing after all.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a solid thread of evidence to support that OKC was an FBI entrapment plot gone bad.
This Mother Jones article from 2007, they reveal some very weird FBI coverup
involving a bank robber named Kenney Trentadue.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/07/search-john-doe-no-2-story-feds-never-told-about-oklahoma-city-bombing/">
        https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/07/search-john-doe-no-2-story-feds-never-told-about-oklahoma-city-bombing/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trentadue had a dragon tatoo on his arm.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/news/feature/2007/07/oklahoma_275x281.jpg?w=990">
        https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/legacy/news/feature/2007/07/oklahoma_275x281.jpg?w=990
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Trentadue conveniently killed himself in prison. Leaving bruises all over his
body and knuckles, slitting his own throat, and then hanging himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only witness, another inmate in the adjacent cell, later killed himself as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI stonewalled on all of the evidence. The OKC medical examiner would not
rule Trentadue's death as suicide, so the FBI called him a "loose cannon." The
same medical examiner who had just heroically examined every corpse from the
OKC bombing and put back together the blow up bodies.
      </p>
      <p>
       All kinds of documents about what really happened to Trentadue are still
completely redacted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the FBI be so interested in covering up for 2 dead bank robbers with
ties to the Militia movement and White Nationalists (their favorite punching
bag boogey man before Radical Islamic Terror came along)?
      </p>
      <p>
       The MJ ariticle goes on to speculate Trentadue was John Doe #2, and that his
partner Richard Lee Guthrie was John Doe #1. Guthrie was the leader of the
Aryan Republican Army, who robbed 22 banks to finance their militia activities.
Guthrie also conveniently killed himself in prison too.  There have now been
declassified documents showing the FBI was wiretapping Guthrie and caught
McVeigh in phone calls right before OKC, as well as ATF documents showing they
ran informants in Elohim City, OK who were talking about "blowing up Federal
buildings."
      </p>
      <p>
       So why did the FBI wind up the pieces like clock work, turn them loose and let
the OKC bombing happen?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because "the roots of the Patriot Act were not planted in the chasm of Ground Zero, but
in the dusty soil of Oklahoma City."

       It's about the pathology of Control. As an emergent process, the Deep State can
only justify its own expansion to turn America into a fully blown Orwellian
Dystopian Nightmare if a formidable enough Enemy exists to justify ratcheting
society towards Martial Law.  Since such an enemy doesn't exist, the FBI has to press
its pinky on the scales of justice, to tilt the playing field ever so slightly,
to create those enemies itself. By using 100,000 informants, by paying unstable
crazies and hardcore felons to entrap and recruit innocent people, and by
turning a blind eye to their plots to permit the next terrorist attack to
succeed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember seeing a slide somewhere in the leaked Snowden documents that was
bragging about how "Join Task" integrated the FBI and CIA and NSA were
all becoming. It was a pie chart showing something like 30% of FBI personnel had
spent time working for CIA, 20% of CIA had pulled stints at NSA, and 40% of NSA
had worked for FBI and CIA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clearly, in creating domestic terrorist militias, the FBI has learnt from the
ol' CIA playbook of "How to Create ISIS."
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire goddamned Deep State has become an orgy of complicity, a giant
circle jerk where everyone is giving out reach around handies while offering up
their puckered bung like an HIV negative boypucci in a pozzed "Gifting"
hotel gangbang.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not even clear anymore who the hell in the TLA's is a saint and who's a
sinner.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're ALL equally guilty and deseve
       <em>

       Ramzi Yousef went to school with Terry Nichols in the Phillipines and his uncle happened to be Khalid Sheik Mohammed. Ramzi Yousef was one of the 1993 WTC bombers and his uncle was involved in 9/11. The FBI was heavily involved in the procurement of the Rental Truck for the WTC bombing in 1993 if not the OKC attack. All this shit went down under bill clinton. Along with the death of 3 former body guards at waco (then FBI) who were involved with the MENA drug running that also encompassed buisiness they did with the Branch Davidians with Firearms and Drug running.

       McVeigh is an actor, from the actor layer, given a script with layers and nothing more. Friends; don’t get caught in attractive webs. Pointless and actually bury you further away from the truth. They keep you believing in the lie layers. Force u to assume a lie just to entertain their speculation - “ITS A TRAP”.

       Great choice, at first I was reluctant it seemed political but by the Halfway mark I was bug eyed. There is a lot more than we have been spoon fed about this event but the only certainty I can find is that there is no certainty, great recommendation and I now know something is off with this case.

       Thank you. I saw the McVeigh documentary, &amp; it was excellent. It's so hard to know whom to believe these days. Some commenters are disparaging the spammy participation on this sub, but I think there's still a lot of good stuff here -- &amp; other places, too, provided you look. If only more people sought out many sources of information to select from the most plausible among them. This world would be a different place. But I consider that unlikely -- &amp; that's okay w/ me.

       I'm here because I want to be and I'm telling you that these featured documentaries and round table chats are bullshit.

        He might have actually gotten away if he would have just had a license plate on his car, so it's almost like he wanted to get caught.

       Having murdered over 100 people, including children, he got pulled over and peacefully arrested in spite of having a gun on him. People that are willing to blow up buildings and kill innocent people would have no qualms about shooting a cop.
