       I randomly bumped into a clip from West Wing that talked about how the northern and southern hemispheres are actually upside down and that the map was made this way to promote top and bottom cultural ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I did some searching and didnt find any compelling information to back this claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was wondering if any of you may have heard of this and are willing to share/discuss what this is about

       Technically, there is not up or down, so you can have the map hownever you want, there is only a magnetic pole which is used for navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       My history teacher in Middle School had a map that was 'upsidedown" to counter this idea.

       That's due to difficulties in mapping a spherical surface onto a plane.  Some projections have distorted proportions, others have distorted shapes.

       Well there is no 'real' up or down, it's all relative. The clip I think you are referring to is where a pressure group wants to change whwich map projection is used, claiming the reasons are oppressive/cultural or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Different projections certainly do miscontrue the real shape and size of landmasses. Reasons for using a map is not likely political though, more likely practical = true shorelines for shipping for example.

       The other thing, we are so used to seeing maps cut through the Pacific, as Europe is featured more prominently.  Maps that split the Atlantic are more commonly used in Asia:

       Yeah, I used to live in Honolulu.  A lot of the islands are already making disaster plans for when the inevitable ocean rise happens.  The ones I heard about were to transfer their important cultural artifacts so that they can make sure they are saved.  Pretty sad when you think about it, the only thing that might be left will be at museums.

       The word you're looking for is
       <em>
        orbiting,
       </em>
       but the point is that has nothing to do with the orientation of maps. Map orientations (and projections) are entirely arbitrary, and they're used because they're
       <em>
        useful,
       </em>
       not because they encapsulate some deep underlying truth about the rotational asymmetry of the world.

       The Earth's orbit is in free-fall about the Sun. The Sun's orbit is in free-fall about the center of the Milky Way. Both fall in a particular direction. What we view as being "north" or "south' is the direction that the sun falls or orbits.

      <p>
       This isn't correct. Maybe you've gotten confused by the variety of different "norths" people talk about.
      </p>
      <p>
       North on Earth is toward the North Pole, being one of the two points where the earth's rotational axis intersects the surface. This is wholly arbitrary; the concept of "north" originates with the fact that north is to your left when you face the rising sun … approximately.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Solar
       </em>
       north is the direction away from then sun which, when you look at the ecliptic from that direction, the earth is moving counter-clockwise. Solar north is vaguely in the same direction as polar north, but it's angled away by about 23°.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Galactic
       </em>
       north is the direction away from the center of the galaxy which, when you look at the galaxy from that direction, the
       <em>
        sun
       </em>
       and the solar system are orbiting counter-clockwise. Galactic north is angled away from solar north by about 60°.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no meaningful correlation between galactic north and polar north. The only connection between the two is that the entire galaxy and all the matter in it has similar total angular momentum, originating far back in astronomical time when the galaxy was just a diffuse cloud of matter collapsing under its own weight. That cloud had a net angular momentum, and because angular momentum is conserved, the galaxy today still has that same angular momentum. This is why stuff orbits other stuff in the first place, rather than having long since collapsed into a big wad of matter with no rotation.

       It's just a model, and definitely has some inconsistencies, but this doesn't change the fact that the sun is moving in a direction. You're looking at it backwards if you're viewing the sun as being "stationary" with respect to the Earth, and perhaps that's my fault for not stating things more clearly. But what I'm asking is, using Earth directions for reference where north means the North Pole and south means the South Pole, in which direction is the Sun moving? It doesn't have to be an exact cardinal direction but the sun is always moving a direction, regardless of its orbital plane. That geocentric direction is actually all I'm interested in. Which Earth direction does our solar system fall towards while orbiting the solar system?

       I think the other person is trying to explain to you that there is no absolute frame of reference in space.  The sun only has motion relative to other objects.  You can talk about the sun's velocity relative to earth, relative to Alpha Centauri, relative to the galactic center, whatever, but asking "what direction is the sun moving?" doesn't make sense.

       You have the wherewithal to understand that the sun orbits around the galactic center, but you still try to define the sun's movement based on an object that is
       <em>
        orbiting and rotating
       </em>
       around the sun itself? There is no useful answer to that because you have the importance of your variables backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only "geocentric" variable that even comes close to mattering to what you're asking is the center of the Earth's orbit (which, for so many reasons, puts you back at square one in this question). You could I suppose physically point a direction that the sun is moving at a specific date and time, but that answer will immediately change and never be the same again; a year later on the same date and time the entire system will have moved. It's based on a location on the earth which is based on it's position around the sun which is based on it's position around the galactic center, and if you want to scale out one more time, is based on some vector from the center of the universe. It's a fool's thought experiment and the best you could hope for is a guy pointing either at the sky or at the ground and say "about that way."

       I'm not trying to define anything. I'm trying to create a mental image of the earth in orbit around the sun while the sun orbits around the galactic center. That's it, and instead of trying to answer the question, this idiot is arguing that the sun doesn't move.

       so the question is if its a conspiracy that maps show northern hemisphere "on top" of the south?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it probably has more to do with who was making the maps when crossing the Atlantic became consistently do able. So Europeans probably orientated their maps in a way that placed things how they are and have remained that way for the most part since then. They may have unknowingly been biased in how they depicted the world but I doubt it was a conspiracy to depict some places as less than others.

       He who maketh the maps, gets to choose which side is up. Australians can freely distribute their upside down map if they like. As far as I'm concerned, Europe is the center of the world. ;-)

       It probably stuck to the way it is now, because more population lives north of the equator than south of it.
