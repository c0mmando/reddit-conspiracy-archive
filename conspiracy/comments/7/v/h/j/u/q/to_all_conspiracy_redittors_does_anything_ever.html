        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m fascinated by conspiracies. I have been reading about them since the mid 90s when I was a high school kid. I&#39;d sit in the library reading books like Holy Blood, Holy Grail and whatever other books I could find. I get that the world is an interesting place and things might not always be what they seem. Yet at the same time, I come to a place like this and whoa, it seems that people believe that everything that happens is orchestrated for some reason or other. I mean, the Challenger explosion? That&#39;s a ship strapped to millions of gallons of fuel. Shit happens. Accidents happen and people make mistakes. Doesn&#39;t sometimes shit happen simply because shits happens? </p>

<p>Then I see that thread about &quot;what if something happens today&quot; about the Super Bowl and then...nothing happens...so we just all move on to the next thing that might happen? It sounds exhausting to live in a world like that.</p>

<p>And I get it, I&#39;m here. I&#39;m interested in reading about certain things, I find them interesting and entertaining, but then I go too deep and it all becomes too pointless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What if, events have happened that are similar to now, and as we exist within the same space, we are fed the information from the past, therefore repeating it?</p>

<p>I forgot what it was called. It&#39;s a theory that suggests cyclical sharing of information and then there&#39;s this other one suggesting consciousness is everywhere. It&#39;s like we&#39;re robots being given programs to run but what if we realize it and break the code. What if we have to gain next-level consciousness to avoid the pitfalls of birth and death?</p>

Maybe it&#39;s just me, but in a way, that&#39;s kinda fun too; to be caught up in this moment of imagination running wild coming up with all sorts of possibilities.

<p>Maybe when you go a bit beyond the Holy Grail, and you get into the deeper/darker aspects of this world, you&#39;ll start to come to terms with the fact that there is a very high probability that there is a secret evil cabal of people working to install a New World Order. This may just sound like a fantasy world to you, but many people here believe that this cabal is intertwined with occult practices involving numerology, trauma induced mind control, and blood sacrifices. Look into Hollywood. Look into MKUltra. Look into our FBI that told MLK to kill himself. Look into the Finders Cult. Look into Israeli agents that operate pedophile rings to blackmail politicians. Look into Harvey Weinstein and his Mossad agents. Look into 9/11. Look into USS Liberty. Look into predictive programming. It&#39;s not a joke. </p>

<p>Maybe if this is &quot;all pointless&quot; to you, then r/Weeniehutconspiracies may align a bit more to your liking. </p>

<p>Sorry if this comes off as bitchy. Have a good one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see this kind of argument all the time by &quot;non-conspiricists,&quot; which almost always stem from 1 of 2 logical fallacies: argument from incredulity, and argument from ignorance.</p>

<p>If you are actually serious about learning about this, then you can start with James Perloff&#39;s book &quot;The Shadows of Power.&quot; </p>

<p>A very brief summary of the NWO is this: the top 1% of wealthy families, oligarchs, bankers, and CEOs have formed various coalitions to ensure a revolving door between their organizations and governments all around the world. The most prominent of these organizations are the Council on Foreign Relations, Bilderberg, and the Trilateral Commission.</p>

<p>The CFR has its tentacles firmly entrenched in the US government. They have had members placed in high levels of government, including the President, since the days of Woodrow Wilson. The Trilateral Commission was the brainchild of the CFR, and like the CFR has a revolving door to the US government, the TC does the same with governments around the world.</p>

<p>Their goal is simple not in scope but in vision. They wish for one world government dominated by the 1%, with the most power in the hands of the .01%. This one world government will be the marriage of the corporate state, military industrial complex, and intelligencia, which will birth a truly dystopian technocratic society. </p>

<p>Western countries (in general) are receiving many luxuries from these crimes against humanity, but it won&#39;t always be this way.  Some day, the slaves won&#39;t be &quot;over there&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, a lot of us believe some really far out things. Personally, mine are mostly political/NWO in nature, and mainly from about WW1 and on. But I&#39;m constantly expanding my knowledge and coming to new conclusions!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thing is though, the NWO conspiracy isn&#39;t far out. It&#39;s documented fact. Members of the CFR and Bilderberg like Kissinger, Rockefeller, and Brezenski have plainly stated their intentions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, I agree with you. I guess people find it hard to believe that they affect policy in an organized way in pursuit of their goals, or something. I&#39;m not sure why some people find it so hard to believe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I have a friend like that. He accepts that there is corruption worldwide but somehow can&#39;t believe that it is organized. Whenever I bring up specific points like the CFR, Brzenski&#39;s &quot;The Grand Chessboard,&quot; technocracy, etc, he just shakes his head and says &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; and leaves it at that. Love the guy, he&#39;s one of my best friends, but it is a little frustrating.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The oddest thing is that people who I guess are politically on the left will dismiss the idea of an organised conspiracy based on dynasties of rich families, yet complain about the 1% having all the wealth. Is it much of a stretch to think that incredibly rich families will institute policies to remain incredibly rich?</p>

<p>The political conspiracy is written about quite extensively in their own words, they know most people won&#39;t bother to read the books and they&#39;re usually quite dry and uninteresting so they aren&#39;t exactly page turners that people will want to read, but the evidence is there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This guy has the right idea.  There are so many different rabbit holes, sometimes conflicting, that muddy the water.  Also, tons of these if not the majority, are likely provided to us by whomever.  With the kind of information sharing technology these days, you cant shred what you want to hide, you have to bury it in similar but ultimately incorrect information.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best part is you read the thread about Challenger, you kept your mind open to a theory someone has.  In the end it didn&#39;t seem credible to you and you moved on.  </p>

<p>There is no way in hell any of us can research every way we are being lied to.  There are things I never thought could be conspiracies, someone on r/conspiracy posted solid research on it, and it set me off researching.  Sometimes I walk away entertained, but sometimes I walk away thinking maybe Oswald didn&#39;t act alone.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its not that everything is a conspiracy. However most of the time, most people, are not telling you the most. That breeds a world where people are untrusting because look at like 90% of mainstream events and they&#39;ve found something they find fishy. The whole challenger thing is weird. I don&#39;t know what really happened but I know nasa isn&#39;t above lying to the entire world so they probally should never be trusted. That&#39;s probally how most feel. Not putting it past them cuz they lied about the moon landing, what else are they willing to lie about?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, it&#39;s the nature of the game.  If we started ignoring some conspiracies based on our personal biases (that are built heavily on media and outside influence) then we risk missing the real ones.   It&#39;s boils down to due diligence I think.  You have to have an open mind to seriously look into a lot of conspiracies that turn out to have some validity.  </p>
