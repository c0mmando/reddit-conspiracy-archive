      <p>
       I ask this question because this new line of defence doesn't make any sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter Page has been fascinated by Russian energy companies and investment for decades. He has been employed in Moscow investment banking since at least 2004.  He described himself as an energy consultant with Gazprom and claimed he was involved in billions of dollars of deals with Gazprom (not that I believe him). Carter Page even got a PhD in Russian and energy companies in 2011.
      </p>
      <p>
       In order for this theory to be plausible, you have to believe that the FBI trained Carter Page and sent him to Moscow back in 2004. Then you have to believe that they would get one of their assets to get a PhD in Russian and energy practices. Once Carter Page became noticed by the SVR in New York back in 2012/2013 due to his "fake" history with Russian investment banking and his "fake" PhD, the FBI then would tell Page to cooperate with SVR agents and sent them folders with bugged devices. The other person that is mentioned in the SVR court documents then has to be Carter Page, even though the court documents have clearly stated that they are two separate people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the FBI gets Carter Page into the SVR influence ring, they personally warn someone that they already control, which makes zero sense, that they are being recruited by the SVR.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once they warned Page, the FBI would then get Carter Page to work as an adviser to the Kremlin for a couple of years. After a while, the FBI would then get their asset to work for a campaign in March 2016 as a foreign policy adviser. Even before they opened a counter intelligence investigation into the Trump campaign, the FBI was plotting to take down someone that was still in the middle of the Republican primaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the FBI gets their asset onto the campaign, they create 4 "entirely false" FISA warrants to spy on their own asset. This is the single most confusing part of the theory. The FBI committed fraud 4 times in order to spy on an asset that they already controlled. If they already controlled him, why wouldn't he just wear a wire, like the FBI did with Papadopolous?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now for those people that believe this theory and still do, fine. But are you going to continue with this defence once Felix Sater and Michael Cohen are exposed for having long running ties to Russian organised crime? Because these two people are the biggest legal liabilities for Trump and have been working for the Trump Organisation for a long time. Michael Cohen especially is going to be legally problematic for Trump, considering his involvement on the campaign.

       FBI controlled Page in 2004 while he was in Moscow &gt; forced him to get a PhD in Russian &gt; forced him into an SVR spy ring &gt; then warned him about something theoritically he would have already known about &gt; lied about his involvement in the SVR ring to a court for no reason at all&gt; then forced him to go to Russia to work for the Kremlin &gt; then forced him onto the Trump campaign before they even started investigating the campaign &gt; then created FISA warrants to spy on their own plant.

       <em>
        already

       occurring, but we will have to wait and see what the truth is. Either way, it is very clear that the FBI knew he was their asset up until 2016, when he suddenyl turned into a potential 'foreign spy'.

       Again, in order for Carter Page to be a FBI asset, the FBI would have had to create a false statement for Male-1's involvement in a 2013 spy ring for no reason at all. Then the FBI would have had to apply for a FISA warrant on their own asset, which makes zero sense, and commit a crime to conceal the identity of someone that they already 'lied' about back in 2013 for no reason at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Explain why the FBI would commit crimes in 2013 to conceal an asset of theirs for literally no reason at all?

       Because they were literally applying for a FISA warrant to spy on a private citizen who was running for president.

      <p>
       You have this weird assumption that there is "no reason at all".
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason is that crooked people abused the FISA system, and then used Carter Page as a patsy to cover their ass.

       Because apparently you have no idea what a FISA warrant gives you access to. A wire. You can't be serious.....

       As if a wire is in the same universe as the power a FISA warrant grants you.
      </p>
      <p>
       A FISA warrant would essentially give them the ability to comb through the NSA database of ALL PHONE CALLS/EMAILS/TEXTS/CONVERSATIONS of all people two degrees of separation from Carter Page, as long as those records have been collected. GET IT?

       If the FBI had applied for a FISA warrant, they would have to prove that their asset is actually an agent of Russian intelligence, which makes no sense at all. The FBI and the DoJ would have to lie from the top down that Carter Page never worked for the FBI and was totally a Russian agent the whole time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Placing a wire on Carter Page is entirely legal if he was an agent/informant for the FBI. Getting a FISA warrant on their own asset is illegal because the FBI would have to lie to a FISA court about Carter Page's work for the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, why would the FBI commit a crime in 2013 in order to eventually spy on a campaign in 2016?

       Then by this logic, the FBI should have never put a wire on Papadopolous and fraudulently applied for a FISA warrant on him. After all, they could do the exact same thing what they did with Page and commit more FISA fraud.

       They are two separate events that seemingly have to do with one another on the surface, except for Page's continual involvement with the FBI as an asset at this exact time. And you do not have evidence that there was a FISA warrant in 2013.

       I never claimed that there was a FISA warrant in 2013. I claimed that in order for this theory to be correct, the FBI would have had to conceal Page's work for them in court when they reported the activities of Male-1. Which would make no sense for them to commit a crime in concealing Page's activities for them back in 2016.

       If they had access to everything with Carter Page, why did they put a wire on Papadopolous and why did they put a FISA warrant on Manafort?

       If Page knew everything and was in contact with everyone on the campaign, there would be no need for the FBI to surveil Manafort and use Papadopolous as an informant.

       Male-1 in the deposition is not described as an under cover FBI agent at all. If Male-1 was an undercover FBI agent, that would be making a false statement. In the deposition, the FBI clearly identifies the under cover agents and the confidential sources they used in the case, but nothing about Male-1.

        The court documents say that Mr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital, provided documents about the energy business to one of the Russians.

       The fact that Podobnyy was the only one in the spy ring that interacted with Male-1 throughout the entire transcript and only mentioned first meeting him in 2013.

       I mean, it's possible. But then you have to start asking why is the CIA running operations within the United States, cause that is against their charter. You still also have the question of why the FBI would get a FISA warrant on a known CIA agent.

       These people you are arguing think FISA is a perfect little secret court.  Absolutely no civilian oversight.  Yet blind trust that they are running a tight ship with no potential abuse.  Like why would someone abuse a secret court with no public oversight to spy on a political opponent?  Especially if they assume they are going to win and it won't be a problem to bury it because its all classified anyway.

       So is Paul Manafort going to be an FBI asset too considering he had a FISA warrant placed on him both before and after he joined the campaign? The FBI places FISA warrants on their own assets, because that totally makes sense.

       are the same person. If they are, then it's simply true that the FBI considered him an employee in March 2016, then told a judge he was an enemy spy in October 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       The line you want, or ought to want I suppose, is that he was a
       <em>
        double-agent
       </em>
       , and the feds only figured it out late in the day. Hence the overkill Title I warrant, hence even some cut corners in the application process. He was a russian spy all along! He only went undercover for us to throw us off his trail! And now he's on trump's campaign team?! Jesus this could be the beginning of a coup! To hell with protocol, we gotta get ears on this guy! And so on. Works much better.

       Which would be a crime that the FBI committed for no reason at all. The FBI would be lying on a 2013 court document for no reason.
      </p>

       You also need to believe that the FBI would create 4 FISA warrants with completely false information to spy on someone that they were already in control of. Which makes no sense at all. If Page was an FBI informant and the FBI wanted to use him to spy on the Trump campaign, it would make total sense for him to wear a wire, just like Papadapolous did.

       They don’t name CS1 or any UCE, they refer to them that way to avoid naming them. The theory I’ve seen basically just posits if Page was an employee in 2014-2015 that was trusted enough to aid in a spy ring breakup, how did that change into “we can’t trust this guy he’s a spy”.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, would it have made a difference for the FISA court if it was disclosed that Page was an undercover agent whose work led to a spy ring breakup and 1 Russian national conviction less than 2 years prior.

       Yes, it would be a crime for the FBI if they lied about an undercover agent in order to spy on a campaign that they were never even investigating at that point.

       The FBI would essentially be committing crimes in March 2016 for no reason just to conceal a previous 2013 crime that they committed again for no reason.

       It presents it as a possibility. It doesn’t present it as “fact” that he wore a wire, which is how you presented it. Not every “proactive cooperator” is an undercover agent. Flynn is a “proactive cooperator” that’s how he got his plea deal. Did Flynn wear a wire too? Maybe, but no one knows any of these to be “facts” outside of Mueller’s team.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, yes you’re correct with Male-1 also being utilized and reported as being Carter Page, but he’s named in an earlier section of the document than CS-1 or UCE-1/2.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not out of the question that Carter Page could be both Male-1 and CS-1. They could’ve designated him as CS-1  in that section to purposefully differentiate that individual from Male-1 in order to further safeguard the identity of a confidential informant. Now I’m not a lawyer/investigator, I don’t know if that is completely against protocol, maybe it is. I just don’t think that you know with 100% certainty either.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are very loose with throwing around “facts” when the reality is the best any of us can do is propose theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way you’re presenting your arguments is as if they are factual. The FBI has an entire department devoted to investigating money laundering schemes international or otherwise. If there’s something on Sater and Cohen it will come out, but it will come from the FBI, not journalists writing articles conflating associations with certainty of impropriety. And journalists writing articles that are relying on other journalists articles to bolster confidence is misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       A shit ton of Russian money has flowed into Manhattan and international real estate over the years, these guys deal in Manhattan and international real estate. It is virtually certain the oligarchs linked to Cohen and Sater have purchased real estate from numerous other individuals and entities, is every single seller/administrator on these deals guilty of money laundering? No. Are the deals scrutinized, I would assume yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re saying that you’re sending info to journalists. That’s cool I guess, but if you’re just digging through public articles and making connections based on a preconceived notion of certain guilt, well that’s a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are your sources? Are you interviewing the subjects? Do you have a team that plays devils advocate with you to combat confirmation bias? I have no idea, maybe you do. I’m glad you’re interested in this. Just don’t throw around allegations like they’re factual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same applies to the theorists on the opposite side of the spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reality is none of us actually no WTF we’re talking about.

       My investigation is entirely focused on public real estate records and court documents. I found out about Cohen's father in law's tax fraud conviction from public court records. You can actually view bank fraud funds going to his business Ukrethanol from public investment reports that Grain Alliance puts out.

      <p>
       Carter Page literally got his PhD in Russian. He's worked his entire life in Russian investment banking and Russian energy consulting. If you read the resume that he was giving out, you would clearly see his connections to Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter Page's connections to Russian intelligence were given to the top congressional leaders in 2016. Harry Reid threw a fit as soon as he found out that the FBI was concealing Carter Page's connection to Russian intelligence. Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnel would have known as well in fall 2016. Both Trump and Clinton were breifed on Russian interference, which I assume would contain the same reports that were given to Reid, Ryan, Pelosi, and McConnel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Carter Page's connections to Russian intelligence was reported on in the fall of 2016. If Trump believed the reports that were out in the fall of 2016, he would have steered away from Page entirely. The problem is, Trump does not consume the reporting that would have warned him of this fact.

       Trump himself had access to these reports, as congressional leaders had been notified of Page's connections to Russian intelligence.

       There is no lie on the 2013 document. That is the point. In order for the FBI to use Page as an asset in the 2013 SVR spy ring, they would have to conceal that Male-1 worked for the FBI. Nothing in the court documents indicate that Male-1 was working for the FBI.

       There is no evidence that they lied about Page. This are theories concocted by making an assumption that a person named UCE-1 met Sporyshev in 2012 is the exact same person named Male-1 that met Podobnyy in 2013.

      <p>
       People are making that assumption because they don't want to believe that Carter Page was actually recruited by an SVR ring and actually had 4 FISA warrants prove with additional probable cause on each warrant prove that Carter Page was an agent of a foreign government during the 2016 election.

      <p>
       No, because UCE-1 interacted with Sporyshev in 2012 and Male-1 interacted with Podobnyy in 2013, who recruited him. Sporyshev never recruited Male-1. It's a fun theory, but it doesn't hold up to scrutiny.

       Sorry, I wasn't clear. When I ask 'why are people making that assumption', I mean the actual people making that assumption, what are they basing it on? If you asked them, what would they say?
      </p>
      <p>
       Probably not, 'because I don't want to believe xyz', where xyz is your version of the story. Probably they'd talk about the similarities in the accounts, that uce-1 and male-1 both at NY energy companies, both ferried documents with bugs hidden in the binding, those sorts of things. You've heard these things, it's not possible that you haven't.

       I suppose the point is, you need to be able to articulate the argument that you are contending with. Otherwise you're not contending with it, you're just being a nuisance. And someone as sharp as you are should aim to be more than that.

       They are basing their assumption based on 2-3 press reports that discuss UCE-1's work for the FBI and the inveractions with Sporyshev in 2012 as well as the court documents that discuss Male-1's interactions with Podobnyy in 2013.

        Curious Journey of Carter Page
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       He worked for Merrill Lynch in Moscow in 2004 on energy deals. Merrill Lynch is assuredly not a Russian front.
      </p>
      <p>
       He got his PhD from the University of London in 2011. You make it seem like he got it in Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       The theory, I agree it’s pretty out there, is that he was either the Confidential Source, or the Undercover Employee that passed off binders with recording devices that greatly aided breaking up a SVR spy ring. The reporting is he was merely questioned and released.
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn’t have to work for the FBI at any time prior to the spy ring breakup for the theory to work. When he is attempted to be recruited and brought in for questioning by the FBI, if at that point the FBI taps him to help record the SVR spies, it is fair to question how did the FBI trust him enough to aid their spy ring breakup, but then think he became a Russian Spy less than 2 years later? If he helped break up the spy ring, why would Russian intelligence trust a guy that had already burned them?
      </p>
      <p>
       With Sater, Loretta Lynch is on record stating he played an invaluable role in providing information leading to convictions of Russian mafia and La Cosa Nostra members. So Sater seems like a shit person, but his only documented intelligence dealings to date were in aiding a 10 year investigation wherein he supplied invaluable information. That’s from Loretta Lynch’s confirmation hearing. He was ultimately fined $30,000ish for his association that led to him ultimately cooperating for 10 years with the investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, Cohen f’ed over powerful people, why would those same types of groups trust a guy that had previously burned them?
      </p>
      <p>
       With Cohen, I’d have to see what you’re alleging. He was working on a Trump Tower Moscow deal, but that fell through.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see the suspicion over money laundering given these two guys seemingly have no qualms over where money comes from, but I don’t see the collusion angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did Russia want a Trump Tower deal so badly that they figured they’d try to swing the presidential election? I’m assuming there are “foreign built” hotels in Russia that were developed by parties that weren’t the President of their nation at the time. It just doesn’t make sense. “We need to get this Trump Tower built, we better make sure Trump gets elected. It’s the only way.”
      </p>
      <p>
       And assuming that Trump was implicated in a covert money laundering scheme across two decades, why on earth would you want him to run for president thereby multiplying his public profile 1,000 fold.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t run illegal money laundering rings, but I have to think if I did, I’d force everyone to keep as low a public profile as possible. The President is scrutinized more than any other person in the US, why would you want an existing principle in a money laundering scheme to run for President?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention Putin cracked down on money leaving Russia, that’s why the Chinese took over from the Russians as the biggest foreign real estate players.
      </p>
      <p>

        Putin and Russian Capital Flight
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       If Trump was knowingly helping these people funnel money out of Russia, Putin would be no fan of Trump’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I’m not even arguing that Trump’s not connected to some shady shit, I’m just saying both sides are doing some mental gymnastics here when information comes to light that doesn’t jive with what they think is going on.

       In order for this entire paragraph to be correct, Carter Page has to be Male-1 and UC-1 at the exact same time, which makes no sense. The FBI would be lying on court documents for no reason at all and lying about his work for the FBI for no reason at all.

       Russian spies can use useful idiots. It's entirely reasonable, considering the SVR spies are on tape discussing how stupid he is.

       He aided prosecution because he was going to go to jail if he didn't. He ran the entire racketeering ring with Gennady Klotsman and Sal Lauria. He comes from Russian organised crime and continued to operated as such after his plea deal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sater has laundered millions for Kazakh criminals that found its way into Trump Soho. The entire Bayrock corporate structure was a racketeering enterprise designed to launder tens of millions of Maskevich and Arif mining proceeds. Both him and Daniel Ridloff have a lot of explaining to do about what they did as employees of Bayrock and of the Trump Org.

      <p>
       Cohen's ties to Russian organised crime go way back. He was laundering money for a Russian mafia extortion scheme involving a Russian NHL player back in 1998. His father in law was convicted for tax evasion conspiracy in 1993. Cohen was involved with organised crime figures in a massive fraud scheme on a Florida gambling cruise operation. Him and his brother laundered millions from Ukranian bank fraud orchestrated by Viktor Topolov from 2010-2014.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a ton of other things with regard to Michael Cohen that is going to come out. I've done a ton of research into Michael Cohen that I've been sending to reporters about.

      <p>
       That's why Trump set a red line for his finances. He knows he wasn't personally involved in any collusion. He knows where he got his money from though. He knows who owns his Deutsche Bank loans. He knows who Felix Sater is.

       Putin cracked down on oligarchs that weren't doing his bidding.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Putin had an actual problem with money leaving his country, then he would have no problem with the Magnitsky Act, and he would have never let his intelligence agencies murder Sergei Magnitsky. Every single oligarch that Putin is close to has billions stashed overseas. Putin himself has billions stashed overseas.

       This is exactly why Trump has drawn a red line in his finances for Mueller. He does not want anyone to look into them.

       Assume what you say is true.  How is it illegal?  We are not at war with Russia.  The group that does not want friendly relations between Trump and Putin are the NWO globalists.  The NWO globalists want a one-world government, and Trump and Putin are against it.  It makes perfect sense for Trump and Putin to work together to prevent this evil from occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, that is exactly what is happening.  The Rothschilds are selling off assets, the NWO globalist infiltrators in government are being exposed and are panicking.  We keep getting closer to taking control of the Federal Reserve.  Putin already took control of banking in Russia, which is why he is demonized.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American voters back Trump because we do not want to be governed by a one-world government.  In fact, we are not governable at all.  Certain people have committed Treason, and they will soon be dealt with by the American patriots.

       So, this is what won Trump the election?  I am still unclear about how exactly the Russians influenced the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.)  Did the Russians change the ballots?
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Did the Russians influence the American voters?  If the Russians influenced the American voters, then when did this influence begin?  We will be able to see a change in the polls and media coverage.  I remember that Hillary was favored to win by a large margin the entire time.

       How did Russia influence the elections?  Nobody has been able to answer this question, including the FBI.

       You were asking whether Trump was involved in illegal activities. Trump won the election because he accumulated enough electoral college votes. Winning an election does not excuse you from any crimes you or your campaign officials are involved in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone like me is interested in criminal activity by the President and his ties to Russian organised crime. I find the development deals that the Trump Org was involved in, as well as the employees that the Trump Org hired to be fascinating.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking into the campaign, I also find the cast of criminals that Trump hired to run his campaign to be absolutely breathtaking. I find the crimes that they were involved in both before the campaign, during, and after to be extremely intriguing.

       Later, after building his cover, he was used as bait to bring down a couple of genuine Russian spies.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a CIA agent, the FBI could not legally expose his identity, even if they wanted to. Likewise, they might not have even known he was an undercover agent until they "warned" him about his contact with the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       By that point his cover was blown anyway, so he then began acting as an agent for the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you find it suspicious that a man that graduated in the top 10% of his class at the US naval Academy and holds a PhD was described by one of the Russian agents as an idiot?
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, that's exactly what a deep cover CIA would want the Russians to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, it's all speculation, but it does fit the known facts.

       Wait so is it collusion with the Kremlin or "ties to Russian organised crime" now?

       As far as Carter Page the verdict isn't out yet as far as I am concerned.  We don't really know much about him.  He has openly worked with Russian Companies, not a crime. Claims to have worked as an advisor to Putin on a resume.  That's really all we know about him.

       I think some more stuff will have to be declassified for us to find out for sure.  But it's possible it contains too much information on the methods of the FBI or something that will be non-partisan agreeance to keep it classified. Could get interesting.

       The FBI will properly have them indicted for the crimes they've committed such as money laundering and tax evasion. This is just nonsense. Like it's ok that Trump is owned by Putin on the basis of some FISA issue. Please! Page, Cohen, Sater and Trump are corrupt to the core.

       Same with

        In other words, would it have made a difference for the FISA court if it was disclosed that Page was an undercover agent whose work led to a spy ring breakup and 1 Russian national conviction less than 2 years prior.

       Yes, it would be a crime for the FBI if they lied about an undercover agent in order to spy on a campaign that they were never even investigating at that point.
      </p>

       The FBI would essentially be committing crimes in March 2016 for no reason just to conceal a previous 2013 crime that they committed again for no reason.

Public disclosure of the defendant’s initial appearance, however, would significantly undermine his ability to serve as a proactive cooperator.

       The Special Counsel specifically said that if Papadapolous was exposed as an informant, his cooperation would be useless. Meaning he was helping record conversations for Mueller.

      <p>
       Your free to interpret that statement as you will. I just don't see how it doesn't explain Papadopolous was being used to record other suspects.
