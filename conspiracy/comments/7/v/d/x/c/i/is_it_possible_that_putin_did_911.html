<p>More so, wouldn&#39;t Putin have had a very keen interest in the slow slide towards authoritarianism that&#39;s occurred since 9/11? The same slide that&#39;s allowed Donald to rise so quickly, and such power?</p>

<p>I mean, doesn&#39;t it all seem a bit odd?..</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov">Saved the world from global thermonuclear war</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Vasili Alexandrovich Arkhipov (Russian: Василий Александрович Архипов, IPA: [vɐˈsʲilʲɪj ɐlʲɪkˈsandrəvʲɪtɕ arˈxipɔːf], 30 January 1926 – 19 August 1998) was a Soviet Navy officer credited with casting the single vote that prevented a Soviet nuclear strike (and, presumably, all-out nuclear war) during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Such an attack likely would have caused a major global thermonuclear response which could have destroyed much of the world.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad">Kicked the Nazi&#39;s ass at Stalingrad</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Battle of Stalingrad (23 August 1942 – 2 February 1943) was a major confrontation of World War II in which Nazi Germany and its allies fought the Soviet Union for control of the city of Stalingrad (now Volgograd) in Southern Russia.</p>

<p>Marked by fierce close quarters combat and direct assaults on civilians in air raids, it is often regarded as the single largest (nearly 2.2 million personnel) and bloodiest (1.7–2 million killed, wounded or captured) battles in the history of warfare.  It was an extremely costly defeat for German forces, and the Army High Command had to withdraw vast military forces from the West to replace their losses</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, actually Putin used 9/11 to try and build a rapport with GW.</p>

<p>Russia had experienced terrorism for many years from Chechen rebels and others in Abkhazia etc.</p>

<p>Putin was the first leader to call GW after 9/11 and he struck a tone of cooperation to defeat terrorism (bear in mind Russias economy was dying in the early 00s).</p>

<p>Alas, color rebellions in Gerogia, Kyrgyzstan and Ukraine caused Putin to rethink his stance - if us supported popular revolts in those countries could be successful - why not Russia? This was really when Putin decided to basically ignore rapprochement with the west and leaves us in the position we are today.</p>

<p>Ps guess who watched the frontline episode about Putin last night? Lol</p>

<p>Highly recommended</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would Russia want us intervention and agression in the middle east that favored Saudis, thier chief economic competitor to the oil and gas demand of Europe, attcked thier allies, and threatrned a US-Russia forced mistake draeing us into a possible hot war or prolonged ramping up of the military around them?</p>

<p>It would br more likely in Russias favor to have a more pacifist America who isn&#39;t threatening to blow up or overthrow thier allies every week. This notion is reinforced by Russia picking up anti war joitnalists from  the US that got kicked off corporate media for now toeing the line.  Lee Camp, Jessie Ventura, Thom Hartmann, Ed Shultz, all anti war and American Imperialism voices. Most whom backed Bernie Sanders - who was the peace candidate last election. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t really make sense.  The Pentagon &quot;lost track&quot; of $2 trillion, and the Navy had their accountants move to the newly refurbished wing of the Pentagon to work on tracking it down.  That was the wing that was attacked on 9/11.  Putting together the likely motive, it seems that factions within the US Government are the most likely suspects.</p>
