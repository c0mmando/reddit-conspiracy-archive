        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">18</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-05 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/ifyourheadexplodes.html">ifyourheadexplodes</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So now Quentin is in the news. I&#39;m sure you&#39;re familiar with the details. I think he&#39;s guilty as sin and there&#39;s probably way worse shit we haven&#39;t found out yet.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s something a little bit interesting. So his first movie is Reservoir Dogs, and the opening line is spoken by Tarantino himself, about Kabbalah worshiping Satanist Madonna, and her song like a virgin. In a film where virtually every character is ritualisticly sacrificed for the sake of the plot. And who&#39;s most recent film did virtually the same thing, and who&#39;s next film would be about one of the darkest, most demented pieces of Hollywood history (and one of the most filled with conspiracies, read up on Laurel Canyon if you have some time). The Tate LeBlanca murders. </p>

<p>Also, if we&#39;re counting Kill Bill as one movie (as Tarantaltino says he does) that would make the now probably soon to be canceled Manson movie his 9th film, a number frequently associated with Satanism, especially Dante, who claims the final level of hell to be the 9th level, where the devil is frozen in a lake. And Tarantino has already shown he notices the numbers of his films, titling his last film Hateful Eight, after the fact that it was his 8th film. A Clockwork Orange (Mr. Orange?) was Kubrick&#39;s 9th film and Beethoven&#39;s 9th symphony plays a major role in the mind control sequence. The year of the films release, it became the anthem of the EU. </p>

<p>In the movie, Mr Orange mentions the Lost Boys. A film which at this point 3 male actors have come forward, saying they were abused while underage. And the fact that the plot of the movie is, what the hell else, blood drinking, Satanism. Only this time, it&#39;s also super homoerotic too. Just like Reservoir Dogs.</p>

<p>With a bunch of the same actors as Stand By Me, Kiefer Sutherland playing virtually the same role as primary antagonist, a weird ass movie about a bunch of kids finding a dead kid. And then of course one of the cast members dies super young, River Phoenix. Whose family it turns out was actually in a super abusive cult. Go figure. Oh and Feldman&#39;s character is being abused by his dad. Yup. </p>

<p>But now back to The Lost Boys. And of course the 3 different actors, Haim, Feldman, and that guy from Bill and Ted who played one of the vampires. All of them were abused, and Haim died because of it. OK, now it&#39;s getting a little odd. </p>

<p>But of course it gets worse. Turns out, Mr Orange, the character who mentions the Lost Boys? Well he was played by Tim Roth, who was apparently sexually abused by his grandfather. Oh and it turns out he looks EXACTLY like Corey Haim in 1991, the year of Reservoir Dog&#39;s release. And also Madonna. Very bizarre, gender ambiguity stuff, brainwashing mind control stuff. </p>

<p>Corey Haim 1991 <a href="http://cineplex.media.baselineresearch.com/images/285231/285231_full.jpg">http://cineplex.media.baselineresearch.com/images/285231/285231_full.jpg</a></p>

<p>And then of course where does the term Lost Boys come from? Well that could straight up be another post this length, i can&#39;t go into that, but PLEASE look it up, the guy who wrote Peter Pan is fucking nuts. </p>

<p>Lemme leave you with this. What was Michael Jackson&#39;s ranch know as? Yup. </p>

<p>heres another tip free of charge since i like you. dont trust rose mcgowan either. she can be as outraged as she wants but she&#39;s the one who voluntarily worked with victor salva, convicted pedophile who used his hollywood studio to make cheeze pizza with a 12 year old star of his movie</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not sure she didn&#39;t wake up recently and realize what she was condoning with her inaction.  And put on the spot ans knowing she would be sacrificing her career she lied to herself about that director.  It&#39;s not uncommon in abuse survivors.  We can even punish ourselves by finding or latching onto another abuser/predator.</p>

<p>I was sexually abused by my uncle he was a teenager and I was 5.  I was destroyed inside but defended him.  It&#39;s some kind of survival mechanism. We disassociate and then convince our more vulnerable self it didn&#39;t happen or it&#39;s not what it was or even that we dreamed it.</p>

<p>And if we know MK Ultra and other mind control goes on with victims then how do we know she wasn&#39;t drugged and programmed at the time too.</p>

<p>Maybe it took that terrible accident that disfigured her to help shake her out of it?</p>

<p>Her hair makes me think of guilt and grief ravaged women who cut their hair off severely in shame.  I did it once.  I was also cutting myself. I didn&#39;t do it often but I did it bad.</p>

<p>Also women entering nunneries shave their heads letting go of who they were and the outside world.</p>

<p>Maybe I am too empathetic with her.  But maybe I also have a similar perspective.  My heart aches for her and while I resent this phoney me too movement it&#39;s in My because I know the enablers hijacked it for the power play and to further violate her for ruining their special system.  I guess women who sold their bodies had a better chance at becoming the next A lister and they liked that verses actually needing talent.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>everyone remembers brittany spears doing this too, and saying she wanted &quot;everyone to stop touching me&quot;, but nobody ever really questioned it and let the story become tmz tabloid clickbait, instead of asking the real question of what would make someone at that level of success act that way. </p>

<p>i am aware of the very blurry line between abuse victim and perpetrators, especially factoring in mind control. its honestly a struggle to sort out responsibility but i am in no way saying that just because feldman and mcgowan and the other pawns arent coming clean with the unvarnished truth that they should be set upon and strung up. i am simply cautioning against taking their word at face value or believing that their stories are the beginning and the end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Repeating over and over that Russia interfered doesn&#39;t make it true. They met with a Russian lawyer, your jump to thinking that somehow all Russians are avatars for Putin is the same kind of jump in logic that you get irrationally angry at pizzagate people for. </p>

<p>Having pictures of children tied up, known FBI code and symbols for pedophilia, Clinton intervening on behalf of Silsby and other human traffickers, art of children being abused. Theres tons of evidence but you&#39;re not interested because you&#39;re a partisan creep.

<p>James Alefantis playing with his god daughter in a public restaurant isn&#39;t child abuse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you know what appealing to authority is? You should look it up before you try to argue. Maybe the FBI, CIA, and NSA should prevent evidence, but I guess they don&#39;t need to when they have people dumb enough to shill for their investigation in between their advocation for pedos.</p>

<p>You should learn not to strawman as well, where did I say they got her off? I said intervened. She ended up serving six months for &quot;arranging irregular travel and her co conspirators served no time. She now writes software for the Amber Alert System, but I&#39;m sure that wouldn&#39;t bother someone with the moral character of someone like yourself. I guess we&#39;ll never know if theres a connection as long as we have people like you spending all their free time making sure theres no investigation. Keep doing what you do, people notice when you guys constantly kvetch about Russia and obfuscate for pedophiles and it doesn&#39;t make you look good. Take it easy creep.</p>
