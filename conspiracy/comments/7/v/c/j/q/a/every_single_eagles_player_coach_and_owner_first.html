       something felt odd about all the players and management interviews. all start by praising god and the coaching.

       Maybe you just hang around people who can't handle hearing the name Jesus without getting upset? Giving glory to God isn't as crazy or weird as you think.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the NFL did tell them to. Maybe it was scripted. But if ONE team mentioning Jesus gets you riled up, imagine how a nation of "fly over state" and former mining town Christians have felt watching what's happened in the NFL this last season.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just saying that it looks like the pendulum is swinging the other way and if you can stomach all the bending over/kneeling and preachy high horse leftism, you can't complain when "the right" begins to make moves against "the left".
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even watch NFL. I'm just saying if hearing Americans thank Jesus is scary, you really may need Jesus.

       Eagles were one of only six teams than never took a knee this season during the anthem. I don't think that's coincidence.

       Yes Jesus is King and it is refreshing to see other believers proclaiming His name on a grand stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       OP it wierds you out because you are having a negative spiritual reaction to the name Jesus.  No other name will do this to you.  Jesus was and is, and will always be the truth.  He came to save us from Hell and the free gift is still available, but it is you that must make the decision to embrace it and accept the gift.  It is called becoming saved, born again, and accepting Christ into your heart and repenting

       That is a link about how Jesus is literally just the semi modern day western cultures version of worshiping the sun and stars. God if you must is simply the human mind trying to rationalize the unexplainable and cope with things it doesn’t understand therefore it created “god” which over hundreds of thousands of years has evolved into what you call Jesus, because white men figured out how to exploit the average persons insecurities, fears, and wants and make money and gain power through it.

       Yeah, they were pressured to thank god instead of budweiser and Disney world. Recently on npr I heard that military recruitment is down, so maybe could that being related. Definitely a nationalism thing.

       The team and coaches doing it was no surprise. They always tend to start off like that when winning, or doing interviews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Foles did it so emphatically, because he's from a die-hard Christian home. He even had the WWJD wristband, which still didn't bother me. He's a good dude, so whatever makes him happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jeffery Laurie produced films and having a guy in the business in the Eagles box didn't surprise me. Maybe they're banging or friends. Laurie was originally a Boston guy/ Pats fan, who wanted to buy them, but then settled on the Eagles when he couldn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       What sat wrong with me, was the push of the term 'WORLD Chamions" and "fans around the world" bs. I always blew off the notion of expanding, but they were forcing that shit last night. The Eagles also play over the pond next season, so it's good marketing to have the SB champs overseas pushing the idea. With the XFL coming back in 2 yrs, the NFL might be making their move to pre-empt it's success.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong. I love my team. I love we finally got our SB. I'm overjoyed Brady got shut the fuck down, BUT, there is the tiny,  nagging feeling of my Paranoid Schizo side screaming out, "You just got played! They handed you that game to push an agenda! Look how that foot was OOB on the TD catch! Didn't you hear the announcer scream  and go ape-shit over it, saying it should have been overturned?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I tell myself to stfu, at least for one day, and enjoy it, even if shit is going on, because at least the little kid I used to be, finally saw Philly get one.

       The halftime show was noticeably less satanic than last year also. Maybe the satanic references will be fewer in popular media for a while as more people have now caught on to the elite's occult leanings.

       It's all mockery.  They are doing this before literally kissing a crafted idol made of silver.  The entire thing is basically a gigantic Babylonian ritual.
