       It's easier that way.  I could explain why you can't speak honestly about politics, religion, myth, legend, conspiracy, and history without triggered downvotes but I'm sure most of us get the jist.

       Your question is too vague.
      </p>
      <p>
       What parts of Reddit are you upset about? It can't be all of Reddit because you consider this part to be fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any examples? Because people disagreeing with you don't mean they're anti-intellectual. You might be wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are people dogmatic about that has you upset? Is it actually an opinion or a proven matter?

       I think i have to agree with cisvotr here about people being very dogmatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the base of the word is exactly what reddit is founded on.
      </p>
      <p>
       When i think of the most simple explanation i can use - dogmatic basically just means trying to prove something without facts or evidence. Like if you say it louder *(or with more upvotes) its going to become true. And unfortunately it happens all too often on reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one proves anything - instead they post alot of opinions - the unpopular ones drop out of site to the bottom as the get loads of down votes. And the hive mind popular ones - soar to the top. If
       <strong>
        (the average reddit users)
       </strong>
       read something on the top pages of reddit everyday often enough - its going to start to sink as if it were true.....even though in many cases - its totally false and/or unprovable

       The problem with that attitude is that people will want to start a group with you of some kind if you are vocal about the desire to think independently. Look at Jordan Peterson per example. He preaches individualism and self dependency and many of his fans are completely dependent on his perspective on almost everything.

       It's designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator.  You can't even post on some subs unless you have enough 'comment karma'.  You literally need to circle jerk the sub before you are even allowed to participate.  Galileo Galilei would have been shadowbanned from the astronomy subs.

       These social media sheeps, they have tags like 'liberals' or whatever. They represent 'free thinkers' fair enough, they love good old revolutions, fair enough, they love freedom, fair enough. Im sure as individuals they actually good people who are like us people on this sub but the diferemce is they are afraid to show it among their own groups. Its a gorup mentality which leads them to be victims of disillusioned reality. Its like social media played a crazy role and defo has destroyed society itself. People live their lifes, fair enough, it could be shit or good, mediocre ranging from shit to amazing but somehow social media plays a role. Sort of like "i need to be relevent", maybe it is human nature to be attention seekers, or social media gave us the power to actually have a chance being 'famous'. Social Media brings out a cynical, disillusioned, sheepish side out of the mass and those make perfect sheeps. Social Media catwrs to your arrogance, vanity and subtle masochism such as SJWs. People dont fear society but fear the people that fear society itself and this is why humans are complex. Most sheeps know the gov is bad but they dont act on it unless there is a 'trend' to talk about it freely without being called 'weird'. It pisses me off tbh when people say "Im woke", that half empty statement mean jack shit and just lile the saying cuz they heard it from Netflix. Tbh we are all sheeps but some of us are pretty much wolves in a sheep's clothing.

       Because a manipulated sense of morality is the new intellectualism. This means you can actually be the smartest person in the room if you are vocal about your group think because you have the moral high ground. That’s why they are encouraged to shut down debates rather than engage in them. They can’t win the debates and in turn this helps to ensure nobody else hears them

       George Orwell wrote abut this exact phenomenon in
       <em>
        1984
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Ironically, even people who claim to have read Orwell's book will shut down debate if you bring up the topic of

        war fakery

       -- one of the central topics Orwell wrote about in

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       People claim to be 'awake', they claim to be 'open minded', but watch them turn into parrots when challenged on their faith in the telescreen stories about 'war'.

       Reddit is dogmatic because it's average age coincides with college kids. Colleges (as Noam Chomsky said) are a selection process to weed out critical thinkers and to reward conformists.
      </p>
      <p>
       What did Nietzsche say? "The surest way to corrupt the youth is to teach them to respect those who think alike, rather than those who think differently."
      </p>
      <p>
       (Millennials are the most conformist and Statist generation in American history. They're sycophantic before authority, and trained to be contemptuous of those who challenge conventional wisdom or propose original ideas.)

       States [of belief] and scale [of knowledge].
      </p>
      <p>
       To what degree do those that encompass the vast human population seek truth and knowledge as a life-goal?
      </p>
      <p>
       IN that, how many people then have to subsidize their overall debt of knowledge and understanding of complex material happenings, combined with the amorphous human conceptual universe and models of the world - their identity and ego in development with their debt of knowledge in compounding accumulation - ALL OF THEM DO.
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast amount of necessary knowledge, to be known and is unknown... well, It makes a person feel 'lost'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially when they are brought to an intellectual test of their true depth of knowledge; particularly in debate and duels of reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       This makes a person adjust their scale of knowledge, and debt of such, towards 'faith'. They double-down on the degree of knowledge they do have, to structure their 'map of reality', into making sense to them, with personal meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusion: PEOPLE, by nature of their scale and limit of conceptions, regarding the complexity of how the universe in material form matches that conceptual model they hold, needs gaps filled with inflated beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further:
      </p>
      <p>
       Their dogmatism is a defense mechanism from the observing of their own debt of knowledge, and the gaps that are exposed in belief, through actual exploration of their meanings.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence, it's safer to use rhetoric than ever directly engage in formal debate, for more people in the western world not economically or habitually acclimated towards argumentative reason.

       I think a lot of that was the original reddit tribe's in your face behavior. but
      </p>
      <p>
       Then reddit got big and became packed with all the paid posters and a great place to expierment with AI comments and all the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Paid posters not only for political issues but of course the paid corporate propagandists from companies like Monsanto, the climate change deniers and other special interest groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       No I consider a high percentage of the junk comments to not be from actual individual ideas but made with deliberate manipulative intent using prepared scripts and troll like attacks.
