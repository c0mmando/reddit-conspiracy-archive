        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’m just so sick and tired of of these people. They’re so annoying. These types of people come up a lot in my YouTube feed and they drive me through the roof.</p>

<p>Yes I believe in a lot of what they say. But what good does it do to spend 5 hours breaking down all the Illuminati and Masonic symbols from Justin Timberlake’s frickin halftime performance? Who cares anyways can I not enjoy music anymore?</p>

<p>I’m sick and tired of symbolism and numerology and biblical references and names. I’m just tired of it I want facts. Cold hard facts. I want to know the real news like how well the world economy is performing and the power struggle in the Middle East and anything with great implications really. I’m tired of worrying about Lil Pump or celebrity blank being a Satan worshipper.</p>

<p>And the facts that conspiracy theorists fail to point out are often the most simple ones. How much is spent on the military? Who is the military working for? What are special interest groups up to and what laws are in place that give them an unconstitutional, anti free market advantage? What is the federal reserve up to? What is the IMF up to? Who’s printing the money? Who’s financing war? Who is benefiting from war? Who benefits from recessions and depressions? Is there actually a spy grid and who has access to it?</p>

<p>Like please put more effort into answering these simple questions instead of showing me how Rihanna has been possessed by a demonic spirit or showing me a frickin blood sacrifice ritual conspiracy. I don’t care and frankly it is extremely rare and doesn’t affect anyone. What does affect everyone is the scumbags that manipulate markets and finance war and promote their degeneracy and their sickness onto the general population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is all disinfo. </p>

<p>Masons and symbolism are real, and that line of thinking presented by the people you are talking about has certain merit, but very limited specialized meaning. The whole Illuminati Satanism ritual bullshit is disinfo to dilute the very real issues of 9/11 truth, war, banking, and growing inequality. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Not many people knew of the illuminati before the 2000s. When it started becoming a thing, the people in charge decided to zoom and focus on it and treat it like as a distraction / backfall for everything else they&#39;re looking to hide.</p>

<p>If you ever wanna know what&#39;s really going on, we could have a conversation sometime :) </p>

<p>I remember hearing of the group in the mid 90s when I was a child. I heard about it from another child. They were surprised that I had never heard of it. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t for the life of me wrap my head around why you would lie like this. Claiming the Illuminati is a new thing that started in the 2000s? What? People were calling themselves the Illuminati literally hundreds of years ago, it&#39;s not even remotely new. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Which lie? Wtf??? Maybe you misunderstood. </p>

<p>When I&#39;m talking many people, I&#39;m talking MAJORITY. When was the illuminati talked about so vaguely and frequently? by celebrity influencers, main stream media news and 98% of the majority??</p>

<p>It became a trend and rose up and is now used in MEMES as a fucking joke for gods sake. In 2000. I&#39;m damn sure a lot of people didn&#39;t have internet until the 2000s. Like wtf are you on about?</p>

<p>You&#39;re literally telling me you barely knew about it in the 90s until some friend of yours whispered it to you. Which isn&#39;t even the point because I was bringing up how it&#39;s used to frequently compared to when no one know what it really was like they do now - a secret society</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Illuminatus! Trilogy was written in the 70s,  Cosmic Trigger I: The Final Secret of the Illuminati - 1977, The Illuminati Papers - 1980, Masks of the Illuminati - 1981, Foucault&#39;s Pendulum - 1988, The Historical Illuminatus Chronicles - 1980s-1991, Foucault&#39;s Pendulum - 1988, Fallen Angels - 1984, Michael Romkey novels in the 90s, just to name a few popular places from before 2000 and Dan Brown.</p>

<p>But yes, the internet made things more widely accessible and I think the Dan Brown novels were significant in raising this awareness and kind of helped bring the topic to the mainstream.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I wish it was that simple and easy. Haha.</p>

<p>There are a lot of different reasons, perspectives, opinions and theories...</p>

<p>Ultimately what&#39;s been predicted through books like 1984 and Brave New World, the elites are looking to unify the whole world and create a New World Order where everyone&#39;s religion, currency and purpose is just 1 - and that of the elite..</p>

<p>But I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s much bigger than this.. It&#39;s really hard to manage 8 billion people. You know a big whole world is inside each human being.. come to think of it, ordinary people have struggles managing their lives, habits, thoughts and day to day relationships/friendships on a daily basis as is. I highly doubt that a group of humans would be able to manage 8 billion people and create complex systems (propaganda, religion, banking, internet, etc.) to keep the masses alive/spending.. which brings me to my point that will make me sound crazy  (at least fellow redditors would think so).</p>

<p>I think that the aliens that we so openly accept and have learned to normalize (through movies, memes, frequently joking about them) do exist. We were shown all the content and truth to desensitize us before they revealed it to us so we couldn&#39;t be as mad or upset that we&#39;ve been being lied to this whole time. </p>

<p>So, basically, I think these extra terrestrial beings exist and they&#39;re working closely with archons / shapeshifters / politicians / bankers / (maybe even normal humans) / the elite.. I think these guys are trading human DNA for space technology. This is how we&#39;ve been able to develop so quickly as a race and species..</p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more to it.. you can hit my inbox up and I&#39;d be happy to talk more about it..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually your pretty much a long the same lines as me. </p>

<p>I figured the DNA swap for tech like when I was 11 years old man. </p>

<p>I believe we were Tiamat originally, Mars aliens came and were aggressive, we didn&#39;t like this, they were stronger, blew us the fuck up, earth is either a chunk of Tiamat or massive amounts of debree reached Earth. </p>

<p>I believe there is even more happening. Although we are trading human DNA for technology, we are unaware of the capabilities of this technology, specifically we have recently been made aware of tons of hardware backdoors in most computer systems, we have no idea what these machines are actually leading to. </p>

<p>If you want my opinion, there is something powerful WITHIN us that something is working to extract/destroy/break down, trying to make hybrids etc etc, they are after something we have, that they cannot seem to get, not easily anyway. </p>

<p>as for the &quot;illuminated ones&quot; they did exist in the 1400-1500s (my dates might be off) and certainly still do to some degree, they were after all just a sub-set of Freemasons who felt they were worthy of running the world.</p>

<p>they are powerful for sure, but i doubt they are anywhere near as powerful as most of the claims. hell they probably feed the rumors because it builds mystique and makes recruiting easier.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only way you will ever know the truth, especially in today’s day and age, is  if you do the research yourself. With help of the Internet, disinformation and propaganda run rampant, but there are bits of truth. </p>

<p>I’m not saying all the Illuminati conspiracy videos are disinformation, but you shouldn’t blindly believe anything without doing a bit of research beforehand. </p>

<p>I believe the Illuminati are still very real and have a major influence all over the globe. From banking conspiracies to depopulation conspiracies-I believe they’re all connected. </p>

<p>The power is with the people, that is why there are so many division tactics going on. From sports teams to politics, it’s absolutely ridiculous. The population is manipulated from birth and constantly throughout their life, but we can still stand united, it’s never too late. </p>

<p>The people are not weak, the people hold the greatest power. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you want facts then its not a theory. But you can get to the facts only if you do the right questions and elaborate (create a theory) on it.</p>

<p>But facts are harder to come each passing day. MSM is fabricated reality most of the time, internet is vulnerable to shilling.</p>

<p>If you want to be sure 100% of anything, keep it to a level when you can go out and check/test it yourself.</p>

<p>Anything beyond that requires some degree of faith..</p>

the answer to most of your questions is the sovereign military order of malta (wall st), knights of columbus (in the us) the jesuits (all intelligence agencies and its operatives around the world, the mafia, and religious and scientific doctrines) and the royalty and nobility around the world (the shareholders).  industrialists (rockefellers) and billionaires (gates, soros etc) are called court factors and court jews, iow proxies to the vatican and nobility to act on their behalf publicly, while the really powerful families can enjoy a tranquil life away from it all.  the rothschilds are &#39;merely&#39; the guardians of the papal treasure, not a capstone of any kind, but important and powerful operatives for the vatican</p>
