<p>Do these &quot;look&quot; like they were dropped from a plane? Must have been a pretty soft landing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mattis said Sarin and that there was no proof.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say the same thing I said the first time. Syria isn&#39;t going to use chemical weapons when they&#39;re actually gaining ground and ISIS is all but gone. Russia would probably pull support.. which is why this continues to be a claim used by the US and their mercenary forces.</p>

<p>Beyond that news..</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget the Kurdish female fighter that was mutilated..</p>

<p>The claim that a US made MANPAD took down that Russian fighter.. Syrian special forces are in the area where Russia took out the terrorists responsible. They&#39;re looking for remains of the MANPAD used in order to trace the serials.</p>

<p>Talks of a possible direct conflict between US and Turkey</p>

<p>Claims that N-Norea is supplying Syria with weapons</p>

<p>...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It just seems like every time there&#39;s an escalation in violence or Syria gains ground there&#39;s claims of chemical weapons. Granted it&#39;s possible but it doesn&#39;t seem probable or logical.. especially with Russia breathing down their back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things went down in Idlib recently...</p>

<p>Russian warplane shot down:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/FSAPlatform/status/959839291047374848?s=17">https://twitter.com/FSAPlatform/status/959839291047374848?s=17</a></p>

<p>And...HTS, formerly know as Al-Nusra Front and Al-Qaeda have been becoming very unpopular there. People are sick of them and their letting them know.</p>

<p>Al-Nusra has a proven history of using chemical weapons..</p>

<p>So, it could have gone down like this..</p>

<p>HTS gets told to leave..they don&#39;t like that...Russian plane gets shot down..HTS knows there&#39;s going to be repercussions to the downed plane..Russians and Syrians are gonna come looking.</p>

<p>HTS waits till planes or helicopters are incoming...launch a chemical attack on the citizens in Idlib that have been giving them a hard time.</p>

Im not dissing the sport as im an NFL fan myself but i doubt Superbowl is a good distraction for any evenrs such as rite now in Syria, maybe to the americans.
