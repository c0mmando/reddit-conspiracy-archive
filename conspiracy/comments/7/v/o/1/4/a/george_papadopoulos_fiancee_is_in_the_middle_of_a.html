       It’s probably because Nunes said yesterday that Trump never met Papadopoulos (even though photographic evidence proves that wrong) and after George was arrested Trump distanced himself from Papadopoulos by saying he was just a coffee boy.... so his fiancée wants people to know that he was someone important.

       I don't think Nunes was aware that Trump met him. Both campaigns worked with countless volunteer advisors and I'm fine with exploring PaPa related leads. But if PaPa isn't anything more than a lucky to be there drunk we have problems.
A paid for fantasy dossier + PaPa are not good enough reasons to spy on a rival campaign and launch an investigation when you loose.

       The photo of him at the TIHDC meeting of the NatSec team was widely circulated around the media when he got arrested. Nunes would have to have buried his head in the sand not to know that.

       I doubt this picture or meeting keeps Nunes up at night. He forgot or was not aware. It certainly doesn't further justify spying on Americans. Forming a policy team and hosting media is not illegal. It is commonplace. Can you tell me everyone Clinton met,worked with or was photographed with? Those people should be ripe for FISA warrants.

       You can't tell me why when faced with the same scenario FISA warrants were not issued for Clinton and company. Via the path the FBI took anyone can be spied on without cause. Is Mueller leading a sham investigation?

       You don't understand how FISA warrants work.
      </p>
      <p>
       A completely separate warrant application was filed in 2016. Each successive renewal every 90 days required
       <em>
        new
       </em>
       probably cause.
      </p>
      <p>
       To say that this is explained by a 2013 warrant is....naive at best. Especially coupled with the new information that Page was working as an FBI asset.

       Find the illegal activity. Please, anything, as it‘s been a year of Mueller and 30 lawyers and the only Russian crimes I have seen involve Uranium one and that fabricated Russian Dossier. Now you have a picture with the liar Popadopoulos, wow! Lol

       I have to imagine Trump was fully aware of anything Papadopoulos was doing.  Just loke he was aware of Flynn ( was warned about it ffs), knew that sessions had meetings with Russians, knew that his son met with Russian officials to discuss the Maginsky act, knew that wikileaks wanted to help his campaign, knew that saying on TV, "release the emails" was a directive and not just a joke......And then they just play stupid.

       Your timeline is wrong. The DNC emails were released on July 22, Trump made that statement on the 27. So it could not be the result of it.

       More than two months after Trump's statement. You're comfortable assuming a causal link to this statement with that timeframe?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also remember what Trump actually said. He was speaking towards the 30,000 emails that Clinton deleted for putatively personal reasons. None of which were included on the Podesta leak, to my knowledge. Given this and the timeline, are you really sure there is a causal link between this statement and what happened?

       No, that WikiLeaks clearly and undeniably worked to help get Trump elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason that any time anything bad happened for Trump during the campaign, another "slow leak for maximum impact" of Clinton's emails would come out.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason Assange refused to release the info he admittedly had on Trump.

      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason they felt they needed to "dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality," especially given the fact that WikiLeaks' official Twitter was hawking "Bill 'Dickin Bimbos' Clinton" tshirts, and sharing right-wing propaganda memes about Hillary's health in the run up to the election, while not saying a word about Trump.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's completely absurd. Here's the timeline of leaks:
      </p>
      <p>
       July 22, DNC leaks get dropped in one giant batch. Supposedly their intended deadline had been earlier that week but they missed the deadline and had to scramble to get the material out before the convention several days later, probably because they had to rush to get out the AKP emails on the Erdogan government on July 19, after the failed July 15 coup in Turkey made the material particularly relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oct 7, after days of building hype in the media, the Podesta leaks started. A batch of Podesta emails was published
       <em>
        every day
       </em>
       from then until the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Access Hollywood tape also came out on October 7, but had been
       <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2016/10/11/donald-trump-hurricane-matthew-access-hollywood-leak/">
        scheduled to break on NBC several days later
       </a>
       because they didn't want it to compete with Hurricane Matthew coverage, but then someone leaked it to the Washington Post to break on Oct 7. I know the implication is supposed to be that WikiLeaks timed the initiation of their daily Podesta leaks based on the Access Hollywood tape, but they had been building hype for days, and it was the Access Hollywood tape that was pushed up via leaking to another outlet.
      </p>
      <p>
       On Nov. 6, there was a second batch of less dramatic DNC leaks was released to little hype. According to
       <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/08/21/julian-assange-a-man-without-a-country">
        The New Yorker's Raffi Khatchadourian
       </a>
       , "A WikiLeaks staffer told me that they worked so fast that they lost track of some of the e-mails, which they quietly released later in the year." It isn't clear exactly what Trump scandal that was supposed to be distracting from, if any.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just not seeing this alleged [pattern of WikiLeaks dumps "any time anything bad happened during the campaign". The Oct 7 overlap is the closest it gets, but takes ignoring the fact that WikiLeaks had been steadily building hype for their release and that it was the Access Hollywood tape that was leaked to break sooner.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, he stated the reason at the same time -- because all they'd managed to get on Trump paled in comparison to everything that was coming out of Trump's own mouth.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        There's a reason they were in contact with Trump Jr., asking him to push stories that Trump himself then tweeted out 15 minutes later.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You mean the link they suggested Trump use
       <strong>
        if
       </strong>
       he linked to their stuff, the one they'd set up to try to get around Twitter's censorship of WikiLeaks-related tweets? Yes, they were trying to fight back against censorship being imposed on their publications by having high-profile people who were likely to link to them use a url that wasn't yet being targeted for censorship.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, they stated that reason in the exact same message: because the Clinton campaign was constantly slandering them as pro-Trump/pro-Russia. I wonder why
       <em>
        The Atlantic
       </em>
       decided to truncate the message before that part in their reporting.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        while not saying a word about Trump.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's just a lie. They have been consistently critical of Trump as well as Clinton. They've also publicly solicited submission of Trump tax returns in addition to trying to convince Trump Jr. to submit them.

      </p>
      <p>
       With the Russian thing, if anybody is stupid enough to believe someone conducting a hacking operation wouldn't be behind several VPNs/proxies and basically entirely untraceable is not thinking at all. The only reason server logs would point to the Russian government is because somebody intended it to.

       The Trump campaign was warned that the Flynn was compromised.  We don't know the whole story since there are still pending charges against Flynn and what the resolution of those charges will be.  But yes he lied repeatedly, supposedly even to the vice president about discussing sanctions with the Russians.  I don't know how that conversation went but I am assuming there is a very good reason why he lied about it to the FBI.

       Thank you for confirming what I just told you, that Michael Flynn's only crime was lying about a conversation that
       <em>
        itself

       was not illegal in any way.

       I assume so as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't assume, like so many people, is that it is evidence he had nefarious purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       In fact, because he was blocked from testifying his story in front of open Congress, I would argue that he lied on purpose to be able to actually testify on the record about what he knows. Which is a lot.

      <p>
       But I wouldn't expect you to understand that. Or have any idea what it means to fall on your sword.

       Fuck sakes. This thread is 50/50 upvotes to downvotes. I have no idea what the hell is going on. The mission to make everyone so fucking frustrated that they just give up trying to figure out what is truthful is working on me :(

       Thank you for confirming what I just told you, that Michael Flynn's only crime was lying about a conversation that
       <em>
        itself
       </em>
       was not illegal in any way.

       You can't tell me why when faced with the same scenario FISA warrants were not issued for Clinton and company. Via the path the FBI took anyone can be spied on without cause. Is Mueller leading a sham investigation?
      </p>
      <p>
       You guys like to pretend Clinton doesn't exist. She was a major player in the election. She is involved in an investigation into the FBI/DOJ. Please no one mention Clinton?
