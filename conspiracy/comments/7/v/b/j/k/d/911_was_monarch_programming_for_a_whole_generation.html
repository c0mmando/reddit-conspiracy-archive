       9/11 was programming humans to hate humans therefore further dividing humans and creating hate, fear, indifference to easily control the masses. There's proof everywhere..

       I don't think humans ever needed a reason to hate other humans.

       You know how strong humans would be if we cooperated, shared and worked together completely? You know, humans only survived because they learned to work as teams - thus helping them expand from groups of 100 to 1,000s to tens of thousands.. We work better as TEAMS. We evolved that way. Which means we work better with love and the good things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, the indifference created when we hate each other because of skin, gender, sexuality or religion, is really damaging and it really creates gaps in everyday human life. If you're not willing to stick up for a stranger just because they're black or Muslim and you let them die, you're letting the people in charge win and letting them tighten their grip on us.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you CREATE and FUND a war based on fear, unconsciousness and ignorance, do you know how easy it is to control it and twist and manipulate it in their favor? They want to create a New World Order..
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you're right. We did need a reason to invade the Middle East. Their main goal was for the whole world to see Muslims as terrorists though.

       No. That's social conditioning. If that were true we wouldn't have interracial babies or the genetics of Neanderthals (the human species before Homo Sapiens that we allegedly lead to extinction)

       I told you, social conditioning.. this was due to no knowledge of survival or how to make tools.. or how to kill prey. Or resources.. or family feuds. These are all man made. Or even fear. Those lead to tribal war..

       I would say I know the earth is flat and that big pharma is in cahoots with certain influencers about diet and medication.  But the flat earth part, is really a belief until I visit Antarctica (it's important to be honest about this classification I believe). But it is important to note that I know the earth is flat as much as someone else knows the earth is a globe, if that makes sense. With the distinction being that most globe believers will not admit that their idea of a globe earth is still only a belief (until they become an astronaut and see earth from space for themselves).

       Well, I think "someone else" is a little vague. It's true that most people "know" that the Earth is round without really thinking about it. But there are a good number of people who actually have first-hand experience of the "spheriness" of the Earth, because they have to use it in their daily job.

       For Antarctica, I would just want to travel from one end to the other, stopping at the South Pole. The goal obviously being to settle the debate for good (I'm aware of the impossibility of this).  If it wraps around the globe, awesome. If it doesn't, awesome. Either way I don't really care. I just would rather like to see it for myself before I can really know one way or the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "someone else" part I was referring to is anyone who hasn't personally verified the shape of earth themseleves. This includes engineers of spacecraft I do believe. Even includes geodesy surveyors (a recent one made some wild claims, that they don't actually measure the curvature because it has already been done and there is no reason to do it again). Yeah, he really said that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yea if I was allowed to travel across the Antarctic unhindered, then I would be very very pleased with the results regardless of what they may imply.

       That sounds pretty extreme, and not very useful. What about sailing around it with the coastline always in your field of view ?

       Well, I don't know the context of what he said. I can only imagine that he meant that surveyors don't have to measure the curvature again, because we already have sufficient data.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I do believe that geodetic surveyors can certainly measure the curvature very easily. And you can do it yourself also, you just need a theodolite (you can rent one for a day for less than 100$), and a little knowledge of geometry.

       Well, the Antarctic trip will provide unquestionable results. While the circumnavigation could have more excuses provided for it. For example, I forget the bird, but they supposedly migrate around coast of Antarctica. They were tracked by wildlife researchers and they had travelled over double to distance of the circumphrence of the globe to travel around Antarctica. That is basically the same observation as the birds I would argue, and that got very little traction, people just don't care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah your on the right track, essentially he said they have faith in the book provided that has the proofs and measurements, which is really just a series of geometry equations. The whole belief and trust thing is the main issue I have with most of these topics to begin with.

       It can measure the deviation from the zenith angle of two distant points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, a theodolite is a telescope where you can have an extremely precise measure of the angle between the line of sight of the telescope, and "the direction towards which objects are falling in the vicinity of the telescope" (I'm avoiding the word "down" because it is slightly misleading in this context). In other words, it's a telescope with a spirit level, but with a much better accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now take two theodolites, and place them at a great distance from each other (typically, a few miles) but sufficiently close so that you can aim each one towards the other precisely (there are some crosshair inside the scope that allow you to do this with great accuracy).
      </p>
      <p>
       If the Earth is flat, then the vertical directions are parallel and hence the sum of the two angles measured by each theodolite should be 180°. If the Earth is spherical, then the vertical direction are not parallel, and the sum of the two angles should be 180°+the angle corresponding to the section of Earth circumference between the two theodolites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, you should do many measurements, at various distances, and various heights, with various conditions to control the other variables, and reduce the margin of error.

       Jeranism is a professional con artist. If you didn't understand it already, then I'm slightly disappointed about you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me get this straight. A few month ago, Jeranism designed a test that was supposed to prove once and for all if the Earth is flat or globe. For this, he was planning on doing a line of sight measurement across a lake, and expected the following : on a globe, the line of sight should miss the target high, and on the flat Earth the line of sight would stay level from beginning to start.
      </p>
      <p>
       The test was announced in several videos, discussed in great details and there were very precise pictures showing that on a flat Earth, the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmRsYTm9m1Q&amp;amp;t=283s">
        line of sight should stay level
       </a>
       . So they all meet in november, tried to do the test but the results were somehow "inconclusive" and we never heard about it anymore. Jeran was announcing this test weeks before it happened. He made several videos about the settings, asking for advices. But suddenly, just after the test, nothing happened. No video explaining the results, or why it failed. (I just checked his channels, and almost all his videos except one are gone, which is not suspicious at all /s)
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesse Kozlowsky is doing the same kind of experiment, only with better instruments. He carefully placed his two theodolites at the exact same height above water. He used a theodolite to level his line of sight, which are much much more precise than the spirit levels that Jeran wanted to use. And he found exactly what is expected with the globe Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now, Jeranism is changing completely his viewpoint. He now claims that on a flat Earth, the line of sight will always miss the target high. In complete contradiction with his previous claims. In complete contradiction with the argument he wanted to use for his november test. And his viewers all agree like nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you cannot see how dishonest this guy is, I can't help you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now about what Jesse said, it seems to correspond to what I thought. He said that it's not necessary to do it all over again, but that he CAN do it. And even better, he exactly does it in front of everyone, and shares his results. It's not about faith, he says very explicitly that it piqued his curiosity and that he did the measurements again himself for fun. His measurements confirm the globe model.

      <p>
       Thank you for that video, it's interesting. I would like to be convinced but I cannot help but notice that the video is doing a very incorrect assumption to prove his point.
      </p>
      <p>
       What he is saying is that the circle that goes south of Australia, Africa and south America is exactly 40000km-45000km on the AE map (at 2:30 he writes that). I had to watch it several time to check, but there is no doubt. He writes that exactly on his video, and uses this to say that the results match the flat model perfectly because 3x40000km = 120000km which is the distance measured by the Albatross tracker.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that's a complete lie. In the AE map, the distance between the North pole and the Equator is 10000km (the same as in real life, actually). That's one of the few things that are used by  flat earthers to compute the altitude of the sun for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       It means that the circle of the Equator on the AE map is already more than 60000km long. The circle where the albatross are flying is much larger than than, at least 80000km on the AE map (probably more than 90000km but let's be gentle).  Which means that if the Albatross are doing the trip only 2 times, they are already at 160000km distance. 40000km more than what was measured
      </p>
      <p>
       When computed correctly, the error on the AE map is much larger than the error on the globe. So I ask a very serious question : why are flat earthers always dishonest ? You linked here two examples of this. And I've explained with as much detail as I could why I think that these people are dishonest. As a conspiracy theorist, I hope that you can see that there is something shady going on here ...

       I've already shown my skepticism towards jeranism and he ae map/model.  I was sourcing the surveyor's claims about trusting the book, not Jerans. But the main difference between the alleged con artists is that jeran is not forcing you to fund his cons, while NASA is.  You are comparing a very small YouTube channel to a government funded program that was partially funded by nazis to deceive people.  That is like comparing the hobo asking me for a dollar to the federal government taking a fixed percentage of everyones income every year.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no doubt that any exact figures will be contested. The main point about albatross is that one lap in the Southern Hemisphere was greater than the distance around the equator on a globe. That simply cannot work on a globe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have clearly stated that I do not like the AE map for many reasons. You also are skeptic of the AE map, so we do agree on that.  So, using it to support your claim (and debunk mine) is dishonest as well, and similar to a straw man argument. You do realize that, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I do see a lot of shady shit going on, but we clearly have different perspectives. That doesn't mean we can't be civil though.

       I'm curious, do you agree that one can prove to themselves without a doubt, the shape of he earth, if they were allowed to explore Antarctica freely? If not, why?

      <p>
       Indeed. But Jeran is clearly emphasizing things that the surveyor did not really mean. This could distort your understanding of what he is saying so I thought it was important to let you know.
      </p>
      <p>
       He simply said that surveyors do not "measure" the curvature of the Earth in their daily job, because it was already done and so there is no need to do it again. That's not a very interesting claim. It's like saying that chemists are not proving that water is H2O every time they have to use water, because it was already proven. That's true, but completely obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I would like to add something. It's not like he said "I've never measured the curvature but I trust the book". Quite the opposite it seems.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire point of that surveyor experiment (or video) IS  to measure the curvature. We should at least agree on that, even if we disagree on his conclusion. So don't you think it's a little stupid to take a quote out of context where he says a general thing about surveyors not measuring curvature again (because it was already done several times), when the thing that he is actually doing is exactly a measurement of curvature ?

       There is one possibility where it can work. The albatross is not doing a race, so it's possible that the Albatross is taking a path that is not really efficient at all to go around Antarctica. (Because of air currents, fishes, islands, ...)
      </p>
      <p>
       And guess what ? if you look at the actual path of two albatross at 1:32 in the video you linked (which is taken directly from the
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4352845/">
        original article
       </a>
       ), you can clearly see that the birds are doing a very jagged path around Antarctica. Somehow, when the author of the video is measuring the length of this path on google, he is using a much smoother circuit than the path that was on the screen 2 seconds before.
      </p>
      <p>
       A smoother path is necessarily shorter than a jagged path. The smooth path is already 28000km long. I would not be surprised if the jagged path was more than 40000km long.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are not convinced by my argument, then  you should perhaps  read the
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4352845/">
        original study

       Here is a very easy way to prove the globe. Have two weights hanging from long strings. Measure the wider distance between the two at the top vs the bottom. If it's a globe there bottom will be smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or we could use gravity. The claim is that gravity is weaker the further from the core, to explain how the atmosphere can exist next to a vaccum with no barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
       So just prove that the weight is dependent on the height of an object. If you go to the deepest hole in the world and largest building, then you should see a difference in weight, if the earth is a globe. The same object would be heavier the closer to the core because it has more gravity.

       Moreover, if you dig a hole, and put your weight on the bottom of that hole, it will not necessarily be heavier. That's because there is something called the "

        Shell Theorem

       " which implies that you don't have to take into account the mass of the things that are above the weight that you want to measure. So you are closer to the core, but there is a smaller mass between you and the core.

      <p>
       Let's check together how precise you need to be. Let's say that the distance between the weight is D, and the distance between the top of the strings is D', and the length of the strings is L. And assume that the strings are perfectly vertical on a perfect sphere of radius R= 6400km. D and L are the parameters that you can modify for your experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
       The different distances are related by the following simple formula : D'/D = (R+L)/R
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this formula imply ? It means that if your precision is 1mm, then the difference between D and D' needs to be at least 1mm. From the above formula, it means that your parameters D and L need to satisfy the relation D*L&gt;6400 m
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       That's clearly not impossible of course, but it shows that there are some constraints. For an explicit example, if you have strings that are 6m long between two points that are 1km apart, then the theoretical difference will be around 1mm.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now, perhaps you start to see the problem. With the parameters given above, your distance measurements need to be precise to the mm on a distance that is around 1km. I don't know any easy way to have this kind of precision. Moreover, you need to be sure that your 6m long string is perfectly straight and that it does not deviate by more than 0.5 mm. A little bit of wind, or a small torsion in the wire, a change in temperature,  vibrations of the support will probably disturb the results by much more than 1mm.
      </p>
      <p>
       For all these reasons, I'm not very optimistic about the feasability of this kind of experiment.

      <p>
       You seem to have a very common, but extremely wrong, idea about the atmosphere and vacuums. There is no perfect vaccum directly next to a pressurized atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
       The air pressure continuously decreases as you go higher in altitude. This is a well known fact that you can measure yourself if you climb a high mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
       At 5000 m above the ground, the pressure is already two times lower than at sea level. At 10000m, it's 4 times lower. At 15000m, it's 8 times lower. This is the kind of data that is easily accessible because planes are flying at roughly these altitudes. 
The rule of thumb is roughly as follows : Each time you go 5000m higher, the pressure is divided by 2.
      </p>
      <p>
       So At 50km altitude (still officially in the atmosphere), the pressure is 1000 times lower than at sea level. This is already considered to be a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum#Measurement">
        medium vacuum
       </a>
       in the industry, and to reproduce such a low pressure at sea level with a vacuum pump, you already need some

        proper equipment
       </a>
       that cost a few thousand dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       At 100km altitude, the pressure is 1 million time smaller than at ground level. This starts to be considered as a "high vacuum", and we are still in the atmosphere. The

        Karman line

       at 100km is usually considered as the limit between the atmosphere and "outer space", but this is a completely arbitrary line. There is no discontinuity. The pressure continues to drop in almost the same way for the next few hundred kilometers.

       Let's make it more rigid so we can make a finer measurement. All we need to prove is that the distance gets smaller from A (distance at the top) to B (distance from the bottom). Let's not negatively assume anything, and just find a starting point for our data.
      </p>
      <p>
       It will be more noticeable the further the distance apart the beams are (assuming a globe shape), and obviously we can expect minimal to no difference on a flat plane (certainly won't be wider at the bottom). Your equation is misleading as you have them way too close together making it seem like we need that great distance when in reality we do not

       No. That's not really how science works. If you want to distinguish two models with an experiment you need to make sure
       <strong>
        beforehand
       </strong>
       that the precision of your experiment will be sufficient to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the problem in most flat earth video doing experiments. They never consider that their different measurements have a margin of error, and they never consider the consequences of small errors. They always underestimate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a stupid example, they will use a hand held spirit level to level a laser and make it point to a target 1 mile away, and expect to measure an 8 inches drop. This is not going to work.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Sure. But it will also be harder to measure a longer distance with great precision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it's easier to measure a 10km distance with a precision of 10mm, than to measure a 1km distance with a precision of 1mm ?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think you can be precise to the mm when measuring distances in the range of a few kilometers, then I'm curious to understand how you can do it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Your equation is misleading as you have them way too close together making it seem like we need that great distance when in reality we do not
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The formula is the formula, it's not mine. The difference on a globe Earth between the two distances will be (L*D)/R. Tell me how far apart the beams are, and how long they are, and this formula gives you the expected difference on a globe Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I took one explicit example to show you how precise your measurements need to be. If you have a better idea for the distance between beams and the length of beams, then say it.

       This is exactly how science works. You create a theory, then perform a test, record data, analyze, and adjust and repeat the experiment as needed to overcome any issues that may not have been thought of beforehand. Your being dishonest about your equation, and you don't need an equation! We're going to do the measurements in real life, so you don't need to try and predict it, we're going to measure it!  You can predict that they will be measurably closer at the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems you are having a hard time understanding how the distance between the two will result in a greater or lesser measurement. The smaller the angle, the more difficult it will be to measure, so we can throw out the 1mm distance idea, that's pretty useless for real life observations. Don't get lost in the equation, when oh don't have to.

       Yes. But you need to make sure that the settings of your test and the precision of your instruments are well thought to avoid inconclusive results.

       How do you know when it's necessary to adjust, or when all issues have been controled ? If you don't do this beforehand, then you let the door open for confirmation bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the test gives results that agree with your preferred hypothesis, you will stop there and state that your test was conclusive. If the test gives results that disagree with your preferred model, then you will try to llok for possible errors, and if you didn't think about possible problems neforehand, you will probably find one. Do you see the bias here ?

       I don't understand what that means. Do you think that the equation is wrong ?

      <p>
       Imagine that you make your test with beams at a certain distance, and with a certain length. You make the measurements as precisely as possible and you find a difference less than 1mm between the top and the bottom.

       I can predict that in a perfect world with perfect instruments, they will be measurably closer at the bottom.

       My problem is that we are not in a perfect world and instruments are not perfect. So you need to be sure
       <strong>
        beforehand
       </strong>
       that the imperfections of your test are not bigger than the thing you are trying to measure.

       I said it three times. I agree with the theory behind your test. I simply provided additional information that is necessary. If you have precise values in mind for the distance between the beams, and the length of the beams, then say it. I'm here to help you with this test.

       I was 11 and played them all the time. I feel like the games were gov sponsored propaganda because i never even questioned the gov/war until i was doing foot patrols through villages in Afghanistan.

       You know how strong humans would be if we cooperated, shared and worked together completely? You know, humans only survived because they learned to work as teams - thus helping them expand from groups of 100 to 1,000s to tens of thousands.. We work better as TEAMS. We evolved that way. Which means we work better with love and the good things.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, the indifference created when we hate each other because of skin, gender, sexuality or religion, is really damaging and it really creates gaps in everyday human life. If you're not willing to stick up for a stranger just because they're black or Muslim and you let them die, you're letting the people in charge win and letting them tighten their grip on us.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you CREATE and FUND a war based on fear, unconsciousness and ignorance, do you know how easy it is to control it and twist and manipulate it in their favor? They want to create a New World Order..
      </p>
      <p>
       But, you're right. We did need a reason to invade the Middle East. Their main goal was for the whole world to see Muslims as terrorists though.
