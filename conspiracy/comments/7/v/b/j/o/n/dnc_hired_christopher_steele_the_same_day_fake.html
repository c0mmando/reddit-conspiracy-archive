<p>&quot;June 20. Former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, [working for a firm called Fusion GPS], begins writing reports assessing Donald Trump’s relationship to business interests in Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>This is what they REALLLLLLY want to coverup. Everyone is freaking out about the memo but they&#39;re missing out on this HUGE piece of the puzzle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guccifer 2.0 first emerged on WordPress on June 15, iirc, and published the DNC&#39;s Trump oppo research with deliberately added Russian fingerprints the day after the Washington Post reported that CrowdStrike had detected Russian hackers stealing Trump oppo research from the DNC. And that article came out two days after Julian Assange announced they had forthcoming leaks on Clinton. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad reading you 2 converse. The big bad leftists are running the deep state.. while what? The Repubs and the executive are beacons of shining light that are only trying to protect you. The lvl of tribalism in here is staggering. I still boggles my mind you think the DNC is a left-leaning/liberal party. Your country is run and owned by the MIC and every single politician that means anything is a fully paid-up member which is why you have been at war for what the last 50 years? 60? No one in the white house gives 2 shits about the common man, just like no one in the DNC or the Repubs really gives 2 shits either. Just carry on voting for more war, more powers for ur Alphabets and laughing at people like you that really belive its the &quot;evil leftists&quot; u have to worry about or people on the left worried about the &quot;far right&quot; when your MIC is making billions without a care in the world. Mostly because dickheads like you cant stop listening to a narrative and propagate this division. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dougalishere I see your point and agree about it not being a right or left issue.  It is all about the elites.  There is a major global power shift happening and that is how 2 sides play into this.  You may ask, by choosing a 1 elite group over another benefit me? Depends on how you measure benefit and that is how parties get rolled into this.  I did not like the path of social issues being used as smoke and mirrors while our democracy was going away. Is trump the savior? Yet to be determined but I think having a non career politician who went to war with mainstream is what we needed to shake things up.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t Rule 6 about having a large percentage of caps lock though, <a href="/u/axolotl_peyotl">/u/axolotl_peyotl</a>? He only capped &quot;SAME DAY&quot;. His title was 76 characters long, &quot;SAME DAY&quot; is only 7, so that&#39;s about 1/11 characters capitalized, or 9%, to conform to the wording of the rule. I don&#39;t think that 9% is &quot;a large percentage&quot;, and I don&#39;t think anyone could possibly think that OP was &quot;shouting&quot;.
