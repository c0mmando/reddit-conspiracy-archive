       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/lT0BBZ9.jpg">
        good standup bit
       </a>
       about our blatantly farcical airport security theater industrial complex, and I guess I was at the right level of buzzed and stoned for epiphanies. The TSA is specifically meant to target well off people and get them used to authoritarianism in the most convoluted, sugercoated way possible. The kind of people who can afford to fly regularly and be annoyed at the antics of the TSA are the kind of people who can afford to buy past the microtransactional brand of tyranny levied on the urban poor masses, and are thus not beaten down enough for the ruling class's liking. So in machiavellian unison with doing that whole 9/11 thing to give them an excuse when it got out that we're all being wiretapped, they got an excuse to turn airport terminals into disneylandized internment camp portals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who knows what kind of hell-society they're laying the groundwork for with all this mass surveillance and police militarization/automation, but it's gonna be pretty fucking scary if we let it happen.

       The right kind of men would be traitors, which the state is damn good at discriminating against in their hiring process, and those don't look much like the service pistols I've been seeing lately.

       Oh bother. If you wanna get metaphysical on me, shit, it's been a while since I tripped balls and interacted with the transmundane but hell, I'll throw down. The nature of this world is hugely physical, the material and spiritual are functionally indistinct anyways. Those spheres inform and affect each other so much they're practically one. The conscious, spiritual aspects of our world and universe emerge from material interactions on every scale, and in turn affect and invent those same material interactions. And when powers collide in our locality, they're not praying or shooting arcane bolts, the most magical thing they're doing is weaponizing memes. When the shit hits the fan, it's men, guns, missiles and trucks that decide the outcome.

       I know for a fact that the physicality you think you feel/see is not physical at all. You are in spirit right now, in christ, with B-IO-LO-GI-CA-L stimulative elements specifically geared to help you transition into a body in the actual physical. This is to learn how to operate a body that is "separate but one" with you, so that when you're given one outside of Christ you will be "naturally tuned" to using it.

       See, I like Jesus, he was probably the most rad dude in all history until that socialism thing kicked off 'round the enlightenment, but I've yet see any evidence that he was magic or had any contact with god. And I very much doubt he is keeping me in some kind of Matrix simulation to prepare for my actual life, because from what I heard about the guy he seemed much more live-and-let-live. If you're actually right I'll take that red pill right the fuck now though 'cause I ain't about to let some creepy two millenia old jewish dude keep my soul in a vat of magic digital goo

       What makes you think that Jesus = Christ? Because of (first name) Jesus (last name) Christ? As in, the last name before Jesus was used was Christ...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Jesus" is in Christ, and so is this "world," so "they" can "meet."
      </p>
      <p>
       "Christ" is the reference to a place of common-ground(s) in which different types/forms of entities can meet... Like if you were going to meet God, you would meet God in Christ, because that is common-ground in which you both could stand together in forms which relate to each other..

       You're not wrong. I'm a million miler and never walked through one of the Rape-is-scan devices that Chertoff pushed illegally. I have since worked for companies that have paid the Chertoff Group and I have personally worked along side Michael Chertoff. He is pure, calculating, inhuman trash.

      <p>
       You are 100% correct about being an exercise to tame the "upper-middle class". I've had my junk groped aggressively was as a response to my rejection of the Rape-is-scan many times and still do occasionally if my answers our out of line with their questioning.

       I'm not an elitist by any means, but there is a personal axe to grind by a lot of the TSA folks that love to flex their little piece of authority over anyone that they might perceive as resistant to the training they are providing to the public. Training people to be compliant is good to a limit. It's a fragile balance.

       And you'll note, a lot of those folk are low income people with few oppurtunities. The scheme doubles as an employment program, and as the age-old tactic of autocracies sending the poor troops into rich neighborhoods and the rich troops into poor neighborhoods.

       Do you have specific historical examples of this? It's an interesting theory, and would be effective logically, but it seems like in reality, most violence used by autocratic rulers is top-down; the leader's troops stop rebellion. And any incidence of 'poor troops in rich neighborhoods' are the result of uprisings like the French or Bolshevik Revolutions, people fed up with the system take up arms. Are there examples in history where both sides are being played conversely against each other like you suggest?

       That's why the tactic of blatent duality is abandond. Today  it is more covert and split up in many levels of created dualities.
      </p>
      <p>
       By focussing on one part that is going wrong to one part of a population it is easy to get caught up in duality and completely miss all other points related to the same basic problem while sometimes adding to the problem at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       It are not a few people under attack, no, the whole of humanity is under attack on many levels simultanious. People are being distracted and kept in misery for many reasons, but the most importent reason is to keep us from uniting and finding out our true natural powers.

      <p>
       We are all humans, we are basicly all the same and all part of one. Fighting amongst ourselves over all superficial and created duality is hurting us all and makes that we miss the most important things in this "reality". Becouse all the biggering between us we are being distracted from looking into the actual source of all duality and it pushes us into a victom mode instead of the Loving mode we should be in. Our ego is part of the problem here and it shines through in any thought we have and action we make while creating our "reality".
      </p>
      <p>
       The above list of "dualities" only seem dualities in this 3D "reality" we are experiencing, if you start looking deeper within yourself you will find out we are indeed all one and everything is energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two energies governing this reality and one "rule":
      </p>
      <p>
       We all have created this maze we are in, the truth will show us the way through it and Love will shine a light so you don't need to stumble too much. Fear is used to create duality and negativety that is keeping us distracted so we don't see the truths that could lead us to the most beautifull path through this maze. But sadley enough many people will let themselves be led to the most dark locations some can think of becouse they get too distracted to even see the maze we are in.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the power for change within ourselves, but we'll need to figure out who we actually are and what we are capable of before we can use our power in the most effective and Loving way. Fighting over any created duality is not helping any cause and violence is even making the problems worse. In the beginning we are all one, there is enough for everybody and once we find the truth within ourselves there is no reason for fear left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Reasoning over any unnatural unbalance and trying to solve the actual problems can help, but we should include everything in these conversations and not get too focussed on just one (easy to miss-use) sliver of the huge problem we have as humanity.

       I get the "Pit side A verse side B" control mentality. But the claim was about playing each side against each other in a much more literal sense. I'd be interested in seeing information on not just putting rich white cops in black neighborhoods, but simultaneously placing under paid black cops in rich white neighborhoods. (or like wise situations.)

       Now i wanted to quote the last sentence and question of the OP to wich i replied, but that is gone now. A parafrase of his question was:

      <p>
       Do you know of anything in the past that has set 2 or more fractions up against each other?

       My reply was intended as a hint that these kind of "games" are being played for as long as the history of humanity and are still playing in the present.

       Thank you. If you strip away all decorations of religion, spirituality and even science it is all the same. We are all one, humans fighting against humans is literary fighting ourselfs on. We only seem seperated becouse of our ego and fears on this level of reality. Who could benefit from humanity being divided and in chaos and misery and why?

       This is the foundation of almost all true conspiracies, keeping the truth hidden and keep humanity from finding our our true powers.

       Only know one person who ever got a precheck thing o bypass the TSA, she is Canadian and makes a lot of money as a teacher so she flys a lot, mostly to Europe for vacations. From what she said it was a huge pain involving multiple meeting and checks eating up a lot of her time.

       My son and daughter-in-law do. They do fly often for work. But before that, my daughter-in-law would just tell them she was pregnant, so she didn't have to be scanned. (She's not--yet.) And she didn't have to be molested, either. Doesn't work for my son, unfortunately.

       Last time I flew I saw a line at the PreCheck longer than the line for the peasants. Then I thought, that's right.... clog up the works with unnecessary searches, slow everyone down THEN offer a speedier (PreCheck) way to board for extra cash.  Make people pay for what they were getting for free.    Brilliant.

       Oh I totally agree it's a scam. I don' think the TSA is protecting us from shit. But it's worth the $80 for 5 years of not having to go through their ridiculous charade of a security process. I kind of think the whole thing is dehumanizing and conditioning like the op is talking about.

       u/2clicksoff vastly over-simplified the process. It's not just a one-time fee and you're good to go. You have to apply, then go to an office in the nearest big city that has one for an in-person interview. They do look into you and people do get denied. A friend of mine got denied for his criminal history (over 10 years since his last charge).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while it isn't necessarily super hard as long as you have a clean history and no other red flags, and it is worth it as a frequent flier, it's not as simple as paying for the fast-pass at Disneyland.

       The operative word is "hell" for the drones--us. I was looking at that town in Kazahkstan today--Astana. That is a weird place. I wondered if that's the kind of place they're planning for the elites when, or if,  they take over? The Guardian had an interesting article on it a few years ago. They spared no expense.

       That commercial is creepy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's probably not a conspiracy, just the result of our culture accepting some of the dystopian norms that have become a part of modern life. I found this commercial to be disturbing too, where Samuel L. Jackson is some kind of interrogator trying to coerce people into using a certain type of credit card:

       Maybe. From my travels. I know the whole system is pointless. The fancy scanners always give me false positives. Specifically on my neck and lower legs. And the scanner clearly isn't that important, since when the lines get long we just go through the regular metal one and we're off.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if anyone here flys out of MCO like I do. Why do they more security at the monorail, and why is there a sign saying "additional screening" when I'm leaving the airport?
