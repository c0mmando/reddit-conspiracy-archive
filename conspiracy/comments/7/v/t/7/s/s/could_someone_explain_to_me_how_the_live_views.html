        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>SS: In the live video of the Falcon Heavy launch, cameras that were running in the cargo bay showed the Tesla Roadster and &quot;Starman&quot; with images of earth and space outside as it launched towards outer space. As far as I know, the cargo bay does not have floor to wall ceilings, nor does it have seamless video panels on the wall that give a live view of the outside. </p>

<p>*edit: I can&#39;t seem to get the video link to embed, but here&#39;s the footage of the roadster during launch:

<p>See Musk&#39;s instagram post that shows the cargo bay and roadster:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BdA94kVgQhU/">https://www.instagram.com/p/BdA94kVgQhU/</a></p>

<p>Those do not look like video panels, nor do I think they have a panoramic camera system outside the rocket. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole &quot;cargo bay&quot; is basically just 2 halves of a shell made of carbon fiber. They are designed to protect the rocket from acoustic and aerodynamic forces on ascent. Once it gets high enough, they are not longer needed and basically become excess weight, so they ditch them.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure your right in some respect in regards to the scale of debris.  But Nasa itself claims there are over 20,000 pieces of debris over softball sized.  Several publications have covered the growing problem we have in regards to this &#39;junk&#39;.  And I am not talking about the vastness of space but a fixed area that makes up our orbit.</p>

<p>Before we go to far talking about how small these objects are there are 100&#39;s that can be tracked with the naked eye from earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s do the math.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say we&#39;re using a telescope with a field of view of about 10<sup>o,</sup> and we&#39;re looking at an area of the sky at the same altitude as the ISS (408 km).</p>

<p>How wide an area does our view cover at that altitude? We can use the math of a right angle triangle to calculate this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calrtri.htm">http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calrtri.htm</a></p>

<p>In that calculator, we set angle A to be half of our field of view - 5<sup>o,</sup> and we set side b to be the altitude, and calculate for side a.</p>

<p>The width of the area we can view at 408 km high with a 10<sup>o</sup> field of view will be double the length of side a.</p>

<p>Running the calculation we get side a = 35.7 km, which doubled is 71.4 km or 71,400m. The ISS itself is 108m wide.</p>

<p>That means that the ISS is only 1/661 the width of our view. If we took a photo with a width of 4000 pixels, the ISS would only be 6 pixels wide.</p>

<p>Even if there were another ISS in the same patch of sky they could be tens of thousands of metres apart.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget. I&#39;m only talking about a two dimensional surface at the same altitude as the ISS. The reality is even a satellite in &quot;low earth orbit&quot; can be as much a 2000 km above earth. So we&#39;re actually talking about 3D volumes of immense size.</p>

<p>You could put all 100 of those visible objects in that one segment and they could easily be thousands of kilometres apart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate this information with regards to optics.  But I feel like the information nasa and other science publications provide paints a different <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/88595/space-debris-problem-getting-worse-new-report-says/">picture</a>.  A picture that I would very much like to see.  A picture that even by your description is possible.  If i can see it with my eye from earth nothing is preventing me from being able to see it in the background of an object filmed in our orbit.  That is fact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have shown you a photo of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/USA202_Thuraya2.jpg">two satellites in the same patch of sky at the same time.</a> I have shown you a photo of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/Black_Knight_Satellite_%28cropped%29.jpg">nearby space debris taken from another spacecraft</a>.</p>

<p>I could show you photos all day long, but you&#39;d simply claim they do not exist.</p>

<p>The reason space debris is a problem is because spacecraft are travelling at extremely high speeds. That means they cover a lot of territory in short periods of time.</p>

<p>The ISS, for example is travelling at 7.67 kilometres per second. In the example I gave, the ISS could enter our field of view on one side and leave the other side a little over 9 seconds later.</p>

<p>Catching an image of two spacecraft, or spacecraft and debris in the same patch of sky at the same time, would mean pointing your telescope at exactly the right place at exactly the right time.</p>

<p>It can be done, but my bet is NASA and other space agencies have calculated their orbits to stay as far away from this large debris as is possible.</p>

<p>But you haven&#39;t seen the photos, so the entire thing must be fake... right?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen a photo of your brain... I&#39;m beginning to suspect it is fake too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are all there... it&#39;s just that they are so far apart that the &quot;sky&quot; is basically empty.</p>

<p>One thing you must remember when you see those pictures and animations of satellites and debris in orbit is that they <em>greatly</em> exaggerate the size of the objects.</p>

<p>For example, imagine an image of the earth where the earth is 2,000 pixels across. The actual diameter of earth is 7,917.5 miles, so each pixel equates to a square with sides 3.96 miles long.</p>

<p>If a single pixel was used to show the location of an object, that pixel would be nearly 700 times wider than 10 yard long satellite.</p>

<p>It would take a truly huge image to show the location of satellites to scale, so whenever you see those images, you&#39;re not getting a true idea of just how far apart they are.</p>

<p>Bullshit. The vast majority of so-called &quot;UFO in space&quot; photos are exactly that - debris near spacecraft like the ISS. Usually this debris is from the spacecraft itself and travelling at the same speed.</p>

<p>Here, for example, is a rather famous example:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_satellite_conspiracy_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Knight_satellite_conspiracy_theory</a></p>

<p>NASA says that object is likely a thermal blanket lost during an EVA mission.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because relative to the cost of any sort of actual satellite, the car was basically free.</p>

<p>This was a test launch of a totally new rocket. It was very possible the thing was going to blow up the second they pushed the launch button (figuratively speaking).</p>

<p>As the entire purpose of the launch was to test the rocket itself, all they needed was a suitable weight to be carried in the payload bay, and that could have been a cube of scrap metal.</p>

<p>The car was essentially a publicity stunt that got attention without putting any sort of valuable cargo at risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The livestream footage that I saw has been edited, and anomalous video removed: I missed the live launch, and rewound the stream to watch liftoff, then forwarded to watch booster separation and fairing deployment. There were 3 camera windows alternating external views and trajectory graphics. 
Before the fairings deploy, the stream changes to a fullscreen graphic tracking the different trajectories, instead of cameras. WTF? Stream returns and Starman is bathed in the blue light of Earth, then the black of space through the windshield. *At this point, I assume that the fairings jettisoned during the fullscreen graphic; unfortunate, sloppy work by the producer. 
Then something weird happens; an external sideview of the roadster against the planet becomes sideview of the car, but now inside the fairing... The fairings detonate, jettison, and Starman is once again exposed to space. I rewound and watched the glitch again. What happened? I assume that somebody, whom screwed-up with the graphic, rewound the video to show off the dramatic moment. I skip ahead to booster landings. Now, however, the glitch/rewind is missing from the recorded video I just rewatched. Clearly, others noticed, and it seems a clumsy edit. What is up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s do the math.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say we&#39;re using a telescope with a field of view of about 10<sup>o,</sup> and we&#39;re looking at an area of the sky at the same altitude as the ISS (408 km).</p>

<p>How wide an area does our view cover at that altitude? We can use the math of a right angle triangle to calculate this.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calrtri.htm">http://www.cleavebooks.co.uk/scol/calrtri.htm</a></p>

<p>In that calculator, we set angle A to be half of our field of view - 5<sup>o,</sup> and we set side b to be the altitude, and calculate for side a.</p>

<p>The width of the area we can view at 408 km high with a 10<sup>o</sup> field of view will be double the length of side a.</p>

<p>Running the calculation we get side a = 35.7 km, which doubled is 71.4 km or 71,400m. The ISS itself is 108m wide.</p>

<p>That means that the ISS is only 1/661 the width of our view. If we took a photo with a width of 4000 pixels, the ISS would only be 6 pixels wide.</p>

<p>Even if there were another ISS in the same patch of sky they could be tens of thousands of metres apart.</p>

<p>And don&#39;t forget. I&#39;m only talking about a two dimensional surface at the same altitude as the ISS. The reality is even a satellite in &quot;low earth orbit&quot; can be as much a 2000 km above earth. So we&#39;re actually talking about 3D volumes of immense size.</p>

<p>You could put all 100 of those visible objects in that one segment and they could easily be thousands of kilometres apart.</p>
