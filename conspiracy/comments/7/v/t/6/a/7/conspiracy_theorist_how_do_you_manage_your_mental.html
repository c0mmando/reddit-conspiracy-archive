       This is not a conspiracy thread and I am not trying to attack any of you guys by any means.
      </p>
      <p>
       I found myself when the vegas shooting went down I wanted answers. My friends, friends, boyfriend was killed in the shooting and it just seemed to surreal. Even so I never met this guy I just found it crazy and incredibly sad what happened and wanted to know the true motive. As we know still hasn't been released exactly. I was in this sub a lot and at the same time getting consumed by other conspriacys. Watching lots of stuff on YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       While this was happening I started feeling really angry and getting depressed about the world in general. I found it hard to enjoy life. After a month or two I stopped being in here as much and stopped with the youtube videos. It was starting to make me miserable along with other things going on in my life
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always took everything with a grain of salt. Tried to read between the lines as much as I can. Especially as I've gotten older. I realize so much of what we consume is trying to promote certain agendas and or propaganda. That being said the conspiracy mentality was not healthy for my mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still come in this sub here and there. I still watch some youtube videos (mainly Shawn dawson's conspiracy videos) but I felt like if I didn't stop diving in deep into everything I would still be in that miserable state.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you guys manage? Have any of you feel/felt the same way? If so what do you do to keep a positive mindset?

       Everything in moderation. 
Also, it’s okay to get mad when you realize how messed up the world around us is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had to take a break from the rabbit hole. I have a young son and I was starting to get so scared about the world around us. I found myself questioning whether it was a smart move to bring his innocent self into this crazy messed up world... then I started spending more time watching &amp; reading “faith in humanity restored” type videos on YouTube. Yes the world is an ugly scary mad house- but there ARE good people who try to whatever they can to make some small impact (even if it’s sending a card to a terminally ill kid or even smiling at a stranger). And that was when I realized I’m raising my son to be the good and the change this world needs. 
I also lean heavily on my faith.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s how I deal.

       This is what I was kind of looking for, thank you. I just turned 24 and I've been hesitant to have a kid myself. Just with what the future forcast of the world seems like. I've made a pledge to wait till I'm 26-27 before I really do or not just to see what's going to happen but yeah I definitely agree everything in moderation. I was getting the same way. Feeling scares, enraged and hopeless. I kind of just dabble in it now.

       Old guy here, truth is this is one of the best times for humanity to be alive. We are today from birth advertised to be afraid and everything that makes us nervous and jittery. The comfort of religion (Christianity) has been removed 20 years ago. Acceptance, meditation, confidence to push on... Madison 5th avenue took its place in that if you don't have a 2018 Mercedes and a 72inch TV then you are a failure. Perpetual misery and consumerism. (I'm an ER RN, Psych so...) had a 8yo Mexican kid (the English translator for the family) who seriously thinking about suicide because parents couldn't buy him a new Smart phone.

       The first , because I find most people lack the ability to think critically with an open mind, and rather than disect the information or just learn , they automatically impulsively try to refute the claims from their current limited understanding / consciousness / and non privy to info that puts it all together and makes it click - I find it’s a waste of time , and most importantly :
      </p>
      <p>
       — remember how I said believe nothing ? We don’t have the full story, everything is obscured and the story changes every rabbit hole you go down. Your explanation for X conspiracy , the motives and stuff behind it , the story makes sense at the level ur at , but once you deviate and look at other conspiracies , you’ll find that the puzzles all connect together , and while one was looking at the corner piece and trying to infer what the full image is .... or think the full puzzle completion is just their corner , not realizing there is more to go and the bigger picture is not the corner they were looking at

       A lot of people are surprisingly receptive to conspiracy theories, at least in my experience. I think conspiracy theories, while having negative implications, can be entertaining reading about and discussing with others.

      <p>
       But with cognitive dissonance in play , it’s a grand waste of time . Some things people need to experience or learn on their own . One must have the will to seek the truth on their own. I’m not against talking about conspiracy to people , but without the vast amounts of small details to pay attention to regarding any particular thing , by the time you successfully explain them anything , you most likely are adding to your own delusion as well because the seeking of truth doesn’t involve expanding the ego when one isn’t 100% sure

       Alcohol and weed and when things get a little too heavy I watch stand up comedy. The good stuff from years ago not the crap that is out today. Letting out a good hearty laugh or cry does wonders for your soul. Just like with a break up it'll get better and easier over time.

       Being told round pegs always fit square holes by MSM. Turned of TV. Big fan of shortwave broadcast B4 internet. News from overseas nothing like news presented here. Overseas, "Rabid dog savagely bites toddler"!  Here- "Animal cruelty juvenile chokes poor sick dog with arm". Last 10 years has been wake up call for (the few left) thinkers. It's big and it's deep. Go at your own pace. Lots to learn. We have been instructed to take America back and this means relearning and painful truth. Lots stuff ain't pretty.

       With that said, your only a few months from a life changing event.  You’re feelings are absolutely normal.  You’re still very early in the stage of grieving.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it’s tempting to search for answers while you’re grieving and if that’s what you need I would never discourage it.  However, I’m only suggesting this for your mental health but maybe it’s not time for you to be looking for answers.  There will be time for that in the future, but make sure you take care of yourself first.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck in your journey.

       I think that any true enlightenment inevitably comes with some pain in the process. Sometimes you gotta just power through that shit, and accept that it's part of the grander scheme. And sometimes you have to give yourself a break and turn your attention to something else. Read, watch a fascinating documentary or a good film, take a walk. Weed helps, as well as the occasional boozy evening. Just be careful not to let it become a crutch (which is easier said than done, I know).

       is this world of disinformation, meditation is the only truth beacon. It allows you to logically and intuitively discern the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sharing and spreading truth sets you free and unlocks the deepest cognitive power in yousrself. Being emathetic to others and honest with yourself aligns one on the true path. While on the path, good things happen. stray from the path and ba things happen. each of us has their own path.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, the original buddhist message is that the socially programmed reality is an illusion. The 'real truth' of the extant of deception and how deep the 'big conspiracy' goes is so far from the social reality that it is so hard to for most to handle emotionally and existentially that their subconscious hides it from themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       this, however, is changing. Remember when people thought that the earth was the center of the solar system and refused to believe otherwise? That is where we are now, except the real truth is

       I think that this is an important post because the same people who are apt to put credit in conspiracies being true are also vulnerable to bouts of self doubt and the madness that accompanies higher level thinking.

      <p>
       Now, what I’ve found helpful in a very practical sense is some kind of spirituality. Doesn’t need to be religion per se, but just something that you place faith in and that you can use to help reassure yourself that you’re on the noble path. Agnosticism is no way to go through life nor face down death. Also, you must ACTIVELY PRACTICE what you believe in, not just think about it from time to time.

       You are obviously a seeker, but have not found the final truth, the bottom of the rabbit hole. 
Once you do, everything will be alright. Maybe you will find it during this lifetime, maybe you won't.
Some people struggle with true understanding or look for the wrong things (a lot of powerful disinformation around) and lose their minds in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sorry for your (friends) loss, but nonetheless try not to get caught up in politics and be aware, that you, yourself, are the creator of your reality, BE positive (not just think), try to balance yourself and positive things will happen. 
Try to see why things happen, maybe this loss was meant to shake you up and signal you to itensify your search.

       All thoughts, ideas, and possibilities are just thoughts. You can’t always control what happens in this reality or universe necessarily, but you can control your relationship with those thoughts and realities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like everything in life, moderation is key. You can’t and shouldn’t live in conspiracy land 24/7, just like you shouldn’t not come here from time to time and keep an open mind. It’s all about balance, and prioritizing your precise time and energy to love yourself and others.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s enough chaos in this world, don’t let yourself become obsessed or absorbed by it. But at the same time stay vigilant, always keep learning, exploring, and following your intuition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, a clean healthy organic diet, and vitamin D3 with K2 and fish oil can be effective against depression and compulsive thinking along side working out regularly. Proper sleep, and meditation help as well. Let the past go and stay present. Don’t let yourself ruminate for too long.

       I work with animals. That helps massively. As far as self medicating, St. John's wort or other over the counter anxiety remedies work as a temporary fix. I do have potentially undiagnosed medically/self diagnosed mental health issues, certainly with anxiety and disassociation disorders, but I don't think they are responsible for my views.  Largely I try not to think about things and certainly don't share my view of the world with others unless somebody else brings the topic up.

       I don’t comment here that frequently, but I am a daily visitor. I have to take breaks. If I stay on this sub or any other conspiracy forum too long I get frustrated with how bleak it seems, on top of how commenters here attack each other when we’re all looking for answers.

       To deal with that I just turn off my phone, tv, and computer. Instead of being upset about the darkness, I try to enjoy what is still beautiful, as cliche as that sounds. You can’t control what other people do, but you can control how you react to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go out for a hike, enjoy your family, do some journaling or art. Create your own beauty. I have a reef tank that I put all my energy into. The people in the world are ugly, but nature isn’t. If that isn’t your cup of tea, find something that is.

       I tend to not take conspiracy theory too seriously, its more of an interest, i handle my mental health with a heap of different chemicals to get me through day to day life. Not ideal but hey i cant get out of bed without medication. Mental illness is horrid.

       I found myself getting mad at what TPTB are doing to my body, to my food, to my schools, to my roads, to my parks, to my blah blah blah. Then I reviewed the Buddhist way and remembered that none of this is really mine anyway so how can I be mad at something that is taken if it wasn't mine to begin with? How can we even say it is taken if 'it' doesn't really exist at all and there never was a difference between you or anyone else here?

       Well, I have had the opposite experience. It's refreshing having an evolving perspective not entirely based on MSM fear porn. It's nice to know that you really have nothing to worry about.  I have no fear at all of nuclear war or global warming or Russia for example.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think conspiracies can help you get rid of irrational fear towards some of those things.

       The first , because I find most people lack the ability to think critically with an open mind, and rather than disect the information or just learn , they automatically impulsively try to refute the claims from their current limited understanding / consciousness / and non privy to info that puts it all together and makes it click - I find it’s a waste of time , and most importantly :
      </p>
      <p>
       — remember how I said believe nothing ? We don’t have the full story, everything is obscured and the story changes every rabbit hole you go down. Your explanation for X conspiracy , the motives and stuff behind it , the story makes sense at the level ur at , but once you deviate and look at other conspiracies , you’ll find that the puzzles all connect together , and while one was looking at the corner piece and trying to infer what the full image is .... or think the full puzzle completion is just their corner , not realizing there is more to go and the bigger picture is not the corner they were looking at
