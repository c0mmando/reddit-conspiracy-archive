        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Just a fun little break from the political narratives. I&#39;ve lived near Philadelphia almost all of my life been here for 19 years. The Eagles have never won a super bowl - they&#39;ve only won the old championships. If the team wins, which I think they will, the city is going to erupt. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen a few posts talking about security teams at this super bowl. But I personally think if there is to be a false flag it will more likely happen in Philadelphia should they win. It&#39;s the first championship ever. The city will be in chaos - also packed full of people. Due to our council absolutely sucking ass at everything, police will be limited. I recall the parade for the Phillies. Woefully under prepared.</p>

<p>To me a false flag in a city packed with people to celebrate the teams first Super Bowl win in eons - perfect idea to get us involved once more in the Middle East. Am I wrong? Most likely but hey I do keep this stuff in the back of my mind. As the TPTB are terrifying with their heinous random but calculated attacks.</p>

<p>But lemme know what you guys are thinking. I&#39;m curious to see if anyone else thinks we&#39;re ripe for something like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>On it. </p>

<p><strong>IF</strong> there is a FF tonight, it’ll be in Minneapolis. Let’s look at some very weird coincidences concerning the events tonight. </p>

<p>First off, Minneapolis has the highest concentration of Somali immigrants in the country. A part of that city (Cedar-Riverside) is know as a “Somali Jihadist Pipeline”, or “Little Mogadishu”. </p>

<p>In 2014, the FBI said that the investigation into terrorists in Minneapolis was the biggest since 9/11. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CBTS_Stream/comments/7sy0s2/attending_superbowl_in_minnesota_dont_notsafe/">Post explaining the Somali Pipeline</a></p>

<p>Who is supplying security for the Super Bowl? G4S. The same company which has provided “security” over many false flags. Most notably, the Orlando Pulse shooting, and Las Vegas. </p>

<p>The head of NFL Security is Cathy Lanier. She was the DC Chief of Police when Seth Rich was murdered, and she is <em>very</em> tight with the Clintons and George Soros. </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/PsDtvY1">Cathy Lanier</a></p>

<p>Now let’s look at some predictive programming. Justin Timberlake is the halftime entertainment. Here are 2 screen caps from recent videos of his; </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/KQKZCUD">Screen Cap 1</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/kjeUsPv">Screen Cap 2</a> </p>

<p>In the 2nd screen cap, the Seal of Saturn is clearly visible above his head. </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/5xukmyH">Q has mentioned The Sum Of All Fears 3 times</a></p>

<p>In The Sum Of All Fears, a football game is nuked. Adding to the predictive programming; in The Dark Knight Rises, a football game is also attacked, AND in Oblivion, it is mentioned that the “last Super Bowl” was in 2017. </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/fgUJH4y">Speaking of The Dark Knight Rises, the NFL affiliated NFL Memes page on facebook shared this meme</a></p>

<p>It gets even creepier; </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/5XhqRY8">The domain name “MinneapolisStrong” is already registered</a></p>

<p>Anyone into the purple revolution? [The Vikings colors are purple and yellow, and the <a href="http://imgur.com/1Stsg1F">seats at the stadium are purple</a></p>

<p>We all are aware of the significance of the Owl in the Occult. Well how’s about this <a href="http://imgur.com/o4ecO99">Tram in Minneapolis has quite a weird way of spelling Super Bowl. Instead saying Superb Owl</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/news/superb-owl-super-bowl-lii-train-not-mistake-winspire-vikings-arete-charity/13jfu79amzdlh14ppl3jnylsla">Link to article about the tram:</a></p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/D1xcHIN">In that article is also the logo/flyer for the Superb Owl Party</a></p>

<p>And then, you have some creepy symbolism;</p>

<p><strong>IF</strong> the game is attacked, then you’re looking at a scenario in which both Eagles and Patriots would be killed. </p>

<p>Twin Towers
Twin Cities</p>

<p>The stock market dropped 666 points on the 33rd day of the year, and the game is on 2/4, or 6. </p>

<p>Let’s not forget that Lynn De Rothschild’s favorite thing to tweet lately has been “#flyeaglesfly”. </p>

<p>I’m not predicting anything, so anyone replying to this comment with such replies as “hurrrr durrr why are you predicting a FF HURRRR DURRR” will be promptly ignored. I am merely presenting a really fucked up set of coincidences to everyone. It seems Minneapolis is ripe for the picking though. I’d personally be too paranoid to be at the game. </p>

<p>In The Sum Of All Fears, a football game is nuked. Adding to the predictive programming; in The Dark Knight Rises, a football game is also attacked, AND in Oblivion, it is mentioned that the “last Super Bowl” was in 2017. </p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/fgUJH4y">Speaking of The Dark Knight Rises, the NFL affiliated NFL Memes page on facebook shared this meme</a></p>

<p>It gets even creepier; </p>

<p>Anyone into the purple revolution? [The Vikings colors are purple and yellow, and the <a href="http://imgur.com/1Stsg1F">seats at the stadium are purple</a></p>

<p>We all are aware of the significance of the Owl in the Occult. Well how’s about this <a href="http://imgur.com/o4ecO99">Tram in Minneapolis has quite a weird way of spelling Super Bowl. Instead saying Superb Owl</a></p>

<p>And then, you have some creepy symbolism;</p>

<p><strong>IF</strong> the game is attacked, then you’re looking at a scenario in which both Eagles and Patriots would be killed. </p>

Twin Cities</p>

<p>The stock market dropped 666 points on the 33rd day of the year, and the game is on 2/4, or 6. </p>

<p>Let’s not forget that Lynn De Rothschild’s favorite thing to tweet lately has been “#flyeaglesfly”. </p>

<p>I’m not predicting anything, so anyone replying to this comment with such replies as “hurrrr durrr why are you predicting a FF HURRRR DURRR” will be promptly ignored. I am merely presenting a really fucked up set of coincidences to everyone. It seems Minneapolis is ripe for the picking though. I’d personally be too paranoid to be at the game. </p>
