       All value is perception. The value of the dollar is merely the agreed amount. The government says that the dollar is worth a dollar. Not what it can buy. Same with bitcoin. Its worth what the market says it's worth. Nobody likes an unstable currency. Few people were complaining about the value of bitcoin a month ago when it was increasing in value. I'd love to sell you something for 100 only to have the currency worth 200 tomorrow. But not if it goes to 50 instead. Stability is key.

       These people who say their dollar is more real than a digitized asset is pretty funny. They're both completely fake. But one is constantly going up in value and the other has been going down in value since end of 2016

       The government is using money as a tool to control the population. So the answer is to remove the leverage. The government should not be able to do this. Their power over money should be limited to taxes. And that should also be limited.

       It is. It just people would rather come on a forum and cry about the govt and the bankers having all the power, but once an alternative comes along they go right back to towing the CNBC line and praising their valuable dollar.

       Look we've all been scammed. Our dollar is worth half of what it was 10 years ago and the noticeable effects are right around the corner.

      <p>
       Bitcoins 50% correction brought us back 1 month. The stock markets upcoming corrections with take investors back 5+ years. If bitcoin fails, oh well.
       <del>
        if
       </del>
       when the dollar fails, just hope you didn't have all of our eggs in that one shit basket..

       Use the same language in the pot laws to specify a bank that is not to be part of the interstate commerce and must not be on the internet.  Keep forcing the issue of limited federal powers specified in the constitution.

       they designed crypto currencies for the marijuana industry so suppliers and retailers could buy and sell their products without cash. They're not really meant for the retail/consumer side, although that could work too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The transaction time for transfers is slow - you're talking about bitcoin or all crypto? Btc is slow, but there are plenty of faster alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some mj crypto examples are - potcoin, thehempcoin, dopecoin.
      </p>
      <p>
       The foundation isn't quite where it needs to be, but this is an amazing alternative to the current system that they're forced to deal in. If you can get past the whole "crypto is a fad" part (most of it is) and see that there are a few really strong cases for why these coins could help an industry in need of a solution.

       It's cool until they allow cops to run your bank cards and if there is too much money in there they will asset forfeit that shit until you can prove  it wasn't gotten through selling drugs, because you are guilty until you can prove innocent. By the time your lawyer has your money back you have spent the same amout trying to prove it was legally gotten. If you don't think it's constitutional legal well they are doing it in Oklahoma so I guess if it works here it's just a matter of time until your debit cards are no longer safe. No one is protected by the constitution because of the 14th amendment took out rights away and gave us privileges back. The federal government sees the US citizen as it's property. This is why if you die them do it in state court and not a federal court. Otherwise your evidence will be stricken from the record. I helped my buddy win a class action because the six lawyers they had didn't understand the 14th amendment as well as I did apperently. If they had they wouldn't have let them move it to federal court. Which I quickly determined was the reason why they started losing their evidence. Because the federal government can't be held responsible for harming their own property.  That cash in your wallet is theirs you don't own shit, so before you start cheerleading like a statist bootlicker you might want to check your own status, slave.
