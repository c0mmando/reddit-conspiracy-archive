<p>The average person understood what he meant and didn&#39;t immediately go to the razor thin and specific understanding of it - Trump directly and specifically being tapped. Because the average person understands it doesn&#39;t matter. The issue is the access to the innerworkings of the opposing campaign. Information. Dirt. And it&#39;s why it was so vehemently denied until it couldn&#39;t be. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the course of several years, the ECMU paid the Podesta Group $1.13 million to lobby Congress, according to the AP. Podesta, however, claims he was not aware that the ECMU was working for a foreign government and did not file a disclosure under FARA due to legal opinions attorneys gave him. However, Manafort and Gates both roundly acknowledged that they were in Yanukovych&#39;s employ, as did several Podesta employees.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ECMU was the think tank set up by Manafort and Gates to help push their interests regarding Ukraine. They hired the Podesta Group to lobby for them. It’s disingenuous of you to associate this group with John Podesta though, as [<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_Group">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podesta_Group</a>] he had left the company in 1993</p>

<p>Yes, which is why I supplied other evidence. I see this all the time, “well this one specific piece of evidence in isolation doesn’t prove the entire point”. It’d be a valid argument if it was <em>the only evidence</em> but it’s not</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are the original tweets from Trump on the matter</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Terrible! Just found out that Obama had my ‘wires tapped’ in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“How low has President Obama gone to tapp [sic] my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, this is really just a battle of semantics and the reason it’s still up for debate is that those statements are pretty vague overall.</p>

<p>Here, to me, are the parts that are most up for debate:</p>

<p><em>President Obama bring the one to do it</em> - this relies on the assumption that Obama was either the one to order it, or that Obama takes responsibility for everyone being put under FISA surveillance. Under that assumption, does Trump feel he takes similar responsibility for everyone currently under FISA, especially considering he signed the latest FISA bill? I wonder</p>

<p><em>”My wires/phones</em> - you can sort of twist his to fit either side of the argument. Skeptics will say he means his personal phone lines, people who believe this to be true will say he meant the wires/phones in the buildings he owns. </p>

<p><em>Tapp/“tapped”</em> - being under FISA surveillance is different than actually being wiretapped. Those who are arguing that these statements are vindicated will point to the quotes around “tapped” as proof that he wasn’t literally speaking about wiretapping, but was using the expression colloquially to mean “people from 3 letter agencies could listen in on the calls”, I see both sides of the argument on this one.</p>

<p><em>Nothing found</em> - this is the part that I have trouble believing, as Manafort has been charged with crimes related to laundering Russian money and violating FARA rules, and will likely get charged again. I don’t understand how Trump would know exactly what they found anyways.</p>

<p>I don’t think we can definitively say what exactly he meant, and that’s ultimately a big part of Trump’s rhetoric imo, leaving in enough room to interpret something as meaning a few different things. Ultimately, it pretty much depends on your presumptions and feelings on Trump I think, as confirmation bias will lead people to have two completely different interpretations</p>
