    <div class="md"><p>indeed the entire premise for the necessity of going to the moon is absurd</p>

<p>they needed to put reflectors up there, yet MIT had been using lasers to measure distance without reflectors since 1962</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Laser_Ranging_experiment</a></p>

<p>and then they say that the crust of the earth moves up and down with the tides, meaning that the ground under the laser moves up and down several feet throughout the day, making the measurements almost useless</p>

<p>like trying to measure a boat on the high seas during a storm </p>

<p>at the end of the day, the measurement of the distance to the moon is not so important that is required NASA to send men to the moon.</p>

<p>nobody can or will explain why measuring the distance to the moon was so important the USA back then, but not important enough for anyone else to do now</p>

<p>and no, i don&#39;t believe 3rd party &quot;verification&quot; of reflectors. they can&#39;t explain how they are able to differentiate between a laser bounced off of a reflector and one bounced off the surface of the moon. </p>

<p>i seriously doubt they have the technology to track the moon to such a degree that they are able to hit a very small target with a small laser point 200,000 miles away, and if they did have that tracking technology, the reflector wouldn&#39;t be necessary anyway </p>

<p>also, the moon is dusty and the reflector would likely get covered with a layer of dust quickly, making it useless     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i can say that after decades of participating in research and debate about the moon landings, is that they were 100% fake and that we still do not have the technology to go the moon in 2018, and i don&#39;t think any of us will ever live to see the day when humans to have the technology </p>

<p>one of the reasons why people believe the moon landing myth is because they can&#39;t comprehend just how far away the moon is. they think its a lot closer than it is</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plenty of folks walked on the moon, 12 if I remember right. So it wasn&#39;t a &quot;one stop wonder&quot;. Also we (scientists) get much more accurate data from satellites now than what an astronaut could obtain terrestrially. There&#39;s also a lot of funding for NASA that went south in the 80&#39;s/90&#39;s because of the launch/re-entry fiascos. Not to mention the public pretty much didn&#39;t care after we beat everyone to the moon! </p>

<p>Moral of the story, lots of cover ups in NASA but I do believe if not the FIRST landing occurred, then at least some of the others landed.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of really interesting medical and science articles based on lunar soil and how corrosive it is. There&#39;s no way space suit boots could be whittled down like that from anything else. </p>

<p>The ascent stage of the Lunar Module could achieve a delta V of 7280 ft/s, or 4966 mph, more than enough to match the speed of the orbiting Command Module. The Russians would have done it too if they had gone to the Moon.</p>

<p>Escape velocity means that you are going fast enough that gravity will not be strong enough to pull it back. You always feel the pull of gravity -- it has infinite range. But, gravity gets weaker as you get farther away. If you are going fast enough, it will get weaker more quickly than it is able to slow you down and you will never stop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.</p>

<p>There are two main Van Allen belts – the inner belt and the outer belt – and a transient third belt. The inner belt is the more dangerous one, containing energetic protons. The outer one has less-dangerous low-energy electrons (Beta particles). The Apollo spacecraft passed through the inner belt in a matter of minutes and the outer belt in about ​1 1⁄2 hours. The astronauts were shielded from the ionizing radiation by the aluminum hulls of the spacecraft.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the orbital transfer trajectory from Earth to the Moon through the belts was chosen to lessen radiation exposure. Even Dr. James Van Allen, the discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belts, rebutted the claims that radiation levels were too harmful for the Apollo missions.  Plait cited an average dose of less than 1 rem (10 mSv), which is equivalent to the ambient radiation received by living at sea level for three years. The total radiation received on the trip was about the same as allowed for workers in the nuclear energy field for a year and not much more than what Space Shuttle astronauts received.</p>

<p>going to the moon was a matter of urgent national security to both countries <em>before</em> the USA went, </p>

<p>none of the experiments that NASA allegedly conducted on the moon have ever been properly replicated on the moon, in accordance with the scientific method </p>

<p>they didn&#39;t need a reflector on the moon, because MIT had been using a laser to measure distance to the moon since 1961  </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/tlly7">https://imgur.com/a/tlly7</a></p>

<p>Papal Rome still runs the world via a network of secret societies.  The end goal is to drag your eternal soul to Hell by distracting you (with literally anything) until your flesh dies.</p>

<p>They want to keep you from the truth which is you have an eternal soul that need to be reconciled to God though the sacrifice of Jesus Christ (The Word of God in the flesh in the form of his only begotten son).</p>

<p>The only way out of here is to repent of one&#39;s rebellion against God and one&#39;s sinful nature and believe the gospel which is:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>

<p>My comfort comes from the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Joh_14:26  But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</p>

<p>Joh_15:26  But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</p>

<p>Joh_16:7  Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t go to a building called &quot;Church&quot; that is another example of pagan Catholic stuff and traditions of men.  I also don&#39;t do or believe any of that stuff you listed.  It&#39;s literally the straw man of Christianity that the elite have created for you.  Everything you have been taught brings you to that conclusion which is a rebellious state toward God.  All he wants is for you to realize what he did for you.  It&#39;s that simple.</p>

Rom 11:26  And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: 
Rom 11:27  For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.

<p>it has been argued that the mass of the moon is somewhere between 1/80th and 1/100th of the mass of the Earth</p>

<p>this means that the Lagrange Points are even father away from the Earth than previously assumed, and so therefore that makes the mission that much more difficult and unlikely </p>

<p>13) Have you ever parked your car while travelling at 30km/s? You do it everyday because that&#39;s how fast the Earth orbits the sun. Speed is relative you fucking moron.</p>

<p>do you really think its plausible to launch a lunar lander from the surface of the moon, and have it intercept and dock with the lunar orbiter which is traveling at 3600MPH?</p>

<p>here is a video of the lunar lander launch. fake launch is fake </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj6a0Wrrh1g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj6a0Wrrh1g</a></p>

<p>19) Wtf</p>

<p>its a pretty straightforward question: </p>

<p>are you aware of any existing aircraft that can circumnavigate the Earth 4 times while constantly increasing its altitude, without re-fueling </p>

<p>since the Earth is about 25,000 miles in circumference, and the Moon is over 200,000 miles away, </p>

<p>if we replace the straight-line distance to the moon, with the number of times you&#39;d have to circumnavigate the Earth, the problem is illustrated in ratios you are better able to conceptualize and understand </p>

<p><a href="https://i.redd.it/88x6kh681b301.png">https://i.redd.it/88x6kh681b301.png</a></p>

<p>20) Lagrange.</p>

<p>yes, Lagrange <em>Point</em>, </p>

<p>not Lagrange Plane or Lagrange Line</p>

<p>the existence of a single point where the gravity cancels each other out, utterly debunks the myth that a rocket can &quot;escape gravity&quot; for much of the duration of the trip the to the moon </p>

<p>theres a reason that Lagrange Points are not taught within the context of the moon landing</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point</a></p>

<p>17, 21) Yes, if your &quot;coast speed&quot; is greater than the current gravitation pull you dumbass. That&#39;s what escape velocity means.</p>

<p>so, lets illustrate how absurd your conceptualization is:</p>

<p>lets say you are driving 25MPH up a hill, and your engine died. you believe your car would continue to coast uphill for an additional 200 miles, when in reality your car would not even make it 1 mile </p>

<p>your coast speed it utterly irrelevant to the fact that you have to go against gravity to get to the moon, and that gravity will continue to impede your progress, regardless of how fast you are going. </p>

<p>a rocket can no more &quot;escape gravity&quot; than a bumble bee can</p>

<p>gravity works no matter how fast your rocket allegedly goes</p>

<p>there is no such thing as &quot;escape velocity&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;escaping gravity&quot; is literally in the realm of science fiction </p>

<p>as is the so-called sling shot effect or &quot;Gravity Assist&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingshot_effect">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slingshot_effect</a> </p>

<p>22) That&#39;s not what escape velocity means holyshit learn to google.</p>

<p>&quot;escape velocity&quot; is science fiction, a concept taught to idiots to make the moon landing hoax more plausible </p>

<p>24) Imagine driving uphill. A hill that starts off steep, and slowly flattens out. If you floor the accelerator, you can gain enough speed, such that you can let off the gas BEFORE you reach the top of the hill.</p>

<p>have you ever actually drove a car up a hill? if you use cruise control you will notice that the engine seems to be working harder all the way up the hill, as opposed to working harder for a moment at the start of the hill, and then coasting to the top of the hill </p>

<p>Wow it&#39;s like you&#39;ve never driven a car before. No one said shit about cruise control, that&#39;s a strawman. I like how you used &quot;25mph to go 200 miles&quot; as your example too. Ignore the numbers first, because you don&#39;t even seem to think the concept is possible: The next time you get in your shitty welfare-funded car, floor the accelerator. Not turn on cruise control. After you do this, your car will coast, common sense. If you are going up a hill, then yes gravity is slowing you down constantly, depending on the slope of the hill. BUT if your original velocity is high enough, and the hill is small enough, then obviously you can coast to the top of the hill. That&#39;s how roller coasters work too. Are you going to tell me roller coasters are fake too now?</p>

<p>you assume that once a rocket is in motion, it tends to stay in motion, regardless if gravity is acting upon it?</p>

<p>I like how you used &quot;25mph to go 200 miles&quot; as your example too.</p>

<p>these are  ratios of the numbers used in your moon landing myth, </p>

<p>notice how much more absurd your moon landing myth becomes when you put into perspective?</p>

<p>if it was possible, the Russians would have done it by now</p>

<p>The next time you get in your shitty welfare-funded car, floor the accelerator. NOT turn on cruise control. After you do this, your car will coast, common sense.</p>

<p>you realize that it takes fuel for a car to move right? and that your car will not coast very far once you run out of fuel?</p>

<p>If you are going up a hill, then yes gravity is slowing you down constantly, proportional to the slope of the hill.</p>

<p>Rockets take off at a 90 degree angle to the surface of the earth, meaning they have to fight 100% of Earths gravity</p>

<p>remember learning about a simple machine called an &quot;inclined plane&quot; in school?</p>

<p>Rockets don&#39;t benefit from the inclined plane </p>

<blockquote>
<p>BUT if your original velocity is high enough, and the hill is small enough, then obviously you can coast to the top of the hill. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>you can&#39;t &quot;coast&quot; a rocket uphill for 200,000 miles. it requires fuel for every inch of progress, per the law of conservation of energy </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s how roller coasters work too. Are you going to tell me roller coasters are fake now too?</p>

<p>nobody claims roller coasters coast uphill for 200,000 miles </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why you feel it&#39;s necessary to start a new line for each sentence, or inconsistently capitalize the first letter. Makes you look retarded.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll break down your misconceptions one by one. What you need to do is start googling these questions on your own instead of assuming you already know the answer.</p>

<h1>Gravity Wells</h1>

<p>The first misconception, you seem to be describing gravity wells as linear when they&#39;re not. I drew a little <a href="https://i.imgur.com/3pPD51c.png">diagram to illustrate this.</a> Inverse square law; the farther you get from the Earth, the less effort is required to travel even farther outside the gravity well. You can find a <a href="http://www.permanent.com/space-transportation-earth-moon.html">better illustration here</a> along with an explanation. As you can see in the second image, if the amount of energy from the rocket&#39;s fuel is greater than the energy of the gravity well, then you can &#39;escape&#39; it.</p>

<p>Note that the diagram in the second link is to scale, and that the moon&#39;s gravity well minuscule in comparison to the Earth&#39;s due to their differences in mass. Also note that the amount of mass being launched from the moon (the lunar module) is a fraction of the mass of the entire Saturn V rocket launched from Earth. These two factors combined explain the lackluster moon departure launch which you describe as being fake.</p>

<h1>Orbital Energy &amp; <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/a/4698">Escape Velocity</a></h1>

<p>Next misconception is that orbital energy is higher than escape velocity. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_cannonball">It&#39;s not.</a> The speed required to achieve orbit is approx  7.3km/s while escape velocity is ~11.2 km/s. This is why an orbit is preferable to a straight line to the moon, and a <a href="http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/gravitation_escape_velocity_saturn_v.htm">good breakdown is given here.</a> </p>

<p>More reading on why orbit first before reaching the moon. <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/13537/orbiting-earth-before-heading-to-moon">[1]</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parking_orbit#Translunar_or_interplanetary_spacecraft">[2]</a> (It&#39;s safer, without using much more energy).</p>

<h1>Gravity Assist</h1>

<p>The last misconception is that gravitational assists seem to violate the conservation of energy, when they don&#39;t. Energy is stolen from the planet; similar to how it requires energy to create the tides -- the energy comes from the moons orbit, which is slowly decaying. Better explanation [here].(<a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/134494">https://physics.stackexchange.com/a/134494</a>)</p>

<p>But mid transmission the film footage was cut, live, from the astronaughts disembarking to pre-filmed footage, then back again when it was needed.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>They knew aliens already had bases on the moon by the late 50&#39;s (oath swearing witness testimony - military film developer/analyst talking about film he developed showing the back side of the moon with 1ft picture resolution) </p>

<p>and they knew that ET craft often visited their craft when they came to the moon the first few times (Moon Flyby, and other secret missions that weren&#39;t public) </p>

<p>So they had a backup plan in case anything showed up on camera.</p>

<p>Allegedly they did. There was ET saucers craft all along the horizon.</p>

Surely the Earth below would have spread out until I could see your fabled ice wall if it was flat, but no, the horizon dropped away just like it does when you flying an airliner - But I doubt you&#39;ve ever done that.

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t seem to know how Lagrange points work if you think it&#39;s like &quot;grandpa walking to school and back, uphill all the way&quot;.</p>

<p>The physics is all wrong. And yeah, that&#39;s going to be a common response, because <strong>you don&#39;t seem to understand the physics of your thought experiment</strong>.</p>

<p>From the link I posted before (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point_colonization">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point_colonization</a>), there is in fact a point where the gravity between two bodies &quot;cancels out&quot;, and it&#39;s called a Lagrangian point. What&#39;s more, there have been proposals to build space stations at this point, presumably because it would use less fuel to maintain position.</p>

<p>That isn&#39;t a matter of opinion, any more than a physics 101 textbook is a matter of opinion. Might I recommend:</p>

<ul>

<p>It&#39;s always amusing to see you completely ignore the substance of my comments. What&#39;s up with that flag? Or did you realize that I was right and decide to just ignore it.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, “absurd” is not what you called it. Your post title calls people “stupid” and in the body you call them “idiots”, if they believe in the moon landings. You also do the same in replies to several other commenters. </p>
