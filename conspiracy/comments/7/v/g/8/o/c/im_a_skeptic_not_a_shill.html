The majority of people on the web aren&#39;t going to respect you or what you have to say. The rest of the feedback is probably from bots, not actual people. Since you seem so new to the internet I guess it is up to me to be the first to tell you that if you don&#39;t let go of silly accusations from strangers you are going to have a bad time online.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It comes and goes.  I’m a skeptic and not a conspiracy theorist, though I love conspiracy theories(especially regarding the ancient world and hidden tech).  Shill gets tossed around to denigrate a view someone doesn’t like, basically just an ad hominem because the person can’t come up with anything better so they attack the person instead of the argument.</p>

<p>I actually like it when I see someone calling another person a shill because it shows who is and who is not here to actually have a discussion.  Calling someone a shill is generally a great sign that person(the one yelling shill) can be ignored and dismissed out of hand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shill hysteria is a big problem in this sub.  Any time you disagree with someone, &quot;oh the shills are out hard today&quot; or something about brigading.  It&#39;s become a victim mentality to help people reinforce their beliefs by thinking they&#39;re under attack by outsiders with an evil agenda.  Then, you can dismiss any opposing viewpoints and show that yours is more true because shillls.  The fact that it&#39;s hard to prove who&#39;s a shill aids to this because you never have to outright prove that someone is, you just make wild accusations.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s genuinely dangerous to a democratic discourse</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree, be I also think it&#39;s extremely dangerous for the government to be engaging in the practice of doing just that.  In 2008 Cass Sunstein proposed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_Sunstein#%22Conspiracy_Theories%22_and_government_infiltration">government infiltrate conspiracies groups online  &amp; off</a>.  Then you 2011, it comes out the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/mar/17/us-spy-operation-social-networks">US Military was using a software that allowed them to use multiple sock puppets to push propaganda on social media</a>.  I tend to think (Conspiracy theories), mainly because of Vault 7, that this technology has been provided to private groups like Cambridge Analytics &amp; CTR.  Since then, I now think that reddit allows <a href="https://qz.com/806321/open-ai-reddit-human-conversation/">chat bots/AI</a> on it&#39;s platform, that way it&#39;s a lot cheaper than having a bunch of people running these types of psyops and it&#39;s now Reddit&#39;s main business model and why they are going public.  But with that said, I think there are shill on here and see them push narratives, not saying everyone is, and wouldn&#39;t accuse anyone myself, but I believe they are here regardless.</p>

Regarding what you said about child abuse you should check this out, <a href="http://www.childtrafficking.org/cgi-bin/ct/main.sql?file=view_document.sql&amp;amp;FULL_DETAIL=Yes&amp;amp;ID=1156">http://www.childtrafficking.org/cgi-bin/ct/main.sql?file=view_document.sql&amp;amp;FULL_DETAIL=Yes&amp;amp;ID=1156</a></p>

<p>The Manhattan Project.  Whether something remains a total secret or functionally a secret is irrelevant.  As to your, no doubt continued belief that thousands of people can&#39;t keep secrets, our classification system literally relies on the notion.  Further, if you understand how classified information works, it is compartmentalized, so office A may not know what office b is doing, though both office A and B may still be working in concert. </p>

<p>I&#39;d prefer to believe elements of the government were not involved, but I am reminded that elements of our government have made regime change and terrorism a cottage industry.  There is proof that the US government at its highest levels planned a false flag terrorist attack against US targets in order to provoke a war with Cuba (Operation:  Northwoods).  </p>

<p>So, we have a government which knocks over other governments as a matter of convenience.  We have a government which is documented to have planned to conduct a false flag terrorist attack against US targets in order to further a foreign policy agenda, and we have the plethora of holes in the official conspiracy theory regarding 9/11.  </p>

<p>What is more likely do you think, the country with the strongest military defense on the planet had that vaunted defense circumvented by 19 box cutter wielding hijackers, or <em>elements</em> of the US government orchestrated the events?  As you thin about that, think about the sudden and massive shift in our foreign policy after 9/11/2001, as well as the establishment of the surveillance state as a direct result of those events.</p>

Why did then President Bush refuse to conduct an investigation for over a year into the biggest &#39;attack&#39; against america since Pearl Harbor?  Why was the Vice President in charge of Norad at the time?  Here is the one that really jumps out at me, where are all the tapes from the dozens of cameras surrounding the Pentagon?  Why did the FBI seize those within 30 minutes of the attack, and why have those tapes never seen the light of day?</p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t tell you who orchestrated it with any certainty, but based on circumstantial evidence as well as applying a little cui bono to the aftermath, I would have to say elements within our intel agencies in concert with Israel.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple things, and please don&#39;t take this wrong, but your definitions of certain words seem to be a little off.  Just because a conspiracy is discovered doesn&#39;t not make it a conspiracy.  A conspiracy is the act of 2 or more people doing something in secret that harms others.  Also, &#39;skeptic&#39; by definition is someone who questions all accepted opinions.  Lastly, you don&#39;t need to believe in UFO&#39;s to still recognize that area 51 exists and we don&#39;t know what goes on there... Unless you believe it either doesn&#39;t exist or that people aren&#39;t flown in everyday for work.</p>

<p>I have a theory on JFK that isn&#39;t as popular as the mainstream ones, but it&#39;s not as outlandish either. It would take me awhile to get into though. The TLDR is that the people in charge of the Alphabet Agencie, at the time, were alive during WW1 and saw the devastation that Gavrilo Princip&#39;s bullet brought to the world. I think it&#39;s very possible Oswald was a Russian plant, who might have gone rouge, and they covered that up cause they knew America would demand justice and wanted to avoid a war. </p>

<p>Maybe I misunderstood but it sounded like you were saying my comment was not a “logical comment” and wasn’t discussing the topic. </p>

<p>I guess I worded my original comment a bit harshly. I didn’t mean that everyone on this sub is crazy. I meant that the craziest, most outlandish theories are always the most upvoted and when some people on here see them at the top, they seem to take it as some kind of validation that the theory is true, regardless of the facts. Upvotes don’t necessarily mean I think your theory is true, they mean I think your theory is interesting and warrants discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shills argue using blanket statements. They try to present some outlandish claim with little to no proof. They go against logic often saying things just to evoke an emotional response. </p>

<p>I myself am in the middle ground when it comes to conspiracy theories. Like the astronaut one where people that died somehow have dopplegangers. Part of me thinks: &#39;well, it&#39;s just a coincidence&#39;, another part of me thinks, &#39;what if they took over other people&#39;s lives?&#39;</p>

<p>There will always be extremism in opinion and reaction. That&#39;s just how most of us are. The goal is to be moderate, but most of us lean more to one side than the other. I think this subreddit and the people posting in it are learning (including myself) to accept other people&#39;s opinions and not jump down their throats.</p>

<p>What I will not tolerate is when people try to undermine the subreddit, undermine the regular posters, and undermine the mods. That is what I will try to defend against. You can tell when people are pushing an agenda. It&#39;s hopefully obvious now to the regulars.</p>

<p>At this point, I&#39;m going to focus on supporting people with new ideas and protecting the sub from take-downs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, I love this thread. Wish a lot more posts were from skeptics like this. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t expect someone who isn&#39;t on board with 9/11 to ~believe in pizzagate, and maybe you were being hyperbolic, but I just want to say that Hillary isn&#39;t really involved with that theory and the basement (referred to by Alefantis) is a passed-over point. Do you have an opinion on pedogate?</p>

<p>But what I really want to ask is have you seen the doc September 11: The New Pearl Harbor? I think it&#39;s thorough and left almost no doubt for me. You mentioned that one of the reasons for not believing was the amount of people needed to keep a secret, but the documentary contends that you only need a few people working together if they are high enough up. Four people in key positions were unavailable during the attacks and it was the first day on the job for two others <a href="https://youtu.be/dWUzfJGmt5U?t=33m16s">[link].</a> But I like to think it shouldn&#39;t matter whether we think it could be kept a secret or not because they wanted to go through with Operation Northwoods. </p>

<p>Anyway you will be receiving a nice cornflower blue tag from me :) Thanks.</p>

<p>Well we sure as hell weren&#39;t best buddies with them either. The cold war was already planted in fertile soil well before the axis powers were crushed.</p>

<p>I mean the only reason we went ahead and dropped the bombs was because Russia was weeks away from staging their own land invasion of Japan, which directly opposed America&#39;s intentions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A couple things, and please don&#39;t take this wrong, but your definitions of certain words seem to be a little off.  Just because a conspiracy is discovered doesn&#39;t not make it a conspiracy.  A conspiracy is the act of 2 or more people doing something in secret that harms others.  Also, &#39;skeptic&#39; by definition is someone who questions all accepted opinions.  Lastly, you don&#39;t need to believe in UFO&#39;s to still recognize that area 51 exists and we don&#39;t know what goes on there... Unless you believe it either doesn&#39;t exist or that people aren&#39;t flown in everyday for work.</p>

<p>There were also numerous accounts by child abuse and rape victims who described the same details of ritual abuse and sacrifice. These details were given to trained psychiatrists and psychologists across the country and even the world. The following video contains examples of such testimonies.</p>
