        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am impressed by how informed so many people are about climate change and about how it is not caused by man or carbon emissions (anthropogenic sources). You see through the lies of the globalists trying to take everyone&#39;s money. They demand people go &quot;green&quot; and cite &quot;global warming&quot; and its consequences as the reason. </p>

<p>However, if their intention was to simply extract money, it would not be such a big deal. I suspect something much more sinister is afoot - something much more devastating than any tax.</p>

<p>To begin to understand it, one must know about climate change and the Sun. The climate is always changing. That is natural. Here is why.</p>

<p>The Sun is not a self-consuming island in space. The consistency of solar cycles becomes more understandable when you realize the Sun has an external source of power. There are invisible plasma currents connecting everything in the galaxy/universe. Stars are like trains in that they are pretty much on rails (our Sun travels at 70,000 km/hr!). And they are like the flame of a candle in the sense that those rails are an invisible wick. The output of the flame depends on where it is on the wick - a thick part or a thin part. The output of our star depends on how much energy it is being given and that somewhat depends on where it is on its path through the galaxy. That path is cyclical (something like a coil/spiral or a coil/spiral in a coil/spiral). The cycle repeats like every 26,000 years.</p>

<p>From there you can see that there is the possibility of a repeating cosmically induced catastrophe/cataclysm that would wipe the slate clean (except for a few pyramids here and there) every 10,000 years or so. If only there was something that was trying to warn of such an eschaton in our immediate future or a record of it in the distant past... nah, those are just meritless stories - fiction, fantasy, myth... right?</p>

<p>As for the calamity, it seems certain it has to do with the electromagnetic equilibrium between the Earth and the Sun. Have you seen how violently magnets shake and jump into place? If the Earth does something like that then the movement of the oceans will undoubtedly make a cataclysm of Biblical proportions - one that makes any tsunami we have witnessed look like not even a ripple. Cataclysmos is the ancient word and it specifically refers to the destruction on Earth by water.</p>

<p>Another side effect of a change in the magnetic status of the Earth is the temporary (a few days to a few weeks) loss or weakening of the magnetosphere - the force field that protects us from cosmic radiation and meteors. The surface of the Earth would literally be scorched by fire from the heavens. Perhaps that is what the people at Derinkuyu Cappadoccia were trying to escape by making an underground city. </p>

<p>The Sun drives the Earth&#39;s climate. That means the climate of the Earth is an open system - not a closed system. Therefore, the second law of thermodynamics does not apply (it is the common reference of &quot;educated&quot; folk to debunk the possibility of &quot;free energy&quot;).</p>

<p>John R. R. Searl made a generator that works the same way as a dam. Except instead of water it uses the endless flow of energy from the Sun (though I don&#39;t believe it can be called solar. It uses electrons, not sunlight). So by this function he does not even claim overunity. He does not have to when there is a practically infinite supply of energy that was previously untapped (it is in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics - not using energy from &quot;nowhere&quot;). He calls his device the SEG (Searl Effect Generator) and it has some remarkable traits: it gets colder and lighter.</p>

<p>Searl is quite relevant to the topic of the Sun driving the Earth&#39;s climate. I see that fact as the primary reason for so much disinformation regarding climate change and global warming. Soon after people realize we are not in control of our climate, they will see why - the Sun. And from there &quot;free energy&quot; is only a couple steps away as they realize we are not a &quot;closed system&quot; - the saying that has closed so many people&#39;s minds on the subject. So the ones who profit from people believing in &quot;man-made&quot; climate change are not just the likes of Al Gore and green/global warming organizations - it is anyone who profits from a finite source of energy that can be metered (oil, etc.) because they will be made obsolete BY THE POWER OF RA!!! </p>

<p>But their plotting does not cease at protecting profits. Perhaps you have heard of rich elites making self-sustaining underground sanctuaries which can allow them to survive something as severe as nuclear war. What if I told you that surviving nuclear war was not the primary reason for those shelters? Disaster is certain. Time is not - or is it? The time is probably predictable but only if you have knowledge of the power density beyond our solar system (the rails/wick) or have been around for 30,000 years.</p>

<p>Here is one of my favorite documentaries. It gets really nutty after 1 hour in. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=4727s&amp;amp;v=2fS9ixfQ_no">https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=4727s&amp;v=2fS9ixfQ_no</a>
In general it is a total BTFO of standard archaeology/egyptology.</p>

<p>A very strange Great Pyramid &quot;coincidence” related to the speed of light was discovered by John Charles Webb Jr. :
Precise latitude of the centre of the Grand Gallery (inside GP) is
29° 58′ 45.28″ N = 29.9792458° N</p>

<p>The speed of light in vacuum, usually denoted by c, is a universal physical constant important in many areas of physics ( 299,792,458 metres /s ).</p>

<p>This also implies they (the builders) not only knew the speed of light but they used the meter and the same GPS system as us (latitude at least) and clearly did not believe the Earth was flat.</p>

After being inspired by a series of dreams and figuring out some 3D math with magic squares (something like Sudoku but apparently with practical applications), John R. R. Searl made the Searl Effect Generator back in the 50s. An electric company confiscated it soon after. Now there is a legal battle for his patent. They intend to erase the inventor from being associated with the invention. They even renamed it the Spatial Effect Generator. Searl is now 85 years old and I fear this invention will soon be forever lost to the deep dark void of technology secrecy.</p>

This is Randall Carlson. He details exceptional geographical evidence of super-mega-ultra-floods with a focus on the Younger Dryas. He proposes the cause of the melting glaciers was a shower of comets. I think it is possible that such abnormal space debris was not necessary. Perhaps that was a time when the Earth&#39;s magnetosphere temporarily weakened or disappeared. Meteors that would have typically burnt up in the sky were free to reach the vulnerable solid surface of the planet. The solid surface of the planet was also vulnerable to radiation that would have typically been shielded against.</p>

<p>On the other hand, maybe comets (and lightning) are the correct explanation...

This is Rolf Witzsche&#39;s site. He studied ice cores to learn about the climate of the past. Through such methods it was possible to see an extreme climate cycle spanning back as far as could be seen (millions of years). The Earth was in a state of ice age 90% of the time (with warmer periods such as now lasting only about 10,000 years). He goes on to explain this with the Electric Sun model.

Make sure you turn on subtitles. This is one of the most concise and entertaining ways of learning about the Sumerian texts and the Anunnaki. The most relevant part is when they make it illegal to warn humans about their impending doom. We were hated by most of them. They called us abominations. They wanted us erased from the planet but did not want to do the dirty work themselves. They left it up to our ignorance of the inevitable periodically reoccurring cataclysm on Earth. One of them clearly broke that law and told some people (Ziusudra/Noah) how to survive. Refer to part 18 and 19. He technically did not break the law. He was talking to the reed hut. Ziusudra just happened to be able to hear every word because he was inside the reed hut. But was there <em>intent</em> to declassify that information? ;)</p>

<p>Are there Anunnaki still trying to erase us by keeping us ignorant? I would not say it is impossible (I do not think it is likely because they would not be happy if the evil selfish technology-hoarding elite humans survived)(or maybe they are fine with the vast majority of humanity being wiped out and then terminating the remaining survivors themselves). But it is irrelevant. </p>

<p>The bottom line is that there are ill-willed forces out there whose mission is to keep us ignorant. We cannot afford to remain so. Denying anthropogenic climate change and keeping our money was the first step. Let&#39;s take the next one.</p>

<p>Realize Earth is not a closed system. It has input from the Sun which in turn has input as well. We can harness the unlimited power coursing through this interconnected open system and properly prepare for the challenges ahead.</p>

<p>Rolf Witzsche talks about how the decrease in solar output will mean that typical crops will not be able to grow unless located near the equator. His proposed solution is to make a global floating bridge along the equator with floating farms branching off along its length. In my opinion, this solution is far too fragile and would not survive bombardments from space or intense trembling of the Earth and the ensuing movement of the oceans.</p>

<p>We need methods of food production that can exist in harsh conditions (cold, dark, and no rain) on a vastly massive scale. We should probably have some sort of underground controlled environment biosphere with man-made sunlight and fresh water - earthquake and flood proof. Might as well make cities underground as well. Make them sealed and impervious to billions of tons of water pressure. And of course make them earthquake proof up to magnitude 30 or something.</p>

<p>If you are wondering why NASA is so incompetent to get it all wrong all the time, inquire about their origins. Operation Paperclip</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Operation Paperclip was a secret program of the Joint Intelligence Objectives Agency in which more than 1,600 German scientists, engineers, and technicians, such as Wernher von Braun and his V-2 rocket team, were recruited in post-Nazi Germany and taken to the U.S. for government employment, primarily between 1945 and 1959; many were former members and some were former leaders of the Nazi Party.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is likely they have been sabotaging our understanding on purpose. And it may not simply be due to loyalty to Germany or nazis. Those who controlled the nazis likely already had tendrils of influence in the USA and they simply brought over their assets from Germany.</p>

<p>Heard of the Business Plot? Or Major General Smedley Butler? A group of fascists aimed to take over the USA in the 1930s and they chose Butler to be the man to lead the coup. Fortunately for us, he was a true patriot and instead warned the nation and named all the conspirators. However, no punishment was given to the people involved in the attempted coup (apparently for the same reason their coup could have succeeded - they could crash our economy).
<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=blhHuX1KSGw">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=blhHuX1KSGw</a></p>

<p>Another clue is Operation Highjump
<a href="http://www.stevequayle.com/index.php?s=36">http://www.stevequayle.com/index.php?s=36</a>
Admiral Forrestal was suicided out of one of the top floors of a hospital he was being held in against his will after ranting about nazi ufos and bases in Antarctica. He was the Secretary of the Navy and the first Secretary of Defense and was in charge of the operation - a pursuit of the remaining nazi forces to Antarctica at the end of World War II.</p>

<p>You can look up the official documentary about Operation Highjump (released the year after the mission) that claims it was purely an exploratory mission and that the only enemy there was the cold harsh weather. It reeks of cover-up propaganda.</p>

<p>The Roswell UFO crash happened one year before Operation Highjump. Maybe it was a nazi craft.</p>

<p>74 NASA scientists have died in 2 years (other sources say 10 years, still insane)
<a href="http://www.ufointernationalproject.com/latest-news/another-dead-nasa-scientist-seventy-four-scientists-dead-in-2-years/">http://www.ufointernationalproject.com/latest-news/another-dead-nasa-scientist-seventy-four-scientists-dead-in-2-years/</a>
Coincidence surely</p>

<p>Jim Marrs is an author that died last year. He wrote about the subject of Nazis secretly taking over America.</p>

<p>For such a thing to be possible they would have to infiltrate and control everything. The Military Industrial Complex was probably their priority. Recall Eisenhower&#39;s famous speech about the MIC. Recall JFK&#39;s famous speech about secret societies. Note Operation Mockingbird in which the CIA assumed control of every source of news in the country since 1950. One of the main conspirators in the Business Plot was Prescott Bush Senior - the father of George Herbert Walker Bush. Other than being the 41st POTUS, George H. W. Bush was a director of the CIA and by some theories is implicated in the assassination plot of JFK.</p>

<p>Finally, imagine what the most important step would be in subjugating a country. It likely has to do with the capital. Either take it over or demonstrate that you have the overwhelming and unstoppable ability to do so.

<a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4-MbGYAv7Cg">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4-MbGYAv7Cg</a></p>

<p>Guess who was in charge of security of the WTC when the order was given to stop bomb-sniffing dog patrols right before the attack - Marvin Bush.</p>

<p>And if you want to go one terrifying step further, look up the evidence for Directed Energy Weapons being used on 9/11. </p>

<p>Maybe one of the reasons why the cold war never went hot is because the USA and USSR were aware of our common enemy waiting for us to destroy eachother. Maybe the nazis even intervened and wanted to prevent their perceived inheritance from being poisoned with radiation.</p>

<p>TL;DR: The Sun has cycles of varying output. Climate change is driven by those cycles - not by carbon or man. Ignorance/denial of this fact leads to two things much more consequential than any tax.
1. &quot;Free&quot; energy will be seen as impossible and unattainable. The illusion of scarcity will persist.
2. We will not be prepared for the coming ice age (starvation), cataclysm (deluge of Biblical proportions caused by shaking of the Earth), or rain of fire (radiation and meteors from space while the magnetosphere is temporarily weakened/absent). But the informed elite will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was genuinely interested because this seems like a fascinating topic, but the basic science of it doesn’t seem to work out though. All I’ve ever seen is single ring prototypes, if they use multiple rings the cylinders won’t spin as they’ll be stuck in place due to the opposing magnetic pulls from inside and outside. As for the generator getting colder, if that is true it wouldn’t follow the laws of thermodynamics... just too many unanswered questions for a skeptic like me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so where does the First law specify that the SEG cannot get colder without violating it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Machines that produce work with no energy input are impossible.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The SEG has energy input. The magnetic waveforms on the rollers guide electrons through the generator to the reservoir. The Earth is showered in an endless supply of electrons from the Sun.</p>

<p>And as stated in the post, the second law does not apply because the SEG operates on an open system. The second law applies to closed systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is touched on in the other comment. Neodymium lacks some outer electrons so free electrons are drawn to it. The waveforms are where it gets complicated and I will not pretend to be an expert on them. The first time I heard of magic squares was when I learned about the SEG. However, they have existed for a very long time (Jainism). They have not really been interpreted as having a practical purpose until Searl had those dreams.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Professor Searl has never claimed &quot;overunity&quot;, or that the SEG &quot;puts out more than in.&quot; Only a proportional conversion.</p>

<p>Searl Effect Technology effectively utilizes quantum kinetic energy which involves the electron&#39;s inherent ability to absorb and emit energy at the quantum level with an energy cycle that can be compared to the hydroelectric dam in principle since both are driven directly or indirectly by entropy of the Sun&#39;s radiant energy. A dam builds up potential and kinetic energy by way of cloud condensation that forms rain and fills reservoirs, but does so only after it has achieved a higher energy level by way of evaporation from ground levels. Whereas the SEG utilizes its layer of neodymium as a reservoir of electrons, Teflon layer is analogous to the dam itself, Magnetic layer as the power plant that makes useful work out of the currents and finally the copper layer that compares well to the water outlets that can be seen to jet out of the bottom of the dam; similarly the SEG ram-jets electrons out to the atmosphere. At this point, energy levels of the water jets or in the case of electrons, are kinetically reduced exiting the system, but be mindful that these discharges go back to the environment to recharge. Therein, ambient energy restores their energy levels up by way of evaporation of water or as with the SEG, the uniform emission of electrons to the outside air exposes them to the atmosphere&#39;s ambient sources energy or temperature which raises the electron&#39;s quantum energy levels back up to natural ambient levels. Thereafter, the external sources of electrons are attracted back to the relatively positive potential of the electron depleted neodymium layer (reservoir) where the energy cycle continuously repeats. It is a process that effectively strips kinetic energy out of the electrons before they are emitted; no different in principle from the energy cycle of the hydroelectric dam where the kinetics of the water flow are harnessed. In this manner, both ways gather ambient sources of energy that can be processed and made useful for electrical applications. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot going on here but I wanted to add to your Sumerian story, which absolutely fascinates me. The Annunaki that warned man about the flood was Enki. Enki is also responsible for the creation of man by mixing his personal DNA with a primitive hominid from earth. After a few tries, modern man was created. His brother Enlil is the one that despised mankind and ordered for everyone to be exterminated because he thought we were load and annoying.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s were it gets interesting. Enki was considered a scientist and his symbol was a snake. He is aka Lucifer. His brother Enlil was considered a commander/general type and was symbolized by the eagle. Enlil is aka Yahweh.</p>

<p>Lucifer creating and saved man from extinction. Yahweh hated man and tried 3 x to have us all murdered. This is the true great deception from the Bible. Remember, the Sumerian text was written a couple thousand years before the Bible. It was essentially copied at times and became the back bone of the Bible.  </p>

<p>People are praying to the war God Yahweh, who hates them, and we wonder why our world is so fucked. The god that considered man to be his sons/daughters is hated and considered the worst being that has ever existed.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t shoot the messenger, this is Short version of the Sumerian creation story. I&#39;m just passing the info on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for that explanation! It is a truly vast topic.</p>

<p>Btw i thought &quot;Enki&quot; was a title - lord on the Earth.
Ki = Earth.
Anunnaki = those who from heaven came to Earth.
(Interesting how that is the literal translation when their supreme leader in the beginning was called &quot;Anu.&quot; Maybe that was just a title too - referring to heaven/space being his domain.)</p>

<p>So then Marduk was Enki&#39;s son? And later the Earth was left to Marduk (after Enlil ruined it with nuclear weapons).</p>

<p>Also, what were the three attempts? One was to deny us knowledge of the flood. Another was a war with Marduk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I love this topic and could talk about it for hours. For me it answers a lot of questions about different topics and has been a huge part of my journey for truth.</p>

<p>Right, Enki means god of water, knowledge etc.  Enlil who outranked Enki 50 to 40, was god of wind, Earth,etc and was named commander of earth.</p>

<p>Anu, is their father, ranked 60. Funny because Enlil sat to the right of Anu and Enki was on the left hand side. </p>

<p>Enki had a son called Ningishzidda, who became Thoth after moving to Egypt. His other son was Marduk, correct.</p>

<p>The 3 attempts were plague, famine and flood. Enki broke a vow of silence to tell man to prepare for the flood. Enlil was furious. Another fun fact, prior to the creation of man there was a lower ranking group of Annunaki called igigi. After all the work they rebelled against Enlil demanding help with the mining. This rebellion was led by a being named Allah. Not hard to piece that together. So many answers in these texts,it&#39;s amazing.</p>

<p>Michael Tsarion is another favorite of mine, he&#39;s into Atlantis and the movement to Egypt after the cataclysm. I&#39;m not 100%on this link but he&#39;s got amazing stuff</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So what is your opinion on them being called the &quot;Anunnaki&quot; and that being interpreted as &quot;those who from heaven came to Earth&quot; yet their dad is named &quot;Anu&quot;? Does it simply mean his name translates to heaven? Or is the interpretation/translation of &quot;Anunnaki&quot; incorrect?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t claim to be an expert or anything but I think Anu translates to &quot;heavenly one&quot;, so I have no issues with the name Annunaki. Makes sense to me that there&#39;s a root word that was built on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess in a way. From what I understand when Adam and Eve were created those names are the names of a &quot;race&quot; for lack of a better term, they aren&#39;t individual people with those names.</p>

<p>I believe that A&amp;E&#39;s were the 3rd and final version of man. So when they have the children, Cain and Able, now it makes sense that they didn&#39;t have sex and procreate with their own mother. There were other , slightly different versions of humans already living at the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome posts on the Annunaki! I&#39;ve been reading about the Demiurge lately and i&#39;m curious if you&#39;re familiar with that whole sphere of the tale? According to Manly P. Hall&#39;s paraphrasing of the ancients in Secret Teachings of the Ages, he talks about how the gnostics and later the rosicrucians and other christian sects considered the demiurge to be the jewish materialist god yahweh, and not the superior deity. Is there anyway that these two mythos could coincide?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks! Im skipping forward in the story a bit but as far as I know Yahweh/Enlil despised humans and had tried 3 times to exterminate us because we were&quot;loud, annoying and rebellious.&quot; He had a rank of 50 and was basically a military commander. Enki/Lucifer was a scientist ranked 40 and was Enlils 1/2 brother. Enki was the being that physically created created man with his own DNA by mixing it with a primitive hominid on Earth. After 3 tries the Adamu and Eve version was created to be gold mining slaves.</p>

<p>After some time and complaints by man Yahweh ordered for everyone to be exterminated by the flood. Enki/Lucifer broke rank and warned man about the flood and saved mankind. He considers humans his children because of his DNA that was used to create man. Yahweh was furious. After the flood sunk Atlantis, their home base, Enki and family moved to Egypt and set up that civilization. Enki&#39;s thrn was known as Ptah his one son became Marduk and the other became Thoth. After a while Enki gave control of Egypt to Marduk and I believe they say Enki becomes his light body and leaves earth.</p>

<p>Yahweh outranked all the other gods and was given control of earth, which is why I believe he was considered the &quot;true&quot; god. All beings would be God&#39;s to man but if one is giving orders and all the rest follow them he would appear as the big boss.</p>

<p>The only higher ranking beings over Yahweh were his mother and father. His father&#39;s name is Anu and he ranks at 60.  I&#39;ve said it before but considering the state of our world it seems like the Christians and Jews pray to Yahweh the war god, who despised man and wanted to kill themall.  he is a rapist (he raped his 1/2 sister) and psychopath with no regard for any life  on the planet. No wonder there is constant war and suffering.</p>

<p>His brother Lucifer created man and saved us for sure death and he is hated and considered the worst being that has ever existed. Amazing stuff. Hope that helps you and gave you a good answer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure thing happy I could help. I&#39;d suggest Gerald Clark and Michael Tsarion,both have YouTube channels with a tremendous amount of info on the stuff. Gerald created a geneology chart to track all the Annunaki bloolines and is overflowing with knowledge.  Michael is my favorite alternative researcher and has a fantastic presentation on the destruction of Atlantis and the movement towards Egypt after the cataclysm. Tons of sources and very thorough. Can&#39;t go wrong with either one of those guys. Good luck!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I simply believe that it is a no brainier that there were many text that were written before the bible. The bible is a book of letters that were all written &quot;after the fact&quot; by the Holy Spirit (God) through selected men. All these other stories hold some truth but they are lies meant to confuse. Lucifer want you to believe he is God. The bible makes more sense than any other book of ancient text on the planet. And if you actually study the bible you will see that it plainly tells you that the earth is billions of years old and there was an ice age over 10,000 years ago that destroyed an ancient civilization that was very intelligent.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>God in the eternal past (Ps. 90:2; 93:2; Mic. 5:2; Heb. 9:14). </p></li>
<li><p>The drafting of God&#39;s plan (Heb. 1:3; 11:3; Eph. 3:11; 1 Pet. 1:20</p></li>
<li><p>Creation of the heavens, including the sun, moon, and stars (Gen. 1:1; Col. 1:15-18; Ps. 8:3; 90:2; 95:5; 102:25; Isa. 40:12, 26; 45:12; 48:13). </p></li>
<li><p>Creation of the spirit-world before the earth was created. (Job 38:4-7; Cor 1:15.-1 )</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is when the spirit world was created including demons. There are many kinds of demon spirits, fallen angels and other spirit beings mentioned in scripture. It is certain they were not created wicked. They were originally created perfect and sinless and became fallen and unclean. Even the prince of demons is spoken of as being “perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, TILL iniquity was found in thee” (Ezek 28:11-17). God could not and did not created anything sinful. Everything in the spirit and human realms that is wicked and rebellious has become this way because of sin and because of free choice.</p>

<p>The fallen angels, demons and other beings are all rebels in connection with the planet Earth. They have sinned with the ORIGNAL rebellion on Earth under Lucifer, or they would not be confined in prisons under the Earth or be operating on the Earth now against God. That those below have sinned in connection with the Earth is clear from the fact that they are confined in the abyss underneath the Earth.</p>

<ol>
<li>Creation of the Earth. The Earth made perfect the first time, not creating it in vein. (Gen. 1:1; Job 38:4-7; Isa. 45:18; Heb. 11:3). </li>
</ol>

<p>The sons of God shouted for joy and all the stars sang when God created earth. (Job 38:4-7) So this means they were made before hand. So I would assume logically that God created heaven…and then all its inhabitant and then God created Earth and all its in habitants in that order. </p>

<p>Everything God created was created perfect THE FIRST TIME. God does not create anything void waste and empty and in chaos. So earth was not created void and without form.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Creation of &quot;the world [kosmos, social order] that then was&quot; (2 Pet. 3:5-9; Isa. 14:12-14; 45:18; Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 28:11-17).  </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer&#39;s reign over &quot;the world that then was&quot; (Isa. 14:12-14; Jer 4:23-26; Ezek 28:11-17; Col 1:15-18) The length of his rule unknown.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>2 Peter 3:6 is not talking about Noah&#39;s flood because that world did not &quot;Perish&quot; for Noah and his family survived. It is talking about 3 worlds. The world that then was, the world that is now and the world that is to come.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Other thrones, dominions, principalities and powers of the universe (Col. 1:15-18; Eph. 1:21; 3:10; 1 Pet. 3:22). </p></li>
<li><p>The Kingdom of God universal; God the Supreme moral governor of the universe, and all in harmony with Him (Job 38; Dan. 4:17, 25, 32, 35) Length of the rule of the universal harmonious kingdom, before Lucifer started his rebellion is unknown. </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer, the original ruler of the planet Earth, conceives the idea conceives the idea that he can get the co-operation of other angelic beings of the universe, dethrone God, come the exalted supreme ruler of the universe (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; 1 Tim. 3:6). </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer carries out his plans and through pride falls and foments rebellion by slander and accusations against the Almighty. He causes his own earth-kingdom subjects and over one-third of God&#39;s angels (Rev. 12:7-12) to rebel against Him. The Earth enters its first sinful career (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; 1 Tim. 3:6). The length of the uprising is unknown. </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer instigates rebellion and persuades everyone possible to rebel. He openly breaks relations with God and His government, and leads his rebels from the appointed place of mobilization on Earth into Heaven to dethrone God; but he is met by Michael and the faithful angels, and is defeated and cast as lightning back to the Earth (Isa. 14:12-14; Ezek. 28:11-17; Luke 10:18). </p></li>
<li><p>God completely destroys Lucifer&#39;s kingdom on Earth, judges the earth with Darkness, just as Darkness is used for judgment or evil throughout almost every other place in the bible (why would Gen 1:2 be any different) and curses the Earth by destroying every bird, animal, fish, city, inhabitant, and all vegetation. He then turns the Earth upside down and by means of a great flood makes it empty and a waste (Gen. 1:2; Ps. 104:5-9; Isa. 14:12-14; Jer. 4:23-26; Ezek. 28:11-17; 2 Pet. 3:5-9). The length of the pre-Adamite flood on the Earth is unknown. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Moses, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Jesus, Peter, Paul and John all teach the overthrow of the pre-Adamite world. (I can prove this if you ask)
Now here is Jeremiah </p>

<p>Jeremiah 4:23-26
 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
25 I beheld, and, lo, <em>there was no man</em>, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.</p>

<p>He saw Genesis 1:2 and what else did he see there? He saw broken down cities, a wilderness, birds that were fled and <em>no man</em>. Which implies there was something inhabited on the earth at this time as well as animals and some kind of being that that built cities. </p>

<p>These had to be earthly subjects because God created the earth to be inhabited. They also built cities that could be broken down. These were not Human but man. Just like when someone take the mark they will no longer be human. The redemption period or trial period must have been like the angels. Nobody knows how long it lasted. They were made perfect and without sin though. God only makes perfect things. Just like in Noah&#39;s day they were destroyed after God&#39;s long suffering ran out. (Isa 45:18) It will always be inhabited with earthly subjects. Even after the Millennium. </p>

<p>Earth was in a state of judgment (Darkness) and broken down and destroyed by God&#39;s fierce anger. Darkness everywhere in the bible is referred to has judgment or evil. Just as in Gen 1:2 Because God is light and in Him there is no darkness.</p>

<p>So now you see Lucifer weekend these nations and tried to invade heaven ALREADY way before the war in revelations. This is why he fell and was in the garden when Adam was there.</p>

<p>Now go to Ezekiel 28:13-15: “Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold; the workmanship of they tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. Thou are the anointed cherub that covereth and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee”.</p>

<p>Lucifer was made perfect he was the most powerful being next to God and walked in a garden of eden on earth before Adams garden. UNTIL iniquity was found in him and he got filled with pride and went and trafficked all the land with his earthly subjects and deceived them. Then when he invaded Heaven his tail drew a third of the angels (rev 12:4) Which basically means he deceived them as well.</p>

<p>So when they &quot;ascended to heaven&quot;, it really makes you wonder if they had some incredible technology or if it was only the angels. Why would Satan need to deceive everyone on earth if they were not going to join him in a war? &quot;<em>just like he is doing again</em>&quot;  History repeats itself.</p>

<p>Now this verse is talking about two things as well as the antichrist if you read all the context. So you really have to connect Isaiah and Ezek together. And then just use some logic. His kingdom had to be on earth if he was going to ascend above the clouds and stars.</p>

<p>Rev 12:4 is talking about the war in heaven from the dateless past. As we already understand that 1/3 of the angels are ruling the earth now.</p>

<p>Hebrews 2:5 we read this:
&#39;&#39;For unto the angels hath God not put in subjection the world to come of which we
speak.&quot; In other words, The World Tomorrow, the Kingdom of God, will not be under
subjection to angels. The present one is under subjection of fallen angels. The
demons, and the devil who is their head, rule this present earth and sway its
inhabitants. </p>

<p>but verse rev 12:15 is talking about the future war in heaven (rev 12:7 and 20:1-10)</p>

<p>2 Thessalonians 2:4 is only talking about the antichrist, not Satan. It is only a man, the son of perdition that exalts himself above all that is called God. But he is really just a man.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So now we get to the war in heaven in Revelation 12 So the proper verses to link these to are Danial 11:45-12:1; Isaiah 24:21-22; 25:7-8 and 27:1</p>

<p>This war in heaven will be the last actual struggle between Satan and God over the possession of the heavenlies where Satan reigns as stated in EPH 2:2 and 6:12
Satan does not live in heaven but still has access to accuse but after this casting out he will never have access again has stated in Job:1:6 2:1 and also in Rev 12:7-12 and it also says it in Zech 3:6-9</p>

<p>Now the war predicted here in revelation that takes place in future could not have been the same war in heaven that took place in Isaiah 14:12-14 because it would not make any sense. Luke 10:18 clarifies this. For Satan cannot cast out Satan. This war was in the dateless past before the recreation of Genesis 1:3 started. The only thing in Rev that references the war in heaven in the past is Rev 12:4 which is symbolic for of the third of God’s angels that rebelled with Lucifer and showing how many will be with him in the future war in heaven under the 7th trumpet.</p>

<p>This war in heaven is in the future because ALL events from revelations 4:1-22:5 must be after the churches And the war in Isaiah was talking about when Satan Fell in the past and how he would be defeated in the future. (God’s grand plan)</p>

<p>It is interesting because if you read all of Psalms chapter 2 it is clearly a conversation with 3 people (The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.) I just don&#39;t know which one is talking when but they are describing how people fight against God and how they are scoffing at the evil world that is so foolish</p>

<p>The Antichrist is going to get a lot of the earthly inhabitants to actually wage war against God like he did in the kingdom he ruled over in the dateless past. History repeats itself. This is what transhumanism will probably do. Create Satan&#39;s army to wage war with Christ when he returns. </p>

<p>The battle of Armageddon will not be an ordinary battle between two sets of earthly nations. It will be a battle between the armies of heaven under Christ and the armies of the Earth under the dragon, the beat and the false prophet. On the side of Christ will be earthly Israel (Zech 14:1-15), the angels of God (Matt 25:31-45;  2 Thess 1 :7-10) and the resurrected saints of ages (Zech 14:1-5; Jude 14; Rev 19:11-21). On the side of Antichrist there will be the devil and his angels and demons (Rev 12:7-12; 16:13-16; Rev 20:1-3) the ten kingdoms who will have been recently conquered by Antichrist (Dan 11:44; Ezek 38, 39; Rev 16:12) and many other nations that will co-operate with the Antichrist through the ministry of the three unclean frogs (Rev 16:13-16; Zech 14:1-5, 16; Ezek 38, 39)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The Spirit of God begins to move upon the flooded Earth and in the darkness which covered the waters to restore the Earth to a habitable state, and to create new land animals, fish, fowls, vegetation, and Adam as the new ruler of the Earth (Gen. 1:2; Ps. 104:6-9). Length of the re-creation is six days (Gen. 1:3-2:25; Ex. 20:8-11; 31:15). </p></li>
<li><p>The Earth is made perfect a second time and all things in the universe are again in harmony with God as before Lucifer&#39;s rebellion; except Lucifer and his spirit rebels are still at large in the heavenlies to further God&#39;s plan in the probationary periods of the human race should man fall (Gen. 1:3-2:25; Eph. 2:1-3; 6:10-18; Job 1:6; 2:1; Rev. 12:7-12) . </p></li>
<li><p>THE FIRST PROBATIONARY PERIOD-The Dispensation of Innocence. The length of this period was about six days. (Gen. 2:17-3:24). </p></li>
<li><p>Lucifer (now the devil or adversary of God and man called Satan) enters the restored Earth, using an intelligent creature of God that as a will of its own, that could apparently already communicate (when have you ever heard of Satan using a creature of God to talk to a human after this incident?) with man before the curse, willingly lets Satan use him as a tool to tempts man and causes his fall, thus regaining dominion of the Earth and all things therein (Gen. 3; Luke 4; John 12:31; 2 Cor 4:4; Rev. 11: 15 ; 20:1-10). </p></li>
<li><p>Rebellion starts again on the Earth by the second ruler of Earth. Man is judged, the Earth is again cursed, the serpent is punished for life and enters its second sinful career, and all creatures are brought under the bondage of sin and corruption (Gen. 3; Rom. 5:12-21; 8: 19-23)</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;The heavens and the earth which are now&quot; since the restoration work of the six days, and since the new curse on the Earth await the time of the second renovation and third perfect state of Earth. Called the New Heavens and New Earth (2 Peter 3:5-13; Rom 8:19-23; Heb 1:10-12; 12:24-28; Rev 21-22)</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Amazingly well-sourced. Thank you!</p>

<p>Btw I have friends that know a lot about the Bible but I cannot really talk to them about these things because they are stuck on the idea that the Earth is only 6,000 years old. Got any arguments or explanations that can help me?</p>
</div>

    <div class="md"><p>No where in the bible does it say the earth is 6,000 years old. I think Jeremiah proves it. If Jeremiah saw the earth &quot;without form and void&quot; then that means God showed him the earth &quot;at creation&quot; Genesis 1:2 and Jeremiah says he saw broken down cities and says the earth was once a fruitful place turned into a wilderness. All done by the anger of the Lord. So if God showed Jeremiah this then the idea that God created the Earth the first time in Genesis 1:2 makes zero sense. And it also proves that there was a dateless past that God is not revealing. Which proves the earth is way older than 6,000 years old. </p>

<p>Jeremiah 4:23-26
 I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light.
24 I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly.
25 I beheld, and, lo, <em>there was no man</em>, and all the birds of the heavens were fled.
26 I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger.</p>

<p>He saw Genesis 1:2 and what else did he see there? He saw broken down cities, a wilderness, birds that were fled and <em>no man</em>. Which implies there was something inhabited on the earth at this time as well as animals and some kind of being that that built cities. </p>

<p>Job 38:4-7 English Standard Version (ESV)
4 “Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?
    Tell me, if you have understanding.
5 Who determined its measurements—surely you know!
    Or who stretched the line upon it?
6 On what were its bases sunk,
    or who laid its cornerstone,
7 when the morning stars sang together
    and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</p>

<p>So Ask your friends exactly what God asked Job. &quot;Where were you when I did all this?&quot; Also if God all the sons of God and stars sang and shouted for joy when God created the earth, then that means they were made before hand somewhere in the dateless past. &quot;In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth&quot; You can only assume that God does things in order. And The heavens had inhabitants right after he created the heavens. So logically the earth had inhabitants right after he created earth.</p>

<p>Here is a passage of the bible telling you plainly that God did not create the earth in a state of chaos like it says in Genesis 1:2.</p>

<p>Isaiah 45:18 King James Version (KJV)
18 For thus saith the Lord that created the heavens; God himself that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord; and there is none else.</p>

<p>Here is another translation</p>

<p>Isaiah 45:18 Young&#39;s Literal Translation (YLT)
18 For thus said Jehovah, Creator of heaven, He is God, Former of earth, and its Maker, He established it -- not empty He prepared it, For inhabiting He formed it: `I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else.</p>

<p>So ask your friends which verse is true? God create the earth void and without form. It is very obvious that God created the Earth perfect the first time and it BECAME a place of chaos.</p>

<p>For me the Sumerian creation story fills some holes and answers questions that didn&#39;t make sense to me just using the Bible. It&#39;s been a fantastic supplement and lots of puzzle pieces are falling into place for me now. The details are unnecessary to get into but this is working for me so I&#39;m stoked I found it. Best of luck friend.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also wanted to mention a theory about the Giza pyramid. If you follow the Sumerian stories you will know about the need for gold for their atmosphere. This is actually the reason Enki created man, to be a gold mine slave. The gold that was mined was to be turned into monatomic gold, a white power, that was to be spread in the atmosphere of their planet.</p>

<p>After the cataclysm/flood which was ordered to kill everything, the &quot;base&quot; of the Annunaki was destroyed. It was on Atlantis. The Annunaki then moved to Egypt and started that civilization. Hieroglyphics show the pharoahs eating a little white cake. This was also the monatomic gold, which was believed to have health benefits and also help synchronize brain activity. The theory I read was that the great pyramid at Giza was actually a massive factory to create the monatomic gold. Pretty interesting. Again, not my theory, don&#39;t shoot the messenger. I just thought it might be appreciated by this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome thanks. Ill look into it for sure. The  texts apparently mentioned a gold mine in a specific place in South Africa. I read that these mines have been found and we&#39;re carbon dated to approx. 200,000 years ago. For me that&#39;s another piece of this puzzle that falls into place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Revelation of the Pyramids is one of my favorite documentaries too. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve believed for quite awhile that the sun is responsible for climate change due to cyclical weakening of the magnetosphere. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve ever read anything about the Ibex Ribbon, but it&#39;s a ribbon of energetic particles.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.space.com/24692-mysterious-energy-ribbon-solar-system.html">https://www.space.com/24692-mysterious-energy-ribbon-solar-system.html</a></p>

<p>Now the solar system &quot;Bob&#39;s&quot; through denser areas of this &quot;medium.&quot;</p>

<p>Understanding how cosmic rays affect the heliosphere is important so that we can better understand how the heliosphere protects us. Our heliosphere is like a cocoon being inflated in the interstellar medium by the solar wind. As our Sun orbits the center of the galaxy every 225 million years, it bobs in and out of the disk of the galaxy like a horse on a merry–go–round. As it does this, it passes through areas of the interstellar medium that are more and less dense, causing the heliosphere to change in shape and size. Denser areas can compress the heliosphere, while less dense regions allow this bubble to expand. In addition, the strength of the solar wind varies over the Sun’s cycle, &quot;breathing&quot; periodically, also contributing to these changes.</p>

<p><a href="http://ibex.swri.edu/archive/2014.02.13.shtml">http://ibex.swri.edu/archive/2014.02.13.shtml</a></p>

<p>Now they can theorize on how this might effect the solar system, but physics says it shouldn&#39;t even exist..</p>

<p>&quot;The solar system is passing through an interstellar cloud that physics says should not exist. &quot;</p>

<p>Now they do actually admit this could affect the climate:</p>

<p>The fact that the Fluff is strongly magnetized means that other clouds in the galactic neighborhood could be, too. Eventually, the solar system will run into some of them, and their strong magnetic fields could compress the heliosphere even more than it is compressed now. Additional compression could allow more cosmic rays to reach the inner solar system, possibly affecting terrestrial climate and the ability of astronauts to travel safely through space</p>

<p><a href="https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/23dec_voyager/">https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2009/23dec_voyager/</a></p>

<p>Now what prompted the Ibex mission in the first place?</p>

<p>&quot;ew data has revealed that the heliosphere, the protective shield of energy that surrounds our solar system, has weakened by 25 per cent over the past decade and is now at it lowest level since the space race began 50 years ago&quot;</p>

<p>Around 90 per cent of the galactic cosmic radiation is deflected by our heliosphere, so the boundary protects us from this harsh galactic environment.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;There is no imminent danger, but it is hard to know what the future holds. Certainly if the solar wind pressure was to continue to go down and the heliosphere were to almost evaporate then we would be in this sea of galactic cosmic rays. That could have some large effects.</p>
