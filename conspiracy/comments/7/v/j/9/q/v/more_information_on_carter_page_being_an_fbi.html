<p><a href="https://jackpineradicals.com/boards/topic/is-carter-page-an-fbi-informant-who-wormed-into-trumps-campaign/">https://jackpineradicals.com/boards/topic/is-carter-page-an-fbi-informant-who-wormed-into-trumps-campaign/</a></p>

<p>Is Carter Page an FBI informant who wormed into Trump&#39;s campaign? As far as I can walk the cat back, the beginnings of “Russiagate” may have been FBI surveillance of Carter Page during a 2013 meeting with Victor Podobnyy, a Russian “Junior Attache” to the UN in NY. U.S. intelligence had Podobnyy under human and electronic surveillance as a suspected Russian SVR intelligence operative, and the FBI had recorded a conversation in March of between Podoobnyy and a second Russian agent discussing his attempt to recruit Page as an asset.</p>

<p>According to court documents, in January 2013, Carter Page first met</p>

<p>Podobnyy at an international energy conference, and later that year Page provided information about the U.S. energy industry to Podobbny. But, this is where it only starts to get really interesting.</p>

<p>In a letter published today by CNN, Page informed a US Senate committee that shortly after he met with Podobnny in 2013 he was interviewed by federal agents in June, 2013 and that he became a cooperating witness in the federal investigation and resulting 2015 prosecution. See below, and .pdf linked at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/politics/carter-page-russian-official/">http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/politics/carter-page-russian-official/</a></p>

<p>Indeed, a court document in the 2015 trial of an SVR officer confirms that Page was indeed interviewed by two FBI Agents about dealings with Podobnyy. Carter Page is referred to in the Affidavit as Male-1:</p>

<p>On or about June 13, 2013, [FBI] Agent-2 and I interviewed Male-1. Male-1 stated that he first met VICTOR PODOBNYY, the defendant, in January 2013 at an energy symposium in New York City. During this initial meeting, PODOBNYY gave Male-1 PODOBNYY’s business card and two email addresses. Over the following months, Male-1 and PODOBNYY exchanged emails about the energy business and met in person on occasion, with Male-1 providing PODOBNYY with Male-l’s outlook on the current and future of the energy industry. Male-1 also provided documents to PODOBNYY about the energy business. Having cooperated with the FBI in a counter-intelligence operation and later as a witness in the 2015 trial of a Russian intelligence officer, it seems implausible that Page could have been a willing secret agent of the Russians at any point thereafter. More likely, he was playing out a role assigned to him, perhaps under duress, by the FBI. Page was apparently sufficiently trusted by the FBI that he was allowed to travel to Russia several times before and after the Bureau busted the Podobnny cell in September 2014. [See FBI Affidavit for the Prosecution, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/2015_0126_spyring2.pdf.%5D">http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/2015_0126_spyring2.pdf.%5D</a> It should be pointed out that Page was never charged as an accomplice.</p>

<p>In addition, bear in mind that Page was never a paid Trump staffer and claims he never met Flynn and never had a single meeting with Trump. In fact, Page appears to have insinuated himself into the Trump campaign suddenly in early 2016 when it was short-handed without persons with direct foreign experience. He seemingly emerged out of nowhere. A biography in Newsweek portrayed him as something of a mystery whose role in the campaign is unclear, as is how he managed to gain nearly instant access as a junior foreign policy advisor to Trump: <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/carter-page-fbi-surveillance-us-presidential-election-russia-donald-trump-583066">http://www.newsweek.com/carter-page-fbi-surveillance-us-presidential-election-russia-donald-trump-583066</a></p>

<p>Reporters who went foraging for information on him during the race for the White House found little. Within Trump’s team, no one seemed to know who hired him, or what he did for the campaign. Among U.S. businessmen who had worked in Russia, and the Russians they had worked with, few knew Page’s name. In a scathing Politico article about Page, an unnamed Western investor in Russian energy told the author: “I can poll any number of people involved in energy in Russia about Carter Page and they’ll say, ‘Carter who? You mean Jimmy Carter?’”</p>

<p>What’s notable here that seems to have evaded previous notice is that instead of being a Russian agent of influence, Page at the time he spang briefly into a prominent role within the Trump campaign in early 2016, was already an FBI informant, something the Russians would obviously know. This becomes even more crucial later that summer after Page returned from a business trip to Moscow when he was repeatedly named in the James Steele “dirty dossier” as a close confident of Russian energy officials and bankers. Page actually appears to have all the hallmarks of an FBI informant, or an agent provocateur, who was planted into the Trump campaign as part of an intelligence operation. Only, it seems apparent, the intelligence service he was actually serving was American rather than Russian.</p>

<p>That is significant for another very important reason – according to the Washington Post, the FBI obtained a FISA warrant last summer to spy on the Trump campaign under the pretext that Page was alleged to be a Russian agent. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-obtained-fisa-warrant-to-monitor-former-trump-adviser-carter-page/2017/04/11/620192ea-1e0e-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html?utm_term=.ee32735cc79b">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-obtained-fisa-warrant-to-monitor-former-trump-adviser-carter-page/2017/04/11/620192ea-1e0e-11e7-ad74-3a742a6e93a7_story.html?utm_term=.ee32735cc79b</a></p>

<p>The Russian UN employee was charged with two others in 2015. There is an interesting section in the Justice Department press release that accompanied the March 11, 2016 conviction of one of the three Russians. Seemingly overlooked by everyone are what appear to be at least some intriguing suggestions that Page is not the unwitting Russian pawn he has been made out to be by most of the media, and was instead quite aware of his role in FBI operations: <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/evgeny-buryakov-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-connection-conspiracy-work">https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/evgeny-buryakov-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-connection-conspiracy-work</a></p>

<p>BURYAKOV worked in New York with at least two other SVR agents, Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy. From November 22, 2010, to November 21, 2014, Sporyshev officially served as a trade representative of the Russian Federation in New York. From December 13, 2012, to September 12, 2013, Podobnyy officially served as an attaché to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations. The investigation, however, showed that Sporyshev and Podobnyy also worked as officers of the SVR. For their roles in the charged conspiracy, Sporyshev and Podobnyy were charged along with BURYAKOV in January 2015. However, Sporyshev and Podbonyy no longer lived in the United States and thus were not arrested.</p>

<p>BURYAKOV’s Co-Conspirators Are Recorded Inside the SVR’s New York “Residentura”</p>

<p>During the course of the investigation, the FBI recorded Sporyshev and Podobnyy speaking inside the SVR’s offices in New York, known as the “Residentura.”</p>

<p>The FBI obtained the recordings after Sporyshev attempted to recruit an FBI undercover employee (“UCE-1”), who was posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company. In response to requests from Sporyshev, UCE-1 provided Sporyshev with binders containing purported industry analysis written by UCE-1 and supporting documentation relating to UCE-1’s reports, as well as covertly placed recording devices. Sporyshev then took the binders to, among other places, the Residentura.</p>

<p>During subsequent recorded conversations, Sporyshev and Podobnyy discussed, among other things, Sporyshev’s SVR employment contract and his official cover position, their work as SVR officers, and the FBI’s July 2010 arrests of 10 SVR agents in the United States, known as the “Illegals.”</p>

<p>While there seem to be some remarkable coincidences, it is not known if Page is actually UCE-1 or, it seems more likely, the FBI used Page to introduce one of its own employees pretending to be a coworker in Page’s NYC-based energy trading company, who subsequently passed bugged binders to the Russians. Page was previously reported in court papers to have been identified as “MALE-1.” It’s all the more curious that Page should have two years later attached himself to the Trump campaign, and is now the central figure in “Russiagate.” Stranger still, that none of this has previously been remarked upon in any major media.</p>

<p>Here’s how ABC portrayed these events when it broke part of story about Page in April: <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-advisor-carter-page-targeted-russian-spies/story?id=46557506">http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-campaign-advisor-carter-page-targeted-russian-spies/story?id=46557506</a></p>

<p>Undercover FBI agents lured Buryakov and his SVR associates, Igor Sporyshev and Podobnyy, into a trap by masquerading as well-placed business sources ripe for recruitment while using physical and electronic surveillance to gather enough information to build their case.</p>

<p>No reference by Newsweek or ABC to an FBI undercover employee posing as an energy analyst or the bugged binders, which suggests that Page (or an agent pretending to work with him) had more than a passive role in the electronic surveillance placed by the Bureau.</p>

<p>It is also significant that Page is the only person within the Trump circle for whom there appears to be strong evidence a FISA warrant was ever actually issued, permitting legal FBI surveillance (see ftn 16, below). The rest of the intercepts that have been alluded to as part of the Rice “unmaskings” were carried out after a FISA Court reportedly refused in June 2016 to issue a warrant application seeking broad surveillance of figures in the Trump campaign. Several media have reported that after the initial warrant request was denied a much narrower FISA request for surveillance of messages from two Moscow banks was granted in October.</p>

<p>Any surveillance conducted outside of the confines of the Page warrant and the possible second warrant was conducted without FISA authorization, and was in plain defiance of the court’s June warrant denial. Conviction for violation of the FISA statute carries a potential 5 year federal felony imprisonment term.</p>

<p>This is how Page describes events of which he was part in a 9-page letter to the Senate Committee published today attached to a CNN article. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/politics/carter-page-russian-official/">http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/08/politics/carter-page-russian-official/</a>; see, related, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/trump-kislyak-timeline/519027/">https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/trump-kislyak-timeline/519027/</a></p>

<p>Page characterizes the 2015 unmasking of himself and later leaking of his identity to the press as “Felony #1.”:</p>

<p>Felony #1: Illegal leaking of my identity as “Male-1” in U.S.A. v. Evgeny Buryakov, Igor Sporyshev, and Victor Podobnyy – On April 3, 2017, reporters at ABC News(ftn. 3) and BuzzFeed News (4) requested to meet in order to inform me that U.S. government operatives had unlawfully disclosed my identity as Male-1 in this 2015 case. This particular incident follows an increasing series of similar revelations about other politically-motivated unmaskings in 2016.(5) It relates to my brief interactions in 2013 with Victor Podobnyy, a junior attaché assigned to the Permanent Mission of the Russian Federation to the United Nations. During my meeting with U.S. [FBI] agents at New York’s Plaza Hotel in June 2013 in support of their ongoing investigation, I spoke with them at length about my research on international political economy which I had been completing as a Fellow at the Center for National Policy in Washington. I brought this up because it seemed to me that the resources of the U.S. Government might be better allocated towards addressing real national security threats, particularly given the recent Boston Marathon bombing of April 15, 2013.</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>With regards to the 2015 [FBI] case where I agreed to provide support,</p>

<p>. . .</p>

<p>Felony #2: Illegal leaking of classified information surrounding the completely unjustified FISA warrant against me, which further enabled part of the Clinton/Obama regime’s domestic political intelligence operations and influence campaign in the 2016 election – On April 12, 2017, the Washington Post published an article explaining that unnamed sources had revealed the completely unjustified FISA warrant to intercept my communications throughout the final months of the reign of the Clinton/Obama regime.(10) Given a growing list of unanswered questions and apparent abuses regarding this nonsensical invasion of privacy, it seems readily apparent that more revelations about these misdeeds will continue to be learned in the period to come.(11)</p>

<p>. . . Not only did precisely that same continued pattern of abuse reflect her disparagement of Director Comey, it also underscores why I have remained a principal target of the Clinton/Obama regime’s surrogates including those in Congress. As a perceived weaker party, I have also been effectively and falsely characterized as a narcissistic loony tune amidst other far worse false accusations by the Clinton/Obama regime. In a revealing New York Times article based on illegal leaks, “The [Obama] Justice Department considered direct surveillance of anyone tied to a political campaign as a line it did not want to cross, the official added.”(16) In other words and consistent with the narcissistic loony tune school approach, they apparently decided it was fine to trample on human rights if someone is a low-level, junior, unpaid supporter rather than a fellow fat-cat career politician from the Washington swamp.</p>

<p>Wrong. The initial FISA application was in October of 2016.</p>

<p>So, then, after Carter Page had already left the Trump campaign. Wouldn&#39;t that completely destroy the idea that the FBI were specifically working with him as a means to surveil Trump et. al? Wouldn&#39;t they have acquired the FISA warrant while he still had anything to do with Trump?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In other words, the investigation is a total sham. The FBI investigated one of their own agents for doing their job so that they could get to the Trump administration.</p>

<p>LOL</p>

<p>It&#39;s crumbled to dust now - completely....</p>

<p>The FBI was working with Carter Page since 2013, sending him into Russia to do secret sting operations and entrap Russian suspected UN
operatives - had Carter Page wired up for YEARS...... using him...</p>

<p>Along comes the Trump campaign and the corrupt FBI DOJ dems send Carter Page over to Trumps campaign - luckily for the corrupt Dems he secures a lame low end position, then goes on the FBI missions... and returns, for the FBI... at which point the FBI and DOJ write up their &quot;get dirty Don&quot; plan using Carter Page, their own operative, as the &quot;lynchpin&quot; ...</p>

<p>Carter Page REMAINS UNCHARGED TO THIS DAY BECAUSE HE IS AN FBI DOJ INTEL AGENT....</p>

<p>LMAO</p>

<p>The damned democrappers are now crapping their pants.</p>

<p>Read through the sources. From Justice.gov:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The FBI obtained the recordings after Sporyshev attempted to recruit an FBI undercover employee (“UCE-1”), who was posing as an analyst from a New York-based energy company. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>UCE-1 might be Carter Page. From NYTimes</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/us/politics/carter-page-trump-russia.html</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The court documents say that Mr. Page, who founded an investment company in New York called Global Energy Capital</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I speculate that they didn&#39;t plan for everything to go this far. Their hubris kept them focused on only Hillary winning and still believe she did...</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s ditch this idea that Page was a controlled FBI informant/asset. That can&#39;t work because the TARGET of the FISA warrant was Carter Page. That is, the DOJ/FBI went before a FISA judge and swore under oath that they had credible verified evidence that Carter Page was working FOR a foreign intelligence service -- they alleged that he was a spy for the Russians, with the implication that Trump hired him because of this and Trump, through Carter Page, was colluding with the Russians to defeat Hillary. That&#39;s the Government&#39;s case.</p>

<p>Why did they think this? Well, according to Nunes&#39; memo, BUT FOR the Steele Dossier, the FISA court would NOT have granted the Carter Page FISA warrant.</p>

<p>So, the FBI was relying on the Steele Dossier for the key predicate fact that Page was a Russian Agent in the employ of Trump. Nunes&#39; memo, backed up by the sworn testimony of Comey, states that the FBI thought the Dossier was &quot;salacious and unverified.&quot; </p>

<p>ShareBlue responds, BUT FISA WARRANT WAS ONLY ISSUED ON DOSSIER! </p>

<p>Response: True, everyone admits that the FBI presented additional information to the FISA Judge, but ROSENSTEIN testified under oath that the FISA warrant would not have issue BUT FOR the inclusion of the Steele Dossier.</p>

<p>So whatever else the FBI presented to the FISA judge, it wasn&#39;t enough on its own to justify the FISA warrant. CASE FUCKING CLOSED. FBI rushed to get FISA warrant because they needed it RIGHT NOW to help Hillary Clinton win the election.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Use American Citizen as an informant to bait foreign intelligence agents. </p></li>
<li><p>Use FISA to surveil this citizen and use their connections to foreign intelligence agents as the probable cause for them being a spy. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>That is, the DOJ/FBI went before a FISA judge and swore under oath that they had credible verified evidence that Carter Page was working FOR a foreign intelligence service -- they alleged that he was a spy for the Russians </p>

<p>They alleged he was a spy, when he was actually a controlled asset.</p>

<p>They perpetrated a fraud upon the court.</p>

<p>They perpetrated a fraud because the Title I warrant they sought and obtained is the broadest warrant available -- it allows you to look in depth into EVERY person Page had contact with.</p>

<p>This, I suspect is what Trump is bragging about here: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMiIgSpV5dY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMiIgSpV5dY</a></p>

<p>He and his team are &quot;the great sleuth&quot; because they managed to unravel this exceedingly devious FBI/DOJ strategy to surveil and take down Trump.</p>

<p>&quot;[S]alacious and unverified&quot; material contained in the dossier, not the entirety of it.

    <div class="md"><p>Why do we label the investigators as the &quot;Clinton/Obama&quot; regime? Clinton was our Secretary of State, ending in 2013. State department is a completely different entity than any of this business here. </p>

<p>So are you saying that Hillary and Obama purposefully set up Carter Page as a potential mole starting 2013 which could infiltrate the Trump campaign that wasn&#39;t even imagined then. Then they set him up to be a fall guy for some sort of fake investigation operation just in case Donald Trump won the Presidency (by 78000 votes and 3 states).</p>

<p>Do you ever, I don&#39;t know, think any of this through? I mean, just say what you&#39;re getting at and articulate it. A bunch of random facts intermixed with Republican spooky words (Clinton/Obama, unmasking) makes this seem like complete bollocks </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I just did. Let&#39;s go through what is being said. </p>

<p>Carter Page is actually a Deep State mole of some sort. Okay, I&#39;m cool with that. But why him? Why 2013? How is HRC connected here as she is in the State Department (totally different work) and stopped Secretary of State work for most of this operation? Why go back to Carter Page? How did Obama/Hillary regime just drop him into Trump&#39;s campaign with no one looking? </p>

<p>Where&#39;s the Rosneft deal in all this? How about how laughable Carter Page is in every interview I&#39;ve seen him in? </p>

<p>How do you even know what was found out during FISA taps anyway? Those FISA taps definitely do not include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Russian-Trump real estate deals</li>
<li>Trump Tower meeting</li>
<li>Kushner&#39;s secret back Russian backchannel </li>
<li>Cambridge Analytica-Russian cooperation </li>
<li>Russian disinformation campaigns </li>
</ul>

<p>Carter Page may only play a minuscule part (most probably Rosneft deal) but there are so many threads about Trump and Russia that Carter Page doesn&#39;t play a part in at all. </p>

<p>So whose got to prove this to who? I&#39;ve already asked questions you failed to answer. How about you guys are just dopey lackey researchers with poor thesis skills? Bring your A game next time Vladimir </p>

<p>This one was a setup by Fusion GPS:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, met with a Russian lawyer before and after a key meeting she had last year with Trump’s son, Fox News has learned. The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Even though th Russian Lawyer meeting with Don Jr was a setup by Glenn Simpson, I do understand that there are no laws against opposition research even if it comes from international citizens correct?</p>

<p>You do understand Clintons paid an ex MI6 Agent, who was in touch with Russian agents for info, Uranium 1 deal, and Bill got paid for a speech in Moscow for $500k, you do understand yes?</p>

<p>So either Clintons + U.K./Russia are illegal, or they are not. Same deal with the fusion GPS lawyer setup. Its either illegal or not</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Simpson and Fusion GPS were hired by BakerHostetler, which represented Russian firm Prevezon through Veselnitskaya, the report said.</p>

<p>Glenn Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter and co-founder of Fusion GPS, was with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya at a Manhattan federal courtroom just hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fox News reported, citing a source. He met with her again after the meeting</p>

<p>What about her Visa, which she was denied entry into the U.S.?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you’re wondering why it matters how Veselnitskaya got into the U.S. for the Trump Tower meeting, look no further than the Fox News story cited in the U.S. attorney’s brief. Fox pinned responsibility for the Russian lawyer’s admission into the U.S. on the Obama administration, which was “involved on multiple occasions in granting access to the lawyer after she was initially denied a visa,” the Fox report said. President Trump has himself raised questions about who approved Veselnitskaya’s entry. The strategy seems to be to undermine the Russian lawyer’s credibility by suggesting she received favorable treatment from Obama officials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Denied prior, but this time allowed in, is paying Fusion GPS, and then after that goes to Don Jr for a meeting. If you seriously think this isn&#39;t a setup, I have a bridge to sell you</p>

<p>Haha, no. Carter Page was the target of spies in 2013 and ended up helping the FBI catch them. You can read the unsealed complaint <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/2015_0126_spyring2.pdf">here.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>When did Carter Page join campaign? Like Dec 2015. Introduced by Republican chair Ed Cox. Not active but was apart of Trump election circle in Spring and Summer. </p>

<p>FISA started in Fall after Christoper Steele went to them twice (once in May and September). Steele didn&#39;t go back to FBI because they blew him off, so he stopped going back to them. And FISA continued after this. We don&#39;t know what happened or what they uncovered but like I said, none of those other points would coincide. </p>

<p>Carter Page is but one thread but he doesn&#39;t open up much unless he talks. Keep in mind Mueller has Michael Flynn and Papadapolous. Manafort could also talk. So Page is window dressing. </p>

Either A he cooperated in 13 and was still under suspicion, and still had the balls to act as a foreign agent, B he cooperated in 13 then the FBI spun that around to make him look like a Russian agent or C he&#39;s been a Fed all along.

I guess the theory is that the FBI hatched a plan in 2013 to get Carter Page to work for the Donald Trump campaign.

    <div class="md"><p>Page was a stooge. He was used, but he cooperated with the FBI. As far as I&#39;m concerned, he was used first by the Russians and then by the FBI--at least as an excuse to also surveil the people around him, as he was working for Trump. He may or may not have known, but I doubt after he assisted them the first time they thought he was working with any Russians...
&quot;In order to answer these questions, the public needs to see more of the classified materials that first sparked the Trump-Russia collusion investigation. If there is concrete evidence that Page was in the employ of the Kremlin while he was an advisor to the Trump campaign in 2016, the American people deserve to know. If not, then that spells a great deal more trouble for anyone who authorized the FISA warrants against Page.&quot;

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect Page wasn’t willingly working for the FBI to ensnare Trump. They either arranged for him to work for Trump or else they just got lucky when he joined the campaign. </p>

<p>The reason I believe they didn’t just get lucky is because his background and contacts with a bunch of Russian energy officials is just too perfect.</p>

<p>The FBI is known for turning on their Confidential Informants. </p>

<p>Never inform for the FBI. </p>

<p>Remember Randy Weaver and Ruby Ridge?</p>

<p>If Page was “recommended” to the Trump campaign, you can bet the FBI was behind it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From Carter Page&#39;s Wiki:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>After leaving Merrill Lynch in 2008, Page founded his own investment fund, Global Energy Capital with partner James Richard and a former mid-level Gazprom executive, Sergei Yatsenko. The fund operates out of a Manhattan co-working space shared with a booking agency for wedding bands, and as of late 2017, Page was the firm&#39;s sole employee. Other businesspeople working in the Russian energy sector said in 2016 that the fund had yet to actually realize a project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So all he did (on record) from 2008-2016 was operate his own investment fund, in which he was the only employee and not a single project was completed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really, you do realise that Heinz Kissinger is one of Trump’s “good friends”. He’s known him for decades and has sought his counsel before the election, after he won, and only three months ago. You know that Trump said he’s a globalist and he enjoys the benefits of globalism. Expecting Trump to fight globalism all the while benefiting from it, you’re in for a massive disappointment sorry to tell you.</p>
