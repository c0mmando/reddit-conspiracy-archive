    <div class="md"><p>It requires no &quot;belief,&quot; as it is a phenomenon we can observe. No, I don&#39;t believe a random international cadre of unassociated telescope owners is participating in a bizarre video hoax for seemingly no reason. Which means if you or I could observe the moon at all hours with telescope equipment we would see the same thing eventually. </p>

<p>If the moon is what we are told it is, a rock in space, then it makes less sense for it to have a wave. If it is something else, say a projection, then it makes sense for there to be a distortion. </p>

<p>If you know the moon landings are fake, I don&#39;t see what&#39;s so preposterous about the idea that the moon itself has been misdescribed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I did not know Crow is making money from this. </p>

<p>Obviously we&#39;re on board with the Apollo hoax. </p>

<p>Why do you actually think they&#39;re fake? &quot;Cmon do you really believe in a lunar wave&quot; is not a good reason which you know. If you tell me why the videos are fake I will be on board. I have no emotional attachment to the lunar wave. </p>

<p>My thinking is, no one has gone there. No one can go there. So it might not be a place in the first place. May just be some kind of image. In that case, it makes sense that there is visible distortion. </p>

<p>Anyway, if you really are JLB I have enjoyed some of your stuff. I&#39;ve referenced the 37 Things before. First learned about Cavendish from your vid. </p>

<p>There is money in pushing fear-porn such as &#39;black helicopters circle my house&#39; which Crrow has claimed in his podcasts.</p>

<p>And his &#39;lunar wave&#39; crap appeals to the Flat Earth retard crowd, who in my experience hold an average IQ at least one standard deviation below the mean and are <em>highly</em> suggestible.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no evidence whatsoever of this &#39;lunar wave&#39; except for some video footage which could be <em>easily</em> doctored by anybody with a camera.</p>

<p>It is as simple as, fill a bowl with water, record the moon&#39;s reflection in the water from a close-up, and create a small wave outside of the frame. Voila! &#39;Lunar wave&#39;.</p>

<p>The average conspiracy person is every bit as much of a lemming as the average normie -- and in many cases, worse.</p>

<p>Personally I encourage questioning of the official cosmology.</p>

<p>At the same time, I mock and deride those who buy into the Flat Earth belief system.</p>

<p>Most people are so retarded they get sucked into false dichotomies like flies take shit.</p>

<p>It is not a case of &#39;spinning ball earth&#39; vs &#39;Flat Earth&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, the issue is not the paid content. </p>

<p>It is:</p>

<p>a) the promotion of ones own paid content... </p>

<p>b) relentless posting of videos that contribute no substance other than promoting paid content and are marginally related
To the discussion.</p>

<p>c) exclusively posting his own content that really serves to promote his paid content.</p>

<p>d) offering no points or arguments of his own other than attacking others and posting his videos that link to his own content.</p>

<p>e) the ratio of paid to unpaid content skews towards paid very heavily.</p>

<p>f) he uses sketchy sales tactics like claiming everyone doesn’t want you to know what he knows and that he will blow your mind for $20+ per month.</p>

<p>That amounts to spamming, not meaningful engagement in the sub. Whether or not his content is worth it (unlikely in my opinion) - that is up to his subscribers. Whether or not it’s ok to spam this site with adverts for uismocntent is up to users and mods here... and most seem to find t an issue. The crypto currency sites definitely did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I did not know Crow is making money from this. </p>

<p>Obviously we&#39;re on board with the Apollo hoax. </p>

<p>Why do you actually think they&#39;re fake? &quot;Cmon do you really believe in a lunar wave&quot; is not a good reason which you know. If you tell me why the videos are fake I will be on board. I have no emotional attachment to the lunar wave. </p>

<p>My thinking is, no one has gone there. No one can go there. So it might not be a place in the first place. May just be some kind of image. In that case, it makes sense that there is visible distortion. </p>

<p>Anyway, if you really are JLB I have enjoyed some of your stuff. I&#39;ve referenced the 37 Things before. First learned about Cavendish from your vid. </p>
