<p>&quot;But the regulators who stripped Geier&#39;s credentials are now in the hot seat, ordered to each personally pay tens of thousands of dollars in damages by a judge who says the board abused its power in an attempt to humiliate the doctor and his family&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not a bot. Just somebody who actually reads the article. Do you have any evidence that chemically castrating kids with lupron is a good treatment for autism? Any, at all? Do you have any evidence that this guy you are promoting is anything other than a lying snake oil salesman? It&#39;s a simple question. Did the people he treated get better? </p>

<p>Here, i&#39;ll make some claims: there is no evidence that treating autistic kids with lupron is a beneficial treatment and the drug has serious side effects. This guy didn&#39;t make anyone better-he just fucked a bunch of desperate idiots out of a lot of money and caused god knows what kind of long term damage to his patients. He lied to his patients about his credentials. And in spite of all of this clear, simple evidence you guys are holding him up as some kind of hero. I ask again, if this guy&#39;s treatment protocol was legitimate, show us the positive results. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Try looking at this again with an open mind.</p>

<p>Are all vaccines bad? Probably not.</p>

<p>Is there a profit motive on why when I was vaccinated, there were less than a dozen shots to get, and now there are like 30? Probably yes.</p>

<p>This is a forum for conversation and debate. Not for shouting someone down for having a different opinion.</p>

<p>I have 2 kids. The older one has autism, and I think it is likely because I did what the doctors wanted, and he got most all his shots in the first month. But with his brother, I said NO, an spread them out over his first 2 years.</p>

<p>I know this is a very limited data set. But when you do some studying on the idea, you see very quickly, that our children are being poisoned.</p>

<p>Someone somewhere knows this, and is doing it for some purpose. Profit is the most likely.</p>

Just because you are vaccinated doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t carry disease. A healthy lifestyle, proper dieting and daily exercise goes further to protect you from disease and build your immune system than any vaccine will. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I got asthma as a direct result of a vaccine as a youth. Almost died in the hospital just hours after getting the shot </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your doctor has done is research, it&#39;s good to hear.  Many doctors aren&#39;t aware of the link between the DPT shot and Asthma, as most the information they get is from Pharma Reps who pass over biased information.</p>

<p>It was found that delaying the DPT shot reduced the risk of Asthma, people die of Asthma every day, so by regularly inducing Asthma with this shot lives are being lost, which aren&#39;t showing up in official statistics as vaccine deaths, they are instead showing as Asthma deaths.</p>

<p>It was good to see a study just the other day in the BMJ discussing the increased risk of Asthma and food allergies after Australia switched to a new type of DPT shot.</p>

<p>Introduction of New Vaccine in Australia linked to rise in food allergies - British Medical Journal</p>

<p><a href="http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/8/1/e020232.full.pdf">http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/8/1/e020232.full.pdf</a></p>

<p>&quot;Allergy represents a significant disease burden in developed countries. The temporal association between an apparent increase in severe food allergy and the replacement of whole cell with aP vaccine in Australia warrants further investigation. Food allergy is not only important in its own right, it is also associated with eczema and with <strong>asthma (fourfold increased risk) in later childhood</strong>&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One more thing, once you have proven the link between Asthma and vaccines, the pharma representatives will then try to argue &quot;You would have got Asthma anyway at some point&quot; which definitely isn&#39;t true, as if you got the vaccine later the risk is reduced, or if you didn&#39;t get the vaccine the risk is almost zero.  They will try any trick they can to push the vaccine on people, that is their job, but the reality is that the data is clear.</p>

<p>Mark R. Geier (born 1948 in Washington, D.C., U.S.) is a self-employed American physician and controversial professional witness who has testified in more than 90 cases regarding allegations of injury or illness caused by vaccines.[2][3] Since 2011, Geier&#39;s medical license has been suspended or revoked in every state in which he was licensed over concerns about his autism treatments and his misrepresentation of his credentials to the Maryland Board of Health, where he falsely claimed to be a board-certified geneticist and epidemiologist.</p>

<p>Oh look, he is actually a dangerous quack that fleeced gullible, desperate parents out of tons of money, doing god knows what to his patients/victims. Love to see some long term follow up on the results of his off lable drug trial, which is potentially also a case of insurance fraud. 
Any long term follow up at all? How are these patients doing? </p>

<p>where he falsely claimed to be a board-certified geneticist and epidemiologist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The wiki sort contradicts it&#39;s self because it says later...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Geier while at the Laboratory of General and Comparative Biochemistry, National Institutes of Health in the 1970s and 1980s was a student researcher from 1969–1970, <strong>a research geneticist from 1971–1973,</strong> a staff fellow from 1973–1974, on the professional staff from 1974–1978, and a guest worker from 1980–1982. He has been examining vaccine safety issues since then.[2] <strong>He is a Fellow of the American College of Medical Genetics.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you read the PDF wiki used as a source for that claim it is pretty long and basically says we are the authority and we believe this and he is doing something else and not falling inline with what we believe. He set up an institute for chronic illness and attempts to treat regressive autism. </p>
