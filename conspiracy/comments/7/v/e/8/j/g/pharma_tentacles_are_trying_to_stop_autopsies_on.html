       I find it amazing that the very term “vaccine injury” is controversial, when everyone can verify there is in the USA a
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_court">
        special court
       </a>
       to deal with vaccine injuries, a
       <a href="https://www.hrsa.gov/vaccinecompensation/">
        special fund
       </a>
       to compensate the victims, and that the proceedings of this court are kept secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, even a cursory look will reveal that the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Childhood_Vaccine_Injury_Act">
        National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act
       </a>
       was most obviously devised to protect pharmaceutical companies (rather than the public).
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccine injuries are not a conspiracy theory. All medicines have side effects, sometimes deadly, and that includes vaccines. The only reasonable argument is that the benefits may
       <em>
        collectively
       </em>
       outweigh the dangers, not that dangers are nonexistent.
      </p>
      <p>
       The morality of collectivist policy is yet a different matter - quite straightforward IMO.

       The crazy thing is that nowadays we have to be so careful with things like food allergies and prescribing drugs because it is well known that some people will have severe allergic reactions to food, or bad reactions to some prescriptions; yet when it comes to vaccines, which contain plenty of highly toxic and allergenic ingredients, they are "safe and effective for all."  Bullshit.

       But this was literally the last half of the article -
“The results of the investigation by the forensic pathologists at the Philippine General Hospital of the 14 children autopsied and who were originally claimed by [PAO forensic expert] Dr. [Erwin] Erfe of the Public Attorney’s Office as having died due to Dengvaxia have been released. None of the deaths of the 14 children autopsied were proven to be due to Dengvaxia,” the DPW stated.
      </p>
      <p>
       “Based on the PGH findings, it now appears that only one case might be causally associated with the vaccine. That is the one with dengue and with antibodies to dengue. However, it has yet to be determined if the vaccine had anything to do with the death,” it added.
      </p>
      <p>
       The DITF’s review disclosed that three of the 14 deaths were due to dengue; with two of the three might be caused by vaccine failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       “In two of the children autopsied, it was noted that vaccine failure may have been the cause. This means that no antibodies were produced and so they could not have suffered from an antibody enhanced reaction. This can happen when the vaccine is not stored properly and so loses its potency. It’s a though the children were never vaccinated. Hence, the two most likely died of dengue not due to the vaccine,” the DPW said.
      </p>
      <p>
       In view of the findings of the DITF, the DPW said “it makes no sense for any more families to be subjected to the torture of having a loved one exhumed and cut up only to find out that no useful information was derived from the cruel act.”

       If you actually read the articles you posted, you would've seen that the reason that the country won't be reimbursed by Sanofi is because, if they were to refund all the monies, it would be akin to saying the vaccine doesn't work, which is patently false. 
The issue with the children dying was showing that two children had ZERO antibodies (which means no vaccine reaction because no reaction happened in the body at all). The theory is that the shipment was expired or somehow defective. They want to "halt the autopsies", but actually it's more like "they don't want to dig up 14 kids because that would be traumatic for the parents and also because there was no reason to assume he vaccine had anything to do with their death. 
The last article talks positively about funding for vaccine information programs because well-funded health education fights online ignorance from Dr Google (cough cough)
