        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Based on the content and themes in Eyes Wide Shut, it appears that the film The Institute tells the same story, but from the perspective of the girls who are trafficked and used in the orgy scene. The following is a comparison of both films that connects the films via: Satanic Ritual Abuse, Elite Parties, Human-trafficking and Mind-Control.</p>

<h1>The Institute (2017)</h1>

<p>A few of you may have seen <strong>Eyes Wide Shut</strong> with Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. If you have not seen it, it is alleged to have cost Stanley Kubrick his life. The original film had more scenes and footage which was &quot;cut&quot; out of the final release. Many people speculate Stanley Kubrick had included <strong>PIZZA and SRA</strong> revelations in the film. This post is a bit of a spoiler, but it attempts to explain how the film <strong>The Institute</strong> with James Franco contains the &quot;missing scenes&quot; of Eyes Wide Shut. </p>

<h1>Topics</h1>

<p>Both films deal with &quot;amnesia of traumatic events&quot;, &quot;Elite Rituals&quot;, &quot;satanic and occult imagery&quot;, &quot;mind-control&quot;, &quot;human-trafficking&quot;, &quot;conspiracy&quot; and &quot;pedophilia&quot;</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>The film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Institute_(2017_film">The Institute (2017)</a>) is a horror thriller film co-directed by Pamela Romanowsky and James Franco. <strong>It is based on a true story of a young girl&#39;s treatment at The Rosewood Institute</strong> in Owings Mills, and stars Franco, Allie Gallerani, Tim Blake Nelson, and Lori Singer. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosewood_Center">Rosewood Center</a> was recently shut down. The intro to the film features actual photographs of the torture and abuse that happened at Rosewood. Despite the events in the film being real, the Hollywood industry went into full shill mode and gave the film poor reviews claiming that it was a silly fantasy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most scandalous—the one that sets Rosewood apart from other asylums—was made by Leo Kanner on May 13, 1937. Before a hushed gathering at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association in Pittsburgh, Kanner shared the shocking tale of “the Rosewood girls.” It’s not a story most people know about today, but it’s an important reminder of just how destructive an upper class with an unchecked sense of entitlement can be, and how vital it remains to safeguard the interests of those who can’t do so for themselves. -<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2014/03/baltimore_s_rosewood_scandal_wealthy_families_sprang_asylum_inmates_to_be.html">Slate</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the film The Institute, the protagonist (Isabel Porter) is institutionalized willingly to help herself get over the loss of her parents. Isabel Porter comes from a wealthy family, and naively submits herself to the torture and mind control of Dr. Cairn (James Franco).</p>

<h2>The Connections - Secret Parties</h2>

<p>The following scenes from Eyes Wide Shut and The Institute when taken together paint a bigger picture. A picture that makes <strong>P1zzaGate</strong> more credible when taken into account with the allegations of <strong>SRA</strong> and <strong>Human Trafficking</strong> by the elite.</p>

<ul>
<li>Isabelle&#39;s brother stumbles into a party where there is a dead girl laying on a dinner table. The dead girl was a former patient of The Rosewood Institute. The secret party is for the elite, and the guests wear masks and have orgies with prostitutes. The guest that notices the UN-INVITED guest (Isabelle&#39;s brother) is wearing a horned animal mask. This is similar to the <a href="http://cdn2.collective-evolution.com/assets/uploads/2017/12/4rn.png">Rothschild Parties</a> . The horned-masked guest attempts to murder Isabelle&#39;s brother for witnessing the party. </li>
<li>Tom Cruise is almost murdered in Eyes Wide Shut for also uncovering a secret party for the elite where orgies and satanic/occult ritual are carried out by masked guests. No murder appears in Eyes Wide Shut, but that may have been taken out of the original. A prostitute pays for Tom Cruise&#39;s intrusion with her life, but it is not shown.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Connections - Amnesia and Child Trafficking</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>In the Institute, Dr. Caim induces amnesia into the patients via mind-control, hypnosis and drugs. Dr. Caim asks the patients &quot;Was it a dream or was it real?&quot; to test the memories of the patients. Memories include satanic ritual abuse, torture and murders. During a ritual where Isabelle pretends to be under mind-control, a very influential man confesses his lust for Isabelle when Isabelle was only a child and he was an adult. This pedophile is the man who selects which patients to traffic to himself and others for sexual gratification.</p></li>
<li><p>In Eyes Wide Shut, Nicole Kidman has reoccurring where she is sexual assaulted by a man in uniform. She even seems to enjoy it, and cannot tell if it indeed happened under the influence of mind control. It is implied in the film that Nicole Kidman is one of the prostitutes that is trafficked for the orgies. When Tom Cruise goes to the costume shop to purchase a mask and robe for the Orgy, he notices that the shop-owner&#39;s daughter (a child) is being sexually assaulted by businessmen. The owner pretends to be upset. The costume shop is where most of the guests purchase their costumes, and it becomes evident that the owner traffics his daughter to wealthy men when Tom Cruise returns the costume back to the shop. </p>

<h2>Mind Control</h2>

<p>Dr. Caim controls the girls via a combination of torture, drugs, hypnosis and trauma. He splits the personalities of the girls by forcing them to take on multiple-personalities and punishing them via torture when they break character or show signs of weakness (compassion and empathy). Girls that help torture other girls are rewarded. Girls are included in sacrificial murder, and made to forget the events via hypnosis.  </p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Human Trafficking</h2>

<p>The girls are deliberately tortured and &quot;broken&quot; to create murderers and prostitutes. Dr. Caim is the mind-control agent and programs the girls to be used in satanic ritual murder of other girls or as sexual toys for the elite. The pedophile that had his eyes on Isabelle from the time she was a child, deliberately made Isabelle appear insane to &quot;treat her&quot; and called &quot;dibs&quot; on her. Other girls are trafficked to the elite. </p>

<h2>Wikileaks-Podesta</h2>

<p>The investigation was halted so fast, and the revelations/evidence were swept under the rug with such force that it created a whole new term &quot;fake news&quot;. It is no secret, the elite enjoy their Moloch (Hillary) references to Ba&#39;al worship and Pagan and Satanic rituals (Spirit cooking). They enjoy going to parties where they murder and rape children (Bonacci/Franklin Scandal) and wear masks and engage in orgies (Rothschild Party). Most people forget that Kubrick was a perfectionist. This is why he included the actual Rothschild building, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentmore_Towers">Mentmore Towers</a>, in the film Eyes Wide Shut. The Podesta Bros sure like sadistic artwork with children and murder as themes. No wonder they are such good friends with James of Comet PingPong. They both seem to sexualize children and murder openly. I&#39;m curious to know if the deleted scenes in Eyes Wide Shut show the satanic ritual murder of the prostitute or more info on the girl from the costume shop and the pedophilia that the elite seem to enjoy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, thanks for posting this. I&#39;ve read this woman&#39;s story, in a different form. Some of this I&#39;ve heard, like the little boy on the beach and some of the Kidman stuff.. other parts of this are new to me, like the surfer.. And then there was more that&#39;s not here, including the artwork of hers she mentions. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll see if I can find it, it&#39;s been a year or two so it might be tough.. I&#39;ll edit if I do.</p>

<p>The first Dad from Hey Dad was moved on but only got charged many years later, the producers knew and said nothing for over a decade. </p>

<p>James Packer owned some of 10 along with a Murdoch, his Dad owned 9 and a number of magazines. Fiona has accused James&#39; grandfather of being a people smuggler and accused Alan Jones (a big money earner for Fairfax) of being an elite pedo. James has been involved with the cult of scientology, Rat-Pac entertainment, Au, Chinese, and USA gambling/casinos. Fiona also accused Molly Meldrum of being involved, for what it&#39;s worth my Dad told me in 2002 that he had heard rumours that to get Molly to play or produce your music you&#39;d have to bend over for him. James Packer also has dealings with Robert De Nero and Nobu, they are investing in some north Queensland resort, I&#39;m still trying to link James and Epstein as his &#39;lolita express&#39; has also been to Nth Qul many times, De Nero has had his number found in a EU prostitution ring black book that &#39;employs&#39; underage workers.  </p>

<p>The media don&#39;t do much because it looks to be filled with pedos and their protectors. </p>

<p>Then you have people like Tony Abbott and Joe Hockey from Sydney Uni, both powerful catholics. Tony defends accused pedo and Vatican treasure Pell, Hockey is in the USA as a diplomat, his predecessor Kim Beazley has had his Dad accused by Fiona of being involved. </p>

<p>I&#39;m giving it attention where I can. There was a story on Media Watch mocking Fiona, our ABC is like the BCC in that it covers for elite pedos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great dot connecting and links.
Are you aware that Fiona Barnett is possibly missing or in hiding right now? Since her last post connecting Colonel Chan as being Victor Chang who was taken out in a hit outside a police station of all places.
The view counts on her videos on youtube are so low.. like no one in Australia (or the rest of the world even) cares.. and I thought NZ was full of sheep!
I wish I had the skills to be an investigative reporter.. going to start on some FOIA requests soon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was reading the reviews for the film, I noticed a very blatant shill campaign. That made me more suspicious. It was very difficult to find any documents on the actual institute which made me even more suspicious. I found a YouTube news story on the shutting down of Rosewood and they feature an &quot;ACTUAL PATIENT&quot; in the story. The catch was that the patient was blind/deaf/mute. No witnesses? Suspicious. They even erased the 1937 article about Kanner) that discussed the fucked up activities and human slavery at Rosewood. Kanner is known for his work with children and autism. The article was previously <a href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleid=141428">featured on The American Journal of Psychiatry</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Somewhat late here, but commenting if someone wants to pick up this thread.</p>

<p>Found this post while researching Eyes wide shut and wondered if there was anything related to the Rosewood girls on Youtube.</p>

<p>A search yielded this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxroIMM5qCk">video</a></p>

<p>Looks to be some sort of makeup thing, but I don&#39;t know what to make of it.  It&#39;s laden with monarch and sex kitten symbolism. </p>

<p>There is also more similar videos on this channel. </p>
