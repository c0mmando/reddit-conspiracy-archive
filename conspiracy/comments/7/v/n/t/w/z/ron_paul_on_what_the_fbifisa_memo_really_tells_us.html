    <div class="md"><p>The most liberating feeling I&#39;ve ever had was tossing off the shackles and blinders of the blue vs. red mentality.  You can see more of the chessboard, and when you look at things like mass surveillance and see that they (the parties) just swap positions based upon which team is in the Whitehouse, you can see it&#39;s just the opposite side of same coin.  The cognitive dissonance require to make sense of that is a toxic impairment to finding the truth- which is exactly what the deep state wants.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hyped Nunes memo promised to derail the Trump-Russia investigation. They claimed the memo would prove that the dossier is what led to the Russia investigation. The memo disproved this stating the intel on Papadopoulos was the trigger. </p>

<p>The other claim about the memo was that the FBI did not disclose that the dossier originated from political sources. Today Nunes conceded on Fox and Friends that the judge was in fact told about the political origins of the dossier. This memo was a conspiracy to release classified info to shield the White House. If the WH was involved this is a huge deal. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy this new narrative that the memo is about FISA abuses. If they cared about FISA abuses why did <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-backtracks-after-appearing-to-contradict-his-administrations-support-of-fisa/2018/01/11/5d7f7088-f6d1-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html">the Republicans push threw the renewal without trying to address any of these problem.</a> The Repbulicans control <em>both</em> the House and the Senate. If they really cared they could have addressed this issue instead of rubber stamping unconstitutional spying on Americans for another 6 years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone is claiming the Republican politicians care about FISA abuses, it&#39;s obvious they don&#39;t.  Neither do the democrats.  I also don&#39;t think that&#39;s the point.  It may not have been the intent of the Reps to expose FISA abuse potential in general but I do see that as what has happened.  This is a good thing for all Americans.  Hopefully the dems and reps get in a pissing match and leak more so we can get a true feel for what actually happened.</p>

<p>I never said that. I just said on this issue they are better. Under Bush we got the Patriot Act. Under trump we lost our Internet privacy and he renewed the Patriot Act without any changes. Under a Democrat, parts of the Patriot Act were reeled in. How can you not see the difference? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Increased oversight, lmao that really makes me feel better about it.  &quot;They are watching themselves closer&quot; Like that means anything significant.  And if you think Obama made any significant change to &quot;reel in&quot; the patriot act you are kidding yourself.  They probably picked there least favorite/usable aspect and said here, don&#39;t renew this then everyone will be under the illusion you are actually trying to do something about this.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t have anything to do with Fox news.  Until the patriot act has been repealed no one has done shit about it.  These little things they do to appease the masses are meaningless.  You fell for it and think Obama is some sort of hero.  I did not and do not no matter how much propaganda you show me illustrating all Obama &quot;tried&quot; but failed to do.  Also why no comment on him legalizing propaganda?  </p>

<p>Obama promised to have the most transparent admin in history. I remember the campaign point from back when I cast my vote for the guy. Instead we get more secrecy and underhanded working than seemingly ever. We&#39;ve got intelligence folk saying Trump shouldn&#39;t have angered the Intelligence agencies, that slighting them will make them retaliate on you and destroy you.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that nice, that our Intelligence agencies are petty and will act out and use their power out of spite.</p>

<p>The memo points out that it was information about a different Trump aide, George Papadopoulos, that led the FBI to begin investigating. So the Page surveillance, whatever the problems with it, can’t fairly be called the fruit of the tree that became the sprawling Mueller investigation. In fact, it’s not clear if Page is still relevant to the current investigation.</p>

<p>Which has nothing at all to do with this FISA warrant against Carter Page.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>But it could be argued that any information gathered via an illegally obtained FISA warrant against Carter Page would be &quot;fruit of a poisoned tree&quot; and possibly ruled inadmissible.</p>

<p>But I highly doubt the FBI cares if they ever get a conviction in this case... it&#39;s not about getting convictions, it&#39;s about bringing down Trump, and they don&#39;t need criminal convictions to do that.</p>

<p>unless you are privy to the investigation, you can&#39;t know what info flows from what source.</p>

<p>it doesn&#39;t matter if papadopoulos was the reason the investigation began. it matters what warrant any particular information stemmed from. </p>

<p>if any information relied upon stems from surveillance running from the carter page/dossier warrant, it is potentially tainted. and i mean all, all the way down the line, even info gained through new warrant applications based on things learned through the dossier warrant.</p>

<p>you aren&#39;t really grasping how the poisonous tree works.  the tree is always an action by a prosecutor/cop to discover information that violates the 4th and/or 5th amendment. the tree is not the investigation. the tree certainly isn&#39;t whatever inspires the investigation. in fact, a papadopoulos scenario is quite common.</p>

<p>cops start an investigation because of X (papa-d) in the course of that investigation they do Y (fisc dupe), which violates the 4th/5th amendment resulting in a very fruitful source of information, and it will all be excluded, even if the investigation continues. </p>

<p>Literally the very first thing that pops up is from Forbes. I love the sources you used, too. I mean you didn&#39;t even try. This is the problem with Liberals: facts aren&#39;t ever on your side, so you either have to lie, or you have to change the variables. Your boner for snowflakes and a few groups of people on the Internet express the insecurity you have over the emotional positions you take on politics (obviously, not logical positions). The people you describe live in your mind, rent-free, and are changing the political landscape without ever leaving the house, while assclowns like Antifa burn buildings down, destroy business, beat people to near death, spit at and curse anyone who opposes them, and then turns around and genuinely wonders why they&#39;re losing. </p>

<p>The left is getting its collective ass kicked, and they&#39;re doing it to themselves through endless contradictions, hatred, and violence towards anyone who disagrees with them. The hard-left are sheep, and the youth of this generation see through the bullshit and rediscovered what millennials like you forgot how to do a long time ago: ask questions. </p>

<p>Yeah, snowflake. You need to wise up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>sigh</em> </p>

<p>This conversation started by my saying this sub was being brigaded lately, which you dismissed (attempted) and <em>made</em> about demographics of Reddit, rather than acknowledge the fact this sub is overwhelmingly (and always has been) Libertarian and right-of-center since its inception, and is all of a sudden now being fucking brigaded by hard-leftist activism. See the above post where I point out how Liberals never have facts on their side, and therefore either lie or change the variables (what you&#39;re doing). We now have 2 back to back examples of you doing this. This literally could not be an easier argument to win for me. You&#39;re literally engaging in the very practices I&#39;m referring to immediately after I speak of them. Not only that, I&#39;m also literally explaining to you again what&#39;s happening and you&#39;re <em>still</em> going to continue walking right into my hands and I <strong>know</strong> this because you&#39;re literally all identical to one-another: a hive-mind with a singular conscience, like zombies in thoughts and behaviour. Nothing individual or unique about any of you. Just sheep. Repeating patterns and arguments and tactics. </p>

<p>It&#39;s amazing to watch you people engage in such cognitive dissonance. Really, I&#39;m not talking shit, I really mean it. It&#39;s fucking amazing. </p>

<p>Here I am already having to educate you on what Generation Z even means, and what the age group is, because you&#39;re too lazy/retarded/scared (likely, because God forbid you have to accept the answers you find for yourself vs. just trying to slap them down after they&#39;re presented by your opponent, which is the secret truth to this) to use Google now too? In before the, &quot;Durrr you can&#39;t answer the question because you won&#39;t type it into Google and present it for me.&quot; Take that shit out of here kid, you&#39;re in the wrong arena with the wrong person to even attempt these low-brow shit shows with me.</p>

<p>Indeed, it&#39;s my love and appreciation of facts, that lead to me always being right. See, what <em>you</em> hate, is the fact that facts aren&#39;t on your side, and you know this logically/intuitively, but logical conclusions are overruled by your emotional nature, which of course, is why you always miss the point. You <em>feel</em> things, but the world doesn&#39;t give a fuck about your feelings, and they damn sure don&#39;t win arguments for you.</p>

<p>If you wish for this little school session to continue you&#39;re at the point where you&#39;re going to need to compensate me for my time. Otherwise, you lack the mental equipment to engage with me.</p>

Republicans act like they protect gun rights, but don&#39;t actually do anything about it. Democrats act like they oppose tax breaks for the rich, etc. But the only thing that ever happens is the ball changes hands and the government ratchets up another notch. Tax breaks for the rich, laws that prevent dissent or take away power for the little guy, and the middle gets squeezed a little bit harder. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Republicans play to their majority of Identity focused individuals, and use buzzwords to appeal to them in that manner.</p>

<p>Democrats play to their majority of Collectivism focused individuals, and use buzzwords to appeal to them in that manner. </p>

<p>They both play the same game, just one plays to class identity and one plays to individual identity. The perceived &#39;wins&#39; of the democrats are just a way to appeal to the fan-base of doing more for more people. The perceived &#39;wins&#39; of the republicans are always about matters that impact on a more individual level. The only real way to move forward is to display understanding of both parties ideologies and attempt to bridge the gap with <em>collaboration</em>. Anything else is just a tug to either side of the political arena. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ron Paul is right - this memo didn’t come out because the civil liberties of Americans were under threat.  It came out because a political party - because power is under threat.  There is a power struggle going on in Washington, as there almost always is.  Politicians aren’t releasing info or writing memos in the wake surveillance abuse against Joe Schmoe - they’re doing it because Trump and thus the GOP are threatened.  Both parties have supported reauthorizing the FISA Amendments Act.  Only a select few are looking to expose illegal surveillance and intelligence agency actions against more average Americans.  </p>

<p>Warrantless wiretapping in its modern form has happened at least since Bush.  It expanded under Obama and surely is happening under Trump as well.  The FBI was practically created to deal with domestic dissent and has had its hand in domestic politics for almost its entire existence - from the Palmer Raids to COINTELPRO and beyond.  It would be naive to assume that in the post 9/11 security state suddenly everything is clean as a whistle.  Both parties are complicit in the security state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ron is right sometimes and wrong sometimes.</p>

<p>This article in particular I think has some good points but ignores some reality too.</p>

<p>For example, he attacks Devin Nunes for several things, but doesnt mention that in reality, the committee he chairs had been stonewalled by the FBI/DOJ for nearly a <strong>YEAR</strong>, which is really what precipitated the entire memo situation - the FBI literally has been acting rogue regarding its statutory oversight body.</p>

<p>So Nunes&#39; committee had little recourse, and finally had to resort to nearly giving contempt citations and authoring this memo to basically clue in the American public.  This should never have happened.  </p>

<p>But the DOJ/FBI has been acting like an above-the-law entity, doing whatever the hell it wants, and literally scheming their way into attempted blockage (then reversal) of the election. Ron DOES get this part right.</p>

<p>In general, the FISA system may have a valid use, thats a different subject and Ron disagrees with any of it, and he then attacks the entire military industrial complex structure, which is consistent with his stance....</p>

<p>But I disagreed with his characterizations of Nunes. Nunes is a patriot and a hero.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The hyped Nunes memo promised to derail the Trump-Russia investigation. They claimed the memo would prove that the dossier is what led to the Russia investigation. The memo disproved this stating the intel on Papadopoulos was the trigger. </p>

<p>The other claim about the memo was that the FBI did not disclose that the dossier originated from political sources. Today Nunes conceded on Fox and Friends that the judge was in fact told about the political origins of the dossier. This memo was a conspiracy to release classified info to shield the White House. If the WH was involved this is a huge deal. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t buy this new narrative that the memo is about FISA abuses. If they cared about FISA abuses why did <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-backtracks-after-appearing-to-contradict-his-administrations-support-of-fisa/2018/01/11/5d7f7088-f6d1-11e7-91af-31ac729add94_story.html">the Republicans push threw the renewal without trying to address any of these problem.</a> The Repbulicans control <em>both</em> the House and the Senate. If they really cared they could have addressed this issue instead of rubber stamping unconstitutional spying on Americans for another 6 years. </p>
