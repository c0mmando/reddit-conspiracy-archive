       After the flood of #releasethememo posts over the past few weeks, does anyone else find it curious that there is no similar push to release the "counter memo"? Those pushing #releasethememo made a big fuss about "transparency" and needing all of the facts. Well, why not these facts?
      </p>
      <p>
       This reeks of conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT: seeing a lot of "durh is been voted to release", where is it? Isn't there a certain someone who still needs to approve it? Use your brain cells.

       Hey there, I regret to inform you that you've been shadowbanned by the reddit admins. As a mere
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       mod, I can only see your shadowbanned comment, approve it, and inform you of your predicament.
      </p>
      <p>
       I recommend contacting the reddit admins ASAP to get it sorted out.

       Well it wasnt hasty, but the key here is the response should be allowed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thats part of the American political process. present the dissenting opinion along with the original and allow the public to be duly informed and make their own choices.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the crux of america, discussion. When one opinion is silenced then you cant stand there and say that you are a true american all the while applauding the purposeful restriction of information and counterpoints just because you dont agree with them.

       There’s no suspense over the counter memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Schiff said it’s not redacted and it’s been through the same process as the GOP one. It’s also been approved by the house and is waiting for Trump’s approval.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has to release his hands are tied. If he blocks it that will automatically invalidate the Nunes memo pretty much entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also no one is going on 20 minute interviews trying to argue the Dems shouldn’t get their counter argument. All the GOP did was require the Dems memo went through the same process with their memo as the GOP did.
      </p>
      <h1>
       ReleasetheMemo erupted from Schiff and Pelosi throwing out every excuse they could think of to not release it. No one in the GOP is trying to stonewall the Dems memo. That’s the difference.

       That's because they have so much egg on their collective faces after the trumped up dud. They have no choice but to release. But we're still waiting for the Neanderthal in Chief to release the counter memo.

       Because it sets a really stupid and dangerous precedent whereby congressmen can write down their opinions and conspiracy theories with no evidence and, rather than send them to a newspaper op-ed section as usual, can now transform them into official government documents. Lots of idiots believe that makes them more legitimate.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt any Dem thought the memo would cause a catastrophe for them, I think it's more about concern that it'll contribute to the erosion of the public grasp of reality which the GOP is actively pursuing.

       That's the lazy CNN spin. Gowdy actually cowrote the memo. He also said that they are investigating about a dozen people in the FBI that acted improperly, which would corroborate the memo. He did say that the Mueller investigation should remain and for some reason CNN obfuscated those two separate things and said that it undermined the memo. That makes no sense, surprised you just took their word for it instead of taking even a cursory glance at what he said.

       Is there anything you disagree with CNN's narrative? Going by your history, I can't find it. I disagree plenty with this adminstration, the prior one, and the military industrial complex, but I'm able to critically consider facts when presented. How about you? Where do you disagree with the CNN narrative? Adorable how you talk about eating up propoganda...

       There's mountains of evidence. Theyve been working on this for months. To say they made up the contents of the memo is a major stretch, a mistake as well. I find it funny that someone on r/conspiracy is arguing against government transparency, especially one that confirms an actual conspiracy.

       They have to release the D’s memo, to block it would basically be admission that they’re full of shit and don’t have any faith in the Nunes memo to stand up to scrutiny.

       No one is fighting the D’s release of the memo, they followed the same procedure that the R’s memo went through.

       The memo was released without redactions. Due to that nature if its full of lies, that can be proven or corroborated. Journalists/officials know exactly where to look for the evidence they need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same will hopefully be true of the Schiff memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the new norm is releasing intel without redactions I’m all for it. Would you rather have congressman putting their name on something that makes claims directly linked to the basis of those claims, or would you rather have them anonymously leak to the press with vague statements that can’t be tied to the person/entity that could verify those claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       “A document of politically motivated lies pretending to be official evidenced truth” .....you do understand the same could be said of the Steele Dossier right? That’s the whole point of this shit show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also who cares if some R’s opposed release? John McCain not wanting a document released when he gobbled up the Dossier and fed it to a reporter just doesn’t really surprise or tell me anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you doubt the memo that’s good, everyone should until corroborating evidence or disproving evidence comes out. Point is that can actually happen since it wasn’t redacted.

       Releasing a document without redactions is actually a refreshing step for our government.

       Untrue. The memo relies on unclassified material, and we're to take Nunes word for the key parts. There are simply contradictions, which means
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       is a lie, but because we're just writing stupid memos
       <em>
        about
       </em>
       documents instead of
       <em>
        actually releasing the documents

       But that's not what they're doing, what they're doing is congressmen "summarizing" intel for us, without actually declassifying it. It's no different from the old "a source familiar with the matter said..." trick but done by government officials themselves.

       I don't give a shit about the spin or talking points that congressmen use to play politics. It's not transparency, it's not exposure, it's just politics-as-usual in a new medium (MEMOS!!!)

      <p>
       No, it's not hte same. The Steele Dossier was a work of opposition research, thus the incentive is on accuracy and truthfulness. Opposition research is useless if it's false, because then it leads the campaign to adopt a strategy that's at odds with reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nunes memo is designed to set a narrative, he wrote it in order for it to be eventually released and you're an idiot if you think otherwise. One has the incentive to be truthful, the other has the incentive to lie.

       You're being a sap, honestly. A congressmen takes his talking points that he'd normally just say on Hannity and puts them in a memo and suddenly you think it's more credible and "is a move toward transparency", what a fucking joke.

       This is beyond dense. Nunes didn't dig around, find some documents, and get them released. He
       <em>
        wrote something with the intent of releasing it
       </em>
       . It's just a new, different route to deliver talking points and propaganda to the public.

       Dude they declassified the info on who signed warrants and the date of the first warrant.

       I’m saying more info needs to come out for anything to be valid.
      </p>

       I want the source material too, but how in the hell were they just gonna release that? We will never get that info without these idiots playing dueling memos because now each side is incentivizing the other to release more info to counter the claims of either side.
      </p>
      <p>
       If these memos necessitate the release of more source doc info then I’m all for it. If it’s just bullshit as usual then you make valid points.

       There was absolutely no chance of ANY source doc information being disclosed without these two parties trolling each other.

       The Republican memo had already been released for House viewing prior to the vote to release it publicly, which then needed White House approval.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can find videos wherein house members explain that the Democrat memo needed to follow the same process to be released if you want more proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       That process was followed and now it’s been unanimously voted to release publicly.
      </p>
      <p>
       No one is trying to block the Dems memo, but yeah they did require it go through the same process as the Republican memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       In theory Trump still could block it, but that’d be dumb as that would completely invalidate Nunes memo regardless of any follow up to corroborate it’s claims.

       From what I read, your articles didn't really clear up your main point.
      </p>
      <p>
       What it sounds like to me was that the Republicans and Trump administration tried to get the Republican memo out as fast as possible and not give Democrats the time to release a memo at the same time as the other memo. This was done strategically to make sure that the Republican memo was out first and allowed all of the talking points to go out without any official rebuttals against it.

       1) Nuns crafts memo, that memo is released to the House
      </p>
      <p>
       2) Schiff crafts memo. Asks for memo to be publicly released along with Nunes memo
      </p>
      <p>
       3) House releases Nunes memo, blocks Schiff memo but votes to release to the house with the acknowledgment that it will be released subsequently to following same process as Nunes memo
      </p>
      <p>
       4) House releases Schiff memo
      </p>
      <p>
       Nunes memo release was voted on party lines. Schiff memo release was voted unanimously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prior to Nunes memo Schiff and Pelosi got in front of any camera they could shitting on it and claiming it threatened national security.
      </p>
      <p>
       Republicans have not publicly shit on Schiff’s memo, they just required it to follow the same process. Once it did, even the Republicans voted for its release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats never voted for release, tried to discredit at every opportunity. Republicans unanimously vote to release once memo completes process required for public release.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is all verifiable. Interpret events how you’d like, but I don’t know how you argue Republicans are the ones trying to prevent public release of information.

       Trump is so fucking stupid. Every Republican on the committee voted to release the memo, so I doubt this was a political game/trap.

       You don’t start down this road and then immediately pussy out at the slightest sign of discomfort.

       I’ll reserve final judgment for a couple days to get all the info that always follow these shenanigans, but unless some material piece of the information puzzle is missing Trump just baffles me here.

       I think the House can vote to release it anyways still, so hopefully they do. Now I really want to see this memo.

       I believe the WH brought in the FBI/DOJ to review the memo. They were allowed to request edits, which Schiff then screamed bloody murder about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So both memos got their review, both will have come out with no redactions (Schiff has said their memo isn’t redacted).
      </p>
      <p>
       Look regardless of party lines shouldn’t we all be happy these guys are actually having to put their name on a document that makes claims directly linked to the person/entity/document that can corroborate those claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       Another commenter is arguing this is devolution and that these guys should’ve just given info to a reporter. An article attributed to anonymous sources that makes short vague statements that conveniently are limited in scope...I mean how is that not the ultimate political cherry picking?
      </p>
      <p>
       At least these guys are having to duke it out in the open without hiding behind anonymity or redactions. Who knows how it will play out, but at least things are being pushed more out into the open.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m certain the Nunes memo is very R friendly and I’m certain the Schiff memo is very D friendly. Doesn’t mean either doc is 100% true or 100% false. The memos will force more stuff out into the open and the truth will probably lie somewhere in the middle.  As long as these memos necessitate the disclosure of more information, it’s a good thing as far as I’m concerned.

       All this memo stuff is incredibly fucking stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       A congressman writes up the normal kind of thing they usually send to the press as an op-ed...but instead they file it as a memo, and now it's a big deal to read it. It's literally just using their positions as government officials to turn their opinions into "official documents."
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing's being "exposed" either way, there's no slam dunk here, it's just the exact same partisan arguments, talking points, and spin that's all over the news, but in the form of memos.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the worst excuse I've seen I think in my lifetime for the government actually
       <em>
        doing
       </em>
       anything.

       They also disclosed a portion of McCabe’s testimony. That’s verifiable if someone follows up on it.

      <p>
       They also disclosed circular reporting, that’s verifiable if someone follows up on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Already there’s an argument as to just how much of the political basis was disclosed to the courts. That’s good cause now someone will be pressed to release more information from the source docs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Portions of this memo were classified, that was Schiff’s whole damn argument over “national security”. The WH had to DECLASSIFY it to be released without redactions.
      </p>
      <p>
       In no way am I arguing that this memo is a bombshell and tells a complete picture. At least SOMETHING of the source docs was declassified and released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously the public needs more info for any conclusion to be drawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is the odds of seeing more source doc info increased with the Nunes memo, it will increase further with the Schiff memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       The chance of seeing anything prior to these memos was a big fat 0.

       I’m not even saying I’m confident any more source material will be released, but for God’s sake at least now there’s a fucking chance.

       Because most of the previous #releasethememo were doing it for partisan reasons. They don't care about transparency or knowing the facts. They just want new talking points to use.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone supports releasing both memos then I wouldn't consider themselves partisan hacks or part of the propaganda machine.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, let's be honest. Both of the memo's are just partisan hit pieces by both the republicans and the democrats, and it should be viewed in those lens.

       I don't support releasing either of the memos. We can't be politicizing our national intelligence. I realize that will be frowned upon around here. I prefer to have my conspiracies be hobbies, not national security matters.

       The memo was released without redactions. Due to that nature if its full of lies, that can be proven or corroborated. Journalists/officials know exactly where to look for the evidence they need.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same will hopefully be true of the Schiff memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the new norm is releasing intel without redactions I’m all for it. Would you rather have congressman putting their name on something that makes claims directly linked to the basis of those claims, or would you rather have them anonymously leak to the press with vague statements that can’t be tied to the person/entity that could verify those claims?
      </p>
      <p>
       “A document of politically motivated lies pretending to be official evidenced truth” .....you do understand the same could be said of the Steele Dossier right? That’s the whole point of this shit show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also who cares if some R’s opposed release? John McCain not wanting a document released when he gobbled up the Dossier and fed it to a reporter just doesn’t really surprise or tell me anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you doubt the memo that’s good, everyone should until corroborating evidence or disproving evidence comes out. Point is that can actually happen since it wasn’t redacted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Releasing a document without redactions is actually a refreshing step for our government.

       So you can't. CNN told you it's not what happened and the House Intelligence Committee showed you classified information that it is. Funny how you believe CNN when all they have is spin and not actual evidence when produced by your elected officials...

       They did not.  They showed us a memo that Nunes wrote based on what Gowdy saw.  Then Gowdy undermined that memo.

       That's the lazy CNN spin. Gowdy actually cowrote the memo. He also said that they are investigating about a dozen people in the FBI that acted improperly, which would corroborate the memo. He did say that the Mueller investigation should remain and for some reason CNN obfuscated those two separate things and said that it undermined the memo. That makes no sense, surprised you just took their word for it instead of taking even a cursory glance at what he said.

       Well the Nunes memo was pretty hilariously ill conceived and laughable. So theres a high mark for this one to be ‘amusing’.
