       SS: The sky in Asheville NC has been increasingly littered with trails- grids, Xs, tartan plaids of trails, whether cold or mild out. Make of that what you will. Tomorrow suddenly we're set to have abnormal winter storms. The timing of a sky full of trails consistently proceeds dramatic weather changes here. 
While I'm uncertain if trails carry agents that keep us sick, dumbed down or tired, evidence increasingly shows that weather manipulation via controlled aerial release is real.
      </p>
      <p>
       First pic, close up of 'plaid' parallel and crossing lines forming a weave of man-made clouds over the center of town. This is more air traffic than comes and goes in the morning hours from our tiny airport. The pattern seems almost insultingly intentional.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was on the south end of town, at the edge of today's grid- and the sky toward the center of town was so tight with rows and grid work of trails that the camera can't make them out, but I could- and had I traveled deeper into town today I could have taken shots of life directly under the massive grid.
      </p>

       And to answer how a single plane can produce that much cloud there's this video of a much smaller truck that's maybe 1/3 or 1/4 the size of a commercial size jet that's creating a mountain sized cloud seemingly out of nowhere:

       Every 6th day. Once a week essentially. Yesterday was one of those days. Watch on Friday, the patter. Should continue. Also. Start taking notice on these days that everyone around you will seem "tired" and complain of some sort of respite issue(cough, stuffy nose, stuffy ears)

       Actually, you have to be pretty dumb to think that an easily explained phenomenon is explained by magic chemicals being dumped in the sky, of which you have no proof. How would chemtrails make them anyway? Where in the plane is there enough space to store that much material? What material is it? How has literally no one ever noticed this chemical being loaded into planes?

       They are not commercial airplanes for one bud so these are not seen by regular passengers or airline staff.  The Government has admitted to chemtrails under the guise of geoengineering and for military drills yet those of us who use our brains know better than to believe the official explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       If chemtrails are actually contrails and are so easily explained, please explain the process and how on the same day, some planes leave no mile long trails which spread massive distances forming their own clouds over 24-48 hours while others do. Also, how do theses contrails magically turn on/off?

       Do you have any evidence that they are not commercial aircraft? Where are all these mysterious jumbo jets coming from?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do those aircraft match the location of commercial aircraft? You know there are apps and shit that can tell you what flight and plane you are seeing in the sky, right? There is literally 0 evidence that they are not commercial aircraft, and pretty much an endless amount that they are.
      </p>
      <p>
       When did they admit to chem trailing under the guise of geoengineering? We occasionally do cloud seeding here in the US, but I don't think that's done by the government.

      <p>
       As I already explained, it depends on atmospheric conditions, which depends on a lot of things. Altitude is a big factor. If one plane is 10,000ft above another, one may form them, and the other may not. They don't magically turn on/off either.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing that requires magic to explain is chemtrails. Where would you fit the absolutely gigantic amount of material required to leave a massive chemtrail several miles long inside an aircraft?

       And there are just as many articles/vids explaining the various chemicals used in chemtrails, vids of unmarked planes turning them on/off, pics of the chemical components/machinez on the planes, etc. You could Google this too if you really wanted the truth but we both know you won't ;)

       <br/>
       Those are ballast barrels used in aircraft testing. They have pics on official boeing websites. A couple pics show cloud seeding equipment. Another shows an aircraft venting fuel. I don't know why these guys have to blatantly lie to make their points.

       No, it's not. It's completely different. Cloud seeding is done publicly, and it's not done by the government. It's done by private farmers, generally in drought stricken areas. It's not at all what you say it is. Why do you have to keep lying? What is it with chemtrail conspiracy theorists and just endlessly lying?

       Doesn't sound like just farmers to me:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the past five years since 2007, billionaire Bill Gates has spent at least $5 million on geoengineering research and cloud-seeding in Africa alone due to severe shortages of clean water and food. But, the droughts are ‘worse than ever.’
      </p>
      <p>
       Raytheon, a private defense contractor, is working with Gates and others “to reduce global warming” through stratospheric seeding with aluminum oxide particles, those nasty ‘CHEMTRAILS’ that we frequently see in our skies. They want to create what they call “smart clouds” through nonotechnology.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, what worries this climatologist is the ‘chaff pollution’ that this high-altitude spraying has produced during the past several years."
      </p>
      <p>
       AND
      </p>
      <p>
       "Among the substances found to be in recent laboratory soils in central Iowa were several that should simply not be there: 6 bacteria, including anthrax and pneumonia, 9 chemicals, including acetylcholine chloride, 26 heavy metals including arsenic, gold, lead, mercury, silver, uranium and zinc, 4 molds and fungi, 7 viruses, 2 cancers, 2 vaccines and 2 sedatives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over the last several months, many senators and congressmen have received a significant increase in chemtrail-related calls and letters. Most report a dramatic increase in chemtrail ‘spraying’ activity in their areas. Some are reporting the development of chronic flu-like symptoms, chronic fatigue and body aches that they have never before experienced. My wife Sharon, normally very healthy, is currently experiencing all of these symptoms as our many others in the region. Are these normal spring allergies? I think not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, just this week, an airline pilot called to tell me, “Cliff, we pilots see these jet tankers dumping chemtrails almost every day. We’re told that it’s ‘a priority military project.’”
      </p>
      <p>
       While I’m on the subject of ‘Chemtrails,’ farmers in some parts of the Midwest have been forced to spend $40 or more per acre on lime applications to combat the surprisingly high amounts of aluminum oxide in their soils. Confirming this on Friday, according our Kansas correspondent, Ed Petrowsky, the well-respected commodity advisory service, ‘Crop Quest,’ reported that aluminum levels across most of the Midwest have ‘DOUBLED’ in the past 3-5 years. They also added, that it must have come from the air. It didn’t leach up from the ground. So, I guess that two and two still makes four. Also on Friday, Greg Koch of Coeur d’Alene, informed me that there was a recent Chemtrail and Geoengineering Symposium held on the island of Maui on April 27 to discuss the lack of normal plant growth on the island.
      </p>
      <p>
       The geoengineers are ‘playing with fire,’ and we’re ‘getting burned.’"

       "BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) — North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum is pushing for a comprehensive study of cloud seeding over complaints from farmers and ranchers that the practice may be making drought conditions worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bismarck Tribune reports that Burgum told a meeting of the state Water Commission that a lot of people think the commission is using old and insufficient data to support the program. One of those studies was conducted between 1969 and 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
       Six counties and a portion of a seventh participate in the state's weather modification program, which seeds clouds with silver iodide to suppress hail and increase rainfall.
      </p>
      <p>
       The budget for the cloud seeding program is about $1 million for 2017, with one-third coming from the state and two-thirds from participating counties."

       "Stratospheric Welsbach seeding for reduction of global warming

      <p>
       Abstract
      </p>
      <p>
       A method is described for reducing atmospheric or global warming resulting from the presence of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, i.e., from the greenhouse effect. Such gases are relatively transparent to sunshine, but absorb strongly the long-wavelength infrared radiation released by the earth. The method incudes the step of seeding the layer of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere with particles of materials characterized by wavelength-dependent emissivity. Such materials include Welsbach materials and the oxides of metals which have high emissivity (and thus low reflectivities) in the visible and 8-12 micron infrared wavelength regions."

       Good job ignoring everything else I posted. Cloud seeding is the known term. You said only farmers do it but I proved you wrong. In fact, the other articles I posted which you ignored show that farmers are alarmed about the numerous heavy metals accumulating in the soil from the cloud seeding programs, so much so that the Governor of North Dakota was investigating it. You are naive if you believe cloud seeding is only to control drought. That is what is called a "cover story" genius.

Nowhere in your article does it state that the Government patents technologies not to use them. You are being misleading thus lying. You seem quite obssessed right now. Face it, you got nothing.

       Unless they grew up in the high Himalayas those men would die of hypoxia at 10,000 feet, so they are clearly below it as you can also tell from their outfits - at 10k they would freeze as well. Your link just states 20,000 feet without any evidence. My problem with that is that contrails only ever start to happen above 23,000 feet. It also states a lot of fanciful hogwash about creating layers of silver iodide for planes to fly through.. Get some real science books, please.

       Is this real enough?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Cold-weather seeding is done at the core of snow clouds that can reach altitudes as high as 60,000 feet: Flares filled with tiny flakes of silver iodide are ejected into the clouds’ centers. Silver iodide has a molecular structure similar to that of ice. As the silver particles drift down through the clouds, water gloms onto them as it would to ice, and snowflakes grow.
      </p>
      <p>
       This method is also routinely used for mitigating hail storms, especially in Canada: When silver iodide particles are injected into a hail-producing storm cloud, there are suddenly more nuclei for the ice to cling to. Smaller ice pellets, or “graupel,” form rather than large hail stones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Silver iodide in large concentrations can be harmful, but the concentrations found in snowpack after cloud seeding are often so low as to be undetectable. Breed’s NCAR study in Wyoming found that there was less silver iodide in snow and soil samples in areas where clouds had been seeded than there had been before the campaigns—either due to fluctuations in naturally occurring levels of silver iodide or because the extra water released by the seeding flushed the system."

       Silver Iodide, as stated in the article, is a harzardous chemical being sprayed in cloud seeding programs. Farmers are finding unnaturally increased heavy metals in their soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The harmful effects of silver iodide are insidious.(3) Yet, according to the web site of the PGCD, the effects are so minimized that the following is stated: “The concentration of iodide in iodized salt used on food is far above the concentration found in rainwater from a seeded cloud.”(4) In addition, in early December of 2002, at the Amarillo meeting jointly conducted by the Panhandle Groundwater and the North Plains Groundwater Conservation Districts, one representative stated that silver iodide was good for the heart. In a private conversation, another explained that silver miners live longer. Iodized salt may seem benign; however, some states such as Colorado have outlawed the use of salting icy roads.(5) Among harmful effects, salt is toxic to the water and land.(5)
      </p>
      <p>
       The Office of Environment, Health and Safety, UC Berkeley, rates silver iodide as a Class C, non-soluble, inorganic, hazardous chemical that pollutes water and soil.(8) It has been found to be highly toxic to fish, livestock and humans.(6,7,8,9) Numerous medical articles demonstrate that humans absorb silver iodide through the lungs, nose, skin, and GI tract.(7,8,9) Mild toxicity can cause GI irritation, renal and pulmonary lesions, and mild argyria (blue or black discoloration of the skin). Severe toxicity can result in hemorrhagic gastroenteritis, shock, enlarged heart, severe argyria, and death by respiratory depression.(8)
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover, a key manufacturer of silver iodide for weather modification, Deepwater Chemicals, warns of potential health effects of silver iodide in their Material Safety Data Sheet as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       Chronic Exposure/Target Organs:    Chronic ingestion of iodides may produce “iodism”, which may be manifested by skin rash, running nose, headache and irritation of the mucous membranes. Weakness, anemia, loss of weight and general depression may also occur. Chronic inhalation or ingestion may cause argyria characterized by blue-gray discoloration of the eyes, skin and mucous membranes. Chronic skin contact may cause permanent discoloration of the skin.(10)"

      </p>

       "Artificial weather modification through the use of chemicals can impact us by reducing water supplies, causing dry snows, less rainfall, changing agricultural crop production cycles, reducing crop production, and water availability. Since most experimental weather modification programs use chemicals released into the atmosphere the public could be subjected increasingly toxic or unknown substances that could adversely impact agricultural crops and trees, not to mention our personal health. Global dimming and persistent contrails and chemtrails that produce man-made clouds, may have serious impacts on crop production, trees in our forests, and our trees on our private property, and Idaho’s Whitebark Pine. The dead and dying trees all around us are being attacked by beetles, and we have a tender box sitting waiting for the lighting strike to ignite and off she burns. I wonder at the governments answer all the time, well huh, its the beetles, and lack of moisture. Well did any of you brilliant government stooges do any soil testing for chemicals, like barium and or other chemical man made agents, gather some ring samples maybe, how about a water sample in these area’s, Never mind, I think I will get some samples myself for my own documentation, never needed you guys any way.

       This same agronomist seemed unable to give a simple, direct answer to my question of what is considered to be the traditional historical background level of naturally occurring aluminum in agricultural soils although one page on the web site of his laboratory had the following statement along with an illustration with specific figures: "Aluminum greater than 400 ppm is a problem for most growing plants.  The primary target for aluminum is the root cap.  Therefore, it has a major impact on root growth and efficiency."
       <a href="http://stopsprayingcalifornia.com/Contaminated-Soil-&amp;amp;-Chemtrails.html">
        http://stopsprayingcalifornia.com/Contaminated-Soil-&amp;amp;-Chemtrails.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The aluminum reading that had been reported in our ten local soil tests ranged from a high of 1692 ppm (parts per million) to a low of 712 ppm - and that lowest one happened to be the Holmestead field.  The average of all ten fields was 1247 ppm which is in the "Very High" range of the above published Aluminum Rating.
 
Our interest in the level of aluminum is related to the fact that there have been numerous reports of various aluminum compounds being found in the "chemtrails" that are being constantly sprayed.  Just search Google for chemtrails + aluminum or aluminium: Google search- the list of results is extensive!"

       The evidence I provided shows that silver iodide is a chemical, along with aluminum, barium, strontium, etc being spraying under the guise of cloud seeding and geoengineering. Farmers have noticed an uptick in all of these heavy metals in their soils and the logical conclusion is that the chemicals we are being doused with is accumulating in the farmland.

       So how is that related to so-called chemtrails at 23,000 to 40,000 feet? Come back with something, anything, that links all this stuff you are hitting me with to the subject at hand. The only aircraft able to reach 80,000 feet are the U2 and the SR71.

       Except for the strontium bit. That's bullshit. And the barium. That's bullshit too. But you get one out of three.... they do indeed spray silver iodide into the sky. The elevated barium is easily accounted for by fossil fuel burning and it's not exactly bad for you. Get a stomach ulcer and they'll make you drink a pint of it before giving you a scan.

       Ballast tanks? Really? You are gullible enough to believe these are secret spooky chemtrail tanks without doing the slightest research to verify this? But of course, you wouldn't. These are just the tanks they fit in every new aircraft to test its handling under different loads and balances. Here are a few dozen

       Crazy to think these tanks are used for more than one purpose, huh? Did you even look at the remaining images of hazardous chemicals signs, the labeled Chemical sprayer, the US Chemtrail patent number on the tank, the US military spraying planes, etc.? How indoctrinated are you guys? They have you working weekends now?

       Those are not the same photos I supplied and don't cover the chemical sprayers, the hazardous materials tankers, the US patent chemtrail labels, the military planes, etc. I assume tou realize Ballest tanks could conceivably carry liquids other than water, correct?

       Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">
        sublimation
       </a>
       , but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called

        deposition
       </a>
       and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It's not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.

       Normal airplanes often fly approximately the same route every day, at the same times. Their contrails look like white smoke stripes, like the exhaust fumes of cars in cold air. Chemtrails, however, are often secreted in dense, sometimes lumpy, stripes. On spray days you'll see the most bizarre flights appear in the air (1), which sometimes include six or seven planes at the same time (2). Sometimes they fly parallel to each other, sometimes they make curves, or they suddenly stop producing a stripe or start making one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chemtrail debunkers claim that the chemtrails are simply frozen plane tracks, but they can't explain why normal planes flying through that same air at the same time don't leave any tracks at all. They also can't answer the question why this phenomenon has only been seen since halfway through the nineties and often can't be seen at all in thinly populated areas (sometimes with far colder air).
      </p>
      <p>
       "With the jet engines of nowadays it's almost impossible to form a persistent contrail. You need unique atmospheric conditions for that. First, the airplane needs to be above 30,000 feet. The temperatures have to be below minus 40 degrees Celsius, and you have to have a relative air humidity of 67 percent. But that's hardly ever the case. So what you see today, with the whole spectrum from the horizon filled with contrails from planes flying at different altitudes, is impossible. That's science. So there must be another reason for it." - Willem Felderhof, former KLM pilot (3)

       Air corridors are busy. Often there's a plane along one every five minutes. If the plane in front is leaving a contrail, the following pilot will fly to one side of it to avoid turbulence and loss of visibility. So, parallel contrails, or more. Planes sometimes fly in lazy circles or ovals in a

       What crap. How old are you? I've been 'Looking up' and seeing them since the 1950s, and the first contrail was observed in 1922. They were a serious problem for
       <a href="https://imgur.com/YK8UBB6">
        US bomber crews
       </a>
       in WWII because they pointed straight at the bombers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And your last quote is pure bullshit. I used to be an aircraft engineer working on gas turbines. I can assure you that high bypass engines produce MORE contrail because of the pressure waves inside the outer turbine casing. Felderhof was a former pilot who was grounded after becoming mentally ill, which he claims was due to toxic fumes in the cabin.

       Again, you have the flight radar data to prove altitude or am I to take your word on this?

       Commercial planes take the most economical flight path to not waste gas, they don't fly winding paths mid flight around other planes doing the same thing whilst creating zig-zagging and circular/spiraling patterns.

       I haven't insulted you once, but if you want one, your age explains your inability to know how to back up your claims with sources. Figure out how to copy/paste sources and cite them in your comments old timer and maybe you will have better luck with future discussions. Oh, and maybe buy a pair of reading glasses while you are at it so you can actually read the articles given to you as sources of evidence instead of copping out because it is too inconvenient. If you want to be taken seriously, put in the work and back up your claims with more than your own opinions and then sticking your head in the sand when evidence counter to your own perception of reality is presented to you. Otherwise, you waste the time of anyone willing to entertain your comments. Take care!

       That is EXACTLY what they mean. Old contrails were thin and high up. These new ones that started appearing around the 2000s are these gigantic wide trails that linger on and a huge storm or freezing weather always follows them. The storms are usually very short too and a thick blanket-like dark cloud appears in the sky and then afterwards evaporates really oddly.

       (-- Where in the plane is there enough space to store that much material?
      </p>
      <p>
       -so by those own words, how does a standard contrail even get produced that is expelled in bursts with a start and stop, and stays for hours, spreading into a haze? How does a small amount of jet exhaust reacting to cool air create such a disproportionate and exponential amount of trail?
      </p>
      <p>
       There's actually a video shot by a drone of an unmarked white van parked in the middle an uninhabited marsh- with a military escort- that produces COPIOUS amounts of 'fog' that rises up into the air and becomes a cloud as the drone flys away and records. It's stunning. This one tiny van has some kind of super condensed material and a means to release it so fast that it becomes as big as a mountain. So having the same device in a large unmarked white plane? Easy peasy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll look for the link and post it when I find it- it's stunning.

        here's an in-depth explanation.

      <p>
       I was only arguing that point because OP thinks that persistent contrails cannot form, so the only other option would be that what you are seeing is some material. It's obviously not, it's water vapor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not entirely sure what that video is supposed to show. Look in the description. There's plenty of talk of what it is.

        How does a small amount of jet exhaust (from a finite amount of fuel) reacting to the cool air create such a disproportionate and exponential amount of trail?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Here you go.... My stock answer: Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">
        sublimation
       </a>
       , but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">
        deposition
       </a>
       and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. It's not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.

       No, as I mentioned, other things effect it. Humidity and wind are also big factors. If atmospheric conditions are met at a given altitude, then they will form. Guess what: That's what happens. Ever notice how they seem to form all at once in one place at the same altitude?

       Numerous instances. Apparently we have never been through the Van Allen radiation belt but somehow went to the moon? Please explain. There are countless vids exposing astronauts on wires and using failed augmented VR on the ISS. There are vids of air bubbles with the astronauts showing they are actually under water instead of outer space.

       You actually provided no evidence debunking anything I said about NASA except Fail so good try. For starters:
      </p>
      <p>
       "In the video presentation below, NASA engineer Kelly Smith explains about many of the risks and pitfalls surrounding the new Orion Deep Space Mission to the planet Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surprisingly, chief among Kelly’s concerns is whether or not his spacecraft can successfully pass through the perilous Van Allen Radiation Belts. Such is the prospective danger in fact, that NASA will have to send a dumbie craft first in order to ‘test out’ what the potential radiation effects will be on future human crews, as well as on the ship’s delicate sensors and equipment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hold on. Why the guessing game by NASA? Why don’t they just use the same 1969 technology they are said to have used on the first Apollo moon missions?
      </p>
      <p>
       SuperPerformance72 explains, “This video released by NASA about the upcoming Orion space exploration craft, shows a NASA scientist admitting that they still haven’t worked out how to properly shield the spacecraft from the radiation emitted from the Van Allen belts.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the ultimate conspiracy, as it brings together two huge issues – the viability of the Apollo Moon Landings, as well as dreams of a human colony on Mars. This latest admission by NASA places both of these in jeopardy."

       The story of the original Blue Marble (seems NASA says it was a real pic, not an artists rendition.
      </p>
      <p>
       "At five hours and a few minutes into the flight of Apollo 17 one of the crewmen looked out the window. What he saw inspired him to grab the only Hasselblad that wasn't stowed and snap a picture -- actually four pictures, no more than a minute apart, changing the exposure after the first one. The second snap yielded the sharper image that's become famous, so a minute's attention was involved. But whoever did it said nothing on the radio or to their crewmates about it. It's possible they did it instinctively, hardly thinking about it, because none of them thought to mention it for weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't until the flight returned safely ten days later, and the film was processed at the photo lab in Building 8 of the Johnson Space Center, that a film technician named Dick Underwood realized what he was looking at: the first photograph of the whole, fully illuminated, astonishingly beautiful Earth. It created an immediate sensation, printed on the front page of nearly every newspaper on the planet, the image of our world as we had never seen it before.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Earth was nearing winter solstice at the time so the South Pole was tilted sunward, cupping the planet in a clean white bowl. White clouds swirl north over deep blue oceans and the green middle of the African continent, then a tan arc caps the image with the dry lands of Arabia. All around this perfect colorful circle is blackness so dense it defines infinity. It's an unmistakable portrait of a living world and it is arresting.
      </p>
      <p>
       (The true camera image is upside-down by earthly standards, showing the South Pole at the top of the globe, because the camera was held by a weightless man who didn't know down from up. Most reproductions invert it to align with our expectations.)"

       As for the chemtrails, you said they are easily explained but cannot provide the exact conditions needed for these long lasting miles long clouds to form. So yes I want specifics which you are unable to provide. You debunked nothing about the pics I provided earlier and you ignore the hazmat chemicals, the chemtrail labeled sprayer, the US chemtrail patent on the tanks, the non commercial military plane spraying, etc. Nice try bud!

       Actually, that's not what he said at all. They said they are working on shielding for the more sensitive electronics. Apollo didn't really have sensitive electronics. They are not really all that worried about the astronauts radiation exposure from the belts, however they would like to limit it if possible. The bigger radiation problem comes from long term exposure in interplanetary space.
      </p>

       Of course they are going to do a test before they send humans. You don't put humans on the first launch of a brand new rocket. That's fucking stupid.

       I still find this hilarious. You provide literally 0 evidence whatsoever that these persistent contrails are sprayed chemicals, then expect me to provide specific temperature, pressure, wind speed, and humidity data for you. Why do you set the standards for opposing arguments so high, yet require no evidence for your own claims?

       You saying things are not what the vids are showing without backing it up with sources of you own do not make my claims (or those in the articles/vids I provided) wrong. You just make it our word against yours. How about backing your claims up with evidence or sources as I have instead of asking me to take you at your word. And please stop supplying PDFs. I really don't want to keep downloading numerous documents.

       The videos themselves are not backing up what they say with anything, so why should I? They are just making their own, skewed interpretation of the videos. I'm offering a more obvious answer. If you want to google my point on the radiation thing, feel free.

        The original Blue Marble (as well as the others) are artist renderings passed off as real photos which you said was not the case. I showed you how NASA said it was an actual photo taken on Apollo 18 with the photographer unknown. They did not originally say it was an artist interpretation.

       Nope, it's fake. Here's some history for you:
      </p>
      <p>
       " As it turns out, much of what one might assume about this beautiful image is not true…. It isn’t actually a photograph of earth. And that blackness surrounding it? That’s not space, either….
      </p>
      <p>
       Simmon, a data-visualizer and designer at NASA’s Earth Observatory, created the image in 2002. He told Quartz it’s not a photograph, but a sophisticated visualization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Images of the earth may seem commonplace, but there are actually very few pictures of the entire planet. The problem, Simmon said, is all the NASA earth-observing satellites are in low-earth or geostationary orbit, meaning none of them are far enough away to see a full hemisphere. The most familiar pictures of the entire Earth are from the 1960s and 1970s Apollo missions to the moon.
      </p>
      <p>
       As realistic as it looks, the image is a composite of four months of light data collected in 2,300 km (1,429 mi) wide bands as NASA’s Terra satellite orbited from pole to pole, and the earth rotated beneath it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That data was then stitched togetherand applied to the surface of a digital ball, then modified in Photoshop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simmon readily admits there are numerous fakeries in his image. The atmosphere is Photoshop blur. Some of the clouds are collaged together using Photoshop’s clone tool to cover gaps in the satellite’s coverage. The black area around the earth is not the void of space. It is simply a background of black color that Simmon placed the earth on top of. (This is standard practice, Simmon says: most actual “photographs” of the earth—including the Apollo images—present the planet on a black background).
      </p>
      <p>
       Without these alterations, the image wouldn’t look very earth-like.Simmon said he based his manipulations on reality, “in the sense that I’ve looked at a lot of imagery to see how thick should that be, how blue should that be.” But, he later added, “It’s more hyper-realistic than realistic.”
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "The image on the left, dated 1978, is actually a composite of images taken in 2001 and published on on February 8, 2002. You can find the original photo here, and the NASA page including a discussion of it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Below we have compared the alleged 1978 image (which we’ll now refer to as the 2001 image) with the original NASA photo. The original NASA image is on the left and the 2001 photo in circulation (mis-labeled as 1978) is on the right. It is clear that the colors have been altered from the original to appear more vibrant, and the subtle greens of the original are much brighter in the altered version.

       But that's not the same blue marble. The one I linked is the original blue marble, NASA photo ID AS17-148-22727. That picture I linked is a digital scan of the original photo, and was released in the 1970s. I mean, the very page you linked says this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fake one is newer released one, which is CG, and says as much. It was released in 2002. You're talking about a completely different image here. As I said, it says that one is fake right on the NASA website.

       They passed the 2002 Blue Marble off as real until they were called on it. You said NASA doesn't lie yet they hid the truth about this pic until they couldn't any longer.

      <p>
       Once you realiza NASA will lie about one simple thing, you begin to wonder what else they would lie about. The evidence is numerous and not related to our original topic so I will leave it to you to research if you really want see the truth about the lies they have been peddling the past 50+ years.

       You said the Goverment doesn't cloud seed while only farmers do. I proved you wrong and then you said you never said the Gov doesn't do cloud seeding. I showed you your own words where you said exactly that and you still have the nerve to call me a liar. Sounds like a perjury and fabricating if you ask me.

       When you resort to name-calling, it shows you truly have no argument left to make, so as I said last night and again today, if you want an honest discussion, refrain from childish name-calling in the future. We are done here.

       you claimed that we have never been past the Van Allen radiation belts. That is not true. In the same comment you also claimed that NASA uses wires in their ISS videos, and that air bubbles are seen floating in spacewalk videos. This is not true. You also claimed that all pictures of the earth are "cgi composites", which is also not true. You also again claimed that the blue marble pics were passed of as real until NASA admitted they were fake, which is also not true.

       Did you even read your evidence befote sharing?!?! It says clearly most contrails only lasted a few minutes with the longest observed 3 hours at most. Chemtrails last anywhere from 24-48 hours. That is what we consider an EPIC FAIL in regards to backing your claims with evidence.

       Most contrails do last for only a few minutes.

       It said that one specific contrail lasted for 3 hours, which by itself is enough. Nowhere did it say that contrails lasting longer do not exist.

       Your source provided no evidence for long lasting mile wide chemtrails, only short lasting contrails. I really doubt you even know what we are discussing right now. Go back to the drawing board bud. I never doubted the existence of contrails, but I do know they do not last as long or behave the same as chemtrails.

       It explains short lasting contrails with one example of a longer one. They came nowhere close to the 24-48 hour long chemtrails observed by people with their own eyes daily.

       Listen, you did a great job verifying contrails exist which I never doubted. You said the long ass chemtrails were easily explained and fail to do so time and time again. I asked for specific conditions and you have nothing. This is going around in circles and you keep resorting to calling me a liar like some child with a broken record.

       Okay. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through sublimation, but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called deposition and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. With an understanding of science, it's not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.

       They are just contrails. Contrails last as long as conditions allow. Jet fuel is very similar to paraffin (kerosene); it is a hydrocarbon - a complex mix of carbon and hydrogen. When it burns in air it breaks apart and the carbon combines with oxygen to expand into carbon dioxide gas (CO2) and the hydrogen combines with oxygen to form water (H2O). These two reactions give off a great deal of heat energy. 1 kilo of aviation fuel combines with oxygen to produce about 3.5 kilos of CO2 gas and 1.2 kilos of water which boils instantly into 1,600 litres of superheated steam. It is these rapidly expanding hot gases which push the aircraft forward. At high altitudes where the temperature is minus 50 degrees the steam will freeze into tiny ice crystals almost instantly. If the air is dry the crystals will disappear in seconds through
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublimation_(phase_transition">
        sublimation
       </a>
       , but if the air is saturated with water vapour then the crystals will grow many times in size into snowflakes through the opposite process called
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deposition_(phase_transition">
        deposition
       </a>
       and can last for hours or even days in a distinct formation. This is a contrail. It does not require any sinister chemicals to make it form. How long a contrail lasts depends on temperature, pressure, and humidity, and nothing else. A 747 burns around 11 tons of fuel per hour, which convert to around 13 tons of ice, which is around 24 kg per mile. It is a tiny amount compared with the thousands of tons of ice in a contrail, but only 0.003% of the water in a persistent contrail comes from the burnt fuel; the other 99.997% is from the atmosphere itself. With an understanding of science, it's not hard to see how a jet liner spewing fire and ice can leave a huge spectacular cloud behind it.

       Contrails form from about 23,000 feet upwards. The temperature and pressure at any given altitude varies a bit, and the humidity varies a lot. It is a sliding scale with three driving forces, and it's called the

       The temerature I gave was only an average. If you fly you'll see it vary from 46 to 56 below centigrade at cruising altitude, which could be between 28,000 and 40,000 feet. As an aircraft climbs it reaches an altitude where it is cold enough to form contrails. Whether it does, depends on how much water vapour there is in the air at that altitude. That varies a great deal. An aircraft at 25,000 feet could be making a spectacular contrail, while another at 30,000 is making none at all.

       That really doesn't explain why you don't ever see the classical/original thin contrails anymore like you did in the 80s or 90s. They're all these massive wide trails that always happen right before it starts raining like crazy or it gets really cold and snowy.

       Always after you see them in the sky you get this massive blanket-like cloud in the sky that clears up really fast after a super aggressive storm.

       They do that, always have done. Persistent contrails usually happen when there is a cold front approaching. Whether a contrail forms, dissipates, or grows depends entirely on moisture levels, air pressure, and temperature.

        This is more air traffic than comes and goes in the morning hours from our tiny airport.

       They are aircraft on route from somewhere else to somewhere else. Aircraft in transit use airports on the ground as visual 'waypoints' and fly over or near them because they are easy to spot and identify.

       Did you see the 3 military helicopters flying towards Black Mtn last week? They were so low you could throw a rock at them. It was just cool. I actually sent my GF a video of two planes flying side by side leaving a trail, but it was on snapchat so thats gone. I also live here and we do have a looot of trails, our town motto is also Keep Asheville Weird lol.

       I did! They cut over our mountains area in skyland, maybe 100 yards from our house. They were skimming the tree tops and we were actually higher up than they were. I asked my wife- what military base is nearby?!

       Okay, I'm not gonna read through that. What is your point in trying to prove to me that geoengineering is real? I know it's real. What I'm asking you to do is explain how any of this is responsible for the long white clouds coming out of airliners. This is about cloud seeding. Not chemtrails.

       If you are unwilling to read, you are unwilling to learn. There really is no point to this conversation anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence I provided shows that silver iodide is a chemical, along with aluminum, barium, strontium, etc being spraying under the guise of cloud seeding and geoengineering. Farmers have noticed an uptick in all of these heavy metals in their soils and the logical conclusion is that the chemicals we are being doused with is accumulating in the farmland.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure why I even took the time to paraphrase evidence you won't bother to read. You have proven this conversation is a waste of time. Take care.
