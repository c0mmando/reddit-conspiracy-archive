        <h3 class="title">Yahoo News "journalist" Isikoff Stunned his Article used to Justify Spy Warrant</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">38</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-02-04 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/TangledWebsWeWeave.html">TangledWebsWeWeave</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Investigative journalist Michael Isikoff said Friday that he was surprised to find out that an
article he wrote about Carter Page prior to the election was used to obtain a spy warrant against the former Trump campaign adviser.
One “essential” part of the application was the uncorroborated Steele dossier, according to the memo. And an article that Isikoff wrote for Yahoo! News on Sept. 23, 2016 that was based directly on the dossier was “cited extensively” in the application.</p>

<p>Isikoff was shocked, he said, because his very article was based on information that came from Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier. He said it was “a bit beyond me” that the FBI would use his article in the FISA application.</p>

<p>“Obviously the information that I got from Christopher Steele was information the FBI already had,” he said, noting that Steele began sharing information from his dossier in July 2016. “My story is about the FBI’s own investigation,” he continued.</p>

<p>“So it seems a little odd that they would be citing the Yahoo! News story about the matter that they are investigating themselves based on the same material that had been separately presented to the FBI before I was ever briefed by Christopher Steele.”</p>

<p>However, the journalist&#39;s names and the amounts they were paid are redacted and Fusion GPS is doing their damnedest to sue the House Intelligence Committee to get restraining orders issued try to keep them classified.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost as if Obama spied on whoever he wanted whenever he wanted and used &quot;Journalists&quot; to cover it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But Trump has access to all of this intelligence. Remember Nunes&#39; first unmasking scandal, it turned out to be from the WH itself. Then it turned out Nunes requested dozens of unmasking requests. I mean if they had evidence Obama ordered unwarranted surveillance it would&#39;ve leaked right? Susan Rice was given her top secret clearance. I&#39;m not against your overall idea, I&#39;m just trying to figure out after a year this is all they came up with. </p>

<p>So I suggest we use the same level of trust for the Nunes Memo as we they do for the Steele Dossier and assume that Nunes biases had nothing to do with the information presented in the memo and that it is all accurate.</p>

<p>It really does seem like they’ve been using the dossier as their investigatory roadmap.</p>

<p>If it turns out that Mueller’s investigation is basically just trying to corroborate a political smear document that Comey called “salacious and unverified”, that’s next level bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No for sure, I’m not trying to argue that Mueller had anything to do with those warrants. Any impropriety there would have nothing to do with him at all.</p>

<p>I’m just saying that the only individuals indicted were all individuals in the dossier. Except for Papadopoulos, but how significant his role is in this saga is yet to be seen. Process crime so far, but who knows, he could be key, stranger things have happened.</p>

<p>It just kind of seems like Mueller has been going off the dossier and hitting a wall everywhere else.</p>

<p>I mean we knew the names in the indictments before they were unsealed, if there was jaw dropping info that’s been uncovered subsequently,I feel some would’ve leaked.</p>

<p>So if at the end of this it turns out Mueller basically had the dossier as the foundation and went from there, that’s also not a good look for the integrity of our IC.</p>

<p>I reserve the right to be totally wrong and Mueller ends up having the goods on everyone and brings the hammer of god down upon the wicked. </p>

<p>I just currently find the outcome where they find nothing but try to say trump obstructed Justice to be more likely.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>VP: [Male-1] wrote that he is sorry, he went to Moscow and 
forgot to check his inbox, but he wants to meet when he gets 
back. I think he is an idiot and forgot who I am. Plus he 
writes to me in Russian [to] practice the language. He flies 
to Moscow more often than I do. He got hooked on Gazprom 
thinking that if they have a project, he could be rise up. Maybe 
he can. I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s obvious that he wants to earn 
lots of money .</p>

<p>On or about June 13, 2013, Agent-2 and I interviewed 
Male-1. Male-1 stated that he first met VICTOR PODOBNYY, the 
defendant, in January 2013 at an energy symposium in New York City. 
During this initial meeting, PODOBNYY gave Male-1 PODOBNYY&#39;s 
business card and two email addresses. Over the following months, 
Male-1 and PODOBNYY exchanged emails about the energy business and 
met in person on occasion, with Male-1 providing PODOBNYY with 
Male-l&#39;s outlook on the current and future of the energy industry. 
Male-1 also provided documents to PODOBNYY about the energy business.</p>

<p>Sounds like the same international corporate hijinks to me, do you think after the failed recruitment outlined in your document the Russians did tag him as an informant and also set him on a fast track to trump&#39;s yet to exist campaign? If so serendipitous is the only word.</p>

<p>Now I don&#39;t want to sound like a trump cheerleader because I really can&#39;t stand this whole Q/MAGA deepstate super mission everyone is on about right now. To me trump undoubtedly has tons of hidden assets via his Russian gangster buddies and others but I honestly still can&#39;t see how this shows or even suggests Russian involvement. </p>

<p>A case I might add in which Page was not indicted, apparently because there was no evidence to prove he was acting as a foreign agent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the article was heavily cited as the reason for the warrant renewal vs any “new” findings it’s pretty plain to see. I guess we will have to see the actual application to know for sure, but that’s what it looks like on the surface. Otherwise, why would they cite the article at all if they already had that information plus any additional findings? </p>

<p>What’s the big deal? FBI agents can be biased and partisan. It doesn’t mean it affected their work.</p>

<p>Nunes is a Trump stooge and his memo is biased and partisan!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re right, there could be more gathered, but to me what’s telling is that so far, besides Papadopoulos, the only indictments have been of those individuals named in the dossier. And papa guy is on the hook for a process crime, so unless he’s got a song to sing, that really doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>It really does seem like they’ve been using the dossier as their investigatory roadmap.</p>

<p>If it turns out that Mueller’s investigation is basically just trying to corroborate a political smear document that Comey called “salacious and unverified”, that’s next level bullshit. </p>

<p>But who knows. No way to tell until Mueller has presented his findings.</p>
