       First of all, the flu shot screws up your immune system. You know how people get the flu shot, then they get sick? It's because according to this placebo controlled study, you are
       <strong>
        5 times more likely to catch a non-flu respiratory illness
       </strong>
       if you've had the flu shot. Your cell-mediated immunity takes a back seat for several weeks.

       Did you know that pregnant women are pushed into the flu shot? Often told they have to get it or their doctor will dump them. The American Academy of obstetrics and gynecology, as well as the CDC, both recommend the flu shot (and the DTaP) during pregnancy. This is absolutely insane, especially considering. the shots have
       <strong>
        never
       </strong>
       been studied in pregnant women for safety. The studies on pregnant women are done by "passive surveillance" only, which basically means YOU are the experiment. This study just came out in September 2018 demonstrating
       <strong>
        increased risk of spontaneous abortion if you've had the flu shot two years in a row.
       </strong>

       Last but not least, did you know that the flu is Airborne? In the hospital, we treated as a droplet precaution, which means they have to cough or sneeze on you. But according to this study that just came out a couple weeks ago, if you've had the flu shot and you catch the flu anyway, you will have
       <strong>
        INCREASED viral aerosol generation
       </strong>
       . As in,
       <strong>
        airborne shedding of your flu
       </strong>
       on people when you breathe.
      </p>
      <p>
       "vaccination with both the current and previous year’s seasonal vaccines, however, was significantly associated with greater fine-aerosol shedding in unadjusted and adjusted models (P &lt; 0.01)."

       They push you to get them so bad, it's bizarre. At my old job we had a yearly health fair and they gave flu shots for the employees. Every year I was the only person that didn't get one. They looked at me like I was crazy and continually asked me to get one. I was encouraged because " it's free you know"
      </p>
      <p>
       Now every damn  doctors or pharmacy visit they are pushing them again.  I'm just going to start saying yeah I got one just so they shut up.

       It's not bizarre, it's business. The corporations don't want you to miss work because of something that they inexpensively treat. They've calculated that they save money by offering flu shots vs not offering them. If flu shots were more expensive than the money made by having a completely healthy staff during the flu season then they wouldn't do offer them.

       Money?  These companies don’t give them away for free. The FLU vaccine is the only vaccine I can think of that you are required to take every year to “be immune”.  This creates recurring income.

       They push flu vaccine because usually it's more effective. Like every other medication it has side effects, and they basically have to guess based on what strains are predominantly causing Australia's flu to determine which ones to put in the vaccine here. People hate the flu vaccine because of sensationalized stories about relatively infrequent side effects.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said I'm in the ER everyday, and people with other cardiac/pulmonary problems come in everyday because the flu causes an exacerbation of their other medical problems. Even catching 20% of people in flu prevention saves us tons I healthcare costs by keeping those people out of the ER.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, the CDC is definitely influced by the companies which make these vaccines to push them on everyone for profit, but that doesn't mean they're not a smart preventative measure overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       I probably wouldn't get the flu vaccine if it wasn't required for me, but people who are already sick (with COPD, asthma, etc) are definitely better off getting the vaccine even if it's only 20% effective.

       Do you think then there ought to be a significant push to change who we're giving these shots to?  Wouldn't it save a ton of money and resources and avoid a lot of adverse reactions if we only gave the shot to high risk patients who really need it in the first place?

       nah, you gotta give it to everyone. The way viruses mutate, the worst thing you can do is have a population in the same space together where some/most are immunized and some are not. This is specifically how resistant strains occur....same principal with other vaccines, thats why they try to vaccinate everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       now yes, there are some cases where immunocompromised people get extra, special vaccines. For instance, some HIV patients get boosters for diptheria, new pneumoccal vaccines, and others to prevent bad infections like meningitis. The reason ONLY those patients get those vaccines (unlike the flu) is that they are relatively uncommon (not everyone is walking around as a carrier like the flu), they dont mutate as quickly (we've used the same PSV vaccine for over a decade).

       Allegedly if you eat enough fiber on a daily basis, your gut gets to the point where it's so adapted, you can eat a shitton of fiber and never fart.

       Hmm, maybe its a huge scam to get people to buy more flu shots and become dependent on pharma for health. Or its a flu shot designed to keep people healthy during flu season so they continue to work and earn the companies that mighty dollar. Either way, staying healthy by eating healthy and being physically fit is the best way to not catch flu. This includes being mentality healthy (and that's the important one). Either way, the world has always been out to get us.

       I have never had a flu shot. It just instinctively seems not a good idea. I am not a germaphobe but I
       <em>
        am
       </em>
       aware of washing my hands regularly, using hand sanitizer after things like getting money/change back at a drive-thru, etc.  Haven't had a cold or flu in over 10 years.
