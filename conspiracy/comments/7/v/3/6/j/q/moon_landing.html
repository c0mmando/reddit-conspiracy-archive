       I don't believe we landed on the moon. My cousin told me in his college astrology or astronomy class, they looked at the moon and can see some shining something on the surface.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's the rebuttal for this? I don't have a telescope, nor have I ever looked at the moon through one. So I don't have the slightest clue to what he's referring

       If you don't have a good rebuttal to physical evidence of a moon landing, why do you reject it?
      </p>
      <p>
       To answer your question, the usual explanation by people who deny that humans walked on the moon is that robot probes deposited those reflectors. There are a lot of problems with that theory, but it's probably the best rebuttal to this particular evidence of the moon missions.

       I'm pretty sure you can look at pictures and diagrams of everything that made a soft landing on the moon. You'd be hard-pressed to find a picture of one with a retro-reflector.

       Even by the public history there are little problems with that theory. Probes landed before humans are said to have.

      <p>
       There is zero definitive or truly independent 3rd party evidence of the landings. There are many claims, but very weak if challenged:

       indeed it is, because it certainly wasn't on the moon

       in the OP, you say that you do not believe we landed on the moon

       To be honest it took me about a week to start realizing everything was fake lmfao. Once you do, like you said, your brain literally allows you to see it for what it truly is. I think it's easier to tell what's not real in this world, then what is.

       and of course, soon you will be called names like crazy, paranoid, delusional, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       at which point you will be forced to confront the fact that psychiatry is basically a fancy way of name calling, meant to try and keep people in line.

      <p>
       psychiatrists are not interesting in helping people, they are only interested in controlling people

       Yep. I've been called everything under the sun already. I mostly keep it to myself now a days. People don't listen, or have no interest in thinking against the narrative. Won't look into things shown to them, or simply reply with "why does it matter anyway?". I no longer waste my energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you stated, it's just a form of control. They will prescribe me drugs to make my "paranoia" go away. That just dulls your senses, basically making you forget. There is no real help in that. Why would they want to provide help for their slaves? Minimal care to keep them sustainable is quite enough.

       there are a lot of "woke" people out there, you just have to find one, and ask them to introduce you to their "woke" friends. the stuff that comes up on

       yes during their brainwashing and indoctrination, their minds are filled with models that are so complete, that their minds don't allow other models to co-exist
      </p>
      <p>
       just consider flat earth vs ball earth
      </p>
      <p>
       if your mind is filled with ball earth model, then it can't accept, acknowledge, contemplate, consider etc the flat earth model

       if your mind is filled with the Bohr model of the atom, then it can't ... other models of atoms

       it really takes a change in your own heart and mind to even want to consider other points of view.

       people tend to rely on "thought terminating cliches" to end a conversation or debate. once you recognize that people do this habitually, it can be maddening

       don't worry that people are not ready to hear what you have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe instead of unloading a bunch of startling facts on some poor fool, just make a startling one-liner that is crafted in such as way as to make them ask you for clarification or elaboration
      </p>
      <p>
       for example, just say "yeah, i think man made global warming is a hoax" and leave it at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       the person you said it too will have a cascade of thoughts that might start out with something like "this guys an idiot"... but if you are face to face they may think it but won't necessarily say it
      </p>
      <p>
       just remain silent, and let the pressure build on them to reply to what you just said, to break the awkward silence
      </p>
      <p>
       and about the polite thing for them to say would be something like
      </p>
      <p>
       "oh really, why do you believe that?"
      </p>
      <p>
       at which point you give your reasoning... after they ask for it
      </p>
      <p>
       if they don't ask for your reasoning, and just change the subject, thats fine too.
      </p>
      <p>
       you've planted a seed in their mind, without upsetting them too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       as time goes on that seed with affect how they view future news and info, whether they like it or not

       Yeah whenever I became "woke", I literally dropped all pre conceived ideologies I had. Started from scratch and went from 1 thing to the next. Once you look into it, it's so easy to spot the web of deception that has been woven. Everything is so neatly and perfectly connected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, I studied flat earth for awhile, and came to a middle ground area between the two. Definitely can't drop that bomb shell on anyone lol. Yeah, I've tried the global warming intro, but people are already sold into the lie of global warming. It's like everything else. They're sooo deep into it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I'm working into the positivity thing. It's so much easier to be brought down when like you said "you see your cage". It's been about 9 months so far, and it's been a crazy ride, and I haven't even touched the tip of the iceberg.

       9 months is all?
      </p>
      <p>
       I started looking at the moon landing stuff in probably 1998 or so
      </p>
      <p>
       started looking at 9/11 stuff in about 2005
      </p>
      <p>
       started looking at Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013
      </p>
      <p>
       started looking at Vaccines and Autism in 2014
      </p>
      <p>
       my suggestion to you or anyone else would be to make it a point to learn new names and faces every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you read a news article and it mentions "Carter Page", look him up and find his face pics, his bio, etc
      </p>
      <p>
       you'd be amazed at how many names and faces you can remember, in spite of Dunbars Number
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       later, when these names or faces come up in other contexts, you will put the dots  together more quickly
      </p>
      <p>
       like for example, the would-be assassin of Ronald Reagan was a close family friend of the Bush family, and GHW Bush would have been President had Reagan died

       ok, so you can tell that this image has been manipulated, because there are words and arrows on it that are obviously not part of the original photo

      <p>
       once you acknowledge that the photo has been manipulated,
      </p>
      <p>
       then the question becomes "how much" has it been manipulated
      </p>
      <p>
       that makes the so-called evidence more questionable

      <p>

       if you are asking if people "see" a reflector, the answer is "no"
      </p>
      <p>
       if they "see" anything, its just a photon that bounced off the surface of the moon
      </p>
      <p>
       the moon is already reflective, as evidenced by the fact that the moon reflects sunlight

       They can see something a trillion miles away, but they haven't been able to design a telescope capable of actually seeing the lander or flag on the Moon. They have some CGI images (they never call them photographs for a reason) that have an arrow pointing to a pixel with the word "flag" next to it, if you believe that. For some gullible people, that's plenty proof.

       after many years of debate, with many different people with different background and educations etc there seemed to be a pattern of how the math and physics would be debated,
      </p>
      <p>
       but unfortunately most of these debates were fragmented, incomplete, and out of order, and so people/lurkers didn't get the benefit of seeing all the various arguments worked out in a single debate
      </p>
      <p>
       so therefore i sat down one day and wrote out all of the most popular arguments, and arranged them into a logical sequence

       What is to be gained by saying we went there, going through all the trouble to create the endless stream of image and live streams of nothing but CGI as you put it along with the op. There is just nothing to be gained other than being able to say to the russians "ner ner we put a man on the moon!"

       i like it because it preemptively debunks whatever arguments you can come up with, and all i have to do is reference the number of the question, and it will be presented in context that is favorable to my narrative development
      </p>
      <p>
       basically i got tired of having to re-explain these simple concepts over and over to each new idiot i encountered, so this makes it much less labor intensive for me to smack down your moon landing myth
      </p>
      <p>
       i have posted this to
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       a few times, giving the critics and skeptics every opportunity to debunk it or ask me questions
      </p>
      <p>
       thus far, the questions are still standing, and the moon landing believers have failed to debunk it.
      </p>
      <p>
       have a look at these lame comments that some people consider to be a debunking:

       It could be something that normally happens on the moon, or maybe something we shot over there, no need to be put there by people, the most important prove of the moon landing fake is the testimony of astronauts they said there were no stars, while the modern ones say there are many?  who is telling the truth?

       I agree. The back and fourth from then to now, with all the other evidence is overwhelming. Like I said. I don't believe we ever did, I just hadnt heard that question asked before.

       Yep. I've been called everything under the sun already. I mostly keep it to myself now a days. People don't listen, or have no interest in thinking against the narrative. Won't look into things shown to them, or simply reply with "why does it matter anyway?". I no longer waste my energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you stated, it's just a form of control. They will prescribe me drugs to make my "paranoia" go away. That just dulls your senses, basically making you forget. There is no real help in that. Why would they want to provide help for their slaves? Minimal care to keep them sustainable is quite enough.
