        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m not going to lie; I hate Reddit, and I always have. For the most part Reddit feels like a band of teenagers who find little safe-spaces (subs) where they circle-jerk eachother and ban/suppress opposing views. Reddit has never been a bastion of free speech, and we know that. This isn&#39;t a secret. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve always liked this sub though (and it always encouraged open minds and removing political bias) and I read it a lot more often than I respond or contribute. Lately though? I&#39;m seeing this place get shilled HARD. I&#39;m seeing a lot of left-leaning, anti-conservative political bullshit on here that looks like it belongs in r/politics. I&#39;m also seeing the comments reflect a clear bias and hatred of the right, the GOP, and the President. I&#39;m seeing open-minded comments (neutral in nature) being downvoted into oblivion when someone simply doesn&#39;t go full-bore in agreement with these liberal leanings. </p>

<p>This place is literally starting to look like a spinoff of <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. Honest comments and threads are being downvoted, while one-liner poltical hack lines are being +voted over 300. What the fuck? This is total bullshit. It didn&#39;t use to be this way.</p>

<p>What the fuck happened? Is the deep state so damaged that they&#39;re now even brigading subs like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because the truth is finally getting out to the masses? </p>

<p>Seems like there&#39;s an OBVIOUS hoard around here trying to control the narrative. This place is changing a lot, and it&#39;s changing fast, and it&#39;s very pro-liberal politics and anti-anything else. </p>

<p>This feels extremely dangerous. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  Appreciate the comments everyone. I think the downvotes on this thread vs the comments received pretty much prove the point. </p>

<p>This sub has been infiltrated by hard-leftists in an attempt to control the narrative. Not a single down-vote managed to voice their reasoning for doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not trying to discredit you...but you do seem to be on this sub for one reason only. Politics. Take it however you want.</p>

<p>Let me ask you some questions. Seeing as how you seem to love &quot;political conspiracies&quot;...</p>

<p>Why did the DOJ under Lynch sign off on immunities for Hillary&#39;s staff? Why were immunities given in the first place? How did Loretta Lynch manage to not recuse herself after the tarmac meeting? Why did Loretta Lynch then break from procedure/protocol and give Comey the authority to assess guilt? Why did Comey then break from protocol and make the decision of whether or not Hillary was guilty of a crime.</p>

<p>Why wasn&#39;t a special prosecutor brought in to avoid a of that?

<p>And what reason is that? Because I talk about a variety of stuff here. And don&#39;t try and backpedal and say you aren&#39;t trying to discredit me, because you are. </p>

<p>You obviously prefer me not to be here and I would love to know why.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did the DOJ under Lynch sign off on immunities for Hillary&#39;s staff? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>To get them to testify. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>How did Loretta Lynch manage to not recuse herself after the tarmac meeting? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Weird wording, but she should have recused herself, and it was fucking dumb that she didn&#39;t. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why did Loretta Lynch then break from procedure/protocol and give Comey the authority to assess guilt?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my understanding that&#39;s what the FBI does. They recommend charges of indictment, and the DOJ chooses if they listen to the recommendation or not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why wasn&#39;t a special prosecutor brought in to avoid a of that? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There definitely should have been one. </p>

<p>Now again, why don&#39;t you want people like me on here who lean left? </p>

<p>You accused somebody of trying to censor a group just because they aired a perceived grievance they have.</p>

<p>Testifying was not the only reason...immunities were also given to secure laptops. Something the FBI has every right to do without offering immunity.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like echo chambers here which is why I hate discussions in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I left room for him to clarify his stance. But, his post is blatantly just attacking one side of the community here and implying that we should be suspicious of anyone that is from the left.</p>

<p>What does that even mean?</p>

<p>That&#39;s correct. That&#39;s my view and my opinion. You said that you don&#39;t want an echo chamber so you should at least respect my view on this. Feel free to debate with me about it or to believe the opposite, but just because that&#39;s my opinion doesn&#39;t make me suspect.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Complete failure of critical/logical/honest thinking imo.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just a personal attack against me.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because I&#39;m aware of what the process is and they aren&#39;t the only ones involved, and I actually pay attention to political news outside of the reddit bubble.</p>

<p>Now again, why don&#39;t you want me here? Why are you making these accusations against me? Is it just because I&#39;m critical of Trump and Nunes?</p>

<p>I am wondering why you just believe the Nunes memo outright when there is no supporting documentation or intelligence provided. The memo really is nothing more than an opinion and a prop that FOX news can use to waive around on TV and nothing more. </p>

<p>How can you just turn of your critical thinking like this? It really is showing that, as long as something supports your political leanings, you will choose to believe it without any proof and without looking into the research and the other sides of the story (i..e. the Minority Report).</p>

<p>What the fuck happened? Is the deep state so damaged that they&#39;re now even brigading subs like <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> because the truth is finally getting out to the masses?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Can be called an expansion of mockingbird. Reputation management firms hired by one of the big ones such as rogue intelligence agencies, globalists, partisan politics, Council on Foreign Relations. Source doesn&#39;t matter but the impact is pretty noticeable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s escalation of tactics seen over on r technology after the domestic spying story broke. Only escalated to overwhelm dialogue. </p>

<p>It requires time and effort to ramp up these efforts. A long running stable sub such as a default are easiest to disrupt. There is time to infiltrate, cut deals with a platform, flood with sock puppet accounts, build tools to interact, and so forth. </p>

<p>It&#39;s more difficult to run these campaigns on moving targets. The administrative time necessary to ramp up the effort. First the location has to be identified. Then take a pulse and get a feel for the culture of the place and develop strategies to disrupt. Field test different existing approaches. If the new location is sufficiently off platform, many tools aren&#39;t available. Imagine spending hundreds of thousands of man hours developing tools to more quickly operate across reddit. Monitoring for key trigger words or topics, AI supported responses from a narrative bank allowing quick responses an employee can select from and quickly modify. </p>

<p>On a new location there&#39;s a window to freely operate, then you move again when needed. </p>

<p>In the conspiracy forum it&#39;s still beneficial to engage. But increasingly I&#39;ve seen side communities split off. If you&#39;re a quality contributor, these side efforts will see you and you&#39;ll find yourself invited to surprising places.</p>

<p>maybe there are just more left leaning members in this sub than right leaning?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s <em>possible</em> that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, being part of an Internet platform that is mostly used by young people, skews left. But that&#39;s not true of conspiracy theorists in general, so the jury is still out on that one.</p>

<p>The left has held cultural power for at least half a century, although some would argue it goes back even further to the Enlightenment period. (If you don&#39;t believe this, just ask yourself whether society today is more &quot;progressive&quot; than it was 60 years ago.)</p>

<p>&quot;Truthers&quot; are anti-mainstream, so I think it&#39;s safe to say they are much more likely to be right-wing (or hold some other non-left political position). This is probably why <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has such a high prevalence of posts about God/spirituality (topics that the left have ideologically abandoned, for the most part).</p>

<p>Again, ask yourself – do leftists have a reputation for being &quot;crazy conspiracy nuts&quot;? No, but conservatives do.</p>

<p>Prior to Trump, there were certainly a lot less posts demonizing right-wingers for their beliefs, that&#39;s for sure. Something changed in this sub, and &quot;leftist shilling&quot; is one of the few explanations that makes sense.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It should not surprise anyone when subs lean politically left. At least ones that do not delete comments or ban people for having opposing views.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a funny argument to make, since the left overwhelmingly supports censorship more than the right. Furthermore, there&#39;s no data to support it, and plenty to refute it. Most places on the Internet that have very low moderation/censorship tend to swing to the right over time; 4chan is one example.</p>

<p>The LOL was in response to your absurd claim.  We can either believe that:<br/>
Someone gives enough of a fuck about what you have to say that they manipulated the vote and apparently ( <em>since the thread isn&#39;t full of deleted comments</em> ) shadow erased all of your positive comments.  </p>

<p>OR  </p>

<p>You waited less than an hour, maybe got a positive comment or two and then made your edit before the bulk of the community got a chance to weigh in.  Of course, for the cynical types, it&#39;s also possible you were fully aware of the negative comments when you made your edit and just wanted to play the victim card.</p>
