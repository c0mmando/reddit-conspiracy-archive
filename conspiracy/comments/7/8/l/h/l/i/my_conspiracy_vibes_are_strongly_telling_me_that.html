<p>Perhaps all the players in TPTB game are going to go under fire soon.</p>

<p>This makes me nervous, my conspiracy senses have never been so strong.</p>

<p>Here are my senses&#39; strongest predictions:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Breaking evidence will come out that Clinton and Trump colluded.</p></li>
<li><p>Trump will remove licenses from many news outlets that speak out against him.</p></li>
<li><p>New laws will be put into place that prohibit us from speaking out against the President.</p></li>
<li><p>Another mass shooting causing gun sales to go up. More fear mongering from the left about getting rid of guns, causing even higher gun sales (people want what they can&#39;t have, and if they feel their freedom to own a gun is threatened, the natural reaction is to buy more guns).</p></li>
<li><p>Antifa turns out to be a right wing psyop.</p></li>
<li><p>The nazi groups turn out to be a left wing psyop.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, nobody trusts any party, and chaos ensues until Sanders comes out and says &quot;I fucking told you so&quot;.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I do, but they are just guesses, and biased towards justice/revenge upon the satanic pedophiles, so I can&#39;t say mine are any less clouded by personal wish than anybody else&#39;s.</p>

<p>One thing I do think is that the so-called &quot;elite&quot; know about natural events before they happen, either by science or occult practice, so there could well be a meteor storm/volcanic eruption/earthquake/whoknowswhat on the horizon, and they&#39;re just toying with us before the Big One (whatever it is).</p>

<p>&quot;They&quot; love their sick jokes, and it&#39;s all quite possible that whatever is happening is timed for incredible revelation and what looks like Good triumphing over Evil, right before the cataclysm kicks in, and humanity has to start all over (again). </p>

<p>BUT.....they don&#39;t always get it right. I&#39;ve always been fascinated by how Hollywood stars can try to tap into the Zeitgeist, read the future and maybe see it, but it still doesn&#39;t play out the way they think. </p>

<p>For example: Occultist Martin Scorcese makes a movie about the silent picture industry, &quot;HUGO,&quot; that costs $150m. Nominated for tons of awards. BUT....that same year, a tiny-budgeted B&amp;W French movie called &quot;The Artist,&quot; ALSO about the silent movie business, happens to come out of nowhere and win all the major Oscars. </p>

<p>Coincidence? I don&#39;t think so. How about Kevin Costner following up his Oscar-winning &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot; with &quot;The Postman,&quot; a just as ambitious Oscar-wannabee that JUST HAPPENED to come out the same time as the Italian picture &quot;The Postman,&quot; which won the Oscar for Best Foreign film, while Costner&#39;s futuristic sci-fi flick bombed. </p>

<p>There are other examples. And you may consider all this coincidence. It may well be. But what I&#39;m saying is that what the occultists THINK is going to happen when the &quot;See&quot; into the future doesn&#39;t always happen the way they think it&#39;s going to play out. </p>

<p>So who knows? I recommend you keep praying, or start praying if you don&#39;t already. Good luck! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not proof. But not coincidence, either. </p>

<p>In some cases, it&#39;s merely one company stealing another&#39;s idea and trying to get it to the marketplace ahead of time. The killer meteor movies, the Robin Hood movies, etc. </p>

<p>I picked &quot;HUGO&quot;/&quot;The Artist&quot; and &quot;The Postmen&quot; because those were cases where it was far less likely a tiny independent foreign film company would be on the Hollywood wavelength.</p>

<p>The November Full Moon is all about water. Early American Colonists and some Indian tribes referred to this as the Beaver Moon for this was the time of the year beavers were very active and traps were set. Many American Indian tribes named this moon for the time the rivers started to freeze and the first snows and frosts came. The Wishram Indians of the North-West calling this time of the year the “snowy mountains in the morning moon&quot;. This November the exact time of the <strong>Full Moon will be just before midnight on Nov 3rd for the West Coast and Mountain time-zones and just after midnight for Central and East Coast United States.</strong></p>

<p>Some of the deadliest/strongest quakes have happened on Full Moons:</p>

military assistance to the Republic of
Korea.</p>

<p>Permanent U.N. Security Council members 
Russia and China will not veto such a 
Resolution, instead abstaining from the vote.</p>

<p>The U.S. then announces the formation of 
a coalition of forces from many countries
willing to undertake action jointly under 
the auspice of the U.N.</p>

<p>What will be really strange will be that 
Russia and China join that coalition.</p>

<p>War breaks out with Russian and Chinese
troops attacking North Korea by land. The
U.S. take the battle to the air.</p>

<p>China wins the war in days with the
death of Kim Jong Un, followed by surrender
by new leaders put in place by Beijing..</p>

<p>Oh, but not before North Korea disables
the North American Electrical grid with
an EMP strike.</p>

<p>Everybody quickly forgets all the other crap.

<p>What will blow up in the next four to eight weeks is the situation in Asia.
Watch for another nuke or missile test in North Korea.
No immediate counter action is taken by the U.S.
Instead, the U.S brings the issue to the U.N. Security Council. The U,N Security Council authorizes some military intervention. The resolution will closely resemble 27 June 1950 UN Resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea.</p>

<p>And this is the point when Seoul no longer ranks as a &quot;populace city&quot;</p>

<p>And this is the point where several Japanese cities once again cease to exist, potentially on in the US or two.</p>

<p>Funny thing about time ... back a few decades it was common knowledge a nuke strike <em>is</em> an EMP strike free of charge.</p>

Nazis are just assholes, and shootings have 90% come from physco leftists who cause more normal people to buy guns which will make it that much harder to ban them. 
But what you should be worried about is your salvation. 
Outside threats will come and mock the living God and an AntiChrist figure will arise among all the chaos. They will cry &quot;peace peace&quot; but there will be no peace. </p>
