<p>Why are we being told to give it up and that this is nothing when the video was just brought to our attention last night? </p>

<p>Why do all these users think they know everything and that there&#39;s no possible way it could be a second shooter? What makes them think this other than their own biased perception of what&#39;s happening in the video?</p>

<p>Why do people not think it&#39;s strange that someone in all black with their hood up is on top of the roof acting sketch as fuck during the shooting? </p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t they noticing how close the gun sounds in that video and that you can literally hear two guns firing at the same time? </p>

<p>Why don&#39;t they think it&#39;s strange that this person is the only one on top of the roof? No one else is up there and why would they be for a concert?</p>

<p>Like I said... maybe it&#39;s nothing, but I&#39;ll be fucking damned if I dismiss this as quick as all of these commenters would like me to. Wtf is really happening on this sub.... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It par for the course, but I&#39;ll tell you this, I just spend 3 days in Vegas and the amount of locals I spoke to who don&#39;t buy the story was remarkable.  Probably spoke with 30+ people (uber drivers, locals at bars, at the tables) and all of them said their being lied to.  I was surprised, I hadn&#39;t seen that kind of reaction to an event before.  So don&#39;t sweet it, keep asking questions and point out flaws.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>can confirm live in Vegas. I mean as soon as I heard on the police scanner and the disparity between body count they said and MSM I was already very skeptical in that moment. They might speak to my own skeptic insecurities, but I have to say there hasn&#39;t been a clarifying moment to tie this all together. Even knowing at least 3 people really died in front of my aunts eyes and I can&#39;t get myself to buy any of the story we are being fed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the time they said they had 20 (police code numbers I forget but when I looked up on twitter people translated to dead bodies) </p>

<p>While the MSM said possibly 2 people dead</p>

<p>I was on my way to pick up my aunt from the airport.. she works at UMC trauma center and had to go straight there. The next day she confirmed with me two people had died by the time she got there and she saw them both. Then she didn&#39;t disclose any more actual numbers but did say more people died. The weird thing is they are the number 1 trauma center out here so I was kind of expecting her body count to be higher there. I guess a lot of the people they don&#39;t try to save and are confirmed dead on sight </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What was he doing with all the weapons in the room?  - He could have been selling weapons to members of ISIS on US soil, which the FBI knew about.  So when ISIS catches wind that Paddock was an FBI informant, they plan the massacre and make him the patsy. It&#39;s been confirmed in the past that the FBI uses sting operations to make themselves look good.  ISIS took credit for the attack, which doesn&#39;t mean they did it, but does indicate they were involved in some way. </p>

<p>Just curious (not trying to be a dick) why you think the videos, physical evidence and photos point to Paddock being the shooter?  Nobody has seen any smoking gun so to speak.  If there is video evidence that shows Paddock strapped with guns inside Mandalay, I would agree.  But there&#39;s been nothing. You&#39;d think the feds would be doing anything they can to reinforce the lone gunman theory, but they can&#39;t because there simply isn&#39;t any evidence of such. I think this is why they released the &quot;child-porn&quot; thing, they want people to think his family has mental illnesses, so it implicates him being crazy. </p>

<p>The videos show muzzle blasts on the 4th floor (cab video), which the SWAT team investigated - not the local police. Seems fishy since the police cleared the rest of Mandalay. Other videos from inside the concert sound like gunfire originating inside the concert area itself. </p>

<p>Physical evidence? What physical evidence?</p>

<p>The hotel scene photos look really odd too.  Bullets on top of blood, inconsistent ear-lobes from genuine Paddock photos and the bloodied photo, bi-pod machine gun mysteriously cradling his lifeless body, etc. The team that stormed his room when interviewed mentioned his room looked more like a gun store than anything else.  23 guns in one room is a cartoonish amount of weaponry for one person.  It doesn&#39;t make sense.</p>

<p>Yeah, as in &quot;conspiracy to commit&quot; stings ran in way that look to <em>gasp</em> protect the public. As in a fake bomb or the classic agent as hit man for killing one&#39;s wife/husband etc. They don&#39;t put a real bomb in the want-a-be terrorist car, then let him drive off to some location, then send in one agent to arrest etc. There is no pay off risk to reward wise for doing that being conspiracy to commit charges are harsh, really harsh. People are doing life in prison for conspiracy charges.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, one could argue that law enforcement does wobble a bit when walking the line between entrapment and actions of a reasonable person. They will claim, correctly, that no amount of nudging will make a reasonable person just decide to get a bomb and blow something up. Yet I&#39;m not sure leaning on a guy to do it for months base off an informant saying the person had those tendency is 100% ok either. It&#39;s a slippery slope. </p>

<p>Gun running line of thinking? There is no reason to have guns + ammo + buyer + seller all in the room for a conspiracy charge. Never mind it being legal guns. Bring ammo? You don&#39;t need an arms deal to buy ammo in the USA. It&#39;s at walmart, that&#39;s how little we care.  </p>

<p>Plus law enforcement would stack tactical next door, not just let the guy have the run of the floor for days. Terrorist cell? Past attacks have been 100% clear &quot;We did this, watch us do this!&quot; in nature. They would of strapped up and walked down stairs and started shooting or blown up the room or something with days to prep. &quot;Oh they did! There was other shooters all over Vegas!!&quot;. Errrrrrrrrrrr and yet zero proof of that, in anyway. </p>

<p>and in the end gen pop not having info is not the same as law enforcement not having the info. Law enforcement never want to share info on investigations unless it helps the investigation some how. </p>

<p>conspiracy wise? I think the big one is watching MGM try to cover it&#39;s own ass here. I&#39;m thinking they screwed up some where. Maybe not technically illegal but more then enough to have court cases brought. </p>

<p>There is ABSOLUTELY ZERO EVIDENCE that the person in black had a gun. All you have is a guy with too much time on his hands who saw someone dressed in black at a concert (NOT UNUSUAL) captured on video, who, like everyone else, was probably trying to get the fuck out of there.  </p>

<p>The reason this video is being downvoted or countered is because it&#39;s stupid and alarmist. And this is coming from someone who doesn&#39;t believe anything the government (or media) says because I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s naive to do so.  </p>

<p>There are more important questions to be asked and answered than, &quot;What is this person in black doing here?&quot; The main one being: &quot;How did all those weapons get carried up to that room without arousing suspicion?&quot;</p>

<p>The main one being: &quot;How did all those weapons get carried up to that room without arousing suspicion?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The answer is simple -- most people don&#39;t give a fuck about other people and their stuff when they are concentrating on having a good time, which is what a vacation to Vegas is for most people. </p>

<p>This is the question that the MSM focuses on because real journalism is too hard for the paid teleprompter readers who &quot;deliver&quot; the news. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t really address the whole topic here, but I will provide my perspective, because I&#39;m basically one of the people in that video thread who called out bullshit.</p>

<p>From my point of view, it&#39;s pretty obvious that the context is driving the perception of the evidence, not the other way around. Yes, there is a guy on top of that &quot;trailer&quot;, but that&#39;s all we know. We don&#39;t even know what that trailer is, or if it is even a trailer. The guy gets up from a prone position, in line with everybody else&#39;s pattern of taking cover while shots are going off and running when they aren&#39;t. You can see no firearm on the suspect, you can also hear absolutely zero indication that gunfire comes from his direction after the spotting. In fact the audio suggests the opposite. </p>

<p>Here is what bugs me: like, three comments into the thread and some people have already began to believe what we&#39;re seeing to be evidence, when in reality the context was provided for them and they are just running with it. There are actually narcissistic people participting in the analysis of the LV mass murder who don&#39;t want the truth, they just want to be credited for some sort of discovery. That&#39;s exactly the type of person who I believe put out this video, and to watch people gobble it up is frustrating for me. What do you think outsiders will think when they come here and see shit like that? They will think we&#39;re all but jobs who don&#39;t have the right answers, and more importantly don&#39;t have the right questions. </p>

<p>And so as a result I raise my voice and call bullshit, because topic aside, the delivery and execution of that piece of content reeks of self propagating bullshit. That video is a grasp at straws in the hopes of developing or maintaining some form of relevance for its creator. It&#39;s not about helping people learn the truth. </p>

<p>Just my 2c.</p>
