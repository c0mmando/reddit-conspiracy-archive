       Wouldn't it be paid by Republicans? DNC footed part of Fusion GPS bill after Republicans dropped it when the primaries finished in July, 2016.

       you are talking about the doc where only the weakest claims have been verified &amp; dont really prove anything.  The repubs didnt do anything that we know of yet though there were rumors when it first came out that McCain passed this mostly unverified doc on to intelligence agencies which then used it to get FISA warrants.  The repubs didnt set up a fake meeting to pretend Trump has serious connections to Russia then have the highly respected media org Buzzfeed publish it.

       No I'm talking about the meeting this submission is about. I didn't mention anything about the dossier. Just simply stating the deal happened with Republican payroll over a month before the DNC took over part of the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus the setup and planning was not done by DNC but by Republicans.

       The meeting was with a Russian lawyer who works for a Russian that shares the same legal team that has represented the Clinton foundation since 2003.  It had to happen first so they could claim they had proof of Trumps &amp; Russians.  That Russian hired that Clinton legal team in 2014.

       So the lawyers law firm hired FusionGPS to try and use the media to warn people up to their version of the whole Maginitsky situation, in an effort for the sanctions which are (freezing billions in oligarchs' assets) to be changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Clinton/DNC bankroll oppo research already being done by the firm, originally bankrolled by Republicans during the primaries.

       man, at this point there's no point having any discourse with you. I've tried to in good faith several times but you just seem to ignore the questions I ask (which in this case is literally just to explain the assertion you're making in the title), and bringing up talking points that have nothing to do with the subject at hand. I've tried to remain open minded about stuff you've said but it's difficult when you're not willing to answer any of my questions

       You want to focus on small parts of the entire story so far &amp; i'm asking you to have a conversation about all of it.  For all i know maybe i am missing some steps.  But i have the same problem with anyone who is even a little left on this issue.  The guy who is in charge of the special council in charge of investigating the connections between Trump/Russia helped Russia get Uranium while the Clintons received donations for their role.  Then the clintons paid Fusion GPS for opposition research.  Fusion GPS just happens to represent a Russian who was effected by the Maginitsky Act &amp; shares the same lawyer as the Clinton foundation.  This russian that shares a lawyer with the clintons has his own Russian lawyer that reached out to Don Jr to offer dirt on Hillary &amp; provided nothing.  The shit the Dems have done is FAR worse than anything i've seen thus far that the Trumps have done.  So which part of this timeline do you want to focus on?  Only the part where Don Jr met a Russian?
