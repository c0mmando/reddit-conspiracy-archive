       We know the world is fucked up, but what are we doing about it? I can't speak for everyone, but it's a safe bet that most of us are doing absolutely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's time we get organised and try to bring about real change. That's what I'm interested in. We have enough members to actually make a difference if we start getting involved and make a voice against corruption.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the ways we can do that is by voting or writing letters en masse. Perhaps protesting also.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's make a plan. They can't ignore 500 thousand people.

       Population voted to leave the eu. Its been strung out as long as possible, and now it looks like it won't happen.. My point is, even if you use your vote, its seemingly pointless when it gets over ruled.

       Article 50 isn't going to be revoked. A transition deal was always likely just for sheer pragmatism sake. Assume that every columnist and source is full of shit and agenda pushing and you will find things are bobbing along very much as expected.

       Can't do much more than that without some actual crime involved. Laws will need to be broken to find something incriminating for the NWO or whomever. What I'm saying is even if we had a million people, there would still be 290 million more that don't know what you're talking about and don't care.

       Hard video evidence, paper evidence of an actual imprisonable crime. Not some 360p shit that 90% of people can't see, and not redacted pages that show no actual proof that would hold up in court. This is evidence, and everything else is circumstantial and won't hold up in court alone. That doesn't mean it can't be used, we just need actual hard proof of crime occurring.

       oh we have that...but if anyone expects evidence to be mentioned by the media or addressed by the government, that's been traditionally unrealistic. It's not as if documentation doesn't exist. It's just ignored.

       Same. It will most likely come to that. With the brink of automation upon us, we are facing yet another revolution in production. Historically, technological revolutions such as these have always led to revolt because the displaced citizens become outraged.

       Look into crypto/blockchain. There are many decentralized projects in the works that will be difficult for TPTB to control or manipulate. Buy bitcoin and get involved. Centralized organizations are easy to pevert and any protest you start will be taken over by agent provocateurs. But they cant do that with decentralized organizations.

       That is a possibility, but I don't think so. The current market cap is $100 billion dollars. That's the value of all the bitcoin in the world. Th price goes up an down, and I think the get rich quick moment has passed. If you do buy any bitcoin, just plan on sitting on it for a few years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But looking at the history it has gone up 500% this year alone. As more people get involved the price increases. Now, that is true of any ponzi scheme, so yeah it could all evaporate. But that can happen with dollars too.

       Ok, I'll answer the 4th question first. Go to youtube and search for explanations of bitcoin. Before you spend a dime on this you really need to understand it. Give yourself a full month. Crypto is complicated and its not ready for users who don't understand what they are doing. But its not
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       complicated. You can wrap your head around it, it just takes a little time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you can answer the above questions yourself you will be ready to invest. But I'm not a dick, so I will answer for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Bitcoin is limited. There will only ever be 21 million of them and it is impossible to create them out of thin air. That's why people want to use it. You can't just print more bitcoin. The technical reasons behind this are what you need to learn for yourself in your own time. Don't take my word for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       1a) It is impossible for anyone to seize your bitcoin. They don't exist in some central repository. The feds can make it illegal, but even then it would be near impossible to enforce that.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) You need to protect your bitcoin yourself. Hackers are stealing bitcoin, but only from people who make mistakes. That's why I'm telling you to educate yourself. Otherwise, yes you could get it stolen. If you do things right it will be perfectly safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Bitcoin is divisible to very small amounts. Basically, if subway accepted bitcoin, the cash register would show a QR code. You would scan it with your phone (or watch etc) and your digital wallet would send 0.00003 bitcoins to subway. Currently this is not practical which is why I suggest buying it and then forgetting about it for a few years.

       I believe the strongest message we could send would be to stop paying taxes en' masse. You will do a lot more damage that way than refusing to vote and you will definitely get their attention if you cut off the money supply if even for a short time. We could also all pull all of our money out of the banks. Cut off the funding first.

       That's a good option, but I don't think they'd have a problem putting us in prison if that's the case. In other words, if you stop paying taxes, might as well go full revolution.

       That’s exactly how revolutions get started which is why instead of going to the polls or “Occupying Wall Street” it any of these other bullshit protests, on April 15th, all the people who would have voted for someone like Sanders, instead took to the streets and said we aren’t paying taxes until this shit gets fixed, they can’t lock everyone up. That’s a few million people.

       Hard video evidence, paper evidence of an actual imprisonable crime. Not some 360p shit that 90% of people can't see, and not redacted pages that show no actual proof that would hold up in court. This is evidence, and everything else is circumstantial and won't hold up in court alone. That doesn't mean it can't be used, we just need actual hard proof of crime occurring.

       So we need to decide what we stand for and start writing about that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I vote we tackle the federal reserve and the fight for internet freedom (represented by The USA Liberty Act, SOPA, and similar).
      </p>
      <p>
       If we just group together for those two issues, we can actually make a difference instead of circlejerking each other on the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's how we do it: We need to keep track of laws which relate to issues we care about, keep track of who votes for what laws, and write them letters. Vote bad lawmakers out of government. Support Bitcoin as a legal tender. Stuff like that will make a huge difference.
