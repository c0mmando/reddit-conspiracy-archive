    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more than certain you can&#39;t prove that there wasn&#39;t. People died that night. This wasn&#39;t a hoax. The sooner people like get your head out of your ass the sooner we can start looking for who and the why. Because all this bs trying to prove it a hoax or if Campos gained weight, or why is a tour chopper in the air blah blah is just distracting from the main questions. You don&#39;t believe anyone died...well, hop on a plane, train or in an automobile and head on out to Vegas and tell people that lives through it that it didn&#39;t happen. Unless you are willing to do that...stop disrespecting people who lost someone or was injured. No one is going to parade around a loved one they lost or who was injured just to prove to a simple minded person that they were in fact shot. All you would do is either swear they were lying and were in on a &quot;hoax&quot; too. This type of mentality is the exact reason victims will not speak up.</p>
