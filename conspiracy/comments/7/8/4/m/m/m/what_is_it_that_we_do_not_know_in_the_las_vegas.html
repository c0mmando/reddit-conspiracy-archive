       I'm more than certain you can't prove that there wasn't. People died that night. This wasn't a hoax. The sooner people like get your head out of your ass the sooner we can start looking for who and the why. Because all this bs trying to prove it a hoax or if Campos gained weight, or why is a tour chopper in the air blah blah is just distracting from the main questions. You don't believe anyone died...well, hop on a plane, train or in an automobile and head on out to Vegas and tell people that lives through it that it didn't happen. Unless you are willing to do that...stop disrespecting people who lost someone or was injured. No one is going to parade around a loved one they lost or who was injured just to prove to a simple minded person that they were in fact shot. All you would do is either swear they were lying and were in on a "hoax" too. This type of mentality is the exact reason victims will not speak up.

       So, you haven't seen the videos? You didn't see the injured and dead on the ground? You haven't watched any interviews? Fact is, you have been shown plenty of evidence. You just to not accept it. Nothing any could show would make you. I am NOT going to ask the people I know to provide proof so that assholes like you can add insult to injury. You can believe what you want but you are a part of the problem not the solution.

       That isn't the fault of the victims. You can either find justice for these people or you can act like they don't exist. But as long as you do that...all your going to search for is a hoax and you are wasting ur time.

       Next time you want to try to prove a point...look up info directly regarding the hotel or issue in question. There are only 4 hotels on the Vegas strip that have hallway cameras and MB isn't one of them.

       Maybe not in the hallways. But I guarantee that there'll be video of him entering the lobby, checking in, stuff like that. There's no way the desk doesn't have a camera. And what about the parking lot? My point is not where the cameras are. It's that they are holding on to the video. In the police audio tapes they are referring to the officers in the video room. What do you think that was?

       All you said was the corridors and then posted and article about hallway cameras. There has never been a question about video in other areas. The police have it. They even said they did. But they won't release it with an ongoing investigation.
