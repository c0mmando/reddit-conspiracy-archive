    <div class="md"><p>I mean, releasing the files are going to do nothing simply because of people with your line of reasoning.</p>

<p>If the files don&#39;t corroborate your theory, then they&#39;re just a false narrative pushed by the government.</p>

<p>If they do corroborate your theory, then what? How does that make them any more real? The chances that they&#39;re pushing a false narrative are still the same.</p>

<p>It&#39;s literally just confirmation bias at that point. You have an answer and you&#39;re only seeking out whatever evidence that supports that answer and ignoring any that doesn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The issue is that, since day one, there has been enough circumstantial evidence to paint a pretty clear picture of, at least, who had to be involved, primarily due to the route of the parade and the security in Dallas that day. Not to mention plenty of motive. And some of those fingers point to the federal government of the united states.       </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/GSw9sjqYK_I">This is a clipped scene from Oliver Stones Movie, JFK</a> I would really recommend watching the entire film, or at least all the scenes with Sutherland in them, as they pose some of the most important questions to the JFK assassination...most important, because some of them really only have one answer...which is why we can confidently say that parts of the united states federal government were involved. JFK is one of the best movies ever made. My only real criticism is Oliver Stones avoidance of discussing possible Federal Reserve, Zionist Israel ties to anything. But i get it....     </p>

<p>So I get what you are saying about confirmation bias, but there ARE things we know without needing confirmation from the very government that was involved. But yeah, I&#39;m not really interested in the files because of their source...Quite honestly, I&#39;m not really interested in the JFK assassination so much simply because i know that the people involved will never be brought up on charges for it and because, I think, a pretty clear picture, though still a picture without fine detail, has been painted about what happened.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, I know that if there is legitimately something to hide, then it&#39;ll be hidden. Especially if it&#39;s still pertinent to stuff going on today.</p>

<p>So, logically, if that <em>is</em> true (without saying one way or the other if it is), the files will say nothing interesting.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the possibility there&#39;s nothing going on at all. So logically, if <em>that</em> is true (once again, no value judgement just for the sake of), the files will say nothing interesting.</p>

<p>And if the files say something interesting, if you want to be consistent with a distrust of the government, you&#39;ll have to consider that it&#39;s a lie. So if it agrees with some theory, we&#39;d have to consider that that theory is wrong. This is the toughest one because the people who were skeptical will get proven wrong and it&#39;s a time for the champions of that theory to crow. But those same champions have to ask themselves why would the government be honest now? Just because they said they would be? That&#39;s their conundrum.</p>

<p>And there&#39;s the additional factor of the next level thinking. Publishing the &quot;true&quot; account counting on the more distrustful to dismiss whatever narrative it contains that way they can sort of hide the truth in plain sight.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the possibility there&#39;s nothing going on at all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No..that is literally not a possibility. There was a conspiracy to assassinate the president. And because of the circumstances surrounding that assassination, the federal government HAD to be involved (granted, probably not the ENTIRE FG, but members of it...). The only details we are missing are some of the who, some of the how and some of the why.       </p>

<p>Honestly, the ONLY reason these missing details would be released to the public now would be if TPTB had been defeated, or if they were released by TPTB to gain our trust, to then have that trust used against us. But honestly, I really don&#39;t think we will learn anything of value. We will most likely get jerked around with complete fairy tales or get bits and pieces of truths that we already knew....but very probably, never the whole picture.     </p>

<p>But in the end, it really doesn&#39;t matter because we already have a basic picture of what happened that can&#39;t be logically disputed by anyone. If this was a trial, we would have enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that some...american governmental institutions were involved in the assassination and coverup... sure it would be great to have the whole truth, but we simply do not have the means to reliably get all that information, and save a divine miracle, we never will.</p>

<p>fair enough.      </p>

<p>Also worth considering that there would be no reason to have a paper trail that would expose the details of the assassination. And even if there was one, TPTB have had like 54 years to destroy such a paper trail. </p>
