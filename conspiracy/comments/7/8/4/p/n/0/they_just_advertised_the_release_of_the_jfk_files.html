       I'm just considering the source of the documents. The government is never going to release all the information they have on the jfk assassination, because it would implement them too much.

       It could show it being someone other than that as well. Which is saying we will never know. The release is being publicized and I think that’s for a reason.

       You never know, it could turn out that they accidentally forget to redact something or release a file that was supposed to be destroyed, leading to a small amount of useful information being discovered. Most likely scenario is probably that all the released files will have nothing, and everyone wastes their time trying to find any new useful information.

       I agree with this. Since JFK is one of the most popular, what better way to discredit all other theories and make us look crazy, then by giving us nothing in the files.

       I mean, releasing the files are going to do nothing simply because of people with your line of reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the files don't corroborate your theory, then they're just a false narrative pushed by the government.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they do corroborate your theory, then what? How does that make them any more real? The chances that they're pushing a false narrative are still the same.

       It's literally just confirmation bias at that point. You have an answer and you're only seeking out whatever evidence that supports that answer and ignoring any that doesn't.

       The issue is that, since day one, there has been enough circumstantial evidence to paint a pretty clear picture of, at least, who had to be involved, primarily due to the route of the parade and the security in Dallas that day. Not to mention plenty of motive. And some of those fingers point to the federal government of the united states.

        This is a clipped scene from Oliver Stones Movie, JFK
       </a>
       I would really recommend watching the entire film, or at least all the scenes with Sutherland in them, as they pose some of the most important questions to the JFK assassination...most important, because some of them really only have one answer...which is why we can confidently say that parts of the united states federal government were involved. JFK is one of the best movies ever made. My only real criticism is Oliver Stones avoidance of discussing possible Federal Reserve, Zionist Israel ties to anything. But i get it....
      </p>
      <p>
       So I get what you are saying about confirmation bias, but there ARE things we know without needing confirmation from the very government that was involved. But yeah, I'm not really interested in the files because of their source...Quite honestly, I'm not really interested in the JFK assassination so much simply because i know that the people involved will never be brought up on charges for it and because, I think, a pretty clear picture, though still a picture without fine detail, has been painted about what happened.

       I mean, I know that if there is legitimately something to hide, then it'll be hidden. Especially if it's still pertinent to stuff going on today.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, logically, if that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       true (without saying one way or the other if it is), the files will say nothing interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the possibility there's nothing going on at all. So logically, if
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is true (once again, no value judgement just for the sake of), the files will say nothing interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if the files say something interesting, if you want to be consistent with a distrust of the government, you'll have to consider that it's a lie. So if it agrees with some theory, we'd have to consider that that theory is wrong. This is the toughest one because the people who were skeptical will get proven wrong and it's a time for the champions of that theory to crow. But those same champions have to ask themselves why would the government be honest now? Just because they said they would be? That's their conundrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's the additional factor of the next level thinking. Publishing the "true" account counting on the more distrustful to dismiss whatever narrative it contains that way they can sort of hide the truth in plain sight.

       No..that is literally not a possibility. There was a conspiracy to assassinate the president. And because of the circumstances surrounding that assassination, the federal government HAD to be involved (granted, probably not the ENTIRE FG, but members of it...). The only details we are missing are some of the who, some of the how and some of the why.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, the ONLY reason these missing details would be released to the public now would be if TPTB had been defeated, or if they were released by TPTB to gain our trust, to then have that trust used against us. But honestly, I really don't think we will learn anything of value. We will most likely get jerked around with complete fairy tales or get bits and pieces of truths that we already knew....but very probably, never the whole picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the end, it really doesn't matter because we already have a basic picture of what happened that can't be logically disputed by anyone. If this was a trial, we would have enough evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that some...american governmental institutions were involved in the assassination and coverup... sure it would be great to have the whole truth, but we simply do not have the means to reliably get all that information, and save a divine miracle, we never will.

       fair enough.

       Also worth considering that there would be no reason to have a paper trail that would expose the details of the assassination. And even if there was one, TPTB have had like 54 years to destroy such a paper trail.

       Umm, no. There is not going to be anything in these files that does anything to discredit the narrative. If there were, it would be blacked out like it always is.

       Sorry to tell you, but Trump isn't looking out for the common man. He's made a career out if telling people what they want to hear and then screwing them over. He doesn't even have a reference of what the common man experiences.

       I've seemed to notice it more in the wake of Las Vegas. It seems as though more people then ever are questioning the narrative. I think they are making a mockery so people will feel as though they will look foolish if they consider any of these alternate theories.

       When their veil of secrecy is shredded and they can no longer rely on a phony cover story to misinform the public, they resort to admitting—sometimes even volunteering—some of the truth while still managing to withhold the key and damaging facts in the case. The public, however, is usually so intrigued by the new information that it never thinks to pursue the matter further.

       You do realize that the term "Conspiracy Theory" was invented, in about 1965, by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in order to ridicule anyone wanting the truth about President John Fitzgerald Kennedy's assassination. So, indirectly, the name of this very subreddit was given by the CIA.

       Blehhh who even cares at this point. There will be tons of redactions and barely any mention of the CIA or Bush Sr., if any. Not to mention the Zapruder Film is literally 3 different films spliced together with both splices happening right before the shots were fired

       They will not release anything that will implicate people that are still alive today. We will be left with an unfinished (but polished to look complete at a glance) narrative - and when we question it we will be labelled as loonies.

       I don't believe in conspiracies either, but after watching a History Channel documentary I saw that some details in the JFK Assassination could lead to people believing there is more to the story.

       'milder ones'? Like what? And are they exclusive from the type of crime?
Reason I'm asking is that you're being a bit vague, for even mainstream accepted theories can still be conspiracy theories that aren't plausible.

       I kept getting this odd commercial during football on CBS. The commercial was informing the public that  it is up to us to do what we have to do, to get trump out of office. That the people must go above the government to ensure our nation's survival. I just felt like those commercials are getting pretty aggressive in  their message.

       I believe the new "official narrative" will be that Oswald worked for the Russians. The CIA knew, but kept it quiet to maintain world peace.
Heroic Gov. turned the other cheek to save the world from nuclear war.

       It's theater. Do people

       think the CIA is going to release anything that actually incriminates them? Get fucking real. This is distraction theater for plebs. Period.

       I personally dont need the jfk-files to know what happened.. just count 1 + 1 together..
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        the videos show jfk was shot from the front (Oswald was behind)
       </li>
       <li>
        the way the gov/cia acted to close the case asap.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       And now we are waiting for the killer to come forward with files to prove himself beeing guilty

       None of them realized that football players weren't even on the field for the anthem until 2009, when the DoD started paying millions to sports organizations for patriotic displays.

       It could show it being someone other than that as well. Which is saying we will never know. The release is being publicized and I think that’s for a reason.

       'milder ones'? Like what? And are they exclusive from the type of crime?
Reason I'm asking is that you're being a bit vague, for even mainstream accepted theories can still be conspiracy theories that aren't plausible.
