        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Okay, I might be completely misinterpreting what MKULTRA is, but I have been reading about ElsaGate and PizzaGate and I see many people here saying that it something to do with making kids/teens desensitized to things like murder, sex, etc.</p>

<p>If I am wrong, correct me. I’m 17, born in 2000 and watched a few shows mentioned here, (Disney Channel, icarly, etc) Anyways, I think people my age are completely desensitized to child predators and rape and molestation (all that stuff). I say this, because I’m guessing most people on here are adults and almost everyone seems so angry with pedophiles and they absolutely hate the act. Which of course, is how people should feel about it.</p>

<p>But I don’t see a problem with it. I have tried for the last 2 hours to find something wrong with pedophiles, but I can’t. I have no reaction towards people who do things like that. I’m just like, “Oh well”. </p>

<p>I’ve asked multiple kids in my grade, both guys and girls, asking how they feel about it. They don’t have any reaction either. Maybe it’s because we don’t have kids but every single person I’ve texted couldn’t care less. They weren’t supporting it, but they weren’t against it. </p>

<p>I asked my parents the same kinds of questions I asked my friends, and they replied like all of you would. They think all pedophiles should burn in hell, be killed, and they think it’s so wrong on so many levels. </p>

<p>I then asked my sister who is 21, born in 1996 the same questions and she was against it, but not as much as my parents. </p>

<p>Maybe it’s normalized in TV and society, but no one I asked my age could find anything wrong with pedophiles, rapists, etc other than what everyone older than us thinks. It just seems normal to all of us.</p>

<p>I could be sorely mistaken in thinking I’m a product of MKULTRA, this could just show how far we have fallen in society and how many awful things seem normal to the younger generation.</p>

<p>If anyone has any insight on why people my age might think like this, please let me know!</p>

<p>Edit: Let me be clear, I would never be a pedophile or had any kind of urge to whatsoever, I could never. I know it’s wrong, but I can’t find a problem with others doing it. Even someone who’s 15 and a year younger is gross to me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I dont think thats what MKULTRA is lol its not like your parents strapped you in a chair, dosed you with drugs and forced you to watch Disney haha</p>

<p>Its more like pedophiles teaching kids its ok to be sexual at a young age. The thing isnt the sex or even sex with older people. Its about children being sold as sex slaves and sacrificing their future for a perverts pleasure. You may not realize it but the desensitization towards this has a lot of negative long term repercussions. Because if you feels that way, how will your kids think? Sex with adults should be the last thing on a childs mind. You basically give up yoir childhood. </p>

<p>Do you think it would be ok for you to have sex with a 12 year old?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re absolutely right about that. MKULTRA has tentacles that extend across most everything in mainstream media, &quot;counter-culture&quot;(which is a ruse, bc it&#39;s also mainstream), and so many other places it&#39;s hard to see where it is and isn&#39;t playing out.   </p>

<p>The main problem I have with pedophilia is the rape/torture, the suffering, and especially the infringement on free will. I find it insane that your generation doesn&#39;t have a problem with it, but society has been made insane, so it doesn&#39;t surprise me. Normalization is exactly the goal, these creeps at the top are having trouble staying hidden because of the physical representation of collected consciousness we&#39;ve come to know as the internet is causing people to see through their thin facades, so the next step is normalization so they won&#39;t end up with their heads on spikes. </p>

I was born in 1994 so not too far ahead of you, but I still notice how things changed. It could be your age as well, when I was at college conspiracy theories didn&#39;t interest me so much (wasnt really aware of them) but I liked to rebel against the system, which is what led me to become interested in conspiracies later on in life </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s just people who haven&#39;t experienced truly evil folks just act like no one would be that cruel and it only exists in Law and Order SVU tv shows. Ask a rape victim your age and see how they reply. I bet you&#39;ll see you&#39;re probably asking folks who are sheltered and that&#39;s why you get the &quot;meh it&#39;s ok&quot; replies. If you asked if someone molested their kid they would react way differently. People don&#39;t care unless it affects them directly. Most folks are completely shallow and selfish.</p>

I&#39;m 17 too, I watched a lot of Nickelodeon when I was little the thing is I don&#39;t feel the same way about pedophiles than you do.
I mean age of consent ? Rape ? Being 13 ? This is just wrong! Stop watching TV damn! Tell yourself the elites don&#39;t want your well-being, they are going to take advantage of you every possible way they can think of. Also I don&#39;t really know if mkultra is -just brainwashing in general or the thing where you brainwash people with drugs and torture in order to make them do whatever...</p>

But I think one of the other commenters got it spot on, I have an elementary understanding of pedos. I just read about the stuff with Dan Schnieder and idk, I feel like he abused these kids why didn’t they just leave? Like is their job in Hollywood that important? Parents even know about it? Maybe that’s why I don’t care that much, the kids who might’ve been abused didn’t do anything </p>

    <div class="md"><p>IMO, we have all been affected by MKULTRA, to some extent. Each younger generation (not meaning everyone) may be less sensitized than the previous one, our culture is &#39;programmed&#39;, so ppl go along w/the flow; it can&#39;t be helped due to media &amp; new tech. </p>

<p>Everyone is different. I&#39;d like to think if we&#39;ve been negatively &#39;programmed&#39; (by outside forces) we can also &#39;deprogram&#39; ourselves (anything &#39;learned&#39; can be edited, over time). Whether this is done &#39;consciously&#39;; by figuring it out ourselves &amp; doing the work or b/c of a life changing event.</p>

<p>Of course a parent (a &quot;good&quot; one) is going to be repulsed, as most ppl are, I think. Maybe it&#39;s because you don&#39;t really comprehend what exactly it &#39;means&#39;. You&#39;re not a parent/guardian, you may not know anyone that&#39;s been assaulted, maybe no one close to you has been hurt in a violent way. A stranger can&#39;t judge whether or not you&#39;re an &#39;uncaring&#39; person with issues.</p>

<p>What I think: if <em>your</em> response concerns <em>you</em>, then you should check it out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s trauma, have you ever suffered a trauma ? It&#39;s juste like when you&#39;re alone at home and you here people downstairs, the thing you should do is go downstairs and check (this is = to leaving/ doing something about it) do you don&#39;t, I mean ... This is not a perfect example, but do you get what I mean ? When you&#39;re going through a traumatic event you might handle things differently but some just stay petrified by fear</p>
