Let’s take a look at some other notable patriots and men of courage  (<em>excluding Hoover</em>) who attempted the same:</p>

<p>It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am. The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of seperation). That Individuals of them may… actually had a  [sic] of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned.”</p>

<p>George Washington.
(First US President)</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>A power has risen up in the government greater than the people themselves, consisting of many and various powerful interests, combined in one mass, and held together by the cohesive power of the vast surplus in banks.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>John C Cahoun
(Vice President 1825-1832)</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people.  To destroy this invisible government, to befoul the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt 
(26th President of the US)</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Since I entered politics, I have chiefly had men’s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something.  They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.” – </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Woodrow Wilson
(28th President of the US)</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The real menace of our Republic is the invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities, states and nation… The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both parties, … and control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country. They use the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government. It operates under cover of a self-created screen [and] seizes our executive officers, legislative bodies, schools, courts, newspapers and every agency created for the public protection</p>

<p>John F Hylan, New York City Mayor</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Today the path to total dictatorship in the U.S. can be laid by strictly legal means… We have a well-organized political-action group in this country, determined to destroy our Constitution and establish a one-party state… It operates secretly, silently, continuously to transform our Government… This ruthless power-seeking elite is a disease of our century… This group…is answerable neither to the President, the Congress, nor the court</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Senator William Jenner 
1954</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The individual is handicapped by coming face-to-face with a conspiracy so monstrous he cannot believe it exists. The American mind simply has not come to a realization of the evil which has been introduced into our midst. It rejects even the assumption that human creatures could espouse a philosophy which must ultimately destroy all that is good and decent.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>J Edgar Hoover
1956</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings… Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe… no war ever posed a greater threat to our security. If you are awaiting a finding of “clear and present danger,” then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent… For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence–on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.”</p>

<p>John F Kennedy 
35th President of the US</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Rockefellers and their allies have, for at least fifty years, been carefully following a plan to use their economic power to gain political control of first America, and then the rest of the world.  Do I mean conspiracy? Yes, I do. I am convinced there is such a plot, international in scope, generations old in planning, and incredibly evil in intent.” </p>

<p>Congressman Larry P. McDonald, 
 1975</p>

<p>And they conduct the hot wars too:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/hidden-history-the-secret-origins-of-the-first-world-war/5600090">Hidden History: The Secret Origins of the First World War </a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Of the many myths that befog the modern political mind, none is so corrupting of the understanding or so incongruent with historical fact as the notion that the wealthy and the powerful do not conspire.</p>

<p>They do.</p>

<p><strong>They conspire continually, habitually, effectively, diabolically and on a scale that beggars the imagination.</strong>To deny this conspiracy fact is to deny both overwhelming empirical evidence and elementary reason.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, for the astute observer of the ‘Great Game’ of politics, it is an unending source of wonderment to stumble across ever more astounding examples of the monstrous machinations of which wealthy and powerful elites are capable. Indeed, it is precisely here that authors Docherty and Macgregor enter the fray and threaten to take our breath away entirely.</p>

<p><strong>Thus, the official, canonized history of the origins of the First World War, so they tell us, is one long, unmitigated lie from start to finish.</strong> Even more to the conspiratorial point is the authors’ thesis that – and to paraphrase a later Churchill who figures prominently in this earlier story – never were so many murdered, so needlessly, for the ambitions and profit of so few.</p>

<p>In demolishing the many shibboleths surrounding the origins of the ‘Great War’ (including ‘German responsibility’, ‘British peace efforts‘, ‘Belgian neutrality’ and the ‘inevitability’ of the war), Docherty and Macgregor point the finger at what they argue is the real source of the conflict: a more or less secret cabal of British imperialists whose entire political existence for a decade and a half was dedicated to the fashioning of a European war in aid of destroying the British Empire’s newly emerging commercial, industrial and military competitor, Germany.</p>

<p>In short, <strong>far from “sleepwalking into a global tragedy, the unsuspecting world”, Docherty and Macgregor contend, “was ambushed by a secret cabal of warmongers” originating not in Berlin, but “in London”.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>Any time I have seen this speech by JFK posted, they come out of the woodwork to try to claim he was referring to communism.  It’s actually kind of hilarious that they don’t see how obvious they are.</p>

<p>It’s also hilarious that they don’t seem to understand that TPTB have rewritten history before, and they are trying to do it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah, i always heard a few snippets of the JFK speech as evidence he was speaking out against the Illuminati or the CIA. I watched the entire thing for myself, and it&#39;s an incredible example of doublespeak. He says that no democracy should ask for censorship of the press, but then goes on to ask for exactly that. It is literally pro-censorship:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I do ask every publisher, every editor, and every newsman in the nation to reexamine his own standards, and to recognize the nature of our country&#39;s peril. In time of war, the government and the press have customarily joined in an effort based largely on self-discipline, to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy. In time of &quot;clear and present danger,&quot; the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public&#39;s need for national security.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And it goes on and on like that. Talking about how the enemy brags of getting intel from the newspapers, and how they should be more self-censoring as a matter of national duty. </p>

<p>And, mayyybe he was talking about the Illuminati and secret societies, but he sure makes it sound like he&#39;s talking about Communism...</p>

<p>It is really kind of a joke... it goes something like, the difference between us and them is that they use brute government censorship.  While we do this in war time, there is not going to be a declaration of war, but you better act like we are in a war, and self-censor. </p>

<p>This is not true. Some anti government forces were financed in order to destabilize the Russian empire during the 1st World War.  No one expected a successful revolution, nor did they expect foreign investments to be jeopardized, that is why multiple nations sent troops into Russia to fight on behalf of the Whites, including the US. </p>

<p>Here is the full quote</p>

<blockquote>

complex life of their own there. My wife was building a nest,
and the children had new friends. The closest was the chauffeur
of Dr. M. The doctor&#39;s wife took my wife and the boys out
driving, and was very kind to them. But she was a mere mortal,
whereas the chauffeur was a magician, a titan, a superman I
With a wave of his hand, he made the machine obey his slightest
command. To sit beside him was the supreme delight.
When they went into a tea-room, the boys would anxiously demand
of their mother, &quot;Why doesn&#39;t the chauffeur come in?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From this it does not follow that Dr. M is a banker, it certainly does not follow a banker financed Trotsky&#39;s passage to the US, Trotsky complained about the price and accommodations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The doors of Europe shut behind me in Barcelona. The police
put me and my family on board the Spanish Transatlantic Company&#39;s
steamer Monserrat, which delivered its live and dead cargo
at New York after seventeen days. Seventeen days! The time
would have seemed tempting in the days of Christopher Columbus,
whose monument towers over the harbor at Barcelona. But
the sea was very rough at this time of the year, and our boat did
everything to remind us of the frailty of human life. The M onserrat
was an old tub little suited for ocean voyages. But during
the war the neutral Spanish flag lessened the chances of being
sunk. The Spanish company charged high fares, and provided
bad accommodations and even worse food. .</p>

<p>Just hoping no one would go back and actually read the link?</p>

<p>&quot;This amazing story begins with the war between Russia and Japan in 1904. Jacob Schiff, who was head of the New York investment firm Kuhn, Loeb and Company, had raised the capital for large war loans to Japan. It was due to this funding that the Japanese were able to launch a stunning attack against the Russians at Port Arthur and the following year to virtually decimate the Russian fleet. In 1905 the Mikado awarded Jacob Schiff a medal, the Second Order of the Treasure of Japan, in recognition of his important role in that campaign.</p>

<p>Jacob Schiff was head of the New York investment firm Kuhn, Loeb and Co. He was one of the principal backers of the Bolshevik revolution and personally financed Trotsky&#39;s trip from New York to Russia. He was a major contributor to Woodrow Wilson&#39;s presidential campaign and an advocate for passage of the Federal Reserve Act. (p. 210) During the two years of hostilities thousands of Russian soldiers and sailors were taken as prisoners. Sources outside of Russia, which were hostile to the Tsarist regime, paid for the printing of Marxist propaganda and had it delivered to the prison camps. Russian-speaking revolutionaries were trained in New York and sent to distribute the pamphlets among the prisoners and to indoctrinate them into rebellion against their own government. When the war was ended, these officers and enlisted men returned home to become virtual seeds of treason against the Tsar. They were to play a major role a few years later in creating mutiny among the military during the Communist takeover of Russia.&quot;</p>

<p>TROTSKY WAS A MULTIPLE AGENT</p>

<p>One of the best known Russian revolutionaries at that time was Leon Trotsky. In January of 1916 Trotsky was expelled from France and came to the United States. It has been claimed that his expenses were paid by Jacob Schiff. There is no documentation to substantiate that claim, but the circumstantial evidence does point to a wealthy donor in New York. He remained for several months, while writing for a Russian socialist paper, the Novy Mir (New World) and giving revolutionary speeches at mass meetings in New York City. According to Trotsky himself, on many occasions a chauffeured limousine was placed at his service by a wealthy friend, identified as Dr. M. In his book, My Life, Trotsky wrote:</p>

<p>The doctor&#39;s wife took my wife and the boys out driving and was very kind to them. But she was a mere mortal, whereas the chauffeur was a magician, a titan, a superman! With the wave of his hand he made the machine obey his slightest command. To sit beside him was the supreme delight. When they went into a tea room, the boys would anxiously demand of their mother, &quot;Why doesn&#39;t the chauffeur come in?&quot; (Leon Trotsky: My Life, New York publisher: Scribner&#39;s, 1930, p. 277)</p>

<p>Here is Pipes in his book on the Russian Revolution:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Either just before or immediately after the start of the war, he
entered into a relationship with an agency of the Austrian Government,
the Union for the Liberation of the Ukraine, which in return for his
support of Ukrainian national aspirations paid him subsidies and assisted
his revolutionary activities.116 The Union received funds from both
Vienna and Berlin and operated under the supervision of the Austrian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. One of the people involved in its activities
was Parvus, who in 1917 would play a critical part in securing Lenin
passage through Germany to revolutionary Russia.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To read  a dissenting view on this question there is the following article:</p>

<p>Which brings us back to your claims... which is of the following form.</p>

<p>schiff was a jewish banker that funded the japanese troops against the russians.</p>

<p>We have no evidence that Trotsky was funded by the bankers, but we can speculate, I mean they are jewish amiright</p>

<p>There is a piece where Trotsky states his kids rode in a car with a chauffeur, therefore he was funded by the bankers...</p>

<p>There is no valid inference that you made.</p>

<p>Moreover, you did not actually read the JFK speech. Because if you did,it would be clear that he is toeing the CIA line about the Soviet Union... </p>

<p>Here is the full speech: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMbmdFOvTs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdMbmdFOvTs</a></p>

<p>Here is the full transcript: <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/American-Newspaper-Publishers-Association_19610427.aspx">https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/American-Newspaper-Publishers-Association_19610427.aspx</a></p>

<p>The date and location of the speech:</p>

<p>Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York City April 27, 1961</p>

<p>That was a speech right after the Bay of Pigs invasion.</p>

<p>April 17, 1961 – April 19, 1961</p>

<p>Where the USA tried to launch a full scale invasion of Cuba, and it failed because the Soviets and Cubans knew they were going to attack. And the invading forces were badly outnumbered.</p>

<p>It was a monumental failure on the part of the USA. </p>

<p>This speech is him talking to the press after the failed invasion, and basically asking them to keep certain machinations and movements of the US government secret from the citizens.</p>

<p>The Bay of Pigs invasion failure it what prompted him to say what he did. To quote his speech directly:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger. <strong>The events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some; but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years</strong>. Whatever our hopes may be for the future--<strong>for reducing this threat or living with it</strong>--there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security--a challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every sphere of human activity.</p>

<p><strong>This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements</strong> of direct concern both to the press and to the President--two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be reconciled and fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril. I refer, <strong>first, to the need for a far greater public information; and, second, to the need for far greater official secrecy</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So right there he is asking the press for greater official secrecy. Then he goes on about how we are opposed to secret oaths, proceedings, and societies. And to quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>The very word &quot;secrecy&quot; is repugnant in a free and open society</strong>; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. And no official of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.</p>

<p><strong>But I do ask every publisher, every editor, and every newsman in the nation to reexamine his own standards</strong>, and <strong>to recognize the nature of our country&#39;s peril</strong>. In time of war, the government and the press have customarily joined in an effort based largely on self-discipline, <strong>to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy</strong>. In time of &quot;clear and present danger,&quot; the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public&#39;s need for national security.</p>
</blockquote>

<h1>TO PREVENT UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES TO THE ENEMY.</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Today no war has been declared--and however fierce the struggle may be, it may never be declared in the traditional fashion. Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe. The survival of our friends is in danger. And yet no war has been declared, no borders have been crossed by marching troops, no missiles have been fired.</p>

<p><strong>If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security</strong>. If you are awaiting a finding of &quot;clear and present danger,&quot; then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent.</p>

<p>“What could I have said that would have helped the situation at all? That we took the beating of our lives? That the CIA and the Pentagon are Stupid? What purpose do they think it would serve to put that on the record?”
He shook his head. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to straighten all this out, and
publishers have to understand that we&#39;re never more than a miscalculation away from war and that there are things were doing that we just can&#39;t talk about.&#39;
I then made a suggestion to the President that I would later regret. He was to speak six days later, on April 27, to the Bureau of Advertising of the American Newspaper Publishers Association at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.
&quot;Why not lay it on the line there?&quot; I said. &quot;It&#39;s a major forum and the timing will punch up the importance you assign to it. It could open up the whole area to serious discussion.&quot;
He agreed to do it and told me to relay my thinking on content to Ted Sorensen, who would write the speech. I gave Ted a long memo summarizing the freedom of information conflict between past Presidents and the press and outlining the steps we had taken to open up channels of information. He drafted a brilliant argument in support of the President&#39;s position, and one that will be as valid in the year so&amp; as it was in 1961. It began with an admonition to the press that it must recognize &quot;our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger: the totality of the Communist challenge to our survival and to our security .. . &quot;This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements of direct concern both to the press and to the President—two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril.

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wait there&#39;s more (Muy Communism for you) &quot;If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security. If you are awaiting a finding of &#39;clear and present danger,&#39; then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent.
&quot;It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions—by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence—on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific, and political operations.
&quot;Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the cold war, in short, with a wartime discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.
&quot;Nevertheless, every democracy recognizes the necessary restraints of national security—and the question remains whether those restraints need to be more strictly observed if we are to oppose this kind of attack as well as outright invasion. For the facts of the matter are that this nation&#39;s foes have openly boasted of acquiring through our newspapers information they would otherwise hire agents to acquire through theft, bribery, or espionage; that details of this nation&#39;s covert preparations to counter the enemy&#39;s covert operations have been available to every newspaper reader, friend and foe alike; that the size, the strength, the location, and the nature of our forces and weapons, and our plans and strategy for their use, have all been pin-pointed in the press and other news media to a degree sufficient to satisfy any foreign power; and that, in at least one case, the publication of details concerning a secret mechanism whereby satellites were followed required its alteration at the expense of considerable time and money.
&quot;The newspapers which printed these stories were loyal, patriotic: responsible, and well-meaning. Had we been engaged in open war, they undoubtedly would not have published such items. But in absence of open warfare, they recognized only the tests of journalism and not the tests of national security. And my question tonight is whether additional tests should not now be adopted. 
&quot;Every newspaper now asks itself, with respect to every story: ‘Is it news?’ All I suggest is that you add the question: ‘Is it in the interests of national security?...And should the press of America consider and recommend the voluntary assumption of specific new steps or machinery, I can assure you that we will cooperate whole-hardly with those recommendations…”
The reaction was violent. The press chose to ignore the content of the speech and to regard its timing—eleven days after the Bay of Pigs—as a presidential scolding for its pre-invasion reports on the training of the rebel brigade and the imminence of the landings. JFK was accused, in effect, of blaming the press for the outcome of the operation. Angry editorials across the country read into his speech a forewarning of official censorship or, at the very least, a demand for self-censorship. Still others took him to task for not revealing to the nation the full picture of our relations with Cuba. If he had, their argument went, he could have built public support for active American intervention at the Bay of Pigs, thus assuring the success of the invasion.
One of the most thoughtful, and least strident, of the editorials criticizing JFK ran in the Raleigh (North Carolina) News and Observer, Editor Jonathan Daniels wrote me: &quot;I don&#39;t think any editor in America has been more enthusiastic in his support of President Kennedy and his program than I have been. I am eager to help in the things I believe he can do for America and the world. But, quite frankly, I was deeply dis¬turbed by his remarks to the publishers in New York . . .&quot;
His editorial led off with the comment: &quot;. . . President Kennedy could not have chosen a worse time to lecture the press for a lack of &#39;self-restraint&#39; in printing the news. His remarks to American publishers came hot on the heels of disclosures that, unknown to the press and the public, this country has been involved in a military adventure which not only cost the lives of many of our friends but also made this nation look both hypocritical and ineffectual in the eyes of the world.
&quot;Undoubtedly, where a free press exists in a free country, facts may be published which will carry information to an enemy in whose country a strictly censored press keeps much hidden from the people and the world. Freedom does involve dangers which totalitarianism can avoid. And even in a free country dangers may sometimes justify the suppression or censor¬ship of news. When and where that is necessary, the American press has shown that it will cooperate. No owners or operators of the news media, however, have any right—let alone any `duty&#39;—to decide what the people should know . . . President Kennedy should be thinking more about how the free, informed American people can contribute to the struggle, not how &#39;greater official secrecy&#39; can be imposed upon them with
the connivance of reporters and officials together . . .&quot;</p>

<p>Daniels is one of America&#39;s great editors but even he was unwilling to
enter into a dialogue with the President on how a free society can protect itself from its enemies and, at the same time, protect the people&#39;s right to know what their government is doing.
I had given JFK bad advice. The timing of his remarks, as Daniels wrote, could not have been worse. But he was still determined that the issue was critical to the national security and that another attempt should be made to open the dialogue. At his invitation, seven of the country&#39;s top news¬paper executives met with him on May 9, ten days after his New York address. They were Mark Ferree, president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association and assistant general manager of the Scripps-Howard chain; Felix McKnight, president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors and executive editor of the Dallas Times-Herald; Lee Hills, president-elect of the ASNE and the Pulitzer Prize-winning executive editor of the Knight chain; Turner Catledge, managing editor of the New York Times; Ben McKelway, president of AP and editor of the Washing. ton Star; Irwin Maier, publishing director of the Milwaukee Journal; and D. Tennant Bryan, publisher of the Richmond (Virginia) Times Dispatch and Richmond News Leader.
The conference in the President&#39;s office was a total failure. Although JFK produced a number of recent news dispatches that clearly violated national security, the news executives told him bluntly that they would accept no new security restrictions—voluntary or official—in the absence of a declaration of national emergency. The President replied that the cold war was a continuing emergency and that the requirement for greater restraint should be obvious.
One of the examples President Kennedy showed to the assembled editors was particularly revealing. An article published in a leading Ameri¬can newspaper completely informed its readers (and presumably the enemy) how the United States was getting intelligence on Soviet space operations, intelligence which permitted the United States government to know in advance when the Soviets were going to make a launch.
Looking back on the meeting, I am sure that a communications break¬down was involved. Either the President failed to make his point strongly enough, or the press misunderstood his objective. In any event, he elicited no favorable reaction from the newsmen present. 156-58 With Kennedy, By Pierre Salinger </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For me it is reminder that we are all in a war. A war for our minds, which primarily manifests itself as battles of information fought through the media. I consider reddit<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> to be on the front lines of that war. More like &#39;Tip of the Spear&#39; on the front line, of the front most infantry formation. As one shatters more of the illusion that has clouded their minds one can more clearly see the tactics used by TPTB (I prefer to label them as &#39;CiC&#39;, &quot;criminals in charge&quot;, and say it with a soft &#39;c&#39;, so phonetically it would be &#39;sik&#39;. Which is what these people are, sick in the head... and spirit.)</p>

<p>So in the case of labeling this speech as about communism, it is a deflection tactic. And is aimed at the more casual viewer. We are all at different levels of awareness. We are all still deeply deceived, some just more so than others. It is good to remember that. The shills who post here are therefor some of the most deeply deceived, some of the most controlled. But they are also being exposed to deep truths, and at some point it will shatter the spell they are under.</p>

<p>Reddit is a sad shadow of what it once was, but it was also critical to my own awakening, way back in 2007. </p>

JFK was as articulate as any president you care to name. The fact he chooses not to, with the addition of all the other non -communist related keywords, is testament to the fact this speech was not about the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>You’re still yet to address the multitude of

    <div class="md"><p>Learn to fucking read. From the beginning of his speech he talks about Karl Marx (the founder of Communism)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You may remember that in 1851 the New York Herald Tribune under the sponsorship and publishing of Horace Greeley, employed as its London correspondent an obscure journalist by the name of <strong>Karl Marx</strong>.</p>

<p>We are told that foreign correspondent <strong>Marx</strong>, stone broke, and with a family ill and undernourished, constantly appealed to Greeley and managing editor Charles Dana for an increase in his munificent salary of $5 per installment, a salary which he and Engels ungratefully labeled as the &quot;lousiest petty bourgeois cheating.&quot;</p>

<p>But when all his financial appeals were refused, <strong>Marx</strong> looked around for other means of livelihood and fame, eventually terminating his relationship with the Tribune and devoting his talents full time to the cause that would bequeath the world the seeds of Leninism, Stalinism, revolution and the cold war.</p>

<p>If only this capitalistic New York newspaper had treated him more kindly; <strong>if only Marx had remained a foreign correspondent, history might have been different</strong>. And I hope all publishers will bear this lesson in mind the next time they receive a poverty-stricken appeal for a small increase in the expense account from an obscure newspaper man.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Then he goes on to beg the press to keep US government machinations a secret</strong>. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>My topic tonight is a more sober one of concern to publishers as well as editors.</p>

<p>I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger. The events of recent weeks may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some; but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years. Whatever our hopes may be for the future--for reducing this threat or living with it--there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security--a challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every sphere of human activity.</p>

<p>This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements of direct concern both to the press and to the President--two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be reconciled and fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril. I refer, first, to the need for a far greater public information; and, <strong>second, to the need for far greater official secrecy</strong>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>You need to dig deeper.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If only this capitalistic New York newspaper had treated him more kindly; if only Marx had remained a foreign correspondent, history might have been different. &quot;</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you know <a href="http://postflaviana.org/wolfgang-waldner-marx/%20(selected%20quotes">Who were Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, really?</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The ruling elite of the government have always been anxious to put their agents at the forefront of opposition movements. Considering that capitalists and the government have the means of power, this is typically not a problem. We will discuss the example of Marx and Engels in detail here, but of course they are not isolated cases, but only the very best examples of the infiltration and undermining of oppositional movements.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The ruling circles see their advantage in the fact that opponents and victims of capitalist oppression can do very little with Marxism. In the 19th century, a fierce resistance to the impoverishment of the masses by the capitalist industrialization developed. Autocrats, government officials, industrialists and bankers were afraid because of strikes and violent resistance to the attacks of the anarchists. <strong>But when Marx and Engels took over the communists’ ideological leadership, the revolutionaries became  peaceful, with value-form analysis employed instead of dynamite.</strong> The fight against the anarchists was Marx’s main concern in the First International.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is no accident that Karl Marx, the lauded pioneer of Communism, was married to Jenny von Westphalen, the little sister of Prussian Minister of the Interior Ferdinand von Westphalen. All Marxists have diligently studied “Das Kapital” as though it represents great, dangerously subversive thinking; but <strong>ccording to credible reports, powerful and well-informed capitalists are said to have almost died laughing at the thought of Marxist revolutionaries wasting their time with value-form analysis.</strong> Of course, not one of the ‘revolutionaries’ has been willing to talk openly about the fact that he cannot make any sense of ‘Das Kapital’, lest someone might hold him a fool. So, Marxists all assure one another how much they have been impressed by the deep insights of Karl Marx, and if so many people say so, no one ever dares to disagree.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Marx and Engels’ theories were no threat to England or capitalism. On the contrary, Liberal ideas could have led to the rise of capitalism in Russia, which would have been a real threat to the Empire. A totalitarian party dictatorship of “Marxists” in the name of the proletariat would hold Russia backwards and isolated from Western Europe. Whereas, England feared nothing more than the prospect of  an alliance of France, or even Germany, with a Russian liberal capitalism.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>&quot;The slogan of the world proletarian revolution sounded horrifying to the ears of all the petty bourgeois. Nobility and big business enjoyed a hearty laugh at the good disguise their agents.&quot;</strong></p>

</blockquote>

<p>My bad, sorry. I fixed the url and now you can see the full text I linked, and it says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Okhrana, the Russian secret service, even planted its own form of “legal Marxism” in Russia, as the Tsar feared the attacks of anarchists and not value-form analysis. No one in the Tsar’s Imperial Court could foresee that Tsarism would lose its power base in the First World War; that Germany would promote a quick peace agreement promising weapons and money to Marxist revolutionaries; and that for geopolitical reasons,England and the US would also favor Marxist revolutionary rule over Russia.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Under the party dictatorship of the Marxists, Russia disappeared under a bell jar; as also later China, politically isolated from Germany and France and not very attractive and efficient. Any criticism of capitalism in the US or Western Europe could easily be stifled by comparison with the situation in Russia under Stalin and China under Mao.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>It is almost as if it had been planned to turn out this way from the beginning — ever since   David Urquhart (agent of the British Crown) and Karl Marx worked together as allies to write against the dangers posed by Russia.</strong> David Urquhart is almost exclusively remembered as the man who introduced Turkish baths to England; but until the death of Prince Regent Albert in 1861, he was closely linked with the political machinations of the British Crown.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The volatile leaders of the Cuban Revolutionary Council in exile—the political arm of the brigade—were just as heedless of security. Only nine days before the landing, the council&#39;s president, Dr. Jose Mir6 Cardona, told the press in Miami that an uprising against Castro was &quot;imminent.&quot; And the very next day, he appealed to Cubans still in their homeland to take up arms against the dictator. The only information Castro didn&#39;t have by then was the exact time and place of the invasion.
JFK was livid. He said to me in his office a week before the invasion: &quot;1 can&#39;t believe what I&#39;m reading! Castro doesn&#39;t need agents over here. All he has to do is read our papers. It&#39;s all laid out for him.&quot; I left him, still not knowing that D-Day already was set.

    <div class="md"><p>No, that isn’t strictly true.
Washington for example, along with other members of the revolutionary founders, were inducted into freemasonry as a ploy to deceive the ranks into thinking the American Revolution was a sanctioned operation to further increase control by giving the
Masses the illusion of freedom (see How the Nation was Won- Lowry).</p>

<p>JFK was no doubt reared to follow in the footsteps
Of the traitors that preceded him, but somewhere between that and him assuming office, he made the choice to move in opposition to them, working with another faction, more aligned with humanist and not oligarchical values.   </p>

<p>As for the rest, I won’t speak for each of them, but the fact they’re words  delicates so starkly from the official narrative, makes them worthy of consideration, despite what their alliances appear to be on surface. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Kudos for you on your phenomenal work chasing down leads and putting all this together. But I remain skeptical. </p>

<p>For example, why would this guy reveal his group&#39;s strategy and plans for the future? It only gives the other side a chance to think of a way to counter attack. Does the element of surprise count for nothing? Also, I don&#39;t see how installing a space elevator to harvest solar energy in low earth orbit is going to lead to a worldwide per capita GDP of $1,000,000. In fact, I don&#39;t see how per capita GDP could ever reach that except through massive inflation (or regular inflation over a very very long term). I think we&#39;re dealing with a LARPer who has a much higher level of average intelligence than most LARPers and also a deeper knowledge of the occult than most.  </p>

<p>Having said that, I certainly <em>hope</em> it&#39;s legit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. Communism was a cabal creation, same as Capitalism. My point is that focus on this speech being a pure reference to the soviet threat, omitting the evident reference to secret societies,
Masonic and otherwise, is limiting and I daresay sinister.
It prevents from further investigation into what these secret societies may be, whose a member, how far into antiquity they were founded etc</p>

<p>And simply leaves one feeling fulfilled that they understand what JFK warned against.</p>

<p>&quot;Today, America would be outraged if U.N. troops entered Los Angeles to restore order [referring to the 1991 LA Riot]. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there were an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all peoples of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown.

<p>&quot;The Trilateral Commission is intended to be the vehicle for multinational consolidation of the commercial and banking interests by seizing control of the political government of the United States. The Trilateral Commission represents a skillful, coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political, monetary, intellectual and ecclesiastical.

In fact, some passages could be seen as the President using undue influence to shape news coverage, and to align the media&#39;s narrative with the military interest of the government&#39;s; note passages like &quot;Every newspaper now asks itself, with respect to every story: &quot;Is it news?&quot; All I suggest is that you add the question: &quot;Is it in the interest of the national security?&quot; And I hope that every group in America--unions and businessmen and public officials at every level-- will ask the same question of their endeavors, and subject their actions to the same exacting tests.&quot; If President Obama had said something like that, this sub would be howling (and rightfully so).</p>

<p>Now, you <em>could</em> argue that Kennedy was subtly using his speech about the Soviet Union to condemn practices that were also being employed in America (Secret Societies, approval of all military budget expenditures, silencing dissenters, etc.). Certainly, that&#39;s a conversation one could validly have. But to claim that this speach &quot;was NOT about communism&quot; is plainly and flatly wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don’t doubt communism was a contributing factor behind the speech. Or more precisely that it was a mask used to conceal his true targets- the oligarchical secret societies that are referenced by the presidents and others that you see in the text. Focusing on the communism aspect seems myopic, given the wealth of supporting evidence to suggest that JFK and others who occupied his position, were aware and tried to warn the US public about another far more insidious and infinitely more concealed threat.</p>

<p>I’m curious as to why you and any others I’ve encountered that push the communism narrative so readily ignore the litany of evidence to suggest this is so. I’ve presented  out 10+ sources of presidents saying the same thing JFK did- yet you insist he was talking <strong>solely</strong> about communism. 
Not sure if you’re being unintentionally obstinate or deliberately misleading.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Actually, I didn&#39;t. I said it was the <strong><em>primary focus</em></strong> of his speech (it was), but allowed that he may be using the subject of the Soviet Union to critique the behaviors also employed by America. (i.e. You know how a woman will criticize someone else--&quot;he plays too much video games!&quot;--but you know she&#39;s <em>actually</em> talking about you? Something like that)</p>

<p>The reason for this pushback is because too often (on this forum and elsewhere), people cite this as &quot;the speech that got JFK killed!&quot; (2.5 years before he was killed, and only three months after taking office) and portray it as him publicly denouncing the Illuminati/bankers/globalists, while simultaneously advocating for a free press. </p>

<p>It is rarely (if ever) properly contextualized as a speech about the Soviet Union, where he&#39;s actually asking the press to self-censor in the interest of &quot;national security&quot;/military interests. From a different president, this forum would be frothing about how the White About was attempting to influence and censor news coverage to benefit the military-industrial complex.</p>

<p>Below, I am going to paste numerous (somewhat) large chunks of the speech (from the <a href="https://www.jfklibrary.org/Research/Research-Aids/JFK-Speeches/American-Newspaper-Publishers-Association_19610427.aspx">JFK library</a>) that clearly indicate he&#39;s discussing the Soviet Union, and urging newspapers to employ self-restraint in what they publish. I&#39;ve emphasized certain lines. Again, I am open to the idea that there&#39;s an implicit subtext here, but it&#39;s clear that the speech <strong><em>is</em></strong> about communism, and is a request for news outlets to self-censor.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to talk about our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger. The events of recent weeks <strong><em>[he&#39;s talking about the Bay of Pigs, which happened a little over a week prior]</em></strong> may have helped to illuminate that challenge for some; but the dimensions of its threat have loomed large on the horizon for many years. Whatever our hopes may be for the future--for reducing this threat or living with it--there is no escaping either the gravity or the totality of its challenge to our survival and to our security--a challenge that confronts us in unaccustomed ways in every sphere of human activity.
This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements of direct concern both to the press and to the President--two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be reconciled and fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril. I refer, first, to the need for a far greater public information; and, second, to <strong><em>the need for far greater official secrecy</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Today no war has been declared--and however fierce the struggle may be, it may never be declared in the traditional fashion. Our way of life is under attack. Those who make themselves our enemy are advancing around the globe. The survival of our friends is in danger. And yet no war has been declared, no borders have been crossed by marching troops, no missiles have been fired.</p>

<p>If the press is awaiting a declaration of war before it imposes the self-discipline of combat conditions, then I can only say that no war ever posed a greater threat to our security. If you are awaiting a finding of &quot;clear and present danger,&quot; then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent.
It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions--by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper. </p>

<p>For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.
Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. <strong><em>It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match</em></strong>.</p>

<p>For the facts of the matter are that <strong><em>this nation&#39;s foes have openly boasted of acquiring through our newspapers information they would otherwise hire agents to acquire through theft, bribery or espionage</em></strong>; that details of this nation&#39;s covert preparations to counter the enemy&#39;s covert operations have been available to every newspaper reader, friend and foe alike...</p>

<p>I have no intention of establishing a new Office of War Information to govern the flow of news. I am not suggesting any new forms of censorship or any new types of security classifications. I have no easy answer to the dilemma that I have posed, and would not seek to impose it if I had one. <strong><em>But I am asking the members of the newspaper profession and the industry in this country to reexamine their own responsibilities, to consider the degree and the nature of the present danger, and to heed the duty of self-restraint which that danger imposes upon us all</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Every newspaper now asks itself, with respect to every story: &quot;Is it news?&quot; All I suggest is that you add the question: &quot;<strong><em>Is it in the interest of the national security?</em></strong>&quot; And I hope that every group in America--unions and businessmen and public officials at every level-- will ask the same question of their endeavors, and subject their actions to the same exacting tests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Came to make the correction that u/elnegroik attempted to do politely and u/peyote_the_coyote made rudely and forcefully.</p>

<p>In the meantime, reading through all this, I am frankly disappointed.</p>

<p>Conspiracy redditors should have their history down pat. This strand of comments about whether Kennedy was or was not speaking about communism in that famous speech is not representative of a deep understanding of relatively recent history.</p>

<p>If you go back to the early 1960&#39;s, you find that the overwhelming majority of the US population thought the USSR was an extremely dangerous enemy, intent on subverting democratic institutions in Europe and America, fomenting revolution in the third world, and intent to catch up and take us on in a Cold War suddenly going hot. </p>

<p>Kennedy was a product of this political mental landscape. There is no doubt that he was a solid anti-communist, and his speech was both intended and indeed received by its audience as meaning communism, not the illuminati.</p>

<p>There are many, many interesting conspiracy strands leading from Kennedy himself, his family connections, his handling of the Mafia, his sex life, his assassination, UFO&#39;s, Vietnam, his &quot;soft&quot; version of anti-communism (which is why he pulled back from Cuban Missile crisis where others wanted to wage nuclear war), etc. Lots of room for Kennedy conspiracy here folks.</p>

<p>But it is a misdirected assumption that because he called it a &quot;conspiracy&quot; he must have meant specifically &quot;The Illuminati Conspiracy&quot;.</p>

<p>I grant you that it is not that difficult to connect the communist revolutions with the secret societies. But you don&#39;t develop advanced missiles and subs to fight a bunch of robe-wearing chanters waving torches in front of some altar (as in Bohemian Grove). You don&#39;t tell the press not to publish detailed military information, unless you are talking about the primary military threat of the time. In this case, the enemy he was indicating directly was the USSR. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for this. The crazy thing is, the <em>vast</em> majority of the speech is <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> clear in both its discussion of the Soviet Union, and its pleas for the press to censor itself. There&#39;s no mistaking the content. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/786nx9/jfks_speech_on_secret_societies_was_not_about/dory12k/">I assembled some of the most obvious passages here</a>, but the entire thing--including the anecdote about Karl Marx at the beginning--is unquestionably explicit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear to me that people have seized on a few passages, arrived at a conclusion they&#39;d prefer to believe, and simply ignored the rest of the speech (as well as the historical context of the times, which some folks don&#39;t even seem to be aware of).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. </p>

<p>But you cannot claim that it is self-evident that the deeply buried thing Kennedy might have been alluding to by a brief segment of his speech (&quot;a vast conspiracy&quot;),  is the main message intended, when there is already a very clear, overt meaning to the speech he actually gave in the context that it actually happened.</p>

<p>In basketball, I think they call it &quot;reaching in&quot;...</p>

<p>Now, I did not go too far into the political and family analysis, but to put it bluntly, from everything we know about the Kennedys, there is as much indication that they were part of the grand conspiracy we here try to uncover, as there is to claim JFK was trying to warn us of such a grand conspiracy. Do a little research on how the Kennedys built their fortune. It&#39;s got conspiracy roots all over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From JFK, this bit specifically:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you are awaiting a finding of “clear and present danger,” then I can only say that the danger has never been more clear and its presence has never been more imminent… For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence–on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s possible he is referring to Communism, but people during this time would have seen Communism as a clear and present danger, no? It is obvious, nothing secret. How could Communism be the conspiracy if it isn&#39;t something secret, as stated above it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The very word “secrecy” is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suppose you could suggest that the secrecy is the threat of Communism being secret, i.e. to the younger swathes of the population and some academic and political action/social justice groups. I feel like that is reaching further than the conclusion he was referring to a grander <em>runaway civilization</em> esque conspiracy. He said he was going to crush the CIA and shatter it into a million pieces. He expressed at other times a great deal of contempt and suspicion of the clandestine sectors of the government. It&#39;s not like it is unprecedented, and this quote fits perfectly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>OP your George Washington Quote is missing context too</strong>. </p>

<p>This is part of a much longer exchange between Reverend GW Snyder and George Washington. 
Snyder doesn&#39;t know Washington personally, but he came across a book called Proofs of a Conspiracy &amp;c. by John Robison</p>

<p><strong>GW Selby letter excerpt from letter sent to Washington</strong>: </p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It was some Time since that <strong>a Book fell into my Hands entituled “Proofs of a Conspiracy &amp;c. by John Robison</strong>,”1 which gives a full Account of a Society of Freemasons, that distinguishes itself by the Name “<strong>of Illuminati</strong>,” whose Plan is to overturn all Government and all Religion, even natural; and who endeavour to eradicate every Idea of a Supreme Being, and distinguish Man from Beast by his Shape only. A Thought suggested itself to me, that some of the Lodges in the United States might have caught the Infection, and might cooperate with the Illuminati or the Jacobine Club in France.</p>

<p><strong>I send you</strong> the “Proof of a Conspiracy &amp;c.” which, I doubt not, will give you Satisfaction and afford you Matter for a Train of Ideas, that may operate to our national Felicity.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Washington and Selby correspond back several times, where Washington doesn&#39;t have a lot of free time to read the book. 
But he eventually does look at it. And no doubt at that time the Illuminati were brand new, and Washington knew of Adam Weishaupt. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have heard much of the nefarious, &amp; dangerous plan, &amp; doctrines of the Illuminati, but never saw the Book until you were pleased to send it to me. The same causes which have prevented my acknowledging the receipt of your letter, have prevented my reading the Book</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a long exchange, but better for context which is always important. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>OP your George Washington Quote is missing context too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the context you provided lacks the deeper meaning this quote has.</p>

<p>It was explained <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/25xwbn/eli5how_does_a_group_like_the_illuminati_who_were/chlwa31/">here</a> by u/FreedomIntensifies</p>

<p>Some quotes from rather heated debate:</p>

<p>&quot;George Washington was in effect the chief intelligence officer of the USA and made the following observation (you can view the original letter which contains this quote online at the website of the Library of Congress)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am.</p>

<p>The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of seperation). That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects; and actually had a seperation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Here we have Washington describing vast influence of the Illuminati network in the American government. But it is more than that, we also are talking about countervailing Jacobinism and an ideological war within the freemasonic lodges playing out at the highest levels.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is saying they have spread. <strong>You are confused by the unusual use of commas as their usage has changed somewhat since then.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;He goes on to talk about the spread of such principles, but objecting that their spread is not directed by the order as a whole but rather individuals within it.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/115437268/#q115452405">Breaking it down:</a></p>

<p>He calls the Illuminati &quot;diabolical&quot; and the jacobins &quot;pernicious.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, diabolical might naively be interpreted as evil but it isn&#39;t obvious that it was Washington&#39;s meaning. As a very educated man, knowing that both Jesus and the snake in the garden are identified as the morning star, we might take the hint that in this case diabolical is simply meant to convey good aims taken with extreme cleverness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the jacobins who are unquestionably birthed from the established secret societies (freemasons) are described as pernicious which can only be interpreted as bad.</p>

<p>Then Washington goes on to tell you that the the founder (himself) had the principles of the illuminati so clearly that it was &quot;too evident to be questioned.&quot;</p>

<p>And what of the separation of the people from their government?</p>

<p>Well, if you are familiar with history at all and therefore know that mankind has been governed and trodden upon by secret societies (the actual government before the revolution) then it makes sense why the founder (Washington) had in mind a separation of the people from their government. </p>

<p>Washington even tells you that the American revolution was indeed a war against the old ways of the secret societies by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that there was division within the ranks. Pretty much the only time you have seen this on any significant scale before was when Jesus started an insurrection against freemasonry 1800 years prior.</p>

<p>So you can start to see how the Illuminati (origin 1776) was a psy-op by American intelligence (the real revolutionaries) to sow discord, confusion, and division within the ranks of freemasonry and therefore make possible the success of the revolution.</p>

<p>Washington was later assassinated for this, showing conclusively that he was fighting them all along and they didn&#39;t know what had hit them until it was too late.&quot;</p>

He shook his head. &quot;We&#39;re going to have to straighten all this out, and
publishers have to understand that we&#39;re never more than a miscalculation away from war and that there are things were doing that we just can&#39;t talk about.&#39;
I then made a suggestion to the President that I would later regret. He was to speak six days later, on April 27, to the Bureau of Advertising of the American Newspaper Publishers Association at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York.
&quot;Why not lay it on the line there?&quot; I said. &quot;It&#39;s a major forum and the timing will punch up the importance you assign to it. It could open up the whole area to serious discussion.&quot;
He agreed to do it and told me to relay my thinking on content to Ted Sorensen, who would write the speech. I gave Ted a long memo summarizing the freedom of information conflict between past Presidents and the press and outlining the steps we had taken to open up channels of information. He drafted a brilliant argument in support of the President&#39;s position, and one that will be as valid in the year so&amp; as it was in 1961. It began with an admonition to the press that it must recognize &quot;our common responsibilities in the face of a common danger: the totality of the Communist challenge to our survival and to our security .. . &quot;This deadly challenge imposes upon our society two requirements of direct concern both to the press and to the President—two requirements that may seem almost contradictory in tone, but which must be fulfilled if we are to meet this national peril. I refer, first, to the need for far greater public information; and, second, to the need for far greater official secrecy.
&quot;The very word &#39;secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths, and to secret proceedings . . . No official of my administration, whether his rank is high or low, civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as an excuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up our mistakes, or to withhold from the press and the public the facts they deserve to know.
&quot;But I do ask every publisher, every editor, and every newsman in the nation to re-examine his own standards, and to recognize the nature of our country&#39;s peril. In time of war, the government and the press have customarily joined in an effort, based largely on self-discipline, to prevent unauthorized disclosures to the enemy. In time of &#39;clear and present danger; the courts have held that even the privileged rights of the First Amendment must yield to the public&#39;s need for national security. –P.155 With Kennedy, by Pierre Salinger </p>

<p>were all these guys talking about communism too? even George Washington?</p>

<p>I mean seriously, JFK does a speech about immoral secret societies that profit from war, then he gets killed in the most dubious, most confusing and debated assassination attempt in US history. he was surrounded by mafia men for christ&#39;s sake</p>

<p>Northwoods was SCHEDULED to happen in 1962, JFK refused, hence he was forced into Bay of Pigs in 1961. that failed, he fired Dulles who was later on, coincidentally, the Warren Commission.</p>

<p>seriously, they had a freaking plan to do a false flag and kill American citizens and blame it on Cuba and Castro. you honestly don&#39;t think that the people who would do that would be a powerful entity and have influence in the government? really? that&#39;s incredibly sad</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>OP your George Washington Quote is missing context too. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the context you provided lacks the deeper meaning this quote has.</p>

<p>It was explained <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/25xwbn/eli5how_does_a_group_like_the_illuminati_who_were/chlwa31/">here</a> by u/FreedomIntensifies</p>

<p>Some quotes from rather heated debate:</p>

<p>&quot;George Washington was in effect the chief intelligence officer of the USA and made the following observation (you can view the original letter which contains this quote online at the website of the Library of Congress)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am.</p>

<p>The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of seperation). That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects; and actually had a seperation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Here we have Washington describing vast influence of the Illuminati network in the American government. But it is more than that, we also are talking about countervailing Jacobinism and an ideological war within the freemasonic lodges playing out at the highest levels.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is saying they have spread. <strong>You are confused by the unusual use of commas as their usage has changed somewhat since then.&quot;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;He goes on to talk about the spread of such principles, but objecting that their spread is not directed by the order as a whole but rather individuals within it.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/115437268/#q115452405">Breaking it down:</a></p>

<p>He calls the Illuminati &quot;diabolical&quot; and the jacobins &quot;pernicious.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, diabolical might naively be interpreted as evil but it isn&#39;t obvious that it was Washington&#39;s meaning. As a very educated man, knowing that both Jesus and the snake in the garden are identified as the morning star, we might take the hint that in this case diabolical is simply meant to convey good aims taken with extreme cleverness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the jacobins who are unquestionably birthed from the established secret societies (freemasons) are described as pernicious which can only be interpreted as bad.</p>

<p>Then Washington goes on to tell you that the the founder (himself) had the principles of the illuminati so clearly that it was &quot;too evident to be questioned.&quot;</p>

<p>And what of the separation of the people from their government?</p>

<p>Well, if you are familiar with history at all and therefore know that mankind has been governed and trodden upon by secret societies (the actual government before the revolution) then it makes sense why the founder (Washington) had in mind a separation of the people from their government. </p>

<p>Washington even tells you that the American revolution was indeed a war against the old ways of the secret societies by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that there was division within the ranks. Pretty much the only time you have seen this on any significant scale before was when Jesus started an insurrection against freemasonry 1800 years prior.</p>

<p>So you can start to see how the Illuminati (origin 1776) was a psy-op by American intelligence (the real revolutionaries) to sow discord, confusion, and division within the ranks of freemasonry and therefore make possible the success of the revolution.</p>

<p>Washington was later assassinated for this, showing conclusively that he was fighting them all along and they didn&#39;t know what had hit them until it was too late.&quot;</p>
