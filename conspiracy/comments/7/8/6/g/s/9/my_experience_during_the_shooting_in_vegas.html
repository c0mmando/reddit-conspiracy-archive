        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>**NOTE: I&#39;m not saying everything I remember is correct. Panic and confusion can make you think you heard or saw things that didn&#39;t actually happen. Please don&#39;t downvote me lol - I tried to write down exactly what I can recall/what I gathered from the texts I sent that night. </p>

<p>I also changed the names of everyone in my story for privacy reasons**</p>

<p>On October 1st, 2017, I had gotten just a few hours of sleep. I had slept at 6 AM the night before, but I knew I had to wake up early because my grandpa and my uncle were leaving that day I wanted to say goodbye. I had been sleep deprived for a few days, given we were in Vegas, and the night before I had also barely slept. This is an important detail, not to the shooting, but to my story, personally.</p>

<p>I spent a few hours hanging out with my grandpa and my uncle until they left for the airport. I was so happy to have seen my grandpa that weekend because it had been so long. He’s 90, so I’m never really sure when the last time I’ll see him will be. After my grandpa and my uncle left, my brother and our three friends wandered the Strip to go shopping and get food. After a few hours, my brother and I headed back to the MGM, where we were staying, to hang out with my dad since I was flying from Vegas back to school the next day. After the three of us talked, I was so tired that when two of my friends, Kristen and Courtney, asked if I wanted to go ziplining, I told them to book it for later, because I was going to take a nap. By the time I woke up, it was a little past 8 PM, and my dad asked me what I wanted to eat.</p>

<p>At around 9 PM, we finally decided on eating downstairs at Mori Moto in the MGM. Kevin, my dad’s friend, had been wandering the Strip earlier and eaten dinner by himself, but we asked him to come hang out for our last night in Vegas. I should note that both my dad and Kevin have had strokes, so they are both physically impaired but able to walk, just not well. Jordan and Stacey, my parents&#39; friends, had driven halfway to the Grand Canyon before turning back around, and had also already eaten, but decided to join us just to hang out, as well. The kids (my brother, our friends, and I) made plans to go to New York New York for dessert after dinner.</p>

<p>We were all eating dinner when we looked outside and saw everyone - and I mean everyone - walking away from the casino, towards the food court. We were all confused, wondering what was happening, and my first thought (I don’t know why) was that there was a fight and everyone was going to watch. My second thought was maybe there was a show or concert that everyone was late for. We ignored it, but something in the pit of my stomach felt like something might be wrong. I don’t remember hearing anything, but everyone else at the table remembers hearing gun shots. I was so panicked I don’t know what I remember, but all of a sudden, everyone outside was running and we were being told to “hurry! To the kitchen, now!”</p>

<p>We walked to the kitchen, where they opened the back door leading to a hallway. According to my texts to my friend, this was around 10:22 PM. There were some people there, too, but we were told to stay in the kitchen. We heard from security (I think) that there was a shooter, and I began to panic. I always knew I wouldn’t be good in a situation like this, and I was right. I began to shake uncontrollably and the tears started rolling down my cheeks before I could stop them. My first thought was that there was a shooter in the casino, like a school shooting, but then I thought that maybe it was a guy who had gotten into a fight with someone else and had whipped out his gun. When I accepted that there wasn’t much I could do about the situation, I slowly began to calm down, until we finally got the okay to sit back down. According to my texts to my cousin, this was around 10:33 PM. In my texts to her, I said that there was a shooting outside MGM. We had thought it was inside, but it was outside, and we were all okay.</p>

<p>We proceeded to order dessert, and because we ordered the restaurant’s special, a dessert that lit on fire, we took videos of it. I didn’t save mine, but my brother and Kristen did. The videos were taken between 10:50 PM and 10:59 PM. I googled to see any news of what was happening, and I can’t remember if anything popped up, but I switched over to Twitter. There were reports of a shooter at the Route91 concert. I texted my cousin that I was reading twitter and that “I think the shooter is at mandalay bay.” I told her that they had a machine gun and that I thought the shooter was still active (it was 10:56 PM at this time). &quot;I&#39;m so sad,&quot; I texted my cousin. &quot;We&#39;re eating dessert and people are literally dying outside.&quot;</p>

<p>Everything outside seemed to be okay. I was still shaking a bit but I had calmed down a significant amount. I assumed that the hotel was locked down, so were safe. People were walking back and forth from the casino again. We saw a woman across the restaurant laying on the floor crying. She was on the phone. We thought that maybe she had heard her friend had gotten shot. I had just barely calmed down when again when everyone else but me heard gun shots. There was no walking this time. Everyone outside began running away from the casino. My dad fell off his chair, and before I could panic, I told myself to calm down because I had to help him up.</p>

<p>I helped my dad up and with his arm around my shoulders, we walked to the kitchen. This time, we didn’t stop there. The door to the hallway was open, and we walked down, my dad’s arm still around my shoulder. My mom was on his other side and my aunt was behind him to make sure he didn’t fall and so no one would bump into him. Justin, my brother’s friend, was with Kevin, my dad’s friend, to make sure he was walking okay. I was focused on my dad, but every so often, I would remember someone else in our group and called for them to make sure they were still with us. There were tons of other people (it was pretty full, but not too full to where people were getting trampled or anything) until we hit the door to outside. I had no idea that was where the hallway led to, and if I was panicked the first time we evacuated, I felt like I was going to pass out from the fear this time. I had been crying the whole time we walked down the hallway, but now the tears were coming out faster and I was shaking uncontrollably. Being outside made me feel so exposed, like there was no way to hide if the shooter came. All of this was around 11 PM, according to my texts to my cousin (I sent her a text at 11:09 PM telling her we evacuated again).</p>

<p>My dad told me to calm down, but I just couldn’t. I saw my mom look at me as though she was going to cry, but the second she saw how scared I was, she held back her tears and gave me a hug and told me to calm down. Courtney and Kristen were both on the phone, with their sisters I think, probably telling them what was going on. I’m not sure, but Courtney was crying. Kristen seemed okay - she used to work as in emergency, so she was used to panic. I was texting my cousin the whole time, but my phone was going to die. I don’t know how long we were outside for, but it felt like an hour. It was probably 20 minutes. Courtney and I hugged each other and cried as we tried to calm down.</p>

<p>It’s so strange - I wasn’t crying because I was scared of dying. I can’t really piece together why I was so scared. My first thought was, “what if the shooter comes in here, to this hallway full of people? And I have to watch people die, watch him point the gun in their face and see the terror in their eyes? What will I do if he comes?” The thought of it terrified me. My second thought was about my dad. He can’t run, and that in itself made me panic.</p>

<p>They closed the automatic doors so that you could only open them from the inside. Most people stayed inside, but my group and some others were outside. We were all unsure of what to do. Jordan and my brother kept wandering around to see what the situation was, whether it was safe, what escape routes there were, and so on.</p>

<p>Everything that happened was a blur, so I can’t remember if this is chronologically correct, but I saw a little girl and her mom walk down the hallway, out to where we were standing. There were three women from the concert huddled across from us, standing in a doorway, and they asked the mom if they wanted to hide her daughter there, saying they didn’t have any children. It was at that moment when my heart sank. I had been so scared this whole time, and I was just now realizing that there were children out there. The fact that someone was shooting at pedestrians (which is what we believed was happening) was disgusting enough… the fact that there were children in the mix was absolutely heart breaking. Luckily, the little girl didn’t seem scared, though I’m sure she thought the situation was unusual. The ladies asked her about her favourite shows and kept her preoccupied.</p>

<p>I saw a man who had been shot in the arm. Someone had bandaged him up. At this point, I had already calmed down, and surprisingly, the sight didn’t make me scared again, probably because I couldn’t see the wound. There was blood all over the left side of his body. He seemed dazed, and he said that he was told to take a cab to the hospital. Kevin used his good arm to grab the man a chair. My dad said the man said he’d been shot at the MGM. I wasn’t sure if my dad heard wrong, but my brother said he heard the same. I don’t know what I heard.</p>

<p>I don’t know why, but it was one of my first thoughts to email all my professors and tell them I wouldn’t be coming to class for the next few days. I told them I would be going home with my parents instead, and then flying back for school. I asked for extensions on my assignments. My fingers trembled as I typed out the emails.</p>

<p>After I was done wiping my tears, I saw a woman crying in front of me, with two other ladies. They were wearing plaid and cowboy boots - I know they had to have been at the concert. I went up to the woman and hugged her, asking if she was okay. She told me her friend had been shot and she didn’t know where she was. “She was shot in the face, these men took her and told us to run,” she said. I hugged her again, unsure of what to say. “She’s going to be okay,” I told her, hugging her again, and at that time, I held on to the hope that she really would be okay.</p>

<p>Jordan returned after wandering around to tell us that security said it was okay for us to go back up to our room. I thought we were going to go back into the hallway, but we were to continue outside to the lobby. I didn’t know how close we were to the entrance, and it’s a good thing I didn’t, because I probably never would have been able to calm myself down. I asked the women where they were staying, and they said the Excalibur. It wasn’t safe to walk the Strip yet, so I asked my dad if they could come with us, and my dad said yes. We walked to the entrance, my dad’s arm around my shoulders again, and I tried not to panic. I took deep breaths for the few minutes it took for us to get to the lobby. Everyone seemed to be sitting around. I guess they didn’t have rooms or something. I have no idea, but no one seemed too scared. We walked to the elevators, and I was still scared, knowing I wouldn’t feel okay until we got to our room.</p>

<p>When we got to our room, we closed all the blinds, shut off most of the lights, and all sat away from the Strip. Emily, Barbara, and Lucy, the three women who came with us, were making calls to the hospitals, trying to find their friend. They called her family to let them know what was happening. Barbara broke down in tears every few minutes. Lucy seemed in a state of shock, not crying, but continually repeating that they needed to leave and find their friend. Emily remained calm, telling Barbara (her mom) that it was going to be okay but she needed to calm down. She told Lucy they couldn’t leave because it wasn’t safe. Barbara told us what happened while they were at the concert.</p>

<p>“We thought it was firecrackers,” she said. She said she thought it was strange that someone managed to get fireworks into the concert, but they ignored it. She said she didn’t realize what was happening until they were all told to get down, and even then she didn’t understand. It wasn’t until she watched a bullet pass her face and hit the ground beside her when she understood what was happening. Her friend had been shot in the head, and two guys had picked her up and told the rest of them to run. Barbara began crying again. I hugged her, said Serena (her friend) would be okay, but I didn’t really believe that. I thought if she’d been shot in the head, there was no way she had made it. I didn’t want to watch them get bad news - I didn’t think Barbara could take it. My heart sank again.</p>

<p>I was feeling 90% okay in our room. I figured that the shooters (at the time, we believed there were multiple) was aiming at pedestrians, and we were so high up that it was okay. I doubted that they would aim into hotel rooms, but we lay low just in case. My cousin gave me updates from the police scanner - reports of shooters at Aria, Bellagio, NYNY. My stomach dropped, thinking about how we wanted to go to NYNY for dessert. “Do you think there’s a shooter at every hotel?” I asked my cousin. She said probably. I was a little scared, but I knew panic wouldn’t solve anything. I kept telling myself we would be okay.</p>

<p>Every time someone opened the bathroom door, we all jumped. Someone knocked on our door, and all our eyes widened. It was just hotel staff, asking if we needed anything. We turned on the news to see what was happening. The sound of the gunshots in the videos made my heart race, so I covered my ears every time. I was shivering, even though it wasn’t cold. I knew no amount of blankets would keep me warm, because it felt like the cold was coming from inside my body, but Courtney and I shared a blanket anyway. We read tweets, we watched the news, we listened to the police scanner. Emily continued calling hospitals. I had been okay in the hotel room, periodically crying, but mostly okay, until I saw Emily cry. She had been so strong the whole time, and the moment she broke down was so heart breaking.</p>

<p>I kept thinking about all the kids out there. I assumed that they would be first priority, that people were hiding them to make sure they were okay, but I was still scared for them. More accurately, I felt guilty. Here I was, safe in my hotel room, when children were out there, not even sure what was going on. Every so often, I would say “this is so fucked.” That’s the only way I could describe it. It was so, so fucked. I couldn’t wrap my head around the fact that someone could shoot out into a crowd, killing innocent people, but it completely blew my mind that someone could potentially be shooting a child and not even care.</p>

<p>I thought about the people who had been shot. I thought of the people who had been at the concert, scared for their lives. I thought about Barbara and Emily and Lucy’s friend. I thought about how all three of them must be feeling, since they were actually at the concert. If I was this scared, how were they feeling? I thought about the friends and families of people who’d died, or were missing. People died tonight, not even a 15 minute walk from where I was standing. I felt physically sick. I started crying again.</p>

<p>We turned off the news. I was glad because I didn’t want to keep hearing the gunshots. I was relieved to be in our room, but I felt guilty because of all the people who were still out there, scared and defenceless. Finally, the police scanner reported the shooter down. We turned on the news again - 20 dead, 100 wounded. I cried again.</p>

<p>I thought of all the people I had met while I was in Vegas, even the people I had just passed by. I texted the guy I had met at the club the other day. I wondered if the couple we’d seen come from the concert yesterday were okay. I thought of the people we had stood in line with at the food court. I wanted them to all be okay. I thought about how lucky it was that we decided to spend the last night all together. I would have been freaking out if Kevin was off on his own, especially with his inability to run. I would have been worried sick if we couldn’t get a hold of Jordan and Stacey. What if the kids had gone to NYNY for dessert? I would have felt so bad for making my parents worry like that. I would have been so scared not knowing if I was going to see my parents again. Thank God my grandpa had already left. Thank God my cousin wasn’t there.</p>

<p>My head raced with all the what-ifs. What if we’d been wandering the Strip? If we had eaten dinner any earlier, we definitely would have been. It was our last night in Vegas. What if we’d been at NYNY? I love country music. I wanted to go to that concert. I probably would have asked everyone to stand outside and listen.</p>

<p>It was around 3 AM when we all went to bed. My parents&#39; friends went back to their rooms. Courtney asked if I wanted to sleep in her bed, since all our friends had left and I would be sleeping alone, but my aunt stayed with me. I fell asleep around 5:30 AM.</p>

<p>I woke up at around 8:30 AM. The three women had already left, but had left us a note saying they had left at 6:30, saying thank you and to keep in touch. I turned on the news. 50 dead, 400 injured. I cried. An hour later, the death toll rose to 59, with 500+ injured. I cried again. I usually cry when I hear of mass shootings or bombings around the world, but this time, I couldn’t stop. This time around, it felt too real. It very well could have been me. Why wasn’t it me? Why did those people have to die? The chances of us being on the Strip during the shooting were astronomical. It was all because of my nap that we hadn’t eaten any earlier. I started to cry again.</p>

<p>We went downstairs for breakfast. The tone was so strange… everything felt very somber. I can only recall one rowdy table in a sea of quiet. I don’t know how to explain it, but the air felt very respectful, like we all had an understanding of what had just happened and we should all be respectful of the situation. Some people were gambling, but it was a lot quieter than usual. I remember hearing someone spin the wheel at one of the gambling tables, and it sounded like automatic gunshots. My body tensed.</p>

<p>All my professors were incredibly understanding and I was so grateful. For some reason, I thought they wouldn’t be so understanding, but they all emailed back saying they were glad I was safe and we could talk about due dates when I got back. I teared up reading the emails. (You can see that I was an emotional mess).</p>

<p>I texted Emily, who had left her number. Her friend was in the ICU. She’d been shot in the cheek, and the bullet exited her other cheek. She’d broken her jaw and it would have to be wired for 6 weeks straight, but she was going to be okay. I can’t even explain the relief I felt. I thought for sure she wasn’t going to make it. The guy from the club texted me back. He and all his friends were okay.</p>

<p>I received texts from both the night before, while it was happening, and the morning after, from my good friends to people I hadn’t seen since high school. I felt so grateful to have so many people care about me enough to ask.</p>

<p>I went home with my parents that day, and my aunt and I slept in the same bed again. I was still in shock over what happened. I cried reading about the people who died. I thought about their family, their friends… the children who would grow up without mothers or fathers. The husband who died protecting his wife. The guy who was a year older than me, who lived where I used to go to school. I had two mutual friends with him. That could have been me. A 20 year old girl had died. That’s my cousin&#39;s age. A mom left behind three children. I can’t even find the words to explain what I was feeling. I became obsessed with reading about Stephen Paddock. What was his issue? What could possibly possess someone to do something like this? I read news articles, googled him every half hour, read every recount of the event from various people, looked up stories on Reddit… I quite literally became obsessive. I didn’t know what to believe. What we had experienced, what people were saying… it didn’t exactly align with what story was being put out there. It didn’t sit right with me. But I also understood that panic and confusion could mix up memories… although the timeline of my story (which I got from text messages I had sent out) didn’t fit with the police timeline, either. I was so confused. I needed answers.</p>

<p>I flew back to school two days later. I held back my tears as my mom dropped me off at the airport, but as soon as she left, I started crying. I felt so alone.</p>

<p>I got back to my apartment and immediately locked the door. I had a habit of leaving it unlocked, but I didn’t feel safe doing that anymore. I got into bed and cried. I had been crying on and off for the last few days, but now I felt so alone. I didn’t tell anyone I was back in town because I didn’t feel like seeing anyone. I read up on Stephen Paddock that night, until I came across a supposed photo of his face after he had shot himself. I only saw it for a second, but it’s an image I still can’t get out of my head. I began sobbing. I couldn’t sleep now. I texted all my friends to see who was awake, but it was 2 AM - everyone was asleep. My lovely friend texted his old roommate to ask if I could sleep over, and his amazing roommate said yes. I walked over to his place and he let me in. He was so incredibly nice to me that, again… surprise, surprise, I wanted to cry. I’m really not ever this emotional. It’s been a taxing time for me, lol.</p>

<p>I’ve had a tough time falling asleep. I have awful dreams. I used to get sleep paralysis, right after my dad had his stroke, and I was getting it again. I have dreams about shootings. I used to sleep in pitch black, and now I’m afraid of the dark, so I keep a light on and turn on Friends and I fall asleep around 4 AM, when I’m too tired to keep my eyes open any longer. Loud noises make me jump. My heart races when I hear police sirens. The thought of crowded places, like clubs or concerts, give me anxiety. I suddenly have this constant pit of anxiety in my stomach, everywhere I go. For the first 2 weeks, I constantly felt like I was going to cry, and a lot of the time, when I was alone, I did cry.</p>

<p>I wasn’t exactly crying because I was scared, but because I was so angry that I felt this way. It wasn’t fair that I used to love living alone, and now I couldn’t even sleep in my own bed. It wasn’t fair that I went from being happy-go-lucky to constantly afraid of what was around the corner. I didn’t want to feel anxious walking down the street. I didn’t want to start tearing up every time someone asked me if I was okay. I hated sitting in class and randomly start thinking about the shooting and wanting to cry all over again. I felt like I had no one to talk to. I talked to my cousin, but I didn’t want to talk to anyone else because it felt like they didn’t understand and I didn’t want to annoy them. The day after the shooting, social media was flooded with Pray for Vegas posts. But everything went back to normal after that. People posted selfies, travel photos, food snaps… it was as if it never even happened. But for me, it did. For everyone there, it did. I couldn’t just forget, but I completely understood. Whenever there was a tragedy elsewhere in the world, I would feel heavy hearted that day, but the next, it was as if nothing would happened. The difference this time was that I had lived it.</p>

<p>I deleted my instagram for a few days because I couldn’t handle that everyone had gone on with their lives, as though nothing had happened. No one else I followed felt the same anxiety I did. I couldn’t, for the life of me, stop reading up on Stephen Paddock. I thought maybe if I knew why he did this, I would feel some sort of peace. But the stories kept mixing up and nothing felt right, and I felt more and more distraught. I knew I had to stop, because it was hindering my sleep and study schedules, but I couldn’t. Plus, reading other people’s stories made me feel less crazy. I read about one guy who wondered why he hadn’t died, when people around him did. Another woman talked about how she typed her whole account of the story with butterflies and a racing heart - exactly how I typed this up. She said she couldn’t be in large crowds anymore. She’s okay during the day, but scared when nightfall hits. I understood all of this.</p>

<p>I was sitting in one of my classes when I suddenly felt a wave of anxiety, and I sat in the bathroom for 20 minutes and cried. Every night, when I couldn’t sleep because I was too scared, I would cry because I felt so mad that I was too scared to sleep. Then I felt guilty for being so shaken up, when I wasn’t even at the concert. I didn’t see any bullets. I didn’t see anyone die. The worst I saw was someone who’d been shot. How could I be this scared when others saw people die right in front of them? What right did I have to be this traumatized, when I had been in the same hotel room as people who had watched their friend get shot?</p>

<p>I looked back on texts from the night of the shooting and took screenshots - why did everyone else hear gun shots? Why did we evacuate at around 10:15 PM, and then again at around 11? Why did we really believe there were multiple shooters? Why were there other reports of multiple shooters? I know confusion and panic and hysteria can make you believe you heard or saw things you didn’t, but the timelines still aren’t adding up. I still don’t understand. I’m not saying there was a conspiracy. I just want to know the truth. I thought maybe writing out my story would help me get some of my thoughts off my chest, so here I am.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>watched her video! I&#39;m not sure if she remembers everything correctly but I whole heartedly believe she &#39;s telling her truth. The only thing I find strange about the multiple shooters theory is why weren&#39;t there more dead bodies found at various locations? Not saying I don&#39;t believe these people, I think that with bullets ricocheting and all the chaos that you can see or hear things that didn&#39;t actually happen. I mean, we totally believed there were multiple shooters that night but now Im unsure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for sharing this. There&#39;s lots of people here (and all over the world I&#39;m sure) still trying to make sense of what happened that night.

    <div class="md"><p>100% - a lot of what I remember was a blur but I clearly remember the blood all over the side of his body and the bandage around his arm. Blood was concentrated around the wound. He also said he was shot. Everyone was telling him to sit down because he looked so daze and like he might pass out. The only thing I&#39;m unsure of is where he said he was shot</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks. Just looked through your screens too. You seem like the first person to actually provide some evidence to back up your claim. It&#39;s appreciated.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t, check out Jason Goodman (google Crowdsourcethetruth) and Jake Morphonios (google End Time News Report) - people like that on the ground in LV asking the tough questions and getting thrown out of places is what&#39;s keeping this alive right now.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe this is how I would have reacted before my baby was born. Now, I think I&#39;d be calm mama bear, but once we were safe, I know I&#39;d feel as if the emotional wounds from that night would never turn into scars. </p>

<p>I&#39;m so sorry you are experiencing these effects, and dont think you are less- entitled, for lack of a better word- to experiencing these deep emotions. It&#39;s still very raw, it&#39;s not even been a month! The rest of the world moves on, like the good busy ants they are, but that doesn&#39;t make this any less fresh and horrifying. </p>

<p>A man I grew up across the street from, who went to my church, was one of the eldest victims of the shooting. Most unexpected news I ever received. I hadn&#39;t thought about him in years, but as soon as I saw a friend&#39;s post about it, I was flooded with warm memories from my childhood. Every July 4th, he set off some of the biggest fireworks in town, and he always cleared a big spot in the yard for all us neighbor kids to watch. Every year, knowing a family of 9 is on a tight budget, he bought our whole family tickets to the Shriner&#39;s circus. At Halloween, he was our first and favorite house to go to, because he gave us full size candy bars and a can of soda. He and his wife always watched after us while mom went in to have yet another baby. </p>

<p>We are moving to Vegas in a couple weeks. These are the only connections I have to that night, but I felt this tragedy much more  deeply than I have previous ones. I have stayed up all hours, pouring over any news I can find. How can the news follow so closely for several days, giving all kinds of information that doesn&#39;t add up, only to suddenly sweep it under the rug without clearing up ANYTHING?</p>

<p>Based on everything I&#39;ve read, one theory makes sense, and I believe it about 94%. If it&#39;s true, then I doubt the truth will come out in our lifetime. I worry that I&#39;ll never stop obsessing over what happened. And as you can see in this community alone, there are thousands who can relate. </p>

<p>This won&#39;t likely help you sleep at night, but I hope it gives you permission to grieve without guilt, and know that you aren&#39;t overreacting emotionally to a very real, very terrifying experience that you were very much a victim of- not physically, maybe, but mentally. I hear you and I acknowledge your emotional process. I hope you find comfort in that. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for being so kind. I&#39;m so sorry about your loss. It&#39;s tough when your community loses someone during a tragedy. We lost a 23 year old in the shooting, just a year older than me, about 30 minutes from where I grew up. Two of my friends from elementary school knew him. The man you described sounds lovely. I&#39;m sure he is very missed.</p>

<p>Would you mind sharing the theory? I would love to give it a read. Thank you again for being so kind </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m wondering if the &quot;second round&quot; of shots that precipitated your second evacuation wasn&#39;t the series of little explosions they used to breach the doors of the two Mandalay rooms (134 and the 135 suite) with the broken windows. The timing seems close to right for that to be the case.  It may be that you never heard shots because you aren&#39;t that familiar with the sound of gunfire and didn&#39;t distinguish any sounds from the other distracting noises.</p>
