One big idea that i just do not understand is the importance of satan or lucifer.  I believe religion is the biggest conspiracy in modern history.  Religious dogma is the longest running scam in human history and is a wide-spread and extremely dangerous idea.  Why do so many of us critical thinkers believe in the concept of satan as behind/orchestrating anything when that concept is more bullshit from the religious cult community.  What do you all think and believe on this issue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was talking with a mason on here a few days ago who was very interesting. Pretty much was taking a gnostic point of view that all religions have many similarities over the years along with certain symbolism- much of it insightful, but generally The biblical God, Jewish God, Muslim God, etc are all false Gods while Satan is the opposite of that. All those Gods are jealous and vengeful. I think those in the know say Lucifer is something different from Satan, but still spawned from false beliefs. As he put it, it&#39;s like believing in &#39;false light and darkness&#39;. But there is some kind of organized structure to the universe, which is why some call it the great architect of the universe. But it&#39;s like the dark is fighting against the false light, so its an infinite loop of horse shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What proof do you have that satan js real?  Satan is just like every other religious icon and is based on old books by ignorant people.  Would you say zeus is real, or odin, or hades, or vishnu?  They are all stories  used to comfort and sedate the masses.  We want their to be ultimate evil so we dont have to admit that all the evil was cause eachother is just fucked up people.  We want to believe in an afterlife and someone watching out for us.  Yet humans are no closer to proving god or satan as they were thousands of years ago when the figures were first made up.</p>

<p>Look at all the images, look again... Everything is produced by chemtrails. Serpents, wings, scales, all the imagery our ancestors recorded also emerges. The giant, entire horizon spanning cloud of chemtrails I&#39;m showing you matches all descriptions in old texts. This is abandon/red dragon/destroyer/nibiru/satan, and so on. And really that&#39;s only the beginning.</p>

<p>Just start looking up man, it&#39;ll all become apparent soon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t subscribe to God and I am not selfish with no remorse. However, I do know religious people who are. At the end of the day you are going to be who you want to be God or no God. Those with God seem to think they can do what they want within reason and just pray it away</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My comment was not directed at anyone. Shakespeare and I both see humanity as corrupt and disingenuous. That can include all religions and all atheists. In my experience approximately half the Church are sincere and therefore deprive themselves of worldly pleasure in accordance with their principles.  As the World moves further into the devaluation of Life and inflation of Self, more sadness will likely follow. But then I could be wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you dismiss religion completely (keyword: completely) and all of its values and historical significance, you&#39;re walking backwards.</p>

<p>It&#39;s takes maturity and critical thinking to be able to tackle a topic like Christianity, see where it went right, where it went wrong, and how it has been used as a psy-op... whoa.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of the top 1% elite practice these ancient pagan rituals of  human sacrifice. A lot of satanic rituals were taken from ancient sacred teachings. For example activation of the 3rd eye, ability to see auras, tantrum sex etc are all part of their rituals. It started with Crowley and his church of Satan teaching elite people and even celebrities (led zeppelin, Sammy Davis jr, the beatles), but this knowledge has always been with royalty since the temple of solomon, king David, knights templar, freemasonry, OTO, hermetic order of the golden dawn, etc I would think.</p>
