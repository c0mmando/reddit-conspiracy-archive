       r/science are the real nuts here. They claim to be all about truth, yet they refuse to look at anything that goes against their own views. They mindlessly repeat everything they're told, so long as it fits the liberal brainwash agenda. You can't debate them, because as soon as they realize they're wrong, they band you and come up with an excuse, or start digging through post histories to ad hominem

       Here's the thing. It actually gets way worse than Weinstein. The sad part is, they will point to news reports in the mainstream media that did technically cover this. What they won't understand is the media was actually just covering its ass, not the story. One little article here and there will be seen by almost nobody, and the media is fully aware of that. The other option is maybe there are a couple good journalists out there and that's why it was reported those few times, but I'm a little too jaded to believe that. Make up your own mind. The fact of the matter is there are all kinds of testimonies, court cases, convictions, and news articles on pedos in Hollywood and other industries.

       Spread it where you can. There seems to be a lot of people who aren't aware of all of this proof that is available. It's already well documented in the courts and the media, including 60 minutes, LA Times, New York Times, The Independent, Daily Beast, CBS, etc. The only problem is that journalists seem to have really shitty memories, so they never add up all of the proof. They report on a single case once in a blue moon and pretend the problem isn't really that large, but it is.

       How do you even figure that?  Most countries have some sort of single payer health care which covers vaccines.  How does the pharma corp make any money globaly which most of the suppliers have relitivly cheap healthcare.

       FYI your second link didnt work.  Looks like the web servers firewall is blocking access.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is some interesting stuff, but is it reasonable to assume that because the entire industry is worth 30 billion that there is some shadiness involved in vaccines?  With the rise of anti-biotic resistant bacteria, and potential epidimics like N1-N1 Ebola i think it's reasonable that the market value of vaccines as a whole would go up.  Also as 3rd world countries develop the market in which vaccines are available will broaden also giving a higher market share.  I personally don't think vaccines show any signs of fuckery like say health related things like GMO and fat research do/did.
      </p>

       I could be wrong though.  Whats your opinion?

       I don't know.  I'm grappling with the issue because I'll be a dad any day.  So I've been reading books on both sides and trying to be as objective as I can be.  Drug companies have a long history of shady stuff and I'm inclined not to trust them, especially when some of these vaccines are blockbusters, like Gardasil.  What's bothered me so far is that, at least in other areas of reddit, you can't question the pro vaccine crowd without being labeled anti science.  Vaccines DO harm people, but the question is how many and how much.  The pro side says the numbers are so small that they're insignificant in light of the benefits.  Maybe true.  But I'm still bothered by being labeled a denier for questioning a 30 billion market run by people with a questionable track record and huge profit motive.

       I can understand being skeptical about people being in the pro vaccine camp and I am sympathetic to your worries about being a new father, but I think you should also be more skeptical of people who are anti vaccination.  See, you can question vaccines as long as your willing to learn and willing to accept what actual experts tell you.  If you're not willing to learn or accept actual science then don't be upset when people label you a denier.  I'm not trying to be rude or attack you, but this is just how the cycle goes, and for good reason.

       There are a lot of people who want to lie to you on both sides.  But one side doesn't have any evidence behind their claims.  One side has decades of evidence to back their claims up and the other has feelings and false claims.

       But I'm just a guy who works in IT.  I don't have a degree to back any of this stuff up, I just repeat what I see online and what little research Ive done.  (Here)[

       The preponderance of evidence is certainly with the pro vaccination side.  I don't particularly care what people label me on reddit.  The idea that may gain a little more traction in a sub like this, though, is that one side in this argument has a massive financial incentive, while the other really doesn't.  That doesn't invalidate peer reviewed large group studies, but it does warrant some consideration.  Studies cost money and most of them are done by the side with money.  What about the tobacco, opiate, and oil industry funding research showing their products are safe?  Like what this Scientific American

       That's bullshit logic. You didn't even read the links. A corporation has no incentive to fund fake studies that "prove" their product works unless they can actually get away with it. A phone that doesn't work will not sell, but a pharmaceutical drug with heavy side effects can be made to seem legit. Due to the placebo effect, a drug can be made to seem like it works way better than it actually does.

       I enjoyed flat earth stuff when it surfaced, like it is fun to imagine gravity as being no different than acceleration, but because of logic and reason, I of course land on spherical earth as my final belief on the matter what until [as Asimov and Sagan put it] substantial evidence supports the substantial claim. The fact I considered flat earth proves I am open to ideas, even if I dont shift my position after learning about the new idea, I let people speak and make their case.

       If you want to truly consider alternative ideas, I think it's valid to temporarily set aside everything you thought you knew and take the dive, see if it makes sense.  It's not like by doing so you permanently abandon your prior understanding and can never switch back to it.

       When someone is presenting you with a new theory or evidence that they say goes against what you 'know' then it's worth considering, or playing the game for a moment, that what you think you know, you don't actually KNOW. Too many people think they know things when in reality, the only things you KNOW for certain are those things you have directly experienced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Scientists too often call 'knowledge' what is actually consensus, built upon reading one another's research papers and trusting that what is described in them is an accurate reflection of the research that took place. Really, we know very little and that should mean we are open to all new evidence and all new theories, even ones claiming the earht is flat or that it is run by lizard people. Then you consider the evidence available and make a judgement solely on the basis of the evidence, without allowing your preconceived notions of what is and isn't possible to influence you. Always challenge your own basic assumptions. Far too many people have basic assumptions that they take to be a given, why they are not based upon their own direct experience. Basic assumption - the sun rises in the East, that one can stand because you witness it with your own eyes every day. The government would never do anything on purpose to harm its people - that's a basic assumption you have no direct experience of - yes you might not have experienced harm from the govenrment, you might have never seen harm done by the govt reported on the news etc, but you cannot rule it out, or deny the experience of others.

       Small, but important point. I finally caved in and decided to watch some flat earth videos on youtube just this week. While I watched them, I honestly stayed open minded, and considered what things I think I know would have to be false, and the widespread implications of that.

       I intentionally brought up flat earth because it is so silly it makes a great "acid test" for an open mind.  Vsauce did a great job explaining flat earth points first without being arrogant and condescending, then providing the science why their point is not feasible.

       I appreciate you being open to new ideas but I don't think that you thoroughly researched this subject with an open mind.  I've been deeply researching this for about 3 years and I have not come across this "substantial evidence" that supports a 1,000 mph spinning ball earth with water stuck to it.  I'm very curious what evidence you saw that made a spherical earth your "final belief on the matter"?

       Starting three years ago tried to find evidence that we are actually living on a spinning ball earth with water stuck to it instead of just accepting on faith that it's true.  As it turns out it is much harder to find any evidence of curvature than should be expected on a 25,0000 mile in circumference earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when there is no real evidence of a spinning ball earth and the only real source is a corrupt organization like NASA, it starts to become pretty  insane to continue to believe in it.  Have you ever questioned the subject for yourself or is this new to you?  If you have looked into the subject what made you continue to believe in a ball earth even though there is no real evidence of curvature?

       What is your evidence that gravity is what causes things to be "pulled" to the "core" as opposed to falling to the ground because it is more dense than the air.  Same with buoyant things?
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to have faith that gravity is real because there are no repeatable experiments that can accurately show that it exists.  To me that is when it becomes Scientism and not real science.

       Because it is more dense than the surrounding area so it grounds itself.  It can not stay suspended in the air because of its density.  What evidence do you have that "gravity" is a real force that is pulling the object to the core?

       Because there is an up and a down.  Dense objects fall down until they are stopped by the more dense ground.  If you fill a balloon with the right mixture of helium and air it will just hover there.  Why doesn't gravity effect it?   Again you have provided no evidence that gravity causes objects to be pulled to the ground.  The term gravity had to be invented to explain the heliocentric theory.  Without that term the whole theory falls apart.  You must have a great leap of faith to believe that gravity is real because nobody can recreate it or show with an experiment that it exist in reality and not just theory.

       As for your balloon example, gravity is working on the balloon. There's a mixture of helium and air inside the balloon. Helium is lighter than air, so there's just enough helium to compensate for the mass of the balloon itself, so the combination of the balloon and the air/helium mixture is the same density as the air.

       Sure, gravity is a theory, but it provides a necessary explanation as to why things move the way they do. If gravity is not a real force, what is your alternative theory?

       Math is a language that can be reverse engineered to fit a preconceived notion.  It can be worked out mathematically by making assumptions but the problem is there is no experiment that can show it is real force.  Henry Cavendish claimed to have done an experiment over 200 years that proved it but nobody can reproduce it.  Here is a
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A3H7Brj5NiE">
        video of a professional engineer discussing this subject
       </a>
       if you are interested.  He explains how it would have been possible to reverse engineer the big G or gravitational constant mathematically.  Brian Mullin is the guys name from the video and he has an entire series called "ball's out physics" where he questions all of this from a "science educated" point of view.  His youtube has been taken down but many people have mirrored his videos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just because you can work it out mathematically doesn't mean it is reality.  Notice there is no repeatable experiment that can prove gravity, only formulas on paper.

       That is exactly what you are saying with gravity.

       That's a good attitude to have, just put your head in the sand.

       It took me 15 seconds of googling to find that the flat earth theory's alternative explanation to gravity is 'universal acceleration'. Is this not something you subscribe to? At least it's an attempt to explain the direction in which objects of different density sort themselves, and not just "there just is a down".

       Omg, this really is the first that you have researched the subject.  No real flat earther believes in "universal acceleration".  That was put out by the flat earth society (a known shill organization) to make the movement look like a joke.  Anyone that actually does real research comes to the conclusion that the earth is not moving.

       Again you do have blind faith that gravity is a real force.     Gravity might be the best explanation if we really lived on a spinning ball earth.  If you come to the realization that we do not live on a spinning ball then the need for the magical force of gravity no longer exists.

Henry Cavendish claimed to have proved gravity with an experiment in his barn over 200 years ago yet nobody can repeat the experiment today.  You don't find that a little strange to say the least?

       There are no pictures from space.  NASA provides images and they even admit that they are photosphopped because "they have to be".  That is coming from Robert Simmon the 'Blue Marble' creature.  Images from a known corrupt organization is far from scientific proof.

       First of all we can only see in 2D, so can not tell if the lights in the sky are spherical or not.  Even if they were spheres what does that prove?  That is like saying that all of the billiard balls are round so the table has to be as well.

      <p>
       So why isn't everything a sphere in nature if it is most efficient?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        when matter coalesces it doesnt form discs but spheres (oil in water shaken up, welding spatter)

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not sure what those examples have to do with the earth?  That would just be a random guess that earth is a sphere without any actual evidence.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Where do discs naturally occur in nature?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You brought up disks not me.  Like I said erlier we can only see in 2D so the Sun and moon could be disks just like they could be spheres, we can't tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it sounds like the main evidence that you rely on for your spinning ball earth theory are images from NASA, you think the lights in the sky are spheres, and because physicists say so?
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a step back and see how weak that body of evidence is.  As long as you can admit that you have a belief that the earth is round and spinning that is fine.  Just don't say there is any variable, repeatable, and measurable evidence that backs that belief up.

       Your replies are pretty weak in my opinion. Spheres are all over and occur naturally, a tear drop is a sphere with physics creating the tail. Bubbles are spheres. Fire in zero-gravity is a sphere.

       Scientists do suffer from this, they invest their life into a theory and it is difficult to say they have been wrong the whole time. Dont misinterpret the last sentence, we do need people like this because history has proven some of these "nut jobs" were actually right the whole time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just have a conversation, do you still ask yourself if you could be wrong and do you try to disprove your findings to gain more confidence?

       But the difference is that I believed in a sphere earth for my entire life until 3 years ago when I decided to look for actual evidence instead of just blindly believing what I was told as a child.  You still have the same belief that we all did except you have not yet taken the time to ask for evidence or entertain the idea that you could be wrong.

      <p>
       Sure.  I'm open to a spinning ball earth if someone can provide actual evidence.  I'm not just going to say that it is fact because NASA gives some CGI images though.  If we were really on a 25,000 mile circumference spinning ball someone would be able to show proof of curvature.  After 3 years of searching I have found no proof of curvature or any spinning of the earth.  Saying that objects in the sky are round so we must be living a spinning ball is not science, I'm sorry.

       That is what the evidence shows as far as I can tell.  The alternative is that we are an insignificant accident that came from nothing by nothing.  That is way more unbelievable than the fact the we were actually created for a purpose.

       Big pharma, the Bilderbergs, (((international bankers))), Hollywood, climate """scientists""" and other groups got together to create an information cartel, where the only acceptable journal articles were ones that personally benefited them. They pushed their narrative far and wide - see: weed being demonized but far worse opioids like fentanyl getting a free pass, anyone investigating flouridation's real effects being instantly blackballed, and the constant degenerate propaganda vomited up on the silver screen.

       I love how people think post histories are some how like off limits? Or shouldn't be used against them....
      </p>
      <p>
       In the real world evidence is often used to prove a point. That often includes recordings,  physical objects, and written testimonies as an example a past comments. It's perfectly normal and is done every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet some how when people do it in here, in a civil argument/discussion the shit hits the fan. Usually we hear it's 'creepy' or 'its a personal attack'...
      </p>
      <p>
       Well fuck, should of thought of ALL the possible consequences when solidifying your idea(s)/belie/outlook, and making them real via penning them down.

       Because unless it's a debate over morality, past statements can in no way serve to benefit the discussion. Even when discussing morality, bringing up post history is a tu quoque fallacy and character assasination 99% of the time. Usually, it goes like "oh look one time you got X wrong it was actually Y, argument DISPROVEN!!!11!!1 #HILLARY2020!!" This isn't a criminal trial, we don't have character witnesses to attest to how PC someone is.

       Yeah they can, let's say we are debating climate change if you have a history of denying climate change, I can refer to those as proof no matter what I say you will deny it, perhaps you mention in comments you're a jahovahs witness why would I debate or continue to talk about medical treatment when you have a history of being against it and won't change your mind

       Frankly I've seen OP's exact message posted like a dozen times on this subreddit. It's
       <strong>
        disingenuous
       </strong>
       and basically
       <strong>
        propaganda.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone knew that Weinstein was a sexual predator. People made jokes about it in award shows, TV shows, and more. The reason people didn't pay too much attention to it was because:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         the only people who could do something about it were Hollywood themselves where Weinstein clearly had a lot of power
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         the moment his power waned, he is being thoroughly ostracized and shunted out.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       To compare, Trump was also known for his sexual deviances for ages. What, with the weird tabloid stories of him calling reporters up to brag about sexual conquests and not to mention those downright creepy Stern interviews and talking about Ivanka and Tiffany.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when he tried to get into power, instead of disavowing and ostracizing him like how Hollywood has, to Weinstein, a certain segment of the country voted him into the most powerful position on earth.

       I know it feels like that but much like why the Weinstein story has been publicized trying to highlight the seeming hypocrisy of Hollywood, I'm trying to play the same game highlighting the seeming hypocrisy of people such as OP and yourself (and that post you submitted about deporting immigrants is terribly racist) who are most likely Trump supporters looking to sensationalize the Weinstein story in poor faith.

       Are you suggesting that Weinstein is not deserved of the coverage? And further that people somehow "sensationalized" the story of a major Hollywood player being a rapist, simply to... make Trump look good? Or? I don't get it. And it's your job to bash Trump to offset that or something?

       I never said that. I said that the primary reason to publicize the Weinstein story should be to expose the systematic and problematic behavior of men in powerful positions and the resulting effect it has on the health and safety of women. I worry however that a lot of the coverage I see has been twisted to serve an agenda that doesn't benefit women or the sexually harassed in any which way. This post is one of them. The way Fox News and others covered it -- as a smear on Democrats or democratic donors -- is another example.

       Not quite, because I'm only doing it to point out the hypocrisy. I don't go out of my way calling Trump a sexual predator when it isn't germane to the discussion.

       That makes sense unless the two eventually join hands, and make clear that bending over and sucking dick is the only way you get ahead these days.  Can't rule out (yet) that being the ultimate message here.

       The two are very similar, but let me posit a frightening theory:

      <p>
       What if this Weinstein stuff is NOT meant to destroy him, but to glorify him and make it clear that this is the way and the ONLY way to get ahead in America, especially given who we have as President and the faltering economy in many respects?

       Yeah... Trump... The same guy who created his own beauty pageant and modeling company so his wife and daughter wouldn't be subject to sexual harassment via "managers and reps" who would sell them to folks like Weinstein for their 10%. Seems to me like Trump knew what was up with these entertainment types and set it up so his family could be protected by him in those fields.

       Absolutely, I mean; I have always voted in Presidential races, fundamentally so I can justifiably complain.
I voted for Obama round one but became so fed up with politics I sat on my hands for round 2.

       I mean it's true. Take a step back and look at what policies the GOP or Trump have enacted. Unless you were part of the 1% or higher, you're not getting lickety-split out of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stock market is up, great! How much do you have in it? The wealthy have much more of their wealth in stocks, they've seen bigger gains than anyone else from the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>
       The healthcare system is getting fucked to high heaven under Trump. What good does that do you? Are you getting better healthcare now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's decimating education and environment funding. Not to mention loosening labor laws if he can get away with it. Or at least that's the GOP mantra. Are you a big business owner with thousands of employees you can slash and fire away at short notice? If not what do you gain? You're only losing job security.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is voting for Trump not voting against your interests? I'll take that all back if your net worth is over $2M or your net annual income is over $400k.

       I ain't falling for that partisan bullshit, Paul Krugman. They both sucked.  One would have us going directly for war with Russia, the other has us in drone campaigns that is continuing from the last savior. Regulatory mandates on medicine drove up prices ridiculously and mandating purchasing medical plans just drove it further for those who were already paying. The market is in an asset bubble with no more tricks from the FED so the pain can only get kicked down the road for that much less.

       What and whom are you replying to? You can’t fall for partisan bullshit when the person you responded to was discussing one fucking candidate. You may have some subconscious partisan hackery going on upstairs if you imagined Hillary’s name where it never once appeared.
Bizarre.

       I remember in my civics class, the electoral college was described as a check on the reactionary impulses of the American people. And it seems right - had Hillary gotten the vote, we would be at war, and the ((globalist)) agenda would be in full force. The founding fathers had extremely good foresight when creating it.

       You’re wrong on so many levels. 
Joking about it and knowing it’s true that someone is a predator, not just a sleaze ball are two different things about two different conditions.

       Was he a criminal? Maybe. So yeah the police could have done something in multiple states and countries!

       ... is it? I challenge you to find a single post on this forum about Weinstein being a sexual predator, prior to this month. Now you're all over this story that the MSM broke.

       But being completely dismissive isn't the right approach either, now is it? The way non-mainstream lines of thought are shot down is ridiculous to say the least. What I also am pissed about is people suddenly jump on the bandwagon the instant MSM covers it, but before they won't give it the time of day. That's like going from 0 to 100 in a single day and that is the thing that pisses me off, not a healthy dose of skepticism.

       It's not far off. A lot of people talk a lot of nonsense. That doesn't mean that everything everybody says is nonsense, but it does mean you need some kind of yardstick for judging the reliability of the information you're given. This tends to come in the form of evidence, in most cases.

       Without some at-least semi-reputable news source presenting the information, the vast majority of people wouldn't even hear about it. What would you suggest as the alternative?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        *Edit: Why not be as skeptical of the MSM itself? There is a lot of proof out there that the MSM spins false stories, so why suddenly believe a known liar and manipulator of truth?

      <p>
       It's not mutually exclusive. You can remain skeptical of the MSM whilst not believing every green text post you see on 4chan.

       We are kind-of talking about the same thing. I am not defending the out-there conspiracies that don't have a shred of proof, though it might be hard to figure out which is which.
      </p>
      <p>
       I kind-of agree with you, but we disagree on the amount that people are willing to listen with an open mind. I say that people should use logic to arrive at conclusions, so even if a credible news source does not report it, we can use our own logic to arrive at conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       An example: A conspiracy theory about the Illuminati and how they control everything in the world. (Not sure if you already believe in this or not). At first glance, sounds really out there, but let's use our logic.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Do a few people control incredible amounts of power and money? Yes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Have Governments lied and manipulated before? Almost every chance they get.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Does power generally corrupt? Absolutely.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Can we trust corporations and authority figures to act in the best interests of the general person? Most probably not.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Therefore it is logical to believe in the Illuminati, a select group of individuals that control a lot of power and wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I use logic to try and reason which conspiracies might be true. It pisses me off that most people will not make even this tiny amount of effort.

       Technically true. You don't need evidence to be right. You do need evidence to be convincing however.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're right based on no evidence and a blind guess, sure, whatever, have a cookie. But it's not a solid foundation to build upon. The next blind guess you make could easily be wrong. And will likely be wrong. Because your process is wrong, it's broken.

       It's cute that you're still in the stage where telling people what they think rather than asking them is what you hold instead of a point of view.  Maybe in 10 years you might be able to grow enough as a human to actually have a conversation with someone instead?

       There was some female comic who said a prominent male comic took their dick out and jerked it in front of her. People assumed it was Louis CK and ran with it. She pretty quickly said that it wasn't Louis, but no one listened to that. Eventually after repeating that it wasn't Louis for years, people finally believed her and asked her why she didn't deny it back then.

       That's the trouble with most taboo information. If it were unequivocally proven next week (it won't be) that Oswald didn't hit Kennedy and that there were multiple shooters involved, including one in the storm drain, the response wouldn't be "OMG, conspiracy theorists were right all along, how could we be so deceived" but rather "OMG, who cares, everybody knew that. I saw it on TV once. Get a life."
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with many conspiracies isn't so much that nobody knows about them. The problem is that while almost everyone does know about them, we're all told that it's only a tiny minority of lunatics and schizos that seriously entertain them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If everyone suddenly realized that everyone else (except for the very few hopelessly deluded) at least has an inkling that things aren't great the way they are and that several groups of highly organized, highly powerful individuals actively subvert the public's will at every turn to keep things this way, then the metaphorical lights would suddenly turn on and leave no place for the snakes to hide anymore. Once we stop thinking that we're the only ones seeing this shit (even if we may be the only ones who actively look for it), we can attempt to find common denominators of insight with our fellow person and gradually peel away the layers of deception from there.

       I think people in power turn into pedophiles, to be honest. When you're that wealthy and you can exercise a certain amount of power, certainly some would strip the boundaries in their lives. Getting up

       I think what is often happening is drugs and alcohol are used to trick someone into engaging in abhorrent behavior like pedophilia. This is then used to blackmail and control them, perpetuating a cycle of abhorrent behavior linked with elites. Because they need to be controlled by deep state intelligence actors.

       I'm honestly very curious about what the actual mechanism is. I've read studies about how exposure to certain pornography and sex acts leads to constantly chasing greater perversions, because normal sex acts get boring. I wonder if this is just the same effect on overdrive. I mean, if just watching enough pornography can push people into so many varied fetishes, I would assume that having the money and power to pretty much literally date your every desire would eventually lead to needing to constantly "up the ante" in terms of what gets you off.
      </p>
      <p>
       I doubt that alone could explain it all, but I do wonder if it is a part of it.

       More likely: people who enjoy dominating other people tend to go into careers where they can amass a lot of power to hold over others. These same people and victimize children, because they like the power trip and they can.

       The global elite and the secret society they funded (illuminati) are luciferians. Luciferians worship lucifer with child sacrifice and pedophilia. Their agenda is to push people to go against what the Bible says and to lead people to mortal sin. They only real defense-since this is a spiritual war fir our souls- is to accept jesus as your Lord and Savior and repent for sins. I was agnostic most of my life and realized this was the case after many years of research and observation.

       Not at all. Power can make you more likely to abuse people, whether it be emotionally or physically, yes. But sexually abuse children? I think you already have to have the proclivity to do so there.

       If someone considered a "conspiracy theorist" had told us a month ago that HW is a habitual predator, most people would've thought it was bullshit. When they hear the phrase "conspiracy theory," they associate it with crazy people talking about hollow Earth and the reptilian overlords that secretly run the world. Most people don't stop and make a distinction between the crazy people and those who just ask hard questions and try to expose some ugly truths about society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, for most people facts aren't facts until they hear about it from authority figures and the media. They live in a filtered world, and most of them like it that way. They tend not to like anyone who comes along and disrupts their sleep.

       i wonder how many of those crazy people are paid bad actors. Sure, maybe there are some people under these, who fell for the bad actors, but i doubt the majority of those crazy people are actually that crazy. they just like the monzeys they get for acting that way.

       People are using the Weinstein shit as a way to prove they are right about the other conspiracies they talk about. "If this was true, so must everything else!" Meanwhile there's been talk about the "casting couch" of Hollywood for years and years now. Shiiiiet we even have a porn genre based on it.

       It's much much bigger than Weinstein. This is the tip of the iceberg.  The bigger picture involves the elitists..the ones that have control and power over Hollywood/News Media/Education System/Banks/Oil Industry/Transportation...They get away with anything and everything right under our very noses.

       we create the world. the rich are dependent on the poor and not the other way round. If the poor stop to give the rich their food for fake-monzeys, they are going to starve. Ok, they gonna kill the poor before, because they have weapons. But they need to find new poor people doing agriculture, because they can't do it themselves.

       It's a classic conspiracist manoeuvre.  Like they try and turn any pedo ring busted anywhere in the world into proof that Pizzagate wasn't just a fantasy.  Or for that matter retconning pizzagate into pedogate when it became increasingly apparent they had been making fools of themselves.

       I think it's a way to change the conversation. Instead of people having to admit they're wrong, which everyone hates to do, they can say "everybody knew already".  Which if you think about it, is a non-admission of them being wrong.  They just abandon the wrong position and adopt the new knowledge as obvious.

       Just like you were a crazy conspiracy theorist if you thought the DNC and MSM were biased against Bernie Sanders. That's the one that popped the bubble for me. I had my observations marginalized and dismisses as a "conspiracy theory" repeatedly, and then was proven right -- I was even underestimating the extent of it. Now that line will never work on me again. This is going to keep happening to more and more people.

       I don't see anything that the linked account said that related to Trump or redpill or incels. You are just projecting your political views where they're not welcome.

       No idea. Wasn't suggesting validity of it either way, just linking the user because i saw it elsewhere.  Is it possible that because he was linked elsewhere, people are now going back and upvoting the posts? or are they locked/archived?

       I’ve talked to a lot of people and it’s crazy just how many of them already know that this world is corrupt as fuck. The problem here is that we can’t seem to make big connections and communities.

      <p>
       I mean, sure, we have a subreddit full of us and i’m sure that there’s other online communities as well, but I’m referring to people we actually know. If we could all be open without being afraid of being looked down upon I feel like we could accomplish something soon.

       Yes and I read the
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/3nq4ll/ashley_judd_reveals_sexual_harassment_by_studio/?st=j944b3jd&amp;amp;sh=7cc2559d">
        thread in this comment section
       </a>
       . The majority of people either want proof or agree with the accusations saying that "Weinstein is sleazy" or that "something tells me it rhymes with Harvey Weinstein." Is asking for proof defending someone? Because personally I'd like proof for claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet you supported the claim that people who accused Weinstein of being a sexual predator were being called conspiracy nuts. OP also implies that it was commonplace to be called a conspiracy nut if you accused Weinstein of being a sexual predator since his claim is "If last month you believed Harvey Weinstein was a sexual predator, you were a conspiracy nut." Now do you have proof for your claim?

       Honestly, conspiracy theorists need to grow thicker skin and realize that they are standing for truth, not "crazy talk". And that starts with rejecting some "theories" that give them a bad name (Example: Flat Earth) for which there is ample evidence to dismiss.

       A lot of people know deep down that there are some incredibly evil people who do some unbelievably evil shit in this world. They know it exists deep down somewhere in their subconscious, but they refuse to acknowledge it until something like this is made public and plastered all over by the media. Then it’s all “I knew it all along”.

      </p>
      <p>
       Pissed me off so much. That person and the millions like them are the reason things like abuse in Hollywood and pizzagate are allowed to go on. These people keep their heads in the sand, act like everything is roses, and berate anybody who brings up things like pizzagate

       There's no way a legit comment said that. It either never happened, you're wording poorly, or it was made by someone that could be instantly flagged as sarcasm or a troll.

       Everyone knows Hollywood does this shit and they've known it for years and years. It's just that we are living in a climate that actually punishes it now.

       I'm not talking about Weinstein, I'm talking about in general how it was understood that hollywood producers and directors frequently had expectations that aspiring actresses had to perform certain favors if they wanted to get cast in things. It might have been a surprise for a lot of people that this happened to men as well.

       Uh no? You'd be an idiot not to think that there are sexual predators in positions of power?

      <p>
       I think you're missing the forest for the trees here. The conspiracy isn't that there are sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein with money and power. Everyone knows that. Just look at all the scandals with the BBC in England. The conspiracy is that they get away with it.

       If you follow some of the conspiracy theories from years ago it seems to be that it takes a few years for the world to catch up with what is being proposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read all about the Jimmy Saville rumours years ago, the whole NSA captures everything rumours, the criminal acts of so many politicians etc... those were all just 'crazy' until of course the stories were proven true.
      </p>

       Lumping everything they can onto crazy conspiracy theories I think works for TPTB, to stave off serious investigations for years and perhaps forever...

       Questioning the official story on an event is different, in my mind, than being a ‘conspiracy theorist’. Healthy skepticism is fine, obviously stupid shit like pizzagate is what brings the stigma.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you label yourself as a conspiracy theorist, and believe in chem trails and fluoride as mind control, I’d say the stigma against you is warranted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think that the official story in any scenario is not the whole truth, then you’re on point.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s a lot of crazy and ostensibly dumb shit that gets posted here, and the people that post it and believe it probably do have something wrong with them.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s a big difference between not believing anything because “the government/msm/whaever boogieman you want” is controlling the narrative, and reserving judgement because people in power have a stake in the game when it comes to reporting on world events.

       Everyone believes the women claiming Weinstein did it.

      <p>
       But the women with claims against Trump are being pushed aside. Curious as to why.

       I really don't understand this post.  On the one hand, if you were to tell me last month that a Hollywood producer was a sexual predator, I wouldn't be surprised at all.  I doubt very much that most people would be surprised at that statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, if you were to accuse someone of being a sexual predatory before there was evidence of being one, then yes, you probably would be accused of being off your rocker, because you didn't have evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still am unclear who Harvey Weinstein actually is.  I couldn't name a single thing he's done.  However, it is fairly common trope that Hollywood producers and such are sleazebags.  That's not surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really don't understand all the hoopla over Weinstein.  Yes, he should be persecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  Yes, he should lose his job.  Others who have done the same that he did should face the same.  But, is it really surprising?  Does it really have to be on the news everyday?  Am I missing something here?

       He's a huge Hollywood producer, certainly up there with the most powerful in the world. His films have won 81 Oscars, and he was thanked in Oscar speeches more times than god.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes it's big news he has finally been busted. Just because you've never heard of him doesn't make him an unknown figure

       Ever hear about "the casting couch"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Metaphorically, it describes how a young woman desiring to be an actress but possessing no contacts, no friends and very little money of her own, is pressured into sleeping with a well-connected rich director, studio executive or other "Hollywood bigwig" in exchange for a breakout role in a movie, television, radio, theater play or anything that would jumpstart her career to make her rich and famous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Literally speaking, it's the couch in the bigwig's private trailer or room, because the young woman doesn't rate the formality and expense of a hotel room bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I recall, Alfred Hitchcock made a young actress's life absolutely miserable when she wouldn't go along with his advances.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was 75 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's good that this problem is finally getting addressed in Hollywood, even for a little bit.

       I am admittedly fairly ignorant about Weinstein, but from what I've read, he did some grimy shit, but pretty much the women he exploited made the choice to be exploited so I don't fault Weinstein from what I know. Nor do I have any compassion for the women he exploited with their own knowledge.

       If you believed Harvey Weinstein was a sexual predator a month ago based on, like, his Instagram profile, or some emails he sent about a napkin, then you believe things without adequate proof. This remains true even if a week later the fake news media uncovered that you were right.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's like saying, oh, if I said last week that Trump would tweet "I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!", everyone would think I make a prediction based on nothing at all, but there you go, he just tweeted it. I mean, yes, but that doesn't mean people would be wrong thinking I can't predict Trump tweets.

       I can say though, in the last year or so, a lot more of my friends that I never thought believed in "conspiracy theories" have been much more open about them.  Especially since the Vegas shooting.  People I've never heard say a word about conspiracies, start talking about vegas and somehow end up on building 7.  Its an interesting turn of events recently.  I feel like a lot of people are either opening their eyes and ears, or conspiracies have been getting more exposure so people feel more comfortable speaking openly about it.  Hopefully this sticks and open conversation motivates people to begin to pay closer attention.

       I think Weinstein is a Patsy to try and cover up the depths of depravity. Sort of like saying 'yeah, look Hollywood does have it's sleazeballs, look how bad it really is'. But hes accused of sexually harassing adult females in a sort of subjective way. By exposing Weinstein they're subliminally making you think this must be as bad as it gets thereby creating cover for the really fucked up individuals.

       r/science are the real nuts here. They claim to be all about truth, yet they refuse to look at anything that goes against their own views. They mindlessly repeat everything they're told, so long as it fits the liberal brainwash agenda. You can't debate them, because as soon as they realize they're wrong, they band you and come up with an excuse, or start digging through post histories to ad hominem

       I mean it's true. Take a step back and look at what policies the GOP or Trump have enacted. Unless you were part of the 1% or higher, you're not getting lickety-split out of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The stock market is up, great! How much do you have in it? The wealthy have much more of their wealth in stocks, they've seen bigger gains than anyone else from the stock market.
      </p>
      <p>
       The healthcare system is getting fucked to high heaven under Trump. What good does that do you? Are you getting better healthcare now?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump's decimating education and environment funding. Not to mention loosening labor laws if he can get away with it. Or at least that's the GOP mantra. Are you a big business owner with thousands of employees you can slash and fire away at short notice? If not what do you gain? You're only losing job security.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is voting for Trump not voting against your interests? I'll take that all back if your net worth is over $2M or your net annual income is over $400k.
