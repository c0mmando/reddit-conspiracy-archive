        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No telling who was the shooter. No telling his or her motive. We just don&#39;t have enough information.</p>

<p>But it&#39;s abundantly clear that Stephen Paddock was a government agent of some kind. Probably FBI. He worked in Vegas for the FBI at the time, probably identifying and keeping tabs on shady figures (they are plenty in Vegas).</p>

<p>Evidence:
1. No online history WHATSOEVER.
2. Moved constantly.
3. Trained with guns.
4. Knowledgeable of explosives.
5. Pilot.
6. Was in regular contact with FBI as a kid (his dad was FBI Most Wanted).
7. Inexplicable wealth.
8. Career history of random, bland jobs at government contractors.
9. All of his past homes in border-ish states with 
10. Hardly knew his neighbors.
11. No family.
12. Foreign girlfriend (no entangling/identity-compromising relationship issues).</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t just some drunk with a gambling problem. That&#39;s the most absurd thing I&#39;ve ever heard.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure he was the shooter, or, if he was, why he was the shooter. I&#39;m not speculating as to that. I&#39;m simply pointing out the obvious signs that Stephen Paddock worked for the FBI.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know a couple Hells Angels that say paddock ran weapons and drugs as an informant for the FBI. They say the hotel room was basically a sting gone wrong, it was a massive deal that turned violent, The FBI needed to keep it a secret because paddock was moving large amounts of cocaine and unregulated weapons, it would of been a horrible black stain for the FBI, so they forced it to become the shooting that unfolded. keep the eyes of the public on the fake news.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paddock was shot dead before the crowd shootings even started, that&#39;s why campos was there early. The buyers were able to escape but once they got out of the building a gun fight broke out, hence the extra shooters, the FBI comes into the room paddock is dead. The situation is dicey because theres a lot of shady shit that went into setting the deal up, and theres multiple civilians being shot from the fire fight outside of the building, so they need a diversion, break the windows, fire some rounds.</p>

<p>know a couple Hells Angels</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as in they know nothing, at all, about police procedure. Local PD level, never mind the feds, would never set up a buy in a location that they could not stack tactical units around. So just the fact that he had the room next door punches huge holes in the theory of it being a sting op. Plus as I&#39;ve mentioned before large scale conspiracy stings don&#39;t require risk to reward wise the same level of &quot;caught red handed&quot;. You do that for lower level crimes like drug deals etc where conspiracy charges are not high enough for a law enforcement goal. </p>

<p>but large scale conspiracy charges just don&#39;t require 20+ guns in the room, with ammo + buyer + shooter etc. They could of busted anyone for it well before it reached that level. Don&#39;t confuse movie sting ops and real life. Also as someone who knows a ton of law enforcement due to getting a Criminal Justice degree it&#39;s flat out insulting to suggest that any given federal agent is a coin flip away from &quot;Well damn, this went wrong! Time to kill a bunch of people!&quot;. </p>

<p>I mean look I understand where I&#39;m posting this and so on. So there is going to be total mistrust of large scale gov, law enforcement and the media. That&#39;s 100% ok. It goes hand in hand with conspiracy stuff and that&#39;s fine. My problem has always been this idea that just because a person goes into federal law enforcement they become this soulless monster waiting to do whatever their puppet master demand. &quot;Hey open fire on that crowd agent Jones!&quot; and they just do it. </p>

<p>You think the guys in tactical just want to get their gun on? Get the bad guys but if they get away might as well shoot something? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s anyone&#39;s guess as to why.  But common sense would point to him not being able to take with him, items or persons on a plane ride back.  I think he met with FBI to load up on weapons.  I think he might have even picked up the other person with him who did the shooting.  1 person shooting, yet knocks out 2 windows.  Wearing gloves because as its been reported, he had sensitive hands.  I think it was for finger prints.  I think he was going to sell firearms to someone and whomever that was, did him in.  Maybe that was the initial noise that made security go check up on the floor to see where it came from?  Killing Paddock.  Then hammer out the windows.  One of the shooters had to of been keeping an eye on the camera monitors that were set up.  I think one was firing in to the crowd, then another one was playing look out.  Noticed fat boy Jesus and dropped some rounds at him... I don&#39;t even know if I believe that to be honest.  I definitely don&#39;t believe that engineer&#39;s story, the guy who went on Ellen with Jesus.  That guy just screams plant, probably fbi.  There&#39;s so much wrong in this thing, it baffles me that the MSM just moved on.  I see really no mention of anything about it... the fucking biggest attack on us with guns, and nothing.  Hell that Jesus kid has a fucking Corvette sitting in his driveway... Maybe he was friends with Paddock?  Paddock visited Vegas a lot, from what they say... what if they established a friendship, and Paddock got Jesus the Corvette?? </p>

<p>I wish I was in on the FBI investigation, I would love just an update from them at this point.</p>

Hell I haven&#39;t heard him mentioned in any alternative news.  It makes sense that there&#39;s another shooter.  His hotel room service order said guests: 2.  There were 2 positions knocked out of the casino windows.  People saying they heard 2 different shooters, at least.</p>

<p>Maybe that&#39;s why they haven&#39;t really released much.  They found evidence linking him there and are follwing him or tapping his phone or some shit.  Maybe he&#39;s gone to the Russian embassey in Mexico or some shit... lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah. now i got a idea. its nothing more, but to me, it sounds alot better, then anything i heard from the FBI and LVMPD lol. im going to post my reply to someone from a different thread regarding that link i supplied. &quot;when i watched this video, i asked myself, does bruce sound like he would be capable of a mass shooting? i believe he sounds more so, then stephen. one possibility that i think is possible : Stephen was working with/for the FBI, he enlists the help of his brother bruce, bruce ends up having some &quot;episode&quot; and stephens ends up dead, bruce burgles stephens house after the shooting (To remove things incriminating/of value?). the original op was possibly a sting, or a fema drill. but wildcard bruce, ends up making a complete mess of what was intended to be a very simple op/drill. i think this is the most reasonable idea. because comparing what &quot;we know&quot; about stephen, compared to bruce, stephen seems the unlikely choice if you had to pick one of the brothers. erics first interview, seemed like he was in complete disbelief stephen did this. then the 2nd interview, he was completely buying it. maybe the fbi/police explained a little to him, and got him to run with the narrative of stephen. i mean, would you want to be the officer/agent in charge of one of your workers crazy brothers going apeshit? be interested to hear what others think about this&quot;.</p>

<p>Only the dumbest of criminals? Why?</p>

<p>Really? So you and I decide to sell/buy widgets from each other and need to set up a buy location. I suggest a dead end room on the 32 floor of a hotel in the city known the world over for having some of the highest level of surveillance tech in the entire world. You&#39;re not going to go say something like &quot;No lets meet on the ground floor room of this shit tier hotel on the edge of town&quot;? </p>

<p>Like did you see Dusk Til Dawn? No Country for Old Men? Ya know, the back your damn car up to the door of the room on the back side of the hotel that faces a field. No.. Why would you want to do that when looking to move heavy amount of widgets!? Hell no I want to lug my widgets past 100s of cameras and 32 floors of elevator stops. Maybe take the stairs, for 32 floors. </p>

<p>I mean come now. Even if were going to trade a thumb drive, all spy movie style I&#39;m STILL never, ever going to meet in a hotel, in a city, known for having HD surveillance. That&#39;s crack head robbing a 7-11 level of stupid. Anyone in the market for an arms deal (and I still highly doubt that was what happened) is not stupid enough to ever, ever do it in a huge vegas hotel. It&#39;s not even a mater of hide in plain sight it&#39;s having 100s of HD digital cameras on you at all times. </p>

<p>as for the OP, Paddock is too old for the FBI. You&#39;re not going to have an agent of that age in the field. Why? Being the feds have unlimited resources and there is no reason to have it be him when you could set up any of 1000s of other agents in their 40s to so the same thing. &quot;But.... but he had connections!&quot;. Really? To sell his legally bought guns? Wow.. Where can I get that sort of hardware too!!? Oh right, my local gun store, tomorrow. </p>

<p>hiding in plain sight is not the same as lugging heavy crap 32 floors up past 100s of digital HD level cameras. Then lugging lots of crap back out down 32 floors past 100s of digital HD cameras. I mean sure if we were talking about a conspiracy of trading info then maybe a Vegas high rise hotel location helps the narrative. It&#39;s easy to explain why you might be in Vegas, for anyone.</p>

<p>If it was any other hotel or city other than Vegas, a city known for cameras everywhere I might be more willing to buy into some of the theories of deals/meets. The problem is no one wants to be filmed when doing shady crap. You do understand that a decent conspiracy theory needs to hold up to common sense a little bit too, right? The entire point of conspiracy like thinking is to question so why when one questions theories being throw around it&#39;s all of sudden a bad thing? </p>

<p>again, I have a degree in Criminal Justice and live a gov based town of Sacramento. I know personally and have talked with every level of law enforcement from local PD to superior court judges.  Ex US district DA&#39;s live in my neighborhood, that&#39;s now meh no big deal federal level anything is when you live in a government based town.  So yeah, I sort of have a hard time with a whole lot of the narrative that ignore past confirmed sort of busts for people/groups for conspiracy ops (that I studied as part of pre law) and then default back to &quot;and then the gov just started shooting......&quot;. Same for the the gov just let the shooting happen. Same for the idea that there was this huge arms deal but no tactical response stacked and ready to go. 
That&#39;s just now how it works. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a problem with conspiracy theories, at all. I fact I&#39;ve always liked them but there is a still a base level line of common thinking that should be applied to any given issues. Someone mentioned this before it use to be that a conspiracy theory was at least well crafted. Sticking with common sense and some what grounded in reality, even if the view point was different. Now? Now it just seems like someone makes up some wild ass idea and three other people go &quot;Yup!&quot; and we are done. </p>

<p>for some reason this case has brought some of the worst in people when it come to the low effort. Over and over people keep saying this or that is due to an active investigation as to why certain info is not out there etc but despite that being how every investigation is ran people are still going &quot;Yeah I hear you but.............&quot;. It&#39;s just bizarre. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I’m not special forces, but if the elite wear gloves, it’s probably not a bad idea. I think most people cut the finger off more for their finger fitting in the trigger well. But I can see if you would rather have your finger touching it to feel it better. But I wear gloves because the hand guard gets hot. Got quad rails? Those get hot too. </p>

<p>Knowledge of explosives? He had tannerite, better put all those gun nerds on youtube on a list too. </p>

<p>How do you know he was in contact with the FBI as a kid? You think they were questioning a 7 year old about his dad?</p>

<p>I hardly know my neighbors either. I&#39;d wager most people are not. </p>

<p>Lol he had plenty of family. His mom and brother are still alive. He would see his brothers children at least once a year from the way his brother talks about him</p>

<p>As far as the housing crisis almost making him broke.. Thats when Real Estate developers made the most money! Prices low and foreclosures high! Profit. I would take a guess thats when he made a lot of his wealth. </p>

The housing bubble combined with the Great Recession could have made it very difficult for him to move property at that time. Just a thought.

<p>Other news sources say he at least sold a property in 2004 for 3 million. Nothing really detailed after that though. </p>

<p>An undercover FBI agent would work with contractors as an accountant to prevent fraud and abuse. A dirty undercover FBI agent would work with those contractors to help them get away with fraud and abuse on government contractors and get rich doing it.</p>

<p>Another thing that fits with this possibility is that Paddock only drove standard rental cars and dressed like a shlub in cheap polo shirts, khakis, and white socks even.

    <div class="md"><p>My rebuttals
1) Why would he bother, he was too busy gambling to waste time with social media and anyways, he was in his 60&#39;s, that&#39;s hardly uncommon that a 60 year old is not involved or interested in social media.
2) Means nothing whatsoever. He had the money, big deal. Indicative? Not really, at all.
4) Now here is something, but anyone can read up on that on the internet, and I have yet to see anythign about his explosives knowledge that suggests advanced training of any sort. 
5) He had an accounting background and worked for the IRS, it was a perfect fit. Granted, hardly &quot;common&quot; but it doesn&#39;t imply much, beyond that big contractors do or did hire people with experience workign with the IRS. Just because you work for a company that works with/for the government, hardly means you are evil.
9) Means absolutely nothing whatsoever. Are you really actually implying living in a border state means you will kill people?
10) In 2017, I think it would be more suspicious if he did know his neighbours, The norm these days is not really knowing your neighbours.
11) Demonstrably false, did his brother not do an interview and pretty sure it became publically known very soon after that his mother is in Florida
12) Simply nonsensical. What are you even trying to say?
Frankly your post can be counted among the most absurd posts I have seen. It doesn&#39;t prove a thing and some of it seems to be downright false</p>

<p>If it was just a gun sale and Paddock wasn&#39;t working for an alphabet agency, it would be difficult to pin liability on the FBI/CIA, or MGM.  Liability would be on Paddock and there would likely be fundraising for the victims&#39; compensation instead of a lawsuit against some extremely wealthy entities.</p>

<p>It seems to me like many people simply cannot entertain the notion that this was a <a href="http://fakeologist.com/blog/2017/10/08/steve-pieczenik-las-vegas-911-david-knight-nobody-died-nobody-got-hurt/">staged event</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bullets aren’t exactly hard to make. They’re far easier and cheaper to obtain than guns especially in a black market.</p>

<p>Round up guns? No, probably not. But create a situation where they’re difficult to obtain if not impossible. Eventually owners of automatic weapons will die, and their heirs won’t care about them for the most part. I can’t count on both hands the amount of guns family members have inherited and immediately given away or sold. </p>

<p>I don’t literally mean walk into a house and take someone’s gun, but if you think the government isn’t creating a situation where the public thinks they’re smarter than they are, and is unable to defend themselves you’re not seeing the whole picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While i generally agree with you point here.   I do spend stupid amounts of daydream time thinking about these things, so maybe try and think of it this way.    </p>

<p>The best lies are the ones where only a small innocuous detail is changed to shift the perception of the one being told the lie.  </p>

<p>Truth: &quot;I broke the cookie jar&quot;<br/>
Evidence: Broken cookie jar, Confession<br/>
Result: Punishment for broken cookie jar.   </p>

<p>Bad Lie: I didn&#39;t break the cookie jar.<br/>
Evidence: Broken cookie jar<br/>
Result: Likely punishment for broken cookie jar, likely loss of trust.   </p>

<p>Effective Lie: I broke the cookie jar while trying to get you a cookie.<br/>
Result:  Possible minimal punishment.  Likely increased personal reputation with the person you told the lie to.   </p>

<p>So, rather than simply &#39;making up&#39; an event, if someone were trying to manipulate, they would use a real event and change the details, rather than stage something entirely.  As suggested, making up an event is really hard.  However, confusing people on the perception of an event, it really really easy.<br/>
But thats just my opinion on it.</p>

<p>I believe its easier to fake kill people, because those two options are both horrible.  However, If I didn&#39;t believe those options were both horrible.  Its even easier when a bad situation actually goes down and you have a good fall guy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is seeming most likely, here is the scenario I am envisioning. Paddock is undercover FBI and he has his room set up to do an arms deal, all the cameras and surveillance were so FBI could watch what was happening. Something tells me he was dealing with terrorists and the FBI wanted them badly. I think Campos and Schuck are FBI agents who were on the 32nd floor watching to make sure things went as planned. The perps realized what was going on midway through the deal. I&#39;m wondering if they drilled screws in the room door from the inside and that&#39;s where Schuck got that statement from. He and Campos were watching and could hear the drills but couldn&#39;t see what it was. Either way the perps then shot Paddock first. I think this is when Campos and Schuck panic and try to decide what to do, he called it in on his cell phone because he was not connected to hotel security at all and that&#39;s why he&#39;s having to say that. The perps break out the windows and start shooting. Campos and Schuck decide to do something and approach the door only to be shot at and have to retreat and wait for backup. The perps continue their killing spree for 10 minutes before backup arrives and kills everyone in the room. Massive cover up ensues. </p>

<p>We do know that the FBI knew the Tsarnaev brothers and kept in touch for years before the bombing. FBI was planning a simulated attack during the marathon and planned simulate  backpack bombs.

<p>If the FBI was behind this, think about how huge the risk is for them. If just one document gets leaked, or one person comes forward and provides undeniable proof that they were behind the attack, it would topple the government.</p>

<p>So if they were behind it, it would have to be for a very important reason. There would be societal level changes, like after 9-11, but I just don&#39;t see that happening, so I really have a hard time believing it.</p>

<p>They have two way easier options if they wanted this. They could a.) Let terrorist attacks happen instead of preventing them. But then they look bad, and if they&#39;re caught they&#39;re screwed. Or they could b.) They could fake that they&#39;ve caught a bunch terrorists and prevented a bunch of attacks. This would make them look good, and while it would look bad if they were caught it wouldn&#39;t be the same as murdering innocent people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my new theory based on the information we&#39;ve been given and based on the information that we aren&#39;t allowed to have.</p>

<p>Things I am very sure about.</p>

<p>1.) Paddock was a &quot;Barry Seal&quot;. His method of operation is textbook pilot criminal smuggler money launderer, and shooter mercenary.</p>

<p>2.) There were at least 3 accomplices with Paddock that night. But there is a network of Never-Trump and Pro-ISIS people out there who are threatening people like Jesus Campos.</p>

<p>3.) Government agencies were watching Paddock and were late stopping him. Jesus Campos may have been more than a security guard. An agent, a terrorist, a honey-pot target?  We don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure we need to stop having terrorist watch lists and start having terrorist kill lists. We should not be waiting for murderers to murder innocent people. If it can be proven that they intend to murder, we should end them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope.  Your conclusions are the only absurd thing here.  There is absolutely no evidence he worked for the FBI.  You&#39;re just making shit up.</p>

<p>&quot;6. Was in regular contact with FBI as a kid (his dad was FBI Most Wanted).&quot;</p>

<p>Hahaha, right!  So the FBI were after his father and what?  One of the agents bent down one day, gave young Stephen his card and said &quot;I know your dad is a dangerous criminal, but if you ever want to work for the FBI one day, give me a call.&quot;?</p>

<p>The fact that he worked &#39;boring&#39; jobs isn&#39;t evidence of anything either.</p>

<li><p>He&#39;s old. My dad&#39;s about 10 years younger than him. He even works with computers as his job. Yet he has 0 social media accounts other than a Linkedin profile he finally made a couple years ago. Paddock is retired and doesn&#39;t need that. Older people don&#39;t always feel as obligated to use social media. </p></li>
<li><p>Lots of people do. I&#39;m 25 and I&#39;ve lived in 5 different states in the past 6 years alone. Tends to happen especially for people who don&#39;t have a strong connection to their family&#39;s home. </p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s more odd when a mass shooter isn&#39;t known to have trained with guns</p></li>
<li><p>If you have ideas to kill a bunch of people, that&#39;s something you&#39;d look into</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m almost positive a pilot&#39;s license isn&#39;t required for any government job that doesn&#39;t specifically have to do with flying planes.</p></li>
<li><p>How does that mean he was in contact with the FBI? They might&#39;ve talked at some point 40 years ago when his dad was on the run, but there&#39;s no reason to infer it was anything other than the location of his dad, especially not a 40-year working relationship. </p></li>
<li><p>Real estate holdings can give you a good chunk of money. You know what can also give you inexplicable wealth? Successful gambling, which is literally what he spent a lot of his time doing</p></li>
<li><p>That describes a pretty good chunk of this country</p></li>
<li><p>Iirc he lived in Nevada (not a border state), Florida (not a border state), Texas (border state, but in Dallas which is closer to Oklahoma), and California (is a border state). </p></li>
<li><p>I know none of my neighbors either. If you&#39;re not living where you grew up, that can happen. </p></li>
<li><p>No wife/kids yes. But he was a bit of a loner. </p></li>
<li><p>Foreign yes but lived/worked in America for many years. And they lived together, so that would be compromising. </p></li>

You&#39;re  pointing out crazy is in his genes and go straight too he&#39;s an FBI plant since childhood? Everyone of the terrorism cases the FBI has made up there is evidence or their own admission an informant was involved. I haven&#39;t seen any evidence of that. I think the only conspiracy in this is another doctor over medicating with anti depressants and turning another person into a no conscience sociopath.</p>

I&#39;ve NEVER, I&#39;ll repeat it... NEVER worn gloves to go shooting, long guns or hand guns.  The barrel heats up? Ya no shit, why in the fuck would you grab a gun by its barrel after shooting it?  Do you also take things out of the oven with your bare hands?  If you make a habit of touching things that are hot, then ya, you should probably wear gloves if you&#39;re that thick.  Here, I&#39;ll play the pretentious game with you... you ever heard of a fore grip? Quad rails?  Whenever I receive a message response like yours on reddit over this Las Vegas topic, I really have to wonder if you aren&#39;t a paid shill trying to put out misinformation to people...

    <div class="md"><p>Setting up a deal in a casino is not that dumb.  Any shots fired would immediately draw attention, making it difficult to burn someone on a deal.  There is much more security at a casino then any other type of hotel, so either side attempting to rob the other during whatever deal would almost certainly end in failure, imprisonment, and maybe even death for all those involved.</p>

<p>Considering how much luggage goes in and out, that&#39;s a great cover for exchanging goods.</p>
