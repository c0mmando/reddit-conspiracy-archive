        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Clackamas county sheriffs office murdered a longtime childhood friend of mine in his room. They shot him, lied to his parents about it, waited for about 4 hours to enter the room, and when they finally did he was dead. They claimed he was brandishing a weapon which is BS! The VERY NIGHT BEFORE, Chris posted a video explaining an embezzlement scheme with Oregon and the Treasury. In the news article <a href="http://www.mentalhealthportland.org/what-happened-to-chris-kalonji/">HERE</a> You clearly see them acting as if Chris was not complying and grabbing for a gun. That is FALSE, his mother reports him hanging out of the window screaming for help! <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=r-rbKPgZisU">HERE</a> is the video he posted LITERALLY hours before his death! </p>

<p><a href="http://www.poormagazine.org/node/5648">HERE</a>  Is a good article explaining Chris and his death.</p>

<p>A petition has been created to help bring these murderers in for there crimes! Would mean everything if you just singed <a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/justice4CK">HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</a> </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The Kalonjis said their son was having a breakdown and had access to family guns inside their apartment, but they said he would never have hurt them.&quot;</p>

<p>Sounds to me like the parents admit he threatened them with a gun, but believe he would not have hurt them with it. The cops may not have believed the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not trying to be an asshole I promise. I just am struggling to see anything suspicious, his family reported that he is having a breakdown and has access to firearms in an enclosed space, the police at that point would be treating the situation much differently than if it was just a kid having a mental breakdown. At that point if he were to grab for anything at all in front of police, it would be a massive mistake. To me this sounds like a suicide by cop, which may I add is probably pretty tramautic to the police officers as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mentioned this a few times, the police do not always tell the truth, Chris WAS having a mental breakdown yes, he was scared for days before because he was arrested previously and beaten by them, he was predicting his death days before, he did NOT have access to weapons and would never use one. The cops here murder people every day there is nothing traumatic about it to them, they got off scott free with taking another mans life once again. Chris&#39;s mother says she saw Chris hanging out his broken window screaming for help, than he bled to death for 5 hours while the cops denied her entry</p>
