       Exactly. There is some good stuff on this sub, but there is an avalanche of trash (conjecture, hyperbole, faulty logic) as well. Even this post - what is the point of it? The two items (science study and spying claims) are not mutually exclusive. Meh.

       I agree! I'm also sick of all the posts being exactly the same with just a slightly different title. I don't want to have to scroll past 20 threads on weinstein or uranium 1 to get to new info. I would much rather read through a good discussion in 1 or 2 threads. All this shit thats been posted lately hasn't been updated news. It's all the same! It's making it so hard to find a good thread with good discussion.

       It's because of "free speech" they really only get rid of accusations of shilling. IMO not strict moderation is how subs die, at a certain number of subscribers (let's call this the shitpost horizon) the quality of the sub goes way down because people are morons and don't know what fits in what sub. Basically look at all the defaults, it's all shit. But then look at r/polandball, the mods are Nazis but the quality is always high. Or even the_donald while I don't agree with them they have a super high "quality" because they only want shitposts.

       I would say t_d is a horrible example, because half the moderation they do is simply removing people that don't adhere to the exact message they want to project..
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub doesn't need that kind of moderation. If there's 12 posts about one specific tweet, and there's genuine interest in it, removing the other 11 doesn't effect free speech, it just means everyone can discuss things in the same place.. instead of the sub being clogged with 12 posts of the same thing, times 100 posts like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's an actual effort at forum sliding, and to start removing duplicate posts that don't say anything differently is going to clean this place up, and more posts get more visibility.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I just saw a post about "censorship in r/science" that's just a screenshot of posts that say "removed". How many of these posts do we need that don't actually add to anything, aren't an actual conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you're right, non default subs try harder at moderation.. but it's obvious the mods don't care if our sub is being manipulated.

       I agree, there needs to be some kind of minimum quality requirement for posting new threads. This shits turned into a spammy mess of nonsense that usually gets 1-4 comments if that. Flooding the page with irrelevant or pointless posts.

       I agree absolutely.. and things that are considered "shitposts" should stay in places like the Donald.. things have gotten bad, and I really am curious what the mods views on these issues are. Even if they just remove posts that are obviously spam, which is clearly one of the options we can select when reporting.. it would help a lot in my opinion.

       Yeah it's so blatant too, you can click new and see so many shit posts pulled from r/politics that have nothing to do with conspiracy and a few comments about how liberals are trying to destroy traditional beliefs. WHY THE FUCK are the mods not removing these clear shit posts with nothing conspiracy related. I think I'll start reporting them myself, but I doubt one person can do much. We have clearly been invaded. Idk how we can really fix it though

       I think the only thing we can do, is report it every time we see it. If enough people keep doing it, mods will have to respond to it at some point.

       Look at my very last comment, it's a guy from the Donald, that copied someone else's post, then pastes it in 5 other places in the same post.

       This is exactly the kind of shit that's truly destroying this sub, and I would love to see the moderators do something about it, because each day this sub is less enjoyable to participate in, made worse by having to sift through garbage to find something even worthy.

       I mean, Pizzagate was pretty much all this sub talked about near the end of the election, and it was the quintessential political hit job.

       It still amazes me how many people here willingly spread propaganda for political means (and still do).

       Yes, there has been a concerted effort to stigmatize conspiracy theorists for a long time. Even the term itself is manufactured. Really picked up steam around the time of 9/11. Still going strong though. Btw, if you guys don't know you can BUY Reddit upvotes (I had a client who used a service to do this, almost got to the front page)

       Because the colloquial definition has of conspiracy has been purposely changed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's now associated with "crazy", "nuts", "mentally unstable".

       So, anything that can be covered
       <strong>
        by the real definition now has cover from the masses

       There was also that gem of an article today about a gun show in Vegas spiking crime in California.

      <p>
       Might make sense to a drive-by reader, but in reality, there are gun shows every weekend in nearly every big city.
