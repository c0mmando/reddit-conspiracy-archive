       Four conclusive experiments performed by the top scientists of their day proved that the Sun, Moon and stars revolve around us, and that Earth is the fixed, motionless center of the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Airy's Failure and Sagnac experiments scientifically proved Geocentrism and nearly crushed the dying Heliocentric theory until Mr. Einstein came through with his Special Relativity mathematical denial of the proven Aether and philosophically (not scientifically) banished the Aether from study ever since.
      </p>
      <p>
       These studies and peer reviewed experiments are never covered in any university courses. These conclusive peer-reviewed and repeated scientific results are nowhere debated or denied, merely suppressed and ignored. The fact of the matter is that Geocentrism has been conclusively proven for over a century.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1913 Sagnac conducted an experiment to test the speed and constancy of light and proved the existence of the Aether (Disproves relativity) Therefore, The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted using an interferometer clearly demonstrated that the Earth was motionless. The Michelson-Gale experiment detected the Aether/Firmament passing over the surface of the motionless Earth. Airy's Failure, demonstrated that it is the stars moving relative to a stationary Earth, and not the fast orbiting Earth moving relative to comparatively stationary stars.

       IF they are so well known (back in their day) there will be a lot of stuff you can extrapolate upon ... so why don't you, otherwise you're nothing But a person

       RPmatric you are are a science-denying barbarian from the dark ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       It sounds strange to you to hear these things, because all you have been taught (and have been regurgitating ever since), is bullshit pseudo-science.
Prove: 
1. Gravity.
2. Axial rotation at a uniform speed.
3. Curvature as per 8in x miles squared.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until such time, the Earth is flat.

       you can 'cherry pick' a few topics to 'support' your beliefs, ok, I'll bite

       Gravity -- well, I believe in the 'electric universe' so imo gravity is electromagnetism and there
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       an 'aether' like Tesla believed in. Personally I don't agree with all things Einsteinian

       Yeah bro, the diameter of the earth is ~12,000kms!  If you know anything about curves and can do the maths, that figure is correct.

       figure this stuff out yourself, don't believe some numpty who says they can! They're talking shit
      </p>
      <p>
       as for 'axial rotation' ... Of what? Orbital bodies? Do you wish to discuss orbital mechanics? (Something I'm sure ole YT bro has NO clue about) .... well, which/what is it you're referring to?

      <p>
       And if you want me to do better here we go, since you are too dumb/lazy to research it for yourself, I will now take out the silver spoon and feed you like a baby, just the way you prefer.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, you need to read this article.
       <a href="https://savageplane.wordpress.com/2017/06/06/gyroscope-basics-the-pendulous-vane-fallacy/">
        Gyroscope Basics And The Pendulous Vane Fallacy
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, you need to watch the experiment at the end of
       <a href="https://youtu.be/nUFMZkxochs?t=5376">
        this video
       </a>
       . I have already skipped to the meat and potatoes so you don't have to bother with all that learning and researching for yourself.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So after watching that, you will come out and say that 15 minutes is not long enough. (It is, Pilots are taught there will be 3 degrees of drift every 15 minutes, look it up)
      </p>
      <p>
       But because I'm such a nice guy, here's a second, independent gyro experiment that backs up the result of the first experiment, and joy of joys, it's a full SIX HOURS long.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The Earth is stationary dude, and all you can do is mockt, because I GUARANTEE you that you can not prove the heliocentric sun-worshiping model]
      </p>
      <p>
       Any size bet, you name and I will accept the terms.

       I was trying to spare you embarrassment of kicking your ass in a public forum, but so be it. I will also say, that whatever you are typing are, is not ACTUAL proof of anything, it is only your opinion. Let's get that straight.

       Prove to me that that chart is incorrect, and you will be the hero that saved the world from Flat Earth. (Good luck with that by the way).

2. Prove that satellites are real.

       Not a scientist and two bowls deep so not gonna try to do the math, so to speak, on this post. But I would like to ask a question or three.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the motive behind tricking the population into believing the earth is round? Whats to gain? There wouldn't be so much effort into disinformation without a gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what do you get from trying persuade us unenlightened folks of the 'truth'?

       Satan wants as many souls as he can get. The purpose is to separate our connection to God. The heliocentric model has the Earth orbiting at 66,600 mph, tilted at 66.6Â° from horizontal, .666 ft of curvature per square mile. Satan's fingerprints are all over the heliocentric model. The constellations never change. The moon never rotates and is the exact same size of the Sun. Occam's razor much?

       Are you being serious? For starters, I can't fathom how tricking people into believing the earth is round separates you from god. If that's all it takes then I want a new god. But, in fairness, I'm not a deity so I wouldn't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you go to the grocery store or a fast food place and your total rings up to $6.66 or $46.66 does that mean Satan fucked with your soul and made you buy those things? Or is it simply a coincidence? I'm honestly asking your opinion, not attacking you or your beliefs.

       As far as the motive goes, I can only speculate. Who would truly know the answer?

       But I'll have a go anyway.

       Something very, very bizarre happened to earth somewhere near the 1800's. It's almost like time stopped, a movie set (the entire earth) was changed, and then everything restarted again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every single historical thing from 500AD to 1500AD is ENTIRELY fictional.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point being, I believe the Globe Earth theory was introduced after this restart happened, in order to hide the true nature of our reality from us.

       Much like the majority of crimes need a motive, so do the conspiracy theories. As much as I would like to poke holes in your argument, you could be 100% spot on. I couldn't prove all of history happened lol.

       Well damn if that wasn't interesting. I've often wondered just how much history has been doctored or simply misunderstood. The vast majority of society is easily mislead. I.E. Religion.. 
I'm not saying I'm convinced of anything but please hit me with another mind blower vid when you got time. Lets move off the flat earth thing for now though. Short of alien interaction to quarantine humans, I just can't see it being reality. And I'm one misplaced shadow away from being convinced reality is just a big 'computer' simulation...

       Whatever this place is my friend, I can guarantee you it's a thousand times more amazing than what we can ever possibly imagine. A lot of people are into simulation theory atm to try and deal with the trauma from fake space and fake ball earth.

       Yea and I can guarantee we as humans will never make it far enough to realize that. Nice to sit back and think about though. 
Its less about trauma and more about possibility. If I'm just another animal than my life is just cosmic slaughter but if I'm a program then at least theres a small reason I'm here. The more I ramble, the more it sounds like i'm trying to fill the "god hole". Anyways, if life around us was created, in this way,  then plausibly we could figure out how to do the creating. 
Anyone get lucky and get born in to an admin account?

       The snake is eating its own tail. It always does. It's in their nature. They will go out on their terms though, while causing as much shit as they can. Not long now.
