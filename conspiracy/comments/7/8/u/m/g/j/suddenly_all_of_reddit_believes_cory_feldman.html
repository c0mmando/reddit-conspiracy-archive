        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>65k upvotes on r/news about his documentary. Fuck off, we&#39;ve all known about this for 10+ years and yet as soon as it&#39;s reported on the news and makes the front page of Reddit, suddenly everyone cares and knew about it. Fuck these people, they don&#39;t care. In the face of overwhelming evidence, no one believed us. We talked about Feldman and others&#39; claims for years, and we were mocked because of it. Fuck them. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe the virtue signallers, they only care when the establishment tells them they should. I&#39;m glad this is all coming to light, but chances are nothing will come of it and nothing will change. It&#39;s a limited hang-out. They&#39;ll tell you that the Hollywood pedophile ring is just a group of outliers, a small fringe that doesn&#39;t represent the whole. Lies.</p>

<p>Question everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Here&#39;s a great take on Feldman by Paul Romano of PocketsOfTheFuture on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ba96UffdT7c">YouTube</a>. While I&#39;m sure a lot of his behavior could be attributed to some of the abuse he suffered, it doesn&#39;t seem as though Corey is this virtuous beacon of hope for us to rally around in hopes of exposing sexual deviance and pedophilia in Hollywood. </p>

Are those named really going to sue him?  Any judge/lawyer/prosecutor that went after Feldman at this point would be labeled the defenders of pedophilia and would probably require more protection than Feldman himself and their careers would be in the gutter.  There would be a complete nationwide outrage if he were to be prosecuted for naming names at this point as the public no longer views his claims as illegitimate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys.  Go read &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot; by Noam Chomsky (someone else co-wrote it, too lazy to look it up) I keep posting it all over here.  I really haven&#39;t read more than 5 books in the past 5 years, but this is one that I just tore through, it was so much information that I was really happy to have.</p>

<p>He talks about how the media is now responsible for legitimizing victims.  So, if there&#39;s genocide or a violent regime change in some foreign country, and the US is on the side of-or causing the violence.  They will paint the picture of those people deserving it, or mention &quot;some casualties&quot; but a &quot;necessary evil&quot; to get rid of the horrible government.  They will also lie and make you think that the general population agrees with this new leadership even if it couldn&#39;t be further from the truth (Syria, Vietnam, Yugoslavia)  </p>

<p>However, if we (the govt, cia, or large corporations that have business interests in said country) are opposed to the new regime, even if it supported by the people, those revolutionaries will be accused of genocide, and unnecessary violence, and our media will do their best to shape our opinion of them.  In case we need to go in there to help with military force, we will all be of the opinion that &quot;yes of course we need to help those poor people&quot;  and thus the media has manufactured the consent of the US citizens for the military industrial complex and the CIA to go have their way with a foreign govt.  This was their job post 9/11 and in many other instances.  (think of all of the Syria propaganda showing people injured and hospitals blown up we were shown on the news, trying to slowly convince us we needed to go in there to do something)</p>

<p>Now that Reddit can be viewed as media (especially with a younger audience ditching their cable packages and getting a lot of news from sites such as Reddit) it will be controlled just the same.  I guess we&#39;re allowed to now say that the accusers in Hollywood are &quot;legitimate&quot; victims because it has been determined so by the powers that be.  Until it has been &quot;okay&#39;d&quot; don&#39;t expect it on the FP.</p>

<p>Question everything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why isn&#39;t this a good starting point? It&#39;s got to start somewhere. Regardless of what one thinks of HOW Feldman&#39;s going about it (I&#39;m on the fence, but I understand the legal/security fears he would have), it seems like this IS the time for it.</p>

<p>Wait to see how it plays out... it&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They&#39;ll tell you that the Hollywood pedophile ring is just a group of outliers</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hollywood and sex scandals go hand in hand. If the more &quot;normal&quot; behavior of Weinstein types leads to exposing the pedo-rings, it&#39;s a good thing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth pointing out that even in sex/power groups like Hollywood, acting pedophiles (including child porn) are going to a minority group compared to adult straight/gay &quot;sexplay for pay&quot;, though you&#39;ll probably find a number of the &quot;players&quot; are borderline hebephiles (aka jailbait).</p>

<p>I&#39;d actually argue that hebephiles are much more common, given the nature of human sexuality in general. Hollywood makes huge bank selling hebephile fantasies to the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let’s give people the benefit of the doubt. People understand implicitly that unless an accusation or issue is covered by mainstream media nothing will be done. If a crime is not recognized by the mainstream media it doesn’t exist. If it’s covered by alternative media then the authorities don’t have to respond because it’s a conspiracy theory and who wants police wasting their time on those.</p>

<p>It doesn’t boil down to people only caring when the media tells them to, they can pick up on the wider signalling telling them that finally authorities will act. Everyone knows that the dam has burst and now may be the only time to ride the wave. TBH Corey needs to talk while the public is in such a feeding frenzy and the media is backed into a corner.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Changing people&#39;s minds is one of the most difficult tasks in the world. Tavistock and CIA represent trillions of dollars invested into doing just that. So it&#39;s not at all surprising that people en masse suddenly wake up to Corey&#39;s message once the cognitive and social requirements are in place for them to do so. That is, in fact, EXACTLY how it works. If we could influence people with the truth when the cognitive and social engineering requirements were not in place, we wouldn&#39;t need a <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

<p>I think a lot of people just have a hard time coming to grips with the FACT a growing amount of people they look up to in the entertainment industry are either predators or victims (I’m betting some are both)</p>

<p>That’s a tough pill to swallow.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d disagree with this. I&#39;d say Feldman&#39;s desire to speak up was very heavily influenced by people revisiting what he said in the media and unearthing that disturbing Barbara Walters interviews. This was done outside of the MSM across social networks. The conspiracy community was on the forefront of providing those materials.</p>

<p>Feldman made the announcement himself and the story was picked up by the MSM. They are simply playing catch up now. You&#39;re wrong, the average person does seem to care. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re really upset now that people care? This event should be seen as a success to the conspiracy community and a model for how the mainstream can be persuaded at the right time. If the public at large believes something fishy is going on, people will be receptive and the message will get out there. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say that&#39;s a much path to take than searching for a negative in the situation, creating another divisive conservative/liberal narrative and making it about how the community isn&#39;t respected. But I guess you can find a cloud in every silver lining. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s great, a ton of people are starting to wake up to the fact that sexual abuse is rampant in Hollywood. Now if only they would listen about political figures I&#39;d be happy, the more the merrier. I don&#39;t see any problem with this whatsoever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glad he is getting some traction, even if it&#39;s very late. I believe this guy 100%. Problem is, the world is so gay, if you speak up at all, you could get slapped with a hate crime or some bs. The casting couch and using sex to get in the door of Hollywood has been a constant, even Marilyn Monroe first posed nude early in her career....Here&#39;s a side point from a whiny bitch (me). Notice how when females get sexually harassed they are instantly due millions of dollars in compensation-especially if they are white Establishment- but if a guy gets harassed by another guy, good luck getting a dime! Ladies don&#39;t seem to realize, guys get harassed maybe way more than they do. There&#39;s a power imbalance all right, and males get the losing end of it!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t buy into this mentality - those people are our allies and caught between us and TgrossPTB and I don&#39;t accept dividing us further.</p>

<p>People are busy trying to survive, just like us. They have their set of things to focus on everyday and we have ours. If you aren&#39;t stepping back from this once in a while at least you aren&#39;t living fully.</p>

<p>I say that as someone who has been screaming about this problem with bloody lungs since the 90&#39;s.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t hate the non-complicit for non-believing. Hate the non-believing who complicit work against truth discovery.</p>

But as backer i think the price for an ordinary person is set a bit high. They/he should aim for small backers as well for around 20 dollars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He&#39;s mad the truth is &quot;getting out&quot; the same way it always is--society only cares when the establishment/TPTB want them to care. Ppl never think of these thinfs themselves, they&#39;re too distracted and really DGAF. No one cares about the John Oliver segments until he shows them. Then they care for 30 minutes, forget about it, and the cycle continues. Same thing with all these mass shootings, terrible storms. No one really gives a hoot tbh. No one changes how they interact with the world or perceive the world based on these events.</p>
