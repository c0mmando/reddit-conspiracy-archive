    <div class="md"><p>While I <em>think</em> I get your point, your logic doesn’t really add up.</p>

<p>On most modern laptops, the hard drive is pretty obvious and (especially with spinning disks) not a minascule target. If you’re an individual, you’re most likely not trying to shoot a laptop’s hard drive (while still in the computer) from a couple hundred yards down range, and a point blank shot would be not only loud and dangerous, but pointless as well—only a section of the actual data is gone.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when you’re about to commit a mass-shooting—with a <em>very</em> low chance of survival—who gives a shit about a laptop? Shoot it, burn it, or take the easiest approach and just destroy what will be the specific interest of investigators later. Since it will be of such interest, and the disposal usually beforehand while trying to attract the least amount of attention as possible, might as well just take it out, demagnetize it, smash it, toss it, and let the investigators only theorize. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or you could smash the motherfucker against a hard surface or stomp on it a few times idk</p>

<p>Why would a shooter destroy their hard drives anyway? I guess I wouldn&#39;t want all of my information in the hands of somebody else after I die, especially not the government, but you&#39;re kind of sealing your fate if you want to perform an act of terrorism and it won&#39;t matter what kind of info was stored unless you didn&#39;t want to incriminate anybody else</p>

<p>You can bet your sweet ass the NSA would know about anything stored on the drive before it was destroyed, so the government will have all pertinent information whether they have the drive intact or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you operating on the assumption that individuals who most likely would have acquired the materials or knowledge needed to commit mass murder would have found everything without raising any red flags (search terms) or leaving any digital paper-trails (finding and purchasing equipment) or attempting to obfuscate their connection with an anonymous protocol such as Tor (or utlizing a VPN) wouldn&#39;t be targeted and surveil​ed to such a high degree?</p>

<p>DHS somehow procured the browsing history of a person I know that dated back over two years between something like 2011 and 2014, at the very least. As if they couldn&#39;t read and copy the entirety of an unencrypted volume and archive it in a massive $1.5 billion datacenter like the one in Utah?</p>

<p>The only problem I see is that the NSA collects more data than it can analyze, as it&#39;s more intensive to comb through every flagged keyword and draw up digital identity to estimate the individual&#39;s threat level than it is to strip a carbon copy from the user&#39;s device and keep it for future use.</p>

<p>But did you consider that an intact hard drive is a little inconvenient not so much because of what was on there in the months leading up to the shooting, but also because of the little detail of cameras set up in the room/hallway, by the shooter, used during the shooting? </p>

<p>Since there were very few images released to date, if someone said, “Hey, can we see the footage from Paddocks cameras?”. They could opt to say “Well it wasn’t saving them to disk. Sorry.” To which the reply might be “Well can we see the configuration files for the camera software to verify they weren’t logging to disk?”</p>

<p>Point is... it’s easier to say “Sorry dude, the hard drive is missing.”</p>

<p>Why would a shooter expect to live or not be prosecuted after they followed through with their plan?</p>

<p>My point exactly. If you knew you would have no control over how the <em>entire contents of any hard drive in your possession</em> would be used/interpreted, would you not want to exert some control over that data, by, for example, removing it?</p>

<p>We don&#39;t know that.. 
Saying &quot;removed the hard drive from the laptop before taking his own life&quot; is the police working backwards from a known time point where they are 100% sure of a given fact. So guy&#39;s dead, ok at that point he could not of done anything with a hard drive. That&#39;s the starting point of a known fact. It could mean 4min before or 4 hours before, even 4 days beforehand. It&#39;s just how police tend to phrase stuff. They work backwards like that on investigations being in most cases the only thing they know 100% for sure about the case is an arrest/capture time or in this case found dead time. Look at how messed up the time line is if when they try build the early part. It&#39;s only the end that&#39;s clear right now. </p>

<p>I&#39;m willing to bet there are some low level agents going past all the dumpsters of trash for the MGM still. That can&#39;t be a pleasant job. </p>

<p>I think they said Paddock checked in 3 days before the shooting or something like that. Why not bring along one&#39;s laptop to use in the room? If his plan was to shoot up the concert all along he had a set start time. So at some point he yanked the drive and disposed of it. I&#39;m going to guess chucking it in the trash some where. </p>

<p>I can see doing that. Law enforcement is going to dig into a person&#39;s life, why make it easy by giving them maybe 100 or 1000s of emails? List of contact to dig into, people to talk too etc. You spare all of them that fate, well most of them, if you just get rid of your hard drive. That said, I&#39;m not blind to the idea that is adds yet another layer different conspiracy ideas. That&#39;s the whole reason I find conspiracy theories interesting, the building blocks of them and how people try to connect them. This is the first one I&#39;ve been able to see getting built from the start. </p>

<p>Check in time is A, dead dude is B. I&#39;m just saying if A to B is a decent amount of time why not bring a lap top? Odds are some time between A to B the drive got ripped and dumped. Odds are it was Paddock who did it but that&#39;s a guess like anything else when it comes to what the public knows. Paddock could of taken it to a local best buy for all we know. Maybe it&#39;s sitting on the work bench of the Geek Squad as I type this out. Maybe Paddock pulled it and mailed to someone. I don&#39;t know. The logical path is he had a lap top, used it and then junked the drive but as I said, that&#39;s still a guess on my part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Removing the hard drives from a desktop computer is pretty trivial and I could see why you would do that to conceal information from investigators, since disposing of the entire tower would be harder than removing the hard drive and dumping / destroying it.</p>

<p>It also makes sense why some of these shooters would do this, even though it seems like they were doing it for the notoriety.  Many of them had published information publically before the attacks, and thats what they wanted to form their image.  Investigators actually digging into their hard drive is too personal, and the investigators could reveal information that would change their image in a way the shooter doesn&#39;t want.</p>

<p>For the people with laptops, it makes no sense.  Removing the hard drive from a laptop is harder than just dumping the entire computer somewhere.  Furthermore not disposing of the entire computer can let investigators recover information from the computer&#39;s memory if they can get to it fast enough.</p>

<p>But this also goes for the people who could theoretically have &#39;confiscated&#39; the hard drive... why leave the entire computer?  All in all, despite what some people are saying, this is suspicious.  Especially in the Las Vegas case, and in light of the fact that the shooters brother was recently caught with a computer with tons of child pornography on it by the LAPD.</p>

<p>Just wanted to point out this isn&#39;t how it works. RAM Memory is fast and volatile. Shutting down the PC is enough to clear your RAM. Also, any evidence that would be valuable would have never been in RAM, it would all be stored on the hard disk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The time frame is much shorter than the amount of time it would take to shut down your PC, much less the amount of time it would take to remove the HDD from the PC... which is why you&#39;d want to attempt this anyways.</p>

<p>In theory it may be possible, but in practice, if you can get the PC and/or the RAM submerged in liquid nitrogen <em>before</em> the Hard Drive is removed but while it still has data on it - then the hard drive would still have to be in the PC.</p>

<p>Even if you removed the hard drive from the PC while it was running, you&#39;d cause a full system failure which would purge the memory in doing so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The amount of time needed to remove any given component from a laptop depends on the model.  Personally I&#39;ve never used one that required only a single screw removed... also I would be surprised if you had actually conducted such a thorough survey of the models on the market that you could say honestly &#39;most laptops&#39;.</p>

<p>You&#39;re wrong about DRAM being volatile enough that shutting down your computer is enough to clear bits.  Recent findings by researchers at princeton suggest DRAM is not as volatile as previously thought... their team was able to recover information from DRAM after a power cycle with absolutely no physical modification to the memory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, why are you accusing me of being an unreasonable flat-earther or moon landing skeptic when you are the one senselessly attacking mainstream scientific findings because you can&#39;t admit you didn&#39;t know what you were talking about?  Oh the paper was from 2008?  Oh it was written by students?  Very convincing stuff, it must be garbage! Very reasonable, nevermind that the findings were presented in a well known infosec publication.  Get a grip on yourself.</p>

<p>Even though you boast about how you won&#39;t actually educate yourself and read the paper, you still snipe at an excerpt from the experiment page, and once again demonstrate your ignorance.</p>

<ul>
<li>ECC ram is NOT USED by most consumer computers, because it is slower and more expensive, and more power intensive.  It is only useful in computers that run software which cannot tolerate any data corruption whatsoever.</li>
<li>Some (not all) BIOS have memory-zeroing functionality to prevent this type of attack (the attack you are claiming is impossible and not a concern), those that do have this functionality, often have it as an option which many users may have disabled (or it may be disabled by default) because it elongates boot time.  Of course, all of this is irrelevant to the discussion anyway as an attacker who was explicitly trying to conduct this type of attack would not have BIOS configured to erase the RAM they are trying to recover... that text is there to help people trouble shoot replication issues with the experiment.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t understand this nonsense.  Retention time will vary depending on the specifics of different ram models, doesn&#39;t change the fact that you can replicate the attack easily with many different types of consumer grade ram in otherwise reasonable amounts of time.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t care about your worthless &#39;guarantee&#39; which is based off your willful ignorance of the published findings of scientists.  If you think their findings are fraudulent or overstated, you absolutely should publish a critique.  You and I are the only ones reading this right now so your attempt to save face here is a waste of time.  You were wrong about cold boot attacks and data recover-ability from DRAM, and now you are doubling down revealing your ignorance about many other aspects of computing... its not impressive or convincing, its a waste of time.</p>

<p>I think they said Paddock checked in 3 days before the shooting or something like that. Why not bring along one&#39;s laptop to use in the room? If his plan was to shoot up the concert all along he had a set start time. So at some point he yanked the drive and disposed of it. I&#39;m going to guess chucking it in the trash some where. </p>

<p>I can see doing that. Law enforcement is going to dig into a person&#39;s life, why make it easy by giving them maybe 100 or 1000s of emails? List of contact to dig into, people to talk too etc. You spare all of them that fate, well most of them, if you just get rid of your hard drive.
