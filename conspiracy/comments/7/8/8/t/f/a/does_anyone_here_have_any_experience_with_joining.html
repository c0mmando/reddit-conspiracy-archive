    <div class="md"><p>I can answer it. Freemasonry gives back to you what you are willing to put into. So, if you are very active then you can be set up to do a lot philanthropic work and a bunch of dinners. Conversely, if you just pay the dues and don&#39;t go then it&#39;s just money down the drain. It&#39;s all about brotherhood and camaraderie. Is there anything specific you&#39;d like to know?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a clarification. Only way to become a Mason is to ask a Mason. If your waiting for someone to invite you, you&#39;re going to have a long wait. (Or if they do, they may not be legitimate)</p>

<p>Some places (called jurisdictions) handle it differently, but most do need 2 people to sign the petition. These can be people you meet during the introductory process, but people will generally want to get to know you before signing a petition. </p>

Definitely not in the governments of Iceland, England, Australia, Canada, US, religions, hollywood, etc.  The pedo scandals that came out in the MSM covering these, were all wrong and lies.  One day, our children will ask you &quot;how did you let this happen.&quot;  Well Timmy, it was too kooky to believe, and people demanded videos of kids being raped before accepting it.  At the time, seemed kind of a dark and weird request, when the allegations had our most vulnerable as the victims, but whaddyagonnado, am I right?!

<p>Look into the real roots, Manly P Hall is probably the best (positive) example of a Mason, but reading some Albert Pike (Morals and Dogma) might be more revealing in a worrying way.

    <div class="md"><p>If you consider Masonry as entirely self-contained within the Blue Lodge, rather than a sprawling series of inter-connected networks of fraternities, then sure. The Blue Lodge is not where any particularly weird ceremonies go on, but they still worship the same carefully concealed figures. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Do you mean in terms of 33rd? Of course, that is all that is within the Blue Lodge. Other Lodges have far more or far less degrees. Achieving the 32nd is not worthy of any praise whatsoever, but accomplishing the 33rd is quite privileged. Not many at all reach that level. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>P2 is probably the most outwardly nefarious, yes, but just because their charter is pulled doesn&#39;t mean they bear no relation to the other lodges. I could have named the Knights of Pythias or Columbus, the Orange Lodge, the OTO, the Shriners, or the Acacia Fraternity and they would all be equally tied to extremely high-ranking individuals who can destroy your life if you get on their bad side. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>RoJ is not as prevalent nor as powerful as anyone thinks. I know thousands of Masons. Not a single one is in RoJ. Don&#39;t even think they exist in most jurisdictions. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not surprised, Billiken doesn&#39;t have such good publicity anymore. Everyone sees through the charity charade too easily. Shriners have more cover, and the network of hospitals, and other &quot;we&#39;re just here for fun haha&quot; orders like the IOOF and AMOS are able to conceal their intentions much better. </p>

<p>I feel like this is equivalent to pointing out to someone immigrating to America that the country is totally dominated by Rome and Roman influence. The citizens will argue until the cows come home that they have never seen anything Roman around them, and that if it was Roman influenced it happened a long time ago, but will have no explanation for the Fascii still in the House of Congress or Persephone atop the Capitol, or the Apotheosis of Washington underneath... Just because your average lodge is too small and un-noteworthy for anything nefarious, does not mean that Masonry is not an organization with a long history of using symbols which clearly indicate them as worshipping something evil. </p>

<p>Do you think anyone really believes that? I don&#39;t have to look further than the classic pillars of Tubal and Cain to know that there is clearly worship of Tammuz and Nimrod. There is absolutely nothing within the Masonic theology that is remotely close to any conventional religion, and nothing about it that is biblical what-so-ever. One only needs to read a Mason-annotated copy of the Bible to understand the alternative interpretation. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>None of the secrets for the Blue Lodge really matter, frankly. The Third Degree isn&#39;t that nefarious in the sense that Mah-Ha-Bone and Tubal-Cain are just your typical Pagan slogans. It&#39;s only with the appendant lodges where you get into the extremely heretical or &quot;unorthodox&quot; deity worship. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, they want to infiltrate it because it&#39;s totally suitable to corruption, just like a political position. It helps spread the base of the Pyramid, so that everything can be controlled by the Keystone easier. </p>

<p>Just because you don&#39;t understand your own symbolism doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t still dangerous... The worst kind of worship is one you don&#39;t understand yourself..</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t so long ago they were killed outright - does William Morgan ring a bell? They stopped killing people when they were so widespread that there was no possibility of people freaking out, no matter how vicious the rumours, because the general population was totally pacified after hundreds of years of Masonic influence. </p>

<p>I mean, what happened with the Anti-Mason movement? They led a political party that almost won, before it was revealed <em>it was actually controlled and led by a Mason</em>. That&#39;s why Masons don&#39;t need to kill unless it&#39;s serious (ie. proof of some Jesters snatching kids) just like how the CIA won&#39;t kill you for exposing something they do. They&#39;ll destroy you with disinformation instead. </p>

<p>3 million left, of no consequence and not knowing anything worth knowing. Never made it to the higher degrees, probably barely attended half of the actual ceremonies and remembered even less.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d like to re-iterate that this is almost totally above the level of Blue Lodges (which are generally filled with well-intentioned, poorly managed fellows) and really only an issue if you are actually the type of person capable of bringing real damage to the Lodge. Nowadays, murder is infrequent and always contracted out to others (Hells Angels anyone?) and usually related to internal corruption, not because it is the way the Lodges are intended to operate. </p>

<p>To also re-iterate on my point about disinformation, that is the current tactic, because you can&#39;t go around killing everyone who writes an expose without there being a very obvious pattern. Instead, destroy the author&#39;s life quietly by pulling the strings all around town, get a brother at a local PD to arrest them etc. </p>

<p>You still don&#39;t want to be on the wrong side of that. Fighting against someone who can pull the right strings in the legal system is basically futile. Those are the type of people you brush up against at the upper levels of Masonry. Either stick the course, and be comfortable with learning you&#39;re actually worshipping Jah-Bul-On, venerating Tubal-Cain/Tammuz and Solomon, who were not good people and did not follow good Gods, or duck out early before you get into that sort of stuff. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What levels exist above the Blue Lodges?</p>

<p>Blue Lodges answer to a Grand Lodge for their jurisdiction, which has rotating leaders every year. That&#39;s it. There is no level above that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read up a bit on the William Morgan affair. Can I say for 100% certainty that fellow lodge members didn&#39;t murder him for betraying an oath? I cannot, because I don&#39;t have any first hand factual knowledge.</p>

<p>But rationally, I know plenty of other people have violated their oaths and were merely kicked out with nothing else occuring.</p>

<p>I do know for a fact that several Grand Lodge jurisdictions have removed the metaphorical threats of violence from the obligation to stop such fears from propagating.</p>

<p>I find it unlikely that Morgan was murdered by a Masonic conspiracy that in turn would allow hundreds of other expose books.</p>

<p>FWIW, the evil Albert Pike (the center of so many conspiracy theories) wrote a tell-all book himself that revealed all the &quot;secrets&quot; from Blue Lodge ritual work. There are some Masons who are sincerely angry about this and demand that we stop printing and selling the book. But there are Masonic groups who do in fact print and sell this book for study.</p>

<p>We have no real secrets.</p>

<p>Circles within circles within circles. The Blue Lodge is the outer circle, and each inner circle is another organization which is only connected in the fact it often shares members, not that they are explicitly connected. What else would you expect from a group that came up with their own system of multi-layered symbols, square-based crypt-alphabet, alternate history and alleged lineage of thousands of years? People who study Kabalah can hardly be described as &quot;simple&quot;. This is the realm of complexity and obscurity.</p>

It is a contradiction in terms to call the Chapter, etc., the highest branches of the Order.

<p>The Chapters and other branches of the Institution are indebted to the Blue branch for life, for vitality, for food and nourishment, otherwise they could not exist. This position cannot be denied, but must be admitted by all. So true is this that the highest branches of Freemasonry, so called, have only an existence by permission of the Blue. If at any time it was deemed beneficial or necessary to the harmony or existence of Freemasonry, to abolish the Chapter and other degrees, the authority to do so certainly rests in the Grand Lodge, which represents Blue Masonry. The authority to confer the Arch and other degrees came first from the lodges, subsequently the authority was transferred to, or delegated to the Grand Lodge. </p>

<p>I should take your word for that? You have so many secrets it&#39;s hard to tell what is secret and what isn&#39;t, which is exactly the point. Security by obscurity. Most people don&#39;t care to delve into it anyways, which is the primary defense. Just like the Pope disestablished the Jesuits for a while so he could claim they were not a real order anymore, Freemasonry uses the excuse that all of the secrets have already been unveiled and the only weird things were going on in the past. </p>

<p>People don&#39;t know anything about it other than calling it a drinking club, that&#39;s why Masons aren&#39;t worried about the general population getting riled up over an expose. <a href="http://freemasonsfordummies.blogspot.ca/2013/06/royal-order-of-jesters-in-prostitution.html">The least incriminating stuff is just the general depravity and prostituting/human trafficking...</a> Let alone the strange rituals and strange names for &quot;God&quot;.</p>

<p>You outright state these bodies are not directly connected. The extent of the connections are sometimes debated in Masonry, that appendant bodies only accept Masons as members as a requirement, but some would suggest that they are not Masonry directly themselves.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>There is a rigid hierarchy within any individual Masonic Lodge, which members can influence by simultaneously being members of other Lodges. If any Lodge threw their relationship out of balance (see what happened with the Arkansas dispute between the Shriners and the State Lodge for a petty example) then they would suffer, but they could certainly still influence the Blue Lodge to their desire by getting more members (and hence more Blue Lodge members). It just keeps it inside the network. </p>

<p>There is a masterful interplay of multiple groups working to influence lodges at any given time, <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/revealed-how-gangs-used-the-freemasons-to-corrupt-police-9054670.html">but a great variety of forces from the traditional criminals</a> to the famous example of Weishaupt. Other lodges can also be an example of this influence, they do <em>not need to be superior to the Blue Lodge</em> but rather instead <em>control a few select Blue Lodge members</em>. </p>

<p>That is simply not true.</p>

<p>Membership in an appendant body has nothing to do with being &quot;high ranking&quot; in a Blue Lodge. All Master Masons are equal. We temporarily elevate some to a leadership position that rotates, but it is mostly symbolic. No one is really above another.</p>

<p>And the newest, most junior Mason can join all of the appendant bodies.</p>

<p>All town council members are usually theoretically equal too. That doesn&#39;t mean that if you have more friends on the council or obligated to work with you or obey you, that you don&#39;t have a &quot;higher rank&quot; than other members. </p>

<p>Seniority rules in everything, and having a Worshipful Master who is on your side is <em>obviously</em> high-ranking compared to a Deacon or Steward. Even better yet, there&#39;s a Grand Lodge above the lodge itself, and you can see exactly how much power a Grand Lodge has for arbitrary reasons based on the Arkansas case again. You don&#39;t think that &quot;DJ played music too loud at a Christmas party&quot; was a BS reason? That isn&#39;t symbolic power, that is actual power being wielded. Now that same Worshipful Master could do the same thing to another appendant body because he is a member of an opposing appendant body, for example. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>This example proves the exact opposite of what you&#39;re claiming. Instead of the Shrine getting to dictate to the Blue Lodge how they should operate, the Blue Lodge held ultimate sway over the leader of the Shrine. The Grand Lodge revoked the membership of the Potentate of the Shrine.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;Blue Lodge&quot; didn&#39;t do anything, one angry Worshipful Master did and there is nothing the &quot;legal process&quot; did to stop it. If that Worshipful Master was motivated by anything to do with an appendant body, wouldn&#39;t that be a perfect example of exerting arbitrary control by owning one high-ranking Grand Lodge position? </p>

<p>A variety of increasingly esoteric and occult mystic groups with smaller and smaller memberships. </p>

<p>Most don&#39;t meet, they don&#39;t exist within the physical Lodge per-se. Surely you&#39;ve read Manly P Hall&#39;s &quot;Lost Keys&quot;? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The average Mason, as well as the modern student of Masonic ideals, <strong>little realizes the cosmic obligation he takes upon himself</strong> when he begins his search for the sacred truths of Nature as they are concealed in the ancient and modern rituals. He must not lightly regard his vows, and if he would not bring upon himself years and ages of suffering <strong>he must cease to consider Freemasonry solely as a social order only a few centuries old</strong>. He must realize that the
ancient mystic teachings as perpetuated in the modern rites are
sacred, and <strong>that powers unseen and unrecognized mold the destiny of those who consciously and of their own free will take upon themselves the obligations of the Fraternity</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What exactly does that mean? Well, that&#39;s a bit longer than what I care to delve into in a comment. But I think you and I both know what that means. Pledging your soul to something that you don&#39;t really know what it is to begin with. With something known for layers of obscurity and reversed meanings. Including a history of study and worship of the Roman, Egyptian, Persian, and esoteric Buddhist pantheon. With a few major figures who actually claim that at the bottom of the rabbithole, Lucifer is the guy who is the GAOTU, and that Adonai isn&#39;t actually his superior. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t explain how this stuff happens. To be honest, I would call the precise level of organization almost supernatural and above what I thought human intelligence was capable of. But there clearly is a consistent trend of Masonry revolving around a series of cryptic mystic shells, and containing worship of both the good and the bad Gods of history. As above, so below, each things in equal polarity etc., hence for each practicing the black or left hand path there is another on the white or right hand as well. </p>

<p>Again though, for OP&#39;s purposes, Manly P Hall&#39;s words are <em>insanely relevant</em>. There is <em>far more than meets the eye</em> and it is not a commitment to take lightly. </p>

<p>There is literally nothing about Masonry that <strong>isn&#39;t</strong> purely occult. It&#39;s the textbook definition of what Masonry teaches, that doesn&#39;t mean &quot;occult&quot; in a Satanic spooky way, but it is purely dedicated to the learning of esoteric knowledge. Why else the focus on Solomon&#39;s Temple? Why on the builder Hiram Abiff and his secret? That is occult territory, Solomon is basically the founder of the occult as we know it. </p>

<p>This idea that &#39;magic&#39;, mysticism, or polytheism is irrevocably linked is either ignorance or the height of irresponsible dishonesty.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What else do you call it when you go through a symbolic death and rebirth? Why are there orders like &quot;Ancient Mystic Order of Samaritans&quot; and &quot;Mystic Order of the Veiled Prophets of the Enchanted Realm&quot; and &quot;Order of the Eastern Star&quot;? How isn&#39;t that mystic, what else would you call it? &quot;Porkchop study&quot;? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I asked for brick and mortar, for a leadership structure, and there isn&#39;t an answer to those questions, because they don&#39;t exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WbRKAyn4-I">I can give you examples of those speaking out against it</a>. But I can&#39;t name the exact way that an organization would be infiltrated across multiple countries, I&#39;m sorry, that&#39;s like asking me how exactly Mossad has infiltrated ISIS. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>OP, or anyone else reading, take this for what you will: stop reading about Freemasonry on the internet and get your ass to a lodge building and prove to yourself what the men there are all about. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just hope OP is smart enough to not listen to rhetoric from a rhetorician. Taking masters of casuitry at their word is at your own peril. They have no reason to tell the truth to you and they only profit and benefit (materially and otherwise) from drawing new souls into the Lodges. OP has nothing to gain that he can&#39;t learn for himself online, and at least save himself the Lodge dues, if not his own soul.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will say the fraternal/fellowship aspect is often the biggest draw and one of the best benefits.</p>

<p>But each lodge has its own feel and culture to an extent.</p>

<p>I switched from one lodge in Omaha that was more of a traditional stag group that went out drinking all the time to a more family friendly lodge. My wife and daughters come out once a month for a pot luck dinner at our lodge.</p>

<p>Check out a few lodges and see if you feel if they are a good fit for you and what you&#39;re looking for. Most have some sort of public events where you can spend time with them and get a feel for the group of people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you believe is irrelevant. You don&#39;t get to tell me what I believe. That&#39;s not your prerogative, nor your right. There is no such thing as Masonic theology. Absolutely not conventional religion.  Not a religion at all. A Masonic annotated bible is just that. The Bible has been interpreted a billion ways for millennia. Nothing special, besides maybe as a gift.</p>

<p>Have you seen them?</p>

<p>Harkens back to earlier. You don&#39;t get to tell me what my symbols mean.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get to point out when the people who made up your symbols say they have a different meaning than you do. Just because you are fooled by the simple interpretation doesn&#39;t mean that the true intention isn&#39;t the inner meaning. </p>

<p>Again, I can&#39;t really make progress with someone who denies what those with more authority have dictated is dogma. It&#39;s not my fault that Albert Pike designed your rituals and also happened to worship Lucifer. It&#39;s especially not my fault that he purposefully designed symbols to mislead others, because that is one of the most refined practices of black &#39;magic&#39;... Making someone give their energy to an evil idol without even knowing. Just because you disagree with the guy who founded your ideologies doesn&#39;t make you right. </p>

<p>Again, the individual Mason is usually good and upstanding... but the organization of Masonry is a cancer. Just like any other religion. </p>
