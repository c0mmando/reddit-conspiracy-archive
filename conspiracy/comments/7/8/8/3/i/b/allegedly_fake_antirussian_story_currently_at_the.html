        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/news/comments/786rcv/russian_pop_star_zelimkhan_bakaev_tortured_and/?sort=new">This post</a> about a &quot;Russian pop star&quot; being killed in a Chechnya &quot;anti-gay&quot; roundup sounds like a headline from <a href="/r/subredditsimulator">/r/subredditsimulator</a>.</p>

<p>While the majority of comments are the typical reddit echo chamber fodder, a few rational folks can be found:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although this is totally possible and probable, and I&#39;m 99% sure it happened, this article provides very little details, information or evidence to support its claims...Just saying someone said so doesn&#39;t really cut the mustard above TMZ. I don&#39;t like when media leave things open and in the air like that.</p>

<p>He is not a &#39;Pop Star&#39;, the typical reaction of Russians if you name it will be &#39;who? football player?&#39;. (I&#39;m Russian and live in Moscow, and no one knows about him. All news about zelemkhanov singer starts in August in google). This article speculates on outdated information from early August. According to current information published at the end of September (including video!), he has left Russia and live in Germany now.</p>

<p>they say he was tortured and killed but don&#39;t provide any proof.</p>

<p>Sorry to say, but this is fake news. Bakaev is missing still, but there is confirmation of his death. I hate internet for jumping-the-gun news based on &quot;sources&quot;. </p>

<p>And you guys so easily trust this &quot;news&quot; from some &quot;sources&quot;? Well, ok.</p>

<p>Can anyone find any songs by this guy? I cant seem to find any proof this guy even exists except for this story. ALL results are either this story, or an athlete with the same name.</p>

<p>Jesus, and zero comments about the lack of sources in the article. There are no sources at all, moreover, I am russian, and NO media in Russia reported on this (including liberal and anti-establishment Meduza and Rain). This is fake news, folks. At least until any credible sources will appear. Yes, news about your agenda can be fake too.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reading stories that&#39;s he&#39;s actually alive and most likely in Germany, what&#39;s going on here</p>

<p>People have debunked the video as a fake/forced.</p>

<p>Chechnya is part of the North Caucus, the only majority-Muslim region in Russia. If people just shy away from admitting that Islam causes issues like this, how the fuck is anything going to get done?</p>

<p>they are saying he is found in germany, well and alive. apparently he ran away from russia because he was scared something like this will happen to him. </p>

<p>Russia is Orthodox Christian. Chechnya is Muslim. Please don&#39;t conflate the two.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t look now reddit, but your agenda is showing!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I regularly remove shit posts that reach the top.</p>

<p>The difference is this is <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and they are supposed to be <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> not <a href="/r/propaganda">/r/propaganda</a>.</p>

<p>The other difference is that #1 posts on <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> hit the front page of reddit (and the top of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a>) and they should be held to a <em>much</em> higher standard.</p>

<p>The fact that a fake story (with a broken link) was #1 on reddit for that long is unconscionable and proof that this site is completely fucked.</p>

<p>Are the <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> mods browsing <a href="/r/conspiracy/new">/r/conspiracy/new</a> for moderation advice? Haha just too rich.</p>

<p>Also, how the fuck does a clearly fake news piece of propaganda make it to <em>#1 on <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a></em> before being disposed of? </p>

<p>So many countless thousands of people have seen it by then, the damage is done.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a brilliant form of propaganda...let fake news rise to the top of reddit where it gets ridiculous amounts of exposure, then remove it once the propaganda becomes overwhelmingly obvious.</p>

<p>What a fascinating time for the internet.</p>
