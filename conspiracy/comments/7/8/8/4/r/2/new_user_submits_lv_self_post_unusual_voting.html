       A new user
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/786gs9/my_experience_during_the_shooting_in_vegas/">
        submitted a self post about Las Vegas
       </a>
       five hours ago, after another mod persuaded them to format it into more readable paragraphs I just allowed it to be visible as it was an interesting account and new information might be of interest to you guys.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where it gets interesting, whilst being
       <strong>
        invisible to ordinary users
       </strong>
       it managed to get 19 views and more than one downvote. I gave it one upvote which only took it up to 66% upvoted. Curious.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only 15 active mods here and it's incredibly rare we're all on at the same time on any given day, or scanning the modmail.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So who are the mysterious people with access to invisible posts scanning the new queue and downvoting the posts you can't even see yet?

       Maybe it was u/Young-Kyoon.  He found a way to get you guys to manually approve his blogspam (Rule 3), several times an hour.  Maybe we can add hidden-thread-viewing to his list of bizarre super powers.

       Spreading his blog over a few different blogspot.com sites doesn't make it any less of his own blogging.  (Sorry...  I mean...  "Prophet Matt's"...  ahem...)
      </p>
      <p>
       And adding up his blog spamming tendencies for over a year, with his utter lack of posting karma, I'd reasonably guess that I'm far from the only one who doesn't care for it.  Maybe it's just my hurt fee fees, from being called "human cattle" 5 too many times :)

       His posts are mostly 'for dummies' though, you're clearly too advanced for them :)

       I actually slightly prefer them to the same not-much-conspiracy news stories being posted from eight different reposting sites flooding the queue, at least he actually puts some personal effort into them however out-there we might find them.

       It's called the web of disinformation setup by the illuminati, all self-verifying and referencing each other.
       <br/>
       Contrast to the articles I post which are all entry points to the Web of Truth, articles which the web of disinfo would never dare to link.
      </p>
      <p>
       Poster Awesomo3082 doesn't understand that blogs are just a platform for free speech and that anyone can research the evidence presented to verify for themselves.
       <br/>
       It's no wonder the same poster swallows what's fed to them such as the "Elders of Zion" because it's simply packaged as "credible" and propagated within "approved" sources alias the web of disinfo.

       Well, the infiltrators are definitely using botting to get their job done. If one of their bots submits a link all the other bots just need a shared link from the original account.

       It's important to note that this particular user played the whole "I'm new and don't know how to post" bit while the post was being reviewed. There's BEEN A LOT of those "users" since we started hammering down on the brigaders.

       I know little of moderating on this site other than a few particular subreddits clearly have an agenda to suppress information. What you're implying here is a post won't be seen publicly until it's been approved by the mod team here? I assume that's correct but want to be certain.

       Just playing devil's advocate, but a couple other possibilities to check out. I'm on mobile so I'm not sure I can test, but is it possible that the post was upvoted through the public mod log? Also, what if people still had the post open in a tab while it was suspended? Would upvotes register that way?

       I'm sure there's some explanation buried somewhere about how there are algorithms surrounding the up and downvote buttons and how the votes are applied and then sorted and bubbled and all that. The more algorithms and complexity there is surrounding all of it, the easier it is for all the people involved in the process of creating, maintaining and moderating Reddit to manipulate all the vectors. That probably explains why a newly created post with 1-3 upvotes shows as "99% upvoted", otherwise, why wouldn't it just say "100% upvoted"...... or "75% upvoted" if it had 3 up and 1 down or "60% upvoted" with 3 up and 2 down, etc....... Right now this post shows 14 points (89% upvoted). It should either be 87.5 (rounded up to 88) If there were 14 up, 2 down, or 93.3 (rounded up to 94) if there were 14 up, 1 down?

       It just looks like other mods probably downvoted the same thread. It's not that weird, considering you were upvoting that very same thread before it was capable of being viewed. If you, and OP count count as 2/3'ds of the vote than it would only take one other mod to downvote and bring that score to 66%.
      </p>

       So you and one other mod possibly voted on the same thread. That's not weird in the slightest.

       Actually it was after reading then approving it, not that it matters. It's the amount of views that are the real point, and you haven't addressed that yet. There were around 5 or 6 mods active at the time and only one view is counted per user regardless of revisits.

       If there were 5 or 6 other mods, then one other mod besides yourself voting on it seems entirely likely. That would make the count at 66%.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your second point is wrong. I myself have increased the view count on threads I submitted simply by refreshing the window, or clicking into the comment link myself from the subreddit page. Not to artificially increase the views since no one can publicly see it, but because I was curious about how it worked.
      </p>

       You can test for yourself by manually clicking onto the comment link on this thread, or submitting a new one.
