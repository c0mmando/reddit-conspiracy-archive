       The situation in the UK is becoming dire. Young parents are having to chose between feeding their kids properly or saving for petrol money. We are paying ever increasing amounts of tax that dosent go back into services. Instead it goes into the pockets of the political and upper classes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The monarchy continues its oppressive reign, siphoning off the hard work of the "peasants" while they live in luxury. Everything they have was gained through years of harsh taxes on the starving masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UK population has become blind and subservient. The monarchy propaganda is carried on through manipulation of the public's minds. This is through currency bearing the queens head. The national anthem heard daily in ceremony and sports matches ("god save the queen" "long may she rule over us")
      </p>
      <p>
       They use religion against us, telling us they have been given the right to rule by god. Churches purport the myths, happy to continue spreading religious lies to millions each sunday.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics is held under it's grip. The PM meets with the queen every week, influenced by her no doubt into further widening the divide between rich and poor with more cuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police serve the royals unquestionably. It still astonished me the fact that the queen is above any laws applying to the "peasants". Laws that were agreed upon hundreds of years ago by the rich landowners and lords, while the poor didn't even get a democratic vote yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The UK monarchy maintains a oppressive rule over society, and the situation is looking more and more dire as service cuts to hospitals and welfare continue.

       The monarchy is shit and should be abolished. That said the main problem in the uk is the Conservatives and Austerity. I got out 5 years ago and have no current plans on returning. The rich are ruining the country and blaming poor immigrants that can't even vote for the government's failings.

       I live in the states but, have uk citizenship. I had my fingers crossed when I pledged allegiance to the queen.

       Ha ha good on you. Yeah pledging allegiance is such a weird thing to do, almost like you are submitting to them. To think the royals have the balls to say other people should bow down to them, they are nothing special

       The population is quite old at the moment and oldies love the queen. When she dies and the baby boomers die off this will change. King Charles will likely be the last. If we could find away to stop tourists coming to visit royal shit that would help. I Think Australia is planning on giving up on the royals after lizzie the lizard croaks.

       I think they will pass over Charles, that guy is a full inbred simpleton and go straight to William who is slightly more marketable.
