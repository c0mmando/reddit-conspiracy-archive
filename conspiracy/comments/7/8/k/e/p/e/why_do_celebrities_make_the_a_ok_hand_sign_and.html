    <div class="md"><p>Halsey the singer? Once people get high enough in the entertainment industry, they have to sign over their soul to the devil with their own blood as ink. The deal would mean that the devil serves them by making them rich and famous but when that person dies, he has to become the devils slave. </p>

<p>I’m not saying any of this will actually happen but this is what the cabal believes in. There are Illuminati sex slaves that claim they have seen the cabal summon actual demons which may be a non-physical alien species called archons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m a non-denominational religionist which is very difficult to explain but I believe in Jesus for sure. I also do believe in Lucifer but I don’t believe he is the opposite of God. I believe he is a player in the universe that led a rarely occurring massive rebellion about 200,000 years ago that eventually led to Earth getting caught up in the mix and become a Lucifererian stronghold. Some insiders are claiming Lucifer belongs to the alien family called the Archons. The archons are said to have enslaved the reptilians who in turn may have enslaved humans. </p>

<p>I feel like most beliefs aren&#39;t given out of actual beliefs, but something more agenda driven.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Satanic temple has nothing to do with kidnapping people, or drinking blood. That&#39;s just the Satanic Panic bleeding over (pun intended) from the 80&#39;s.</p>

<p>The church of Satan is an atheistic belief, that has seven tenets:</p>

<p>One should strive to act with compassion and empathy towards all creatures in accordance with reason.</p>

<p>The struggle for justice is an ongoing and necessary pursuit that should prevail over laws and institutions.</p>

<p>One’s body is inviolable, subject to one’s own will alone.</p>

<p>The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo your own.</p>

<p>Beliefs should conform to our best scientific understanding of the world. We should take care never to distort scientific facts to fit our beliefs.</p>

<p>People are fallible. If we make a mistake, we should do our best to rectify it and resolve any harm that may have been caused.</p>

<p>Every tenet is a guiding principle designed to inspire nobility in action and thought. The spirit of compassion, wisdom, and justice should always prevail over the written or spoken word</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Strictly speaking, Satanists are atheists. There is no Satan; there is no God. So-called Satanic atheism is slightly more nuanced than that, as the philosophy prides itself on never advocating any one particular worldview as absolute truth, as doing so would result in a kind of “evangelical atheism” just as dangerous as any other religious group’s efforts at universal conversion.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking, however, the religion rejects the notion of any “big personality” deities—think long white beard—as “silly and without supporting evidence for their existence.” Basically, their official stance on the matter is “grow the fuck up.”</p>

<p>However, as a religion that places the self at the center of existence, each Satanist becomes his own god, “placing himself at the center of his own subjective universe as his own highest value.” Thus, Satanists are sometimes said to worship themselves.  As the most important figures in their own lives, Satanists are free to offer love to those deemed deserving, and wrath, “within reasonable limits,” likewise.</p>
