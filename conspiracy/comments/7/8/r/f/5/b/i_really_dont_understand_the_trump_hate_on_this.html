<p>Trump is bashed 24 hours a day 7 days a week by the media. He has been battling corrupt factions of the FBI and CIA. He has had the biggest political machine in history (DNC) AND media search non stop for any &quot;dirt&quot; on him and yet nothing has been found.  </p>

<p>I think some of you need to open your eyes. What did you expect the cleansing of corruption to look like? </p>

<p>It&#39;s not gonna be Bill Hicks coming back from the grave, kicking Hillary in the vagina and taking over the White House purging the entire government overnight, I&#39;ll tell you that... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Uh, Obama wasn&#39;t president when North Korea went nuclear.</p>

<p>Clinton entered into a nuclear deal with North Korea.  We had inspectors on the ground, and while the North Koreans pushed the envelope repeatedly, their advancement was limited.  Then Bush came in and decided international deals were bullshit (and also wanted to add a non-Muslim country to his &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;), so he began trying to pull out of the deal, which collapsed in 2003.  A few years later, in 2007 -- the year before Obama took office -- North Korea detonated their first nuke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He has no connection to his businesses anymore. Every prez divulges their business interests before becoming president. I just don’t see it here. He’s now the most known person in the entire world. That alone is enough advertising to increase his businesses. Believe it or not they’re are people all over the world who want to stay in a trump hotel just Bc they support the him. Shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone and again, his net worth has dropped 600 million in 9 months. That’s roughly 20% of his entire net worth. Doesn’t seem like a smart strategy for someone trying to make money does it?</p>

<p>This is 100%, completely, absolutely false. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, sure. For your first claim, that he &quot;has no connection to his business anymore&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-11/trump-to-step-down-from-business-will-not-divest-ownership">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-11/trump-to-step-down-from-business-will-not-divest-ownership</a></p>

<p>So he maintains ownership <em>and</em> keeps the management within the family. That&#39;s a far cry from &quot;no connection&quot;</p>

<p>For your second claim that &quot;Every prez divulges their business interests before becoming president&quot; (I&#39;ll assume you meant divest), let&#39;s ask Donald himself</p>

<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/23/trumps-claim-that-the-president-cant-have-a-conflict-of-interest/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/11/23/trumps-claim-that-the-president-cant-have-a-conflict-of-interest/</a></p>

<p>So even he acknowledges that conflict of interest laws don&#39;t apply to him</p>

<p>Do you have any proof for your claims?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The base of this argument is trump wasting taxpayer money more than normal presidents. For one, he is not doing anything above and beyond the normal spending for a president on travel. Second, Obama once gave 500 million to a startup company that went out of business within a year. You know how much golf you trump could play before reaching 500 million? Lol so again I’ll say this whole argument is stupid and a waste of time. </p>

Obama spent <a href="https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-room/press-releases/judicial-watch-new-obama-travel-costs-bring-eight-year-total-96-million/">about $97 million on travel</a> over the course of his presidency.

    <div class="md"><p>You’re forgetting so much. </p>

<p>Obama had Tea Party people holding racist signs about him. He had people accusing him of being a secret Muslim. He had people like Trump falsely accusing him of not even being American! His food was critiqued (how dare anyone use Dijon mustard or speak the word arugula). A fist bump was labeled a “terrorist fist jab”.  Hell, people in this sub still accuse his wife of being a man. </p>

<p>You think Republicans weren’t talking about Obama like that? They flatly stated that their only mission was to block anything he wanted to do. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d say the security money spent on Trump is justifiable. I think every president spends a ridiculous amount of money on vacations. But the security cash seems needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A couple issues: </p>

<p>Trump repeatedly attacked Obama’s spending on trips and security. Trump is absolutely blowing those numbers out of the water and is on track to beat Obama’s 8 year numbers in less than 2, arguably 1 year. </p>

<p>Secondly, most of Trumps trips are to his own resorts where he charges the government to stay there to protect him. The Secret Service literally had to move to a trailer outside of Trump tower because he was charging them such insane numbers.  Furthermore, as he’s going to many of his resorts he’s playing golf constantly, another thing he criticized Obama for doing. </p>

<p>Lastly, Trump himself said during the election that he’d be so busy and doing so much that he’d rarely leave Washington. Yet since day 1 he’s been playing golf and traveling to his resorts every weekend while charging the tax payer millions for it. </p>

<p>Every president incurs costs. No one denies that. The issue is that Trump loudly and brashly attacked Obama and since then he’s gone on to do it far more and at a far higher costs. He’s went back on nearly everything he said about it and the same people who were attacking Obama about travel and spending are now defending Trump for doing even worse!</p>

<p>If you want an example of partisan politics this one is perfect</p>

<p>I mean, the guy lied to your face and right now you’re scrambling trying to defend him. Why? He said he wouldn’t be taking vacations and he’s going to his resorts to golf every single weekend. He said he’d be so busy he’d rarely leave the White House and he’s constantly leaving. He complained about Obama spending money traveling and he’s on pace to spend more than Obama’s 8 years in just 1 year. </p>

<p>Oh, and he claimed he didn’t even need the money so the tax payers would be saving money yet he was trying to charge the secret service so much to use Trump tower they had to move to a fucking trailer outside. He holds meetings with foreign leaders at his hotels where he charges the tax payer money for them to stay. It’s insane. </p>

<p>The plan:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Drastically reduces the corporate tax rate from 35% to 20% (but this is misleading, because most large corporations already only pay about 5% in taxes after loopholes)<br/></li>
<li>DECREASES the highest tax bracket from 39.6% to 35% (the highest tax bracket only applies to income over $400,000--LITERALLY the 1%)</li>
<li>INCREASES the lowest tax bracket from 10% to 12% (that affects approximately 70 MILLION people or nearly 50% of all tax payers).<br/></li>
<li>Eliminates the estate tax, which only applies to people who have more than $5.45 million in assets, therefore only benefiting the uber wealthy.<br/></li>

    <div class="md"><p>So if corporations are only paying 5% as you claim anyway, why not just drop it to 5%?
I’m guessing your reply will be to eliminate tax loopholes. In that case the corporations will just move to a different country with lower taxes. It’s not the oligarchy, it’s basic economics. I’m literally learning this in my intro Econ course right now.
Yes, there are a handful of people of people controlling this country through an oligarchical form of governance, but that doesn’t mean that we can just throw basic economics in the trash. Most of these oligarchs got to their position through competition-reducing regulation anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All money was &quot;already taxed.&quot;  The money I win in a slot machine money I won was &quot;already taxed.&quot;  The casino paid corporate taxes on the money when other players gambled it.  And those people were taxed when that money was paid to them as wages.  And their employers were taxed when that money was earned as business revenue, etc.  </p>

<p>We don&#39;t tax a specific dollar, we apply taxes to the <em>transfer of money,</em> which is why we call it &quot;<em>income</em> tax.&quot;</p>

<p>So if a dollar gets paid to a worker, then spent at the grocery store, which pays the dollar to a dry goods distributor, which uses the dollar in the purchase of a cab from a truck manufacturer, which uses it to buy parts from a engine component manufacturer, which pays the dollar out to shareholders in a stock dividend, and the dollar becomes the fee of the hedge fund manager, who wills the dollar to his idiot kid -- the dollar was taxed at every step except the last one.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually it&#39;s very defensible. The estate tax disproportionately targets the working class up to the upper-middle class by taxing the material value of the deceased&#39;s estate.</p>

<p>Estate taxes on the transfer of companies aren&#39;t based on any fair market value of the company. And estate taxes don&#39;t tax shares that can be sold, or gifted, or held in trust before death.</p>

<p>So what&#39;s indefensible? All I see is yet another tax that doesn&#39;t effect the rich, but seriously prevents anyone in any other class from accumulating wealth over generations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gee, I&#39;m unaware that there was any tax proposals which are directly targeting raising taxes for lower and middle-class people while giving big tax cuts to the rich. Do you have the actual wording of The Proposal that you could post in here as a source? Or do you only have other people saying what he&#39;s trying to do. Do you just have articles of what Trump is pursuing? If you have any document or Bill or actual tax proposal that is being signed and have the wording I would love to read it, other than that I have only heard him say on multiple occasions including the actual wording of a tax plan that he had released previously, that there would be huge tax cuts for the lower and middle class and the very rich may actually end up paying more taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh wow, if the guy who had to pay a $20 million fraud settlement weeks before taking office said it, I guess we have to trust him.  /s</p>

<p>Trump has yet to release a bill but his people have been making the rounds with the basics of his plan for weeks.  The central thrust of the plan is to eliminate a few deductions mostly used by the middle class and upper middle class, while massively cutting the taxes applied to the wealthy.</p>

<p>You and I don&#39;t pay the same types of taxes as the rich.  Our taxes mostly take the form of payroll and ordinary income taxes. That&#39;s true for most people.  But it&#39;s not true of the wealthy. Hedge fund managers, law firm partners, plastic surgeons, trust fund babies, etc. don&#39;t get paid primarily in wages and salary.  They make income through corporate or partnership disbursements, capital asset appreciation, pass-through corporate income, stock appreciation, stock option grants, etc., and their taxes are more skewed towards those types of income, which are all treated differently than salary and wages.</p>

<p>Though it will probably leave the highest nominal rate on ordinary income, Trump&#39;s plan reduces all of those other tax rates above, massively lowering corporate taxes, including on &quot;corporations&quot; that are just a vehicle for the rich guy&#39;s payment -- i.e., I might have to pay a high rate on a million dollar salary, but I would be able to slash my taxes by having that pay come in the form of a payment to my pass-through &quot;consulting&quot; firm for advisory services.  He&#39;s also proposing to repeal the Alternative Minimum Tax, which was a tax reform intended to look at a taxpayers overall bucket of income and make sure he hadn&#39;t overused tax vehicles and shelters, making it easier for the wealthy to escape the income tax and route their pay through lower-tax vehicles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I expect 100% for Donald Trump to state every angle that&#39;s going to be included into his tax reform. I expect his tax reform Bill to reflect the campaign promises concerning tax reform that he campaigned on. Donald Trump has not broken one campaign promise yet. Google it and research it because it is a fact. Donald Trump has kept true on every campaign promise that made me vote for him and I absolutely believe nothing to the contrary that all of a sudden now when it comes to tax reform which is one of the things he campaigned on the hardest that he is going to take a sharp right hand turn and do something that directly contradicts what he campaigned on. He explicitly stated that the lower and middle-class will have lower taxes and that the upper class may have to pay even more in taxes. I will gladly provide a video if I am challenged. But the fact that you are telling me that there are mysterious sources which you have not provided me that in writing other people are quoted saying that they believe they heard Trump may do something different other than the things that he has publicly stated on video that is indisputable that he will intend on doing is hard for me to believe. I believe he will go with the videotape evidence and he will do the things that he promised on the campaign Trail but he will continue to do and one of them is the property tax reform which is lowering taxes for the lower and middle class.</p>

<p>No. There have been serious discussions of both impeachment and invocation of the 25th Amendment to remove Trump. They don&#39;t do that to their stooges.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been well-known for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">decades</a> that the CIA controls the media. The media is selling out all of their credibility to discredit Trump, which will create far-reaching problems for them in the future as everyone shifts to more diverse alternative media, which tells them much more of the truth than the disinformation factories.</p>

<p>Recently, Steve Bannon has announced that they will be challenging many of the incumbent Republicans with millions of dollars from Robert Mercer. There is a very real struggle for power going on right now between competing factions of the ruling class.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see any reason for the deep state to be worried about trump, he&#39;s continuing the afganistan war and put swamp creatures in charge of various agencies like Sessions and Pompeo who are in favor of mass surveillance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Afghan war is about protecting the CIA&#39;s <a href="https://publicintelligence.net/usnato-troops-patrolling-opium-poppy-fields-in-afghanistan/">opium supply</a>. Trump is sending more troops because the Taliban (with Russian backing) was winning the war and threatening the drug supply. </p>

<p>There is very real friction between the intelligence agencies, including the NSA taking down CIA director Petraeus, which caused them to send Snowden to expose the NSA&#39;s warantless wiretapping program, which was generally limited to spying on the CIA, since the FISA court was known to be a rubber stamp on warrant requests against private citizens for years.</p>

<p>People like Mercer are the real ruling class in America. And at times, certain elites may favor policies that are more or less favorable to the American people.</p>

<p>The deep state isn&#39;t unified, and never has been. There are many competing factions. Even people like JFK who genuinely wanted to help the common man were involved with things like the Mafia, out of necessity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The whole deep state was against JFK, which is why they were able to kill him. Trump is in a very different situation, where there is a war going on.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Wall Street is much more accurate than the neocons. Mercer (through Bannon) is about to primary all the neocons. </p>

<p>And have you listened to Bannon lately? He&#39;s talking about the American System of Henry Clay, and banging the drum on economic nationalism. He&#39;s almost a New Deal Democrat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you can&#39;t see the Trump-Russia thing, you aren&#39;t credible as a thinking person to me. You are someone so caught up in your own biases that you let a con man play you. Take the fact that he is allowing the release of the CIA Kennedy stuff. I&#39;ve yet to see anyone on this sub question why he might do that. The answer is obvious to me. He&#39;s pandering to you, just like he did with Obama&#39;s birth certificate, vaccines, and other conspiracy theories. He doesn&#39;t believe that shit. But he knows that you do and if he throws you an occasional bone, you will just blindly follow along. And lots of you prove him right every day. There is no amount of evidence of connections that will make you say there is something odd going on with Trump and Russia. Maybe you believe there isn&#39;t sufficient evidence of collusion (despite an email basically stating it). Okay. But if you don&#39;t find the connections odd, you are hopelessly biased towards the guy. If you think he&#39;s competent or playing 6d chess or whatever, you are hopelessly biased. How hard is it to make a fucking condolence phone call and get basic shit right, like not being a callous asshole to a someone grieving? How hard is it to condemn a white supremacist attack? How hard is it to pass legislation your party wants when you control everything? How hard is it to assemble a team that you don&#39;t have to replace every six months? He can&#39;t get anything right, except pander to you. But that&#39;s clearly enough. If there is anything relative between he and the common person in America, its they feel unfulfilled.</p>

<p>While I disagree, my post had nothing to do with impeachment. OP literally said that we haven&#39;t seen any dirt on Donald Trump. He didn&#39;t qualify it by saying &quot;dirt worthy of impeachment,&quot; he&#39;s claiming that Trump is just the innocent target of the mean establishment.

<p>First, you make a straw man (equivocating a defense of Trump&#39;s actions with someone who believes all dissent should be suppressed) combined with an attempt to shift everyone from specific policies to a vague discussion of &quot;Trump Good!&quot; vs. &quot;Trump Bad!&quot; memetics.</p>

<p>Then you slip in a personal attack to frustrate the OP, and to continue the incessant campaign of attacking anyone who posts here to demoralize them and cut down on the quality of the posts, so that only disinformation agents and new people whose resolve isn&#39;t worn down will post.</p>

<p>Adhom is unsound and everyone here knows that. Trying to get us to argue with each other on an ego level instead of discussing facts. Demoralization combined with division.</p>

That being said,  watching the media constantly shark attack Trump actually gained my trust for him, because the media is 100% full of shit. At the end of the day though,  it&#39;s just Oligarchs maneuvering,  the working people still do not have healthcare and education as basic human rights,  and that imo denigrates humanity for all of us. I appreciate that Trump isn&#39;t looking to tax carbon,  that he is protecting freedom of religion and defending Christians.  Still though,  feeding the military machine doesn&#39;t help my country or my children&#39;s future.  It&#39;s just elite battling out control and oppression,  keep your eyes open,  hope in something realistic,  not the elite white knight,  but the actual majority of humans understanding the system only benefits a very few,  and it is wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point is that those people are going to do what they do anyways, the fact that they believe or worship something that gives them no benefit in the real world makes no difference. It&#39;s just a silly distraction. As if all the world leaders having red hair would give them some sort of sway or advantage, I just don&#39;t see it. I understand where you&#39;re coming from but the satanic angle seems a bit like a straw man to me. </p>

<p>So I can better understand your POV, do you think that these beliefs give this group some sort of supernatural power to control or just that it&#39;s a common thread that holds them together and somehow leads them to nefarious behavior?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ignorance is not the answer to this question, though. It&#39;s good to ignore someone ranting and raving on a street corner, but it&#39;s also good to know your enemy, if they pose a true threat. </p>

<p>To answer your question, I don&#39;t know if it lends them any power, honestly. To me, that they&#39;re some of the most intelligent, worldly, and educated people in the world, and they all both believe in and practice these terrible things, is compelling. My honest take is that it&#39;s used as a control mechanism; that one man with a camera can rule the world if they get a powerful man to commit atrocities and then hold it against them. I wont lie, though: I dont discount the possibility that there is something real to it. From Pythagoras to tesla, great men have been saying that there is more to the world than what we see or are told, and after delving into their beliefs, there is a complete internal logic to many of the systems of thought that most discredit on principle.</p>

You have, in religions, the golden rule. On the other hand, in things like Satanism and the like, &quot;do as you will shall be the whole of the law&quot; as their core philosophy. All the rest, on both sides, is justification and presentation. Boiling those two ideas down to their core gives you STS and STO. I dunno, just my take on it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Reading your comment made me think, and realize something. I too have been watching Trump from afar, at first thinking the idea was ridiculous, then accepting the election results, and making sense of it, then realizing, almost all media criticism of him was either completely false or taken out of context. 
I think he is keeping the MIC close and calm while current events take place. Not everything can be done at once.  The domestic media BS, the media blackout about the Clinton/Uranium scandal, that all stops now. All current events are related. Las Vegas, Weinstein, Corey Feldman, Paddock&#39;s brother/pedo charges, all this is coming to a head. Stay vigilant, folks. </p>

<p>I guess that might be because pretty much half of what you could find has already been found from his shady business dealings, sociopathic lying, threatening his former FBI director, hanging up on the leader of Australia because Trump had a shit fit, throwing paper towels at suffering Puerto Ricans, making really disturbing comments about how hot he thinks his daughter is, calling any journalist who says a single thing negative about him fake news, shoving the leader of Montenegro out of his way at a NATO meeting simply because he wanted to be in the front, lying about the rain at his inauguration, appointing people to positions which they are clearly not qualified for such as Betsy DeVos, choosing that loon Mike Pence as his VP, evading taxes, overtly suggesting 2nd amendment supporters kill Hillary Clinton, tweeting weird shit non-stop, making fun of Mexicans, saying that New York was too cold so we needed global warming and saying that he didn&#39;t think being the president would be this hard.</p>

<p>I could really go on and on if I needed to. That&#39;s just a starter list. The guy is hot trash and Trump supporters like yourself are dispicable. You all keep doubling down on him because you are afraid to admit that you were wrong about how much of an asshole he really is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I gave three different links proving my point. </p>

<p>I mean, the guy lied to your face and right now you’re scrambling trying to defend him. Why? He said he wouldn’t be taking vacations and he’s going to his resorts to golf every single weekend. He said he’d be so busy he’d rarely leave the White House and he’s constantly leaving. He complained about Obama spending money traveling and he’s on pace to spend more than Obama’s 8 years in just 1 year. </p>

<p>Oh, and he claimed he didn’t even need the money so the tax payers would be saving money yet he was trying to charge the secret service so much to use Trump tower they had to move to a fucking trailer outside. He holds meetings with foreign leaders at his hotels where he charges the tax payer money for them to stay. It’s insane. </p>

<p>Not that I expect a reasonable or rational answer from you based on everything else you’ve wrote</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I expect 100% for Donald Trump to state every angle that&#39;s going to be included into his tax reform. I expect his tax reform Bill to reflect the campaign promises concerning tax reform that he campaigned on. Donald Trump has not broken one campaign promise yet. Google it and research it because it is a fact. Donald Trump has kept true on every campaign promise that made me vote for him and I absolutely believe nothing to the contrary that all of a sudden now when it comes to tax reform which is one of the things he campaigned on the hardest that he is going to take a sharp right hand turn and do something that directly contradicts what he campaigned on. He explicitly stated that the lower and middle-class will have lower taxes and that the upper class may have to pay even more in taxes. I will gladly provide a video if I am challenged. But the fact that you are telling me that there are mysterious sources which you have not provided me that in writing other people are quoted saying that they believe they heard Trump may do something different other than the things that he has publicly stated on video that is indisputable that he will intend on doing is hard for me to believe. I believe he will go with the videotape evidence and he will do the things that he promised on the campaign Trail but he will continue to do and one of them is the property tax reform which is lowering taxes for the lower and middle class.</p>
