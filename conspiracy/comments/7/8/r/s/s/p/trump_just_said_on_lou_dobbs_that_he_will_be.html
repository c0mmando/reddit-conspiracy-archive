       If Trump manages to break the backs of big pharma by allowing Medicare to purchase bulk generics, I'll support it. I'm a Bernie voter, but if Trump is willing to make some good policy decisions like that I'm all for it. Not that it will earn him any slack come 2020 ;)

       I understand that many people don’t like his approach and personality. But do you honestly value that over actual change?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’d rather have an asshole that gives positive change versus the smooth-talking career politician that does very little. In a perfect world we’d have a leader that’s both sides of the coin but likely not the choice we are given.

       The companies have to charge more because insurance companies pay only a portion of the final bill. That is why healthcare is more expensive in the US compared to other countries.

       Recently had lasik surgery (not covered by work) and the three tiny .5ml bottles of rx eye drops needed for recovery costs a whopping $550!  Big Pharma needs a kick in the ass. I pray Potus &amp; congress does something to reign in these price gouging dickheads.

       I got into a big argument with a co-worker about this years ago.  He was arguing against subsidizing health care or heath insurance for people in America.  His position was basically no subsidies for any American period.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I brought up the fact that Americans pay more for the exact same drugs other countries pay he said, "Well yeah. That's because they can't afford it."
      </p>
      <p>
       When I then said, "Many Americans can't afford health care or health insurance."  He said something like "pfft....bullshit."
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't believe it and we went round and round about.  He thought it was all perfectly reasonable.

       I was brainwashed by religion when i was a kid.  People start believing shit like this in churches, public schools, etc.  it all works the same way.  When i started questioning religion i started questioning everything.  And if you look at everything you are told with the eye of a skeptic then sometimes you can better determine who is lying &amp; who is telling the truth.
