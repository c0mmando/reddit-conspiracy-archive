        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m relatively new to this, in a way I guess. My parents are weed loving hippies, they sowed the seeds of skepticism for authority from the time I was a toddler. I&#39;ve always just accepted that we are being lied to by the government about most things, I would have considered myself red pilled years before that term came into favor. I&#39;ve always been a fan of Alex Jones, I started really seeking him out when I found out he was arrested at a 9/11 protest.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve herd rants about secret societies, cults, aliens, government conspiracies... But after listening to The Corbett Report &quot;Why big oil conquered the world&quot; twice, and watching the documentery, making it three times total... I feel like I&#39;ve been red pilled, I woke up today and everything was different, but nothing had changed, nothing but my perspective. </p>

<p>I live with my best friend from elementary school, we&#39;re like brothers... Well, we were like brothers until I told him I voted Trump. I always avoided political conversation when I was around him, his (now) ex wife has some participation degree in women&#39;s studies and I wasn&#39;t looking to upset the apple cart. I thought my friend and I had an unspoken agreement that she was stupid and sheepish. When she left him I moved myself in to make sure he didn&#39;t kill himself.</p>

<p>I tried to talk to him today, I wanted to talk to him about what the documentery did to my head. From the second I used the words &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; his eyes glazed over and by the end of the (short) conversation I felt heartbroken. My friend watches cable news, mostly cnn and msnbc, on a daily basis, he&#39;s actually addicted to the TV, I think that&#39;s fair to say. If he&#39;s home, the TV is on, just pumping propaganda and advertisements into his head, all day. It was like he was programmed to just turn off his intellect and shrug off anything that comes anywhere near the words &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;.</p>

<p>This is most people, I&#39;m smart enough to read people before I open up about my opinion on things, most aren&#39;t even worth the effort of discussing anything more than the superficial. They are perfectly content to slide further and further into 1984, I&#39;m surrounded by newspeak. In the last two days I&#39;ve felt so helpless, not about breaking my friends conditioning, he can drink all the kool-aid he wants, fuck that guy. It&#39;s because the bigger picture that&#39;s just been revealed to me is so much worse than I could have imagined. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t fight an enemy you can&#39;t see. </p>

<p>No one&#39;s eyes seem to be open, it&#39;s been literally screaming directly at me for years (in the form of Alex Jones) and I didn&#39;t see it. Is Alex a plant? From my new perspective it seems an awful lot like his bombastic personality is designed to add another layer of obfuscation to the truth, to desensitize those looking for answers. I used to believe that we NEED people like Alex in the world, we don&#39;t. He&#39;s not helping.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna go ahead and assume that most people who frequent this sub think Alex Jones is controlled opposition. Mixing lies with truth, focusing on some things while completely ignoring other things that TPTB are into.      </p>

<p>That&#39;s my opinion anyways. Though, like many, Alex was a stepping stone in my personal &quot;red pilling&quot;...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Be innocent of that evil.  Read the Bible if you want truth that won&#39;t deceive you.  The secret societies, cults, devil worshippers, and the like hide all of their secrets in the dark because they can&#39;t stand in the light.  If you want to feed your curiosities, I recommend a read of Screwtape Letters by C.S. Lewis.  Then jump over to mere Christianity.  Or start there.  </p>

<p>Either way, be careful of the man made rabbit holes.  Seek first the Kingdom of God, and everything else will fall into place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read the New testament from cover to cover exactly three times. Once when I was fourteen so I could better debate the religious majority of my highschool, point out contradictions and nonsensical bullshit. 
Once when I was twenty three to see if I could find any significance to the words. 
And this last time, in July of this year, prompted by listening to a lecture from Jordan Peterson. 
I think I&#39;ve found what God means, to me, I see the truths in the scripture, I see the utility of the words. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the correlation here. Are you suggesting that only the Bible can provide any real truth? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, Cooper would be considered as much of a &quot;plant&quot; today as AJ is, if he were still around. I mean, he claimed to have found part of <em>Pale Horse</em> &quot;left behind in a copy machine&quot;, iirc.</p>

<p>Everyone is a potential disinfo agent in CT-land. Just look at the amount of people who think Assange is a plant, dead, a Ruskie agent, etc.</p>

<p>I for one appreciate both Bill Cooper&#39;s and Alex&#39;s for their contributions to my search for Truth. They&#39;re guides on the path, but that doesnt mean they have to be accurate, or that I stumble into every trap that they do. I also appreciate their willingness to put things out regardless of the cost to their &quot;credibility&quot;. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the very least, the Julian we see today ain&#39;t the same Julian we knew a few years ago. I suppose living inside a pressure cooker does that to ya.</p>

<p>There are a bunch of theories about his whereabouts, including everything from Guantanamo Bay, over a shallow grave somewhere, all the way to him being safe and sound in a secret exile somewhere. Call it wishful thinking, but I&#39;m partial to the last idea. I think a group of insiders that&#39;s mostly aligned with the values held by this sub might have had him &quot;kidnapped&quot; a year ago when the embassy went dark, and he&#39;s since been hidden somewhere safe, so he can revalidate the &quot;October surprise&quot; release we were set to receive a year ago.</p>

<p>Someone like that, you have to teach them critical thinking or logic first with &#39;regular&#39; non-conspiracy topics. If you could get him into logic puzzles (or any puzzles), even that would be great for critical thinking and IQ.</p>

<p>Trumps deep Zionist and Saudi nods as soon as he could show them made me hope he is only acting.</p>

<p>Likewise Aj&#39;s statements and lack of criticism of the Dancing Israeli&#39;s makes me hope they are foxing.</p>

<p>We will find out sooner rather than later I think. Jones has CIA connections and doesn&#39;t criticize the Zionist agenda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most people would rather die -- or, indeed, murder their loved ones -- than seriously challenge their worldview. Remember that. </p>

<p>As for Alex Jones, yeah I think he&#39;s a plant. He tells a lot of truth, but he associates that truth with a ranty red-faced crazy fat man. So when you tell others that same truth, they&#39;ll subconsciously equate you to a ranty red-faced crazy fat man and emotionally dismiss you.</p>

<p>That whole crew, including Joe Rogan and Eddie Bravo, is dirty af in my opinion -- which sucks, as I used to consider Joe, in particular, to be a great role model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have the same problem with my boyfriend. He gets angry and upset if I begin to discuss these topics. We&#39;ve been together a decade and he knows that I&#39;m a rational person, a scientist like him, and he used to really respect me, he gets my help with his work etc. Yet for some reason he can&#39;t accept that I might have done my homework and that the things I&#39;m trying to tell him are real - he&#39;d prefer to believe I&#39;ve lost my mind and plummeted about 50 IQ points.</p>

<p>He was outraged by what happened at the Catalonia vote, with the police coming in and beating people up for trying to vote. Yesterday the Spanish foreign minister called that vilence &#39;fake news&#39; and my boyfriend was horrified and came to tell me about it, and I said &#39;I&#39;m not surprised. This is what these leaders do, they do it all the time about everything.&#39; And he just got really angry and said &#39;No this is nothing like your conspiracy bullshit. Why did you have to go and ruin a good conversation?&#39;</p>

<p>I can&#39;t wrap my head around it, how he can see something like that, where he knows it&#39;s not fake because he watched it unfold online and saw all the footage and eye witness testimony, can see the politician calling it fake, yet can&#39;t put two and two together and realise that a lot of stuff politicians or the media call fake news is actually real, it&#39;s just something they don&#39;t want people to know abotu or pay attention to. He STILL didn&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>But I think we just have to let it go, never mention the words &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; never go on a rant or talk explicitly about it. Let them direct it, e.g. when something happens on the news and they mention it, talk about it like a &#39;normal&#39; person would and just throw in the occasional question to get them thinking. That&#39;s the best you can do.</p>

<p>But don&#39;t worry, there are a lot more people out there who are &#39;awake&#39; than there used to be!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s become really important to me in the last few years that my significant other be open minded, willing to talk about any subject without prejudice. My current girlfriend has been so good at this, making me feel like I can talk about anything with her has made me fall in love. It&#39;s honestly something I&#39;ve never had before, not to this degree anyway, and it&#39;s so refreshing. Being able to be open and talk about all the crazy shit on my mind, ah, it&#39;s great, I&#39;ll stop rubbing it in now. </p>

<p>You are totally right about getting rid of those words, I see what a nusence they have become, the potential they have to wreck conversations and even my own thought process. I&#39;m attempting to take them out of my vocabulary and my thoughts. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I would love it if my boyfriend would be more open minded, perhaps one day he&#39;ll see it. It&#39;s difficult knowing that your other half sort of thinks you&#39;re mad. I met him before I &#39;woke up&#39; so if I was single now I&#39;d definitely look for someone I could talk to about that stuff! I&#39;m jealous!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a conversation with a couple of friends of mine regarding the DNC&#39;s sabotaging of the Bernie campaign, and the very real mathematical patterns in vote tallies that suggested that voting machines were hacked in Hillary&#39;s favour during the democratic primary. </p>

<p>One is a teacher and one is a liberal-ish lawyer (ex-teacher) and neither would countenance the idea. Wouldn&#39;t even consider the possibility that electronic voting machines, which have been proven to be easily hackable, would have been hacked to flip votes for Hillary <em>even though there is no other reasonable explanation for many of the vote tally patterns recorded.</em> </p>

<p>The two of them further went on to explain to me that none of this really mattered because Bernie was &quot;unelectable&quot;, and that he could never win the black vote. It was weird for me to hear these two formerly intelligent people parrot back to me the MSM talking points about why Bernie couldn&#39;t win. Polls had Bernie ahead of Trump by double digits right up until he conceded, and what&#39;s more, how could any rational person claim that a guy who marched with MLK, and who was pushing for universal health care, prison reform, free college tuition, and a $15/hr minimum wage <em>could not win the black vote?</em></p>

<p>Totally eerie for me. Haven&#39;t talked to either of them since. It&#39;s really easy to lose friends over this kind of shit. </p>
