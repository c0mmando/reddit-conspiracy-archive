    <div class="md"><p>Well you should also know that there are non Russian people here who definitely don&#39;t believe the Russia bullshit. I&#39;m a Progressive Populist who voted for Bernie and wrote his name in in November, and to me the Russian narrative has always been nothing but a convenient excuse to ignore the base of the Party and the change we are demanding, by blaming HRC&#39;s loss not on failed Neoliberal policies, a bad career, and a terrible campaign strategy (ya know, like ignoring Wisconsin and Michigan after the convention), by instead riling up a new red scare and claiming the election was stolen.  </p>

<p>Hillary lost, and if the Dems want any sort of political future, they need to listen to the damn base and move Left towards Bernie. That is their only future. I won&#39;t vote for another Corporatist, just like I didn&#39;t vote for HRC. Hillary, her hubris, and her sycophantic inner circle ensured she would lose.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia didn&#39;t &quot;hax the elections&quot;. If you believe that some online shills undermined HRC, I think that&#39;s pretty funny. What propaganda do you think they were spreading? Her husband supported NAFTA, she supported CAFTA, TPP, TPIP, and TISA. She lied, repeatedly, about her server and her emails, which she should have come clean about immediately if she didn&#39;t want it to be an issue. Podesta leaks emails show that HRC and the DNC helped prop Trump up as  Pied Piper. She viciously slandered Bernie and his supproters, claiming we were all sexist white men. So I think the entire Russia narrative is bullshit, if there were shills, it&#39;s HRC&#39;s fault for having a shitty career, and for beign a shitty person, that they were able to spread <em>real</em> dirt on her.</p>

<p>Think about this- <em>regardless</em> of Russia, if HRC had fucking campaigned in Wisconsin and Michigan, instead of abandoning <em>key Democrat Constituencies</em>, she would have been president. <em>She</em> lost this elections, based on her career and shitty campaigning strategies. </p>

<p>No, <em>operatives</em>, from <em>all sides</em> are targeting this sub. Were you there in r/sandersforpresident, when CTR first showed up? Did you see HRC/DNC shills single-handedly co-opt r/politics after the convention? What about when Assange went dark last October, and mods on r/wikileaks changed and we couldn&#39;t question what was going on? You have no fucking clue what you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>You have no response to me, you offer no proof, because there is none. Your argument is pathetic, and you are attempting not only to slander me, but you are breaking the rules of the sub by actively calling me a shill. Again- proof? From my own posts or comments? I&#39;ll wait. Unlike people like you, who argue and hang around here in bad faith, I like to sit in /new and engage with people. So like I said, I&#39;ll be here all night if you want to prove your claims. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Check their post histories mate. First thing you&#39;ll notice is a particular sub whose best interests are served in auto-reflexively discrediting anything like this, no matter how obvious or well established it may be. This is why you&#39;re getting &quot;fuck off with your partisan political bullshit&quot; replies even though you didn&#39;t mention politics. It&#39;s political to THEM, and thus they reveal themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first glance, it tells me that that you&#39;re really trying to politicise this because you associate anyone mentioning Russia with anti-Trump/pro-Hillary. It also tells me that you&#39;re fighting off shill accusations. For what it&#39;s worth (probably nothing) I don&#39;t think you&#39;re a Russian shill.

<p>To me it&#39;s inherently political, but I respect your opinion if you think differently.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From this thread alone...which I find pretty funny. No one wants to offer proof based off of my copious post and submission history.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I agree. Though we likely differ on the details.</p>

<p>Gee, someone tell the rest of America and the entire mainstream media! FFS, some people. When he was elected doesn&#39;t mean shit, what a crap argument. He&#39;s POTUS, you can&#39;t claim he&#39;s irrelevant no matter how triggered you are.</p>
