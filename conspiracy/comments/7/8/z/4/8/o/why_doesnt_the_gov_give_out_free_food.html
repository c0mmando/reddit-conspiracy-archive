    <div class="md"><p>It has to do with the actual basis of power, especially in the economy. Farms are owned either by small families or, increasingly, megacorps. With property rights, if they own the land, they can do whatever they want with what is produced on the land, which usually means sell it. Unless the government were to actually buy out and legally own the farms, as the Imperial Estates were, or buy the grain themselves, as was also often the case in Rome, then it won&#39;t happen.</p>

<p>Not that this is to say that it is not an admirable goal. I just don&#39;t believe it&#39;s feasible until we have the tech to move to a post-scarcity society. Only if the incentive for monetization of the basic necessities of life is removed can we have a realistic chance of something like this, and without causing total anarchy and likely a totalitarian dictatorship, we wont do that without some tech that I feel is just over the horizon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not free. It&#39;s all based on taxes and even the poor pay taxes. If the government gives it out then it can be taken away. How about people learn how to live self sustainable lives. You know like hunting, fishing, gardening, etc. Once they get to a point with their communities they can create co-ops and food gardens. The ironic thing about your post and my comment is that the government is preventing people from doing this very thing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because the government gives you nothing! the food is never free, its either donated by other people or paid for in taxes. if either of these dicontinue, you have to hunt or forage- but theres a limit on that too because of the &quot;no hunting&quot; laws.
 so keep your job and pay taxes or you&#39;re screwed bro. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you give away food for free, then you put all the stores that sell it out of business. You also put their suppliers out of business, and, unless you&#39;re buying from the producers who used to supply the supplier, then you put them out of business too. </p>

<p>Haiti is a great example of how you can fuck up a country with too much free food. US wanted to help Haiti so they sent them a bunch of US grown rice for free. That put every Haitian rice seller, wholesaler, distributor and farmer out of business. Haitians stopped producing their own rice, and when the US cut off the free rice, the native rice infrastructure never recovered, and Haitians found themselves importing a product from abroad they used to produce domestically. </p>

<p>This of course is a dramatic oversimplification of what happened, but hopefully you get the idea.</p>

<p>This is, as an aside, a good argument for giving out money instead of goods to the victims of disasters, famines, and droughts. Money will always attract goods, and won&#39;t put anyone out of business. It helps people without distorting local economies. </p>
