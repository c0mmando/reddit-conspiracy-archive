    <div class="md"><p>Why the insults it makes you look unintelligent.  He&#39;s actually right. The US NEVER shipped or approved any shipments of uranium to Russia.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is also important to note that other federal approvals were needed to complete the deal, and even still more approvals would be needed to export the uranium.</p>

<p>First, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission had to approve the transfer of two uranium recovery licenses in Wyoming from Uranium One to the Russian company. The NRC announced it approved the transfer on Nov. 24, 2010. But, as the NRC explained at the time, “no uranium produced at either facility may be exported.”</p>

<p>As NRC explained in a March 2011 letter to Republican Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the Russian company would have to apply for and obtain an export license and “commit to use the material only for peaceful purposes” in accordance with “the U.S.-Russia Atomic Energy Act Section 123 agreement for peaceful nuclear cooperation.”</p>

<p>In a June 2015 letter to Rep. Peter Visclosky, the NRC said it granted RSB Logistics Services an amendment to its export license in 2012 to allow the Kentucky shipping company to export uranium to Canada from various sources — including from a Uranium One site in Wyoming. The NRC said that the export license allowed RSB to ship uranium to a conversion plant in Canada and then back to the United States for further processing.</p>

<p>Canada must obtain U.S. approval to transfer any U.S. uranium to any country other than the United States, the letter says.</p>

<p>“Please be assured that no Uranium One, Inc.-produced uranium has been shipped directly to Russia and the U.S. Government has not authorized any country to re-transfer U.S. uranium to Russia,” the 2015 letter said.</p>

<p>“That 2015 statement remains true today,” David McIntyre, a spokesman for the NRC, told us in an email.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;The deal made Rosatom one of the world’s largest uranium producers and brought Mr. Putin closer to his goal of controlling much of the global uranium supply chain.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;....despite assurances by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that uranium could not leave the country without Uranium One or ARMZ obtaining an export license — which they do not have — yellowcake from his property was routinely packed into drums and trucked off to a processing plant in Canada&quot;.</p>

<hr/>

<p>One of the defenses to the Clinton in their 145 million dollar Scam to turn over uranium to Putin, was that it would never leave the country.</p>

<p>Wrong--according to the New York Times!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The article also states</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Asked about that, the commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada even though it does not have an export license. Instead, the transport company doing the shipping, RSB Logistic Services, has the license. A commission spokesman said that “to the best of our knowledge” most of the uranium sent to Canada for processing was returned for use in the United States. A Uranium One spokeswoman, Donna Wichers, said 25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The New York Times article concluded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The “no export” assurance given at the time of the Rosatom deal is not the only one that turned out to be <strong>less than it seemed</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So RSB had a license. Some amount of uranium was exported to Canada, and some went to major and stable allies.</p>

<p>If we still have objections to this whole deal, the answer is a general ban on uranium transactions. Government should handle these issues -- not businesses who give &quot;assurances.&quot; </p>

<p>The whole point of this transaction is for partisan advantage as I said. Point one -- that Russia has plenty of materials -- still stands and still makes this entire story partisan banter.</p>
