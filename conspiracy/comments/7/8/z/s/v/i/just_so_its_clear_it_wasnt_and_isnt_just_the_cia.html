        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The CIA is real and it exists on paper, but if you really want to see what the CIA is, its first necessary to imagine a world without boarders.  There is a world without boarders already, YOU just aren&#39;t a part of it.  The &quot;CIA&quot; is just what Americans call that visible part of something that Americans know shouldn&#39;t exist.</p>

<p>A government that explicitly isn&#39;t &quot;of the people&quot; or &quot;for the people&quot;.  </p>

<p>Its a ruling class, a separate class of people that isn&#39;t necessarily defined by money.  Sure money comes with it, its definitely part of the birthright. Put another way, everyone with the birthright has plenty of money but NOT everyone with plenty of money has the birthright.</p>

<p>So the CIA is just part of our government that was carved out by these people (hijacked from &quot;the people&quot;) where the constitution and every other law of the land can be fully ignored.  Where inductees are selected by internally prescribed methods (the easiest kind of methods to hijack) and &quot;The People&quot; have absolutely no representation within these secretive organizations.</p>

<p>You see the problem yet?</p>

<p>Its not the CIA its a group that&#39;s much bigger, the CIA is officially a supernational organization that not only has effective control of the American intelligence complex, but many other similar organizations from many other nation states.</p>

<p>If the USA were to sink into the ocean tomorrow, the &quot;CIA&quot; would only lose a small fraction of its total assets.  It is a foreign and a domestic organization at the same time.  Its super-national and thus its not American.</p>

<p>If you want to have any chance of &quot;making america great again&quot;. The very first thing you should do is get rid of the CIA.</p>

<p><strong>Disband the CIA</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>We wouldn&#39;t win in that scenario.  Our best chance would be to kick them out and hope they don&#39;t destroy us in <em>their</em> reaction.</p>

<p>Not to be abrasive, but your comments seems to hint that think the United States Government, if severed from its intelligence complex, would be the larger of the two separate entities.  That would be wrong and all the military equipment in the world is helpless against a target it can&#39;t identify to aim its guns at.  Furthermore we are all feeding from their trough. </p>

<p>Take a wild deer, start leaving a trough of feed out for it with perfect consistency for a year.  Wait for that deer to have a baby and that baby grows in a world where the trough is all it has ever known for feed.  Once the mommy deer dies,  If you take the trough away the young deer will die.</p>
