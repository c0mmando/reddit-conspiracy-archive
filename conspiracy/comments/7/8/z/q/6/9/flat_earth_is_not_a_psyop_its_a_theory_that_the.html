It dominates in religious circles who believe that a Flat Earth is proof of significance and possibly a loving God,  where the globe model tells you that you are but a speck of dust in time which is attractive to atheist thinking.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s documentary proof that NASA was faking that particular shot.</p>

<p>If the embedded date on that footage is accurate... (note: NASA refused to comment on it except to verify it is genuine footage) then the moon landings could not have happened as described. The astronauts were evidently still in LEO when they were supposed to be halfway to the moon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well im not gonna get into a debate with you, but yes people believe it, including myself. Primarily because information in the video can be proven by the scientific method, as opposed to just taking the word of governmental agencies and the scientific establishment who &quot;know&quot; that the earth is a &quot;globe&quot; because they &quot;have been to space&quot;.      </p>

<p>There is ample evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that NASA has provided fraudulent proof of space flight to the public, this alone should at least get one to question their &quot;truths&quot; about the nature of earth and space. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s funny because I could ask you the same question. Of course the difference is that with flat earth theory, scientific method can prove them, where as with globe earth theory, you need to have access to &quot;space ships&quot; to &quot;prove&quot; them.     </p>

<p>Really watch the 200 proofs video with an open mind. I know its hard, because of what you have been indoctrinated into believing all your life...i was in the same situation before I woke up to it. I haven&#39;t always been a flat earthier....      </p>

<p>and while you are at it, here are a handful of videos that show simple experiments that anyone, including yourself, can perform to help you better understand what Dubay&#39;s video is explaining.      </p>

<p>No, this still image does NOT prove that the sun is below the horizon...you can literally move that point up to the horizon and maintain the angles of the rays. And if the sun was below the horizon, the reflection of the rays on the water would not reach that far and maintain uniformity. And its a pretty shitty image.      </p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, its ignoring the lie that they tell you. Rockets rely on thrust. Thrust relies on propellant coming into contact with other matter. In empty space no thrust would be created. This is why the flys can not fly in the video, because there is no air (matter) for their wings to come into contact with. All these rocket launches that they tell you are going into space don&#39;t even come close to where they say space is.   </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Because of atmospheric conditions and lens strength. If you actually watched the 200 proofs video, you would see examples of being able to see landmarks from distances that a globe earth would not allow, because if globe earth were true, you would have to be looking through the earth to see said landmarks.      </p>

<blockquote>

Gas wants to expand into empty space. If there is no physical barrier between our atmosphere and empty space, then our atmosphere would expand into empty space. Did you not watch the video?      </p>
</blockquote>

<p>All this information is in the 200 proofs video. If you could just allow yourself to understand what is being said, it would make perfect sense. But you are too busy remembering lies that you have been told. Again...all these things can be tested...and if thats what it takes for you to get it, then try it for yourself, just as so many people have.     </p>

<p>What? Why? You have the sky and clouds reflecting and its pretty well known that bright light sources can illuminate things not directly in contact with it. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rockets rely on thrust. Thrust relies on propellant coming into contact with other matter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right... For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. So as the rocket expels energy what do you think happens to the rocket expelling that energy? The rocket is pushing off of itself, not the air. </p>

<p>Its literally the 3rd law of physics. What happens to the energy when a rocket releases fuel according to you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This is why the flys can not fly in the video, because there is no air (matter) for their wings to come into contact with.</p>

<p>Right... Which is why you cant &quot;swim&quot; in space. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. This is reeeeaaaaaallllllyyyyyyy important and you need to read up on this subject. </p>

<p>That is not science. Perform that test once an hour every 24 hours and Im willing to bet you will get dramatically different results. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>not even close man. Your comments just make me chuckle because i have read them numerous times before from numerous other &quot;iamverysmart&quot; people.      </p>

<p>It just pointless to debate the issue with people like you because your mind is so damn entrenched in lies that you willfully ignore truths that are slapping you in the face.       </p>

<p>All you do is regurgitate pseudo science, ignore all the easily verifiable data that we provide to you, and tell us that you are &quot;very well educated&quot;.     </p>

<p>And yes, I realize what I&#39;m saying here, you could regurgitate it back at me. The difference between us though, is that I use to be you. Instead of looking at flat earth with an open mind and letting the information sink in, or even considering that it could be true, I would look at it only to disprove it and prove globe earth. I would say, &quot;well that&#39;s not true because science has taught me that this is true&quot; without actually considering what was being said or that what science told me might not be true....</p>

<p>So i get why you are the way you are, but after so many times of trying to convince people like you that they are missing something, its just tiresome and not worth my energy, so as I said in the beginning, im not gonna sit here and debate this with you....I have done that enough already.     </p>

<p>One of the facts here is that YOU are not being objective. Just because the fact involves the person, doent make that fact less relevant to the conversation.       </p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t implying that you were smarter than me, I was implying that your arrogance is your counter to the facts being presented to you.         </p>

<blockquote>
<p>You don&#39;t know the subject well.       </p>

<p>I respectfully disagree...                   </p>

<p>ok...last example I&#39;m going to give you.        </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/nPXaLTjmypY">This video</a> shows a time lapse of sunrise to sunset in the antarctic fall/winter, or spring/summer for the arctic. Reference <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R52_PdZlSq8&amp;amp;t=599s">this video</a> to help visualize it....and I am only using that for a basic understanding of how the sun rotates over the flat earth. I have not done enough study to say for certain that the accuracy of the dates and positions are perfect...nor does the creator of the model....he clearly says that it is a rough 1st draft of the model.       </p>

<p>If globe earth was really rotating around the sun and spinning on its on axis, this sunrise/sunset would not be possible because the sun stays in the foreground, never getting behind the point where the camera is. But what we see in the video makes perfect sense, if in fact the sun is rotating over the face of a flat earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude...no one has actually proven that gravity exists. Even NDT and the like, when asked what gravity is, have no answer to give. Some people will reee &quot;Cavendish&quot; experiment...but ignore that it is fundamentally flawed.     </p>

<p>And as for disproving it. You can start by watching the videos I provided in other comments. Plenty of resources available o nthe web. Though there is a lot of disinformation as well, so be mindful.     </p>

<p>Effects &quot;caused by gravity&quot; can all be explained with density/buoyancy and a natural up and down in nature. But TPTB know that they need something more for their globe model lie to work, so they made up gravity to fill in all the holes in their theory, even though the scientific method can not prove it/recreate it.       </p>

<p>They actually want people to believe that some magical force, <a href="https://youtu.be/EBZOggGpZ-o">which they can&#39;t explain</a>, can be <strong>simultaneously</strong> strong enough to keep the oceans and atmosphere &quot;in place&quot; (except when they aren&#39;t) on the face of a extremely fast moving and spinning sphere and weak enough that I can walk around and jump off said face under my own strength....its ridiculous.     </p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok...lets keep this really simple....      </p>

<p>You say, &quot;earth is a globe&quot;, I say &quot;its not&quot;....         </p>

<p>You give me some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism">theory</a>, <a href="https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F6iwRYGY.jpg&amp;amp;imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2Fgallery%2FpqTvn&amp;amp;docid=J0KrJ0U9gExIFM&amp;amp;tbnid=aHnM3K_-coV43M%3A&amp;amp;vet=10ahUKEwj_zv603pLXAhVE8WMKHZisCb4QMwhCKAIwAg..i&amp;amp;w=3300&amp;amp;h=2550&amp;amp;bih=949&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;q=earth%20curvature%20chart&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwj_zv603pLXAhVE8WMKHZisCb4QMwhCKAIwAg&amp;amp;iact=mrc&amp;amp;uact=8">a math equation</a>, and a <a href="https://twistedsifter.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/red-bull-stratos-felix-baumgartner-space-jump-12.jpg?w=800&amp;amp;h=450">distorted</a> or even a straight up <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/images/galleries/618486main_earth_320.jpg">fabricated</a> image taken by people &quot;in space&quot;.      </p>

<p>I give you a <a href="https://youtu.be/h5i_iDyUTCg?t=41m36s">simple example of an experiment</a>, which you can perform yourself, that contradicts said theory, math equation and distorted image....       </p>

<p>You proceed to throw another theory, math equation, and a distorted or straight up fabricated image at me to tell me I&#39;m wrong, while completely ignoring your own senses via the experiment....      </p>

<p>See the problem? Can you comprehend why i would have a lack of enthusiasm to engage in that kind of debate?       </p>

<p>I could do this with all your spinning ball earth gravity theory, but if all you are gonna do is preach and ignore what I offer you...then I will simply stop offering you my understanding. Because you don&#39;t want it....you want your belief to be correct...scientific method, senses, perception...TRUTH be damned!</p>

<p>I do have math, its just different from yours. Primarily because my math and the results from my experiments coincide in physical reality.              </p>

<p>There is a difference between watching something and understanding what you are watching. You don&#39;t understand because you don&#39;t want to understand...you WANT the curvature to be there. But as we can see from the experiments shown in the video, it isn&#39;t there.            </p>

<p>Or maybe you do understand and are just pretending that you don&#39;t...either way, I don&#39;t see a reason to continue discussing this with you...            </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I always have the same question, about intercontinental ballistic missiles. Is it the implication of Flat Earth proponents that the telemetry of those missiles is faked?</p>

<p>Like, the scientists input data based on the Earth as a sphere, but since the Earth is actually flat, someone involved in the conspiracy <em>replaces</em> that data with &quot;correct&quot; telemetry based on the Earth secrecy lay being flat? Then the missles hit the target, fooling the scientists and arms manufacturers into believing the Earth is actually a sphere?</p>

<p>Because if so, that&#39;s about the stupidest conspiracy theory that I&#39;ve ever heard of.</p>

<p>So the question is: did the vast Flat Earth Conspiracy intercept the microchips and drives used to navigate those rockets and replace the data with correct flat earth data, or did they not. The telemetry and navigation data on those rockets assumes that the earth is a rotating sphere. The rockets would <em>absolutely not land where they were intended to land</em> if the data remained intact, put there by scientists who had normal &quot;spherical&quot; science educations.</p>

<p>The Flat Earth Conspiracy is based on the idea that intra-global telemetry, satellite design, rocketry, Global Positioning, and marine navigation are engaged in a non-stop, centuries long secret conspiracy to replace all the data and calculations made by those who believe the Earth is a sphere with different equations, so that the objective is achieved and no one is the wiser. The sheep go on 
believing the Earth is a sphere.</p>

<p>It&#39;s so mind-numbingly stupid it&#39;s hard to believe it&#39;s NOT a psyop.</p>

<p>ICBMS travel 250 miles high, leaving the planet&#39;s atmosphere and then re-entering it.

    <div class="md"><p>The earth is flat. First, water always retains it&#39;s level, and the scientific equation for the Earth&#39;s curvature can&#39;t be duplicated at ground level I have specifically asked globe believers to prove this equation. They can&#39;t. Second, science states that the sun is 93million miles away with the earth orbiting that huge orbit, while spinning at 1,000 miles an hour, while spiraling through space at 66,600 miles an hour. That means we are traveling one direction, 67 times more in another direction, and 600 times more in another direction,but we see perfect circle star trails. If you had a time machine (no I don&#39;t believe in time travel) you could go back 65 million years in the past and see the same constellations as today. Therefore the earth is not spinning the Stars, sun, moon, etc. are the moving objects</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just try it. Measure for say 20 miles. It should be around 8 inches per each mile. That should be at least 160 inches of curvature, or over 13 ft. Of curvature. If you can prove that this is correct then ill believe in the globe. This is the scientific equation for the earths curvature. If this can&#39;t be proven.

<p>Also, is this a biblical theory? Because if is just say so. It doesn&#39;t seem to be remotely scientific and isn&#39;t possible under the current understanding of basic physics. So if Satan is in fact the party ultimately responsible for this deception than just make that clear and we can push Flat Earth into the same pile as creationism, spontaneous generation, and divine guidance - metaphysical claims that are clearly religious in nature rather than scientific. </p>
