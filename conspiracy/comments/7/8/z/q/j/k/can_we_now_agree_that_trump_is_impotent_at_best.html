<p>Our president just denied us our right to truth. He&#39;s either complicit in this decision, or impotent to do anything about it, that much is settled. I never want to hear someone on this sub tell me how Trump is different from any other president or is some kinda bright light in the &quot;globalist&quot; dark ever again. Bannon fooled you into thinking Trump lives outside the corrupt muck, it&#39;s time you make yourself aware of that so you can move past it, admit you were wrong, and proceed to fight the good fight. I know that&#39;s a hard thing to do when you&#39;ve tied up so much personal hope and faith in a person, but it needs to be done.</p>

<p>Imagine if Obama made this decision, your mind would be made up immediately, your better instincts want to pull you toward the same conclusion here. This is bullshit, you know it.</p>

<p>Obama had wins &amp; losses too. He made decisions we will never understand because we didn&#39;t have his info. At what point did you judge him on a single day or issue? </p>

<p>May I point you to Dick Cheney, who was running the country while Bush smiled and waived. That&#39;s what I&#39;m getting at. While, yes, the president can veto and Executive Order until he&#39;s blue in the face, it means nothing except to people who want to listen. If the Deep State (which we all know exists * ) really exists ( * ) then he has no real power, and that is what I&#39;m saying. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that was an example of someone from an extra-governmental entity making the important decisions in our country. After his time in the DoD, he was the Chairman and CEO of Halliburton, a major defense contractor for the US. He was taking in crazy money and perpetuating the war machine, weather or not he was in office. Right now, my example would be George Soros, using privately funded groups to influence group think in the general population. Look in to how influential he&#39;s been in economies world wide. If he can do that, there&#39;s no doubt he has politicians on the take, even if it&#39;s not directly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will agree with you 💯, til you tell me he&#39;s running trump or the current White House. They are actively fighting this shit, taking down money laundering &amp; human trafficking rings. This is google-able. It&#39;s no coincidence. </p>

<p>I think the most interesting fact not mentioned much is the recent publication that trump has lost millions in self-worth since taking office. I can&#39;t remember the number, butit sounded devastating to me. And people were assholes - like, &quot;omg what president LOSES money in the White House?&quot; And I&#39;m like &quot;that&#39;s exactly the point. What president becomes so to enrich himself?&quot; </p>

<h1>All if them. Til now.</h1>

<p>Trust, don&#39;t trust. I don&#39;t personally care, <strong>but don&#39;t say trump I say in anyone&#39;s pocket when it&#39;s an easily verifiable fact he&#39;s sacrificing his personal wealth to be in office.</strong></p>

<p>Did you know a couple of senators &quot;retired&quot; yesterday? One in particular, jeff flake, said it was impossible to be a republican anymore because of trump. He&#39;s been in congress for a decade, but he threw in the towel like a full-on bitch (as he was polling -15 behind).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the whole drain the swamp thing is still on. Midterms are coming and I&#39;ve always said since we really don&#39;t know what his plan is we should wait for them to be over and then see how he&#39;s doing.   Things are starting to really take off now with the uranium one and the Russian dossier and with the JFK files I believe he&#39;s holding on to the rest of them for a 180 days to see if anybody can come up with a good reason to keep them Secret. This would also suggest he wants any bombshells to drop with good timing along with any prosecutions having to do with crimes of the DNC. Too me, things are lining up for a really exciting 2018. I believe the Democrats are going to receive an absolute routing.</p>

<p>To be clear I don&#39;t know what could be in those files that could help him or harm any or anyone else but then again we have no idea what is in them so we&#39;ll just have to wait and see</p>
