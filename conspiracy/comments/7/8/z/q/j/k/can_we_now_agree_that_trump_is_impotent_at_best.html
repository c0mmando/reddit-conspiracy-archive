       Instead of continuing to post similar comments I'm just making this a thread because it needs talked about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our president just denied us our right to truth. He's either complicit in this decision, or impotent to do anything about it, that much is settled. I never want to hear someone on this sub tell me how Trump is different from any other president or is some kinda bright light in the "globalist" dark ever again. Bannon fooled you into thinking Trump lives outside the corrupt muck, it's time you make yourself aware of that so you can move past it, admit you were wrong, and proceed to fight the good fight. I know that's a hard thing to do when you've tied up so much personal hope and faith in a person, but it needs to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine if Obama made this decision, your mind would be made up immediately, your better instincts want to pull you toward the same conclusion here. This is bullshit, you know it.

       That's fair, maybe I shouldn't have phrased it that way but the way half this sub has turned into T_Dlite has really degraded the community and discussions, so I don't apologize for wanting them to wake up.

       Your rhetoric is intended to shut down conversations, not facilitate them. And that can only mean one thing - you have some agenda to push. u/outsidetheboxthinkin doesn't have to take that trifle shit from you.

       He held 300 back for "further review." I personally believe he's doing so to use as a bargaining chip in the future and impending case against the DNC/Clinton/establishment/intelligence community/MSM mafia, but who knows? I don't believe he's doing this because he has to, or because he doesn't want the American public to know.

       Well, there's at least 300 of the JFK files he won't be declassifying. If I were a betting guy, I'd bet they'll sit there until the end of time, too.

       I understand that. The office, in theory, "is 1/3"etc... I get it. My point is that real power is held by the "elite" like the Bilderberg Group and other extra-governmental groups along those same lines.

       May I point you to Dick Cheney, who was running the country while Bush smiled and waived. That's what I'm getting at. While, yes, the president can veto and Executive Order until he's blue in the face, it means nothing except to people who want to listen. If the Deep State (which we all know exists * ) really exists ( * ) then he has no real power, and that is what I'm saying.

       No that was an example of someone from an extra-governmental entity making the important decisions in our country. After his time in the DoD, he was the Chairman and CEO of Halliburton, a major defense contractor for the US. He was taking in crazy money and perpetuating the war machine, weather or not he was in office. Right now, my example would be George Soros, using privately funded groups to influence group think in the general population. Look in to how influential he's been in economies world wide. If he can do that, there's no doubt he has politicians on the take, even if it's not directly.

       I will agree with you 💯, til you tell me he's running trump or the current White House. They are actively fighting this shit, taking down money laundering &amp; human trafficking rings. This is google-able. It's no coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the most interesting fact not mentioned much is the recent publication that trump has lost millions in self-worth since taking office. I can't remember the number, butit sounded devastating to me. And people were assholes - like, "omg what president LOSES money in the White House?" And I'm like "that's exactly the point. What president becomes so to enrich himself?"

       I never said he's in anyone's pocket, I'm saying he doesn't have the power that everyone seems to think he has. He has been "draining the swamp" and all that. I'm glad he has. At the same time, there are powers above him that are calling the shots and he's not privy to the information.

       I think trump definitely lost one to the deep state today, but I'm sure as hell not ridiculous enough to try and be like "welp! He's a globalist." What a stupid leap of non-linear thinking.

       Wall street clearly, and the deep state a little less clearly(the real one, not the liberal/neocon one branded by Bannon to make it look like Trump was in opposition to them). He's just another republican president, man, status-quo, nothing more nothing less. This anti-establishment stuff was always a clever psyop, and it worked like a charm.

       Did you know a couple of senators "retired" yesterday? One in particular, jeff flake, said it was impossible to be a republican anymore because of trump. He's been in congress for a decade, but he threw in the towel like a full-on bitch (as he was polling -15 behind).

       I believe the whole drain the swamp thing is still on. Midterms are coming and I've always said since we really don't know what his plan is we should wait for them to be over and then see how he's doing.   Things are starting to really take off now with the uranium one and the Russian dossier and with the JFK files I believe he's holding on to the rest of them for a 180 days to see if anybody can come up with a good reason to keep them Secret. This would also suggest he wants any bombshells to drop with good timing along with any prosecutions having to do with crimes of the DNC. Too me, things are lining up for a really exciting 2018. I believe the Democrats are going to receive an absolute routing.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be clear I don't know what could be in those files that could help him or harm any or anyone else but then again we have no idea what is in them so we'll just have to wait and see

       Don't kid yourself. Trump is on our side and he was the #1 person that celebrated a release. If he's is told by the CIA that assets are going to die if they don't have time to review the documents (although they had 55 years), what should he do?

       dude, you fall for that conman celebration? he knows nothing. riddle me this: the CIA reports to him, does it not? why couldn't he announce six months back that THE LAW STATES that the jfk files must be released IN FULL. you can see the law quoted in other places.
      </p>
      <p>
       and he has the final authority to declassify stuff. classification is literally a power completely beholden to the president, it's not difficult if he really wanted to do things.
      </p>
      <p>
       what does explain his actions are that he's using this as an opportunity to drum up some support and excite his base, while he still panders to the real powers. redacting stuff that really matters.

       He held 300 back for "further review." I personally believe he's doing so to use as a bargaining chip in the future and impending case against the DNC/Clinton/establishment/intelligence community/MSM mafia, but who knows? I don't believe he's doing this because he has to, or because he doesn't want the American public to know.
