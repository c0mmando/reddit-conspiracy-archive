       We questioned the hell out of it. I think the general consensus is it's a shitshow, and too many irregularities. I think we need to be investigating groups like CfcArts, from paddocks brothers shirt. And I do think there is something to the army moulage , and fake wounds. I'm questioning if there were actual injuries or if that was some sort of magic trick ,cause Vegas is full of deception and magic acts already.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think , currently, it's a live drill , compartmentalized, but all a production carried out with the help of Actors they recruit from places like Cfc Arts. And are organized with crisis management consultants. We all can see the motive was to get increased security and probably a bunch of stuff behind the scenes we aren't privy to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is, you think one part of the story is accurate, then things contradict that. So then you think another part is accurate, then you find its not. This goes on until people give up because they have nothing but pieces of the puzzle, and all the pieces don't fit together.
      </p>
      <p>
       So maybe we are trying to solve the wrong puzzle. And the pieces we have were given to us by the puzzle makers. So why are we not questioning where these pieces are coming from? Wouldn't that be the source of who is responsible?

       For example. My first impression when I watched the taxi cab video was that the person was an actor. But I dismissed that because of all the other pieces showing up. But the taxi cab vid was the first piece of the puzzle that went viral right after the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny too is we all questioned it and found the cab driver and the people that got in the cab to be weirdos. But we kind of just thought that was because they were in shock so they were 'acting' that way. But we didn't say they were actors. We were close.
      </p>
      <p>
       I seriously stopped trusting a lot of the YouTube vids that were released . Not all of them , but some. There was one yesterday that showed a wound on a guys arm. That vid was ,in my opinion, full of shit. So I'm seeing something we have to differentiate between. That is crisis actor vids, or real person vids.

       This is what I don't get when people claim that there are "crisis actors" in every god damn incident that takes place.  They're like "nope, Boston Bombing, actors... Las Vegas actors"... Why in the hell would they use these actors and just all coordinated at the same time to what?  Pull ketchup packets out of their pockets to make it look like blood all over the place?
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be a fuckton easier to just give some nut job the tools to actually pull it off, and put all your investigation in to that person you set up.  Crisis actors are something that I don't believe in.  I just don't, and there's not a damn thing anyone can say or show me to change my mind on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that this Las Vegas incident is bullshit.  My ears don't deceive me, first hand accounts from people there, all kind of saying the same thing.  I may have been born at night, but not last night.  Steve's brother, who held these weird ass interviews with the press in the first few days... where in the hell is he at?  He seemed to love the spot light.  Nothing on the girlfriend.  Nothing on the other brother.  One telling by Jesus the glorious security guard, who only managed to dodge 199 bullets, and allow a guy to kill 50 people and wound 500... what a great guy!  Someone should give him season tickets!!

       There are a lot of people that believe that. I'm not saying you're wrong, but from someone that lives here I have a genuine question that I've yet to get an answer to other than "it was all fake and you don't live there!" I live here, I've posted my ID publicly and also sent it privately to a number of people on
       <a href="/r/borrow">
        /r/borrow
       </a>
       . I've worked in two strip casinos and one off-strip. I was directly affected by the funeral motorcade, so no, it wasn't "made up".
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was all fake, why "kill" a "cop"? Monetarily, you now have to pay overtime for a
       <em>
        bunch
       </em>
       of cops, there was at least $18k just in motorcycle cops and roadblocks for the funeral procession. That isn't counting the cops guarding the coroner's office, the cops at the funeral in uniform, the honor guard with the flag, the mounted units, the 21-gun salute, the officers working overtime to figure out who killed the brother-in-arms, etc. And additionally, you now have to shut up an entire county of like two million people. 20k crisis actors at a concert, radio DJ's, hotel guests and employees, every single officer in the LVMPD, Henderson PD, North Las Vegas PD, Nevada Highway Patrol... Any of these people could have gone through training, been at the academy, responded to calls, etc with Ofc. Hartfield.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was all fake, why include a cop? Why kill a cop? Why publicize the murder of a cop of the department you're hoping will "help" you? If there wasn't a real cop, why have the funeral? Why publicize it? Why shut down roads, pay overtime, etc? Why not just settle for 57 and still be the "largest mass casualty hoax" or go for the 58 but not include an officer of the department investigating the shooting?

       The official story is garbage. Hell even the sheriff call it a narrative. Timeline is broken. No real witnesses, no motive, big stock betting on mgm stocks falling by mgm.executives and soros. Victims videos and testimony mostly point to more than one shooter. Leaked pics of the crime scene that raise more suspicion than confirmation. Not a single ballistics report, a morgue on lockdown, no a single frame of video from a casino no less. No accounting for where is all that brass. Not a peep of how paddock died. Complete shutdown of answers to questions and information out of officials. Gag orders on hotel workers and campos and his family.

       Right? I don’t think hoax, because my bosses sister was killed. But there are a ton of irregularities, that’s for sure.

       -The whole mystery surrounding Campos.

       Because if the perfect citizen like Paddock can shoot up all those people then anyone can. Gun laws in place didn't stop him so we must do away with all guns. Just an idea as to why it could have been a false flag.

       Even IF, and that's a big IF, he randomly did this shit cuz he was a whack job, tell us! Even if they have zero leads, tell us! I get it's an active investigation, but come on.

       Exactly.  And after each of those, people were up in arms about them being grand conspiracies.  BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government seems to be really, really bad at these mass shooting conspiracies, doesn't it?  They put all this effort into faking these shootings so that they can finally enact those gun control laws and take control of the US population, and then nothing happens because those gun control laws never get passed by...... the government!  Aw man, that crazy government!  Trying to ban guns by murdering schoolchildren one minute, and then voting against it's own murderous desires the next!  When will they ever learn eh?

       What you said makes sense if your end game is gun control. If people think it was done to institute a ban or a gun grab then yes the lack of push for it seems like a narrative that falls apart. But there is too much surrounding the case to not raise red flags. Maybe he was crazy. Maybe he was like Ted Kaczynski and flew under the radar his whole life not leaving much of a digital footprint. But what has the police and FBI have to hide if that's the case?
      </p>
      <p>
       After several contradicting narratives by the police they seem extremely dubious. Why has the hotel come out questioning the police narrative? Why is the morgue still on lockdown? Why is google and youtube trying to suppress videos of the event? I can keep sitting here asking question after question but people are already asking them. They are not being answered. If stephen paddock acted alone there is nothing to hide. Incompetence or mismanagement of a case can be acceptable as an answer. Hiding things from the public when  dozens of lives were lost is not.

       The police and FBI don't have anything to hide.  And they're not hiding anything.  Just because you want to see something they have, does not mean they are hiding it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What contradicting 'narratives' are there?  And can we stop using that word?  It's such a buzzword and doesn't mean anything.  It's just a rhetorical tool and it's so boring by now.  Thinking something happened at one time and then finding out it happened at another isn't 'a change in the narrative', it's a correction of the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps the fact that the Clark County Coroner's Office is performing an investigation on 58 bodies at the same time has something to do with it being closed?  This is a big investigation and they're busy.  They have to do all sorts of tests on each of the bodies, taking out bullets, figuring out the path they traveled etc. It takes a long time.  As the woman who worked there said, "We've never had anything like this before".
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Google suppressing videos of the shootings?  I just googled 'law vegas shooting raw' and got lots of videos.  No suppression there.  What suppression are you talking about?  The 4th video on youtube when you search for 'Las Vegas Shooting' is footage from the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       People are asking the questions.  But almost all of them have been answered multiple times.  Nobody is hiding anything.

       Multiple people have come out to say their videos theyve posted from the shooting have been taken down from youtube as well as facebook. Theyve posted about it in this thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sheriff Lombardo said himself that the information he had given was "the narrative". Maybe people are repeating it because it came directly from his mouth. It has most certainly changed at least 3 times. Mainly regarding Jesus Campos' involvement. The hotel disagrees with it as well. Maybe the fact that still 3 weeks later Lombardo looks visibly shaken and can barely get the words out during every press conference.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to remember something bud, you are on a conspiracy subreddit going against the reason everyone is here. Whether you want to admit it or not there is something wrong with this. I never frequented this subreddit before this shooting took place because I didn't believe in the fact that the government would hide anything. Call it naivety or blind trust. But the fact is somethings wrong here. If You want to deny it fine, but you're in the wrong place for that.

       People aren't here to believe lies and bullshit. I'm very skeptical of what governments say but I'm also skeptical of what agenda-driven people on the internet say. Treat both with the same level of scrutiny and hopefully you won't get sucked in by dishonesty coming from both sides of the discussion.

       I don't see anything wrong other than the fact that people can get hold of assault weapons and carry out atrocious acts like this.

       I'm glad you're here dude, but don't try and co-opt the sub!  There are plenty of people who aren't swallowing these theories. And don't just say things have happened. Provide some evidence. A couple of sources here and there would help if you're asserting a point.

       First off assault weapons (select fire weapons)  are so heavily regulated the cheapest one you'll get is 6-8k with a 9-12 month wait time and a 200 dollar tax stamp. An m16 select fire lower receiver(not the gun just the serialized portion of the gun) can run you around 15-20k. These aren't estimations this is what the going rate is. Production of these weapons for private use was haulted in 86 so they're tough to come by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Semi auto long rifles, despite what you hear about them, are not "assault weapons". Take massachusetts for example. They decided to "redefine the assault weapon ban". So an AR15 or AK47 is illegal, but a Ruger mini 14 that takes box magazines uses the same caliber as an AR15(.223) and has the same rate of fire as an AR is legal. But because its not scary and black and tactical looking and it looks more like a hunting rifle( which an AR can be used for and I have) it's ok? You dont have to be a gun person and I get that. Some people aren't. But You cant make a blanket statement like that. Yes I agree people that use them to harm others should burn in hell. You'll find 100% of law abiding gun owners to agree with that statement. But this is a whole other discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the shooting. There's things posted on this sub daily. Many can be explained away with logic and reason. I agree there. Some aren't totally explainable but it makes more sense that it isnt anything nefarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can go through this sub or go directly to r/lasvegasfalseflag and see plenty of the evidence. Like you said, you need to look at this with an open mind and be critical of it all. Campos' story is bullshit. Thats evident with them stating when he was shot changing 3 different times. He barely spoke for himself on Ellen. He was coached on what to say. Ellen specifically said "youre going to talk about this here and then not again". If he's a "hero" why wouldnt he want his story heard. The marine who transported people to the hospital accepted the recognition he deserved.
      </p>
      <p>
       The videos. There are a bunch of videos and most of them calling out shooters in the crowd and shooters on different areas. Some sketchy but all been proven not the case. All but 2. The taxi driver video is a bit iffy but there is another one of the gun fire. One gun is shooting a volley of shots and another one is heard start and stop during the initial volley. This isn't echo, this isn't supersonic bullets. Its clear as day. Anyone that has used a slide fire(and I have) knows it requires two hands to shoot. Impossible for one person to use both at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rate of fire of the weapon(s) used is a steady 600rpm weapon. This can be a belt fed machine gun such as an m60 or m240. Or it can be a full auto ak47 but ill tell you, that isn't an AK47. Nor were the "few" casings they found identified as 7.62 rounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The security footage hasn't been released as well. If its "for an active investigation", which they keep using as a scape goat then fine, but why release pictures of his hotel room and of him dead and not footage that just shows his comings and goings at the hotel. If he used a service elevator why was he allowed to use it? Even if he is a "high roller" the hotel is so worried about liability why wasn't he accompanied on the elevator?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the hotel isn't cooperating with the police they can have anything they want from the hotel in 5 minutes with a search warrant pertaining to not only a murder case but the largest mass shooting in modern history.
      </p>
      <p>
       The absolutely lack of transparency is the most alarming thing in this case. Lombardo has been pointed out as exhibiting lots of qualifiers of someone who is lying or withholding truths by showing characteristics developed by the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tried to approach it with skepticism and there are so many red flags. I cant possibly write up all of them. I like this sub because it makes you question not only the narrative but other people's counterpoints. Its both extremely exciting and can be extremely frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would absolutely like to put this to bed and say "he was nuts and went off the deep end and that's that". But until they prove it and lay it all out and there is no question to Lombardo's timeline and narrative(as he put it), its proving hard to just sit there and swallow what they're throwing at us.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry If I came off like a dick in my other replies, I'm not a conspiracy person and this just isnt sitting right with me.

       But what makes it "fact"? What evidence is there that he was the shooter, and the only shooter, aside from authorities saying "we're very confident he was the only person in that suite"? What supporting information have they provided to back up that claim?

       Ah, so the fact that he was definitely in that suite that he rented, full of guns that he'd bought means nothing to you?  That doesn't point to him being the shooter at all?

       And the fact that there is no evidence whatsoever to support the theory there was more than one shooter doesn't deter you at all?

       The most ridiculous part was how they were examining his brain to find a motive. To give the illusion that they're really searching hard to give the public an answer. Such bullshit. They don't need to examine his brain. The facts are there, they just won't tell us. They never even proved that he did it.

       They honestly want us to believe that he was a ghost with no past, politics, associations or a single negative emotion that he ever confided in anyone.  Just an automoton who played video poker 16 hours a day and lived off of untold millions from ethereal real estate holdings.

       Keep pointing out the stuff people miss, like the morgue on lock down etc... I feel this shouldn't all be swept under the rug and hope everyone continues to question the narrative. It seems like they're trying to sweep it under the rug, and I'm baffled as to why people aren't as interested in such a current event.

       Last reported was they had no idea. Whoever it was waited until the house was no longer under surveillance or the cops went on a kiss break. They got in and out without leaving evidence and no one had any leads. However, it's under FBI jurisdiction, so if they had any leads, it isn't public knowledge

       I still think he was some sort of illegal arms dealer and was set up, real shooter(s) popped him then did their thing and got away. Million different ways to get away, hell, just have another room rented and slip in before anyone gets there idk just too fishy with what's been told to us.

       I don't know about illegal arms deal, but I do think the event was supposed to be bigger or the shooting was covering something bigger up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just looking at the cadence of the shooting, it seems lazy for a mass shooter. A few early shots, break, One volley, break, another volley. It's almost as if the intent was not to kill as many as possible but rather to create as much chaos as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some have even suggested that the speakers were playing some of the later volleys, which could make sense if it was all misdirection. Shoot some bullets to show people they were in danger, then just play the sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most annoying part about all of this is that many of these questions could be answered so easily:
      </p>
      <p>
       2 shooters or shots played over speakers or blanks: report on the number of casings found in the room. Not sure if you can discern blanks from real bullets at that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Was Paddock with anyone, did he have bags, when did he go to his room, etc: surveillance videos

       Yeah something is for sure up with Campos. Haven't heard the speaker theory yet, but its plausible, the causing more chaos then harm thing, I find the number of shots vs casualties could have been higher with not much effort, not to mention the whole calculations BS makes no sense for a supposedly bump stock modified gun that is more of a spray and pray weapon not like a real precision tool. Ugh sooo many holes in the narrative......

       Long, but worth it. Face to face with a second shooter (around the 50 minute mark, but you really need the background leading up to it.

       Once it became about "gun control" most people  (and MSM) lost interest.  People stopped thinking about it as its own (inconsistencies ridden) event, but lumped it in with whatever tired position they've been trained to hold about "gun control" thus killing any real critical analysis of the event itself.  "Classic Misdirection"

       Can understand you're skeptical. Also remember this r/conspiracy won't allow any posts or comments from accounts less than a week old.

       This is what I don't get when people claim that there are "crisis actors" in every god damn incident that takes place.  They're like "nope, Boston Bombing, actors... Las Vegas actors"... Why in the hell would they use these actors and just all coordinated at the same time to what?  Pull ketchup packets out of their pockets to make it look like blood all over the place?
      </p>
      <p>
       It'd be a fuckton easier to just give some nut job the tools to actually pull it off, and put all your investigation in to that person you set up.  Crisis actors are something that I don't believe in.  I just don't, and there's not a damn thing anyone can say or show me to change my mind on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe that this Las Vegas incident is bullshit.  My ears don't deceive me, first hand accounts from people there, all kind of saying the same thing.  I may have been born at night, but not last night.  Steve's brother, who held these weird ass interviews with the press in the first few days... where in the hell is he at?  He seemed to love the spot light.  Nothing on the girlfriend.  Nothing on the other brother.  One telling by Jesus the glorious security guard, who only managed to dodge 199 bullets, and allow a guy to kill 50 people and wound 500... what a great guy!  Someone should give him season tickets!!
