       Whether you are form the US or not, what are examples of Historical Revisionism that you have come across l? How did you feel?
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally for me it’s the complete silence over US labor movements at the turn of the last century. We  are not taught about what truly happened in the US over labor rights. We are not taught that Jack London and Mark Twain wrote about the capitalist problem. Nothing

       We achieved independence for the 26 southern counties (Republic of Ireland) on January 21st 1919 and the free state was formed in 1922.  Britain Still rules the 6 counties in the north (Northern Ireland).

       Nope, we were invaded in 1169 and ruled from then.

       Not that we were given a vote/choice but we became part of the UK in 1801 as a way to try and stop the sectarian wars.

       No you weren't. The English had presences in Ireland over the centuries but that is not "ruled". Might as well say Californians were ruled by the English too.

       We're not taught about the Bolshevik Revolution (lead by mostly Jews) that murdered over 60 million Russians in the early 1900s, and how that played into WW1 and WW2. Because that would destroy the Jewish victim status that serves as Israel's foundation.

       How to spot someone whose never actually studied history.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can cite two very easy examples of why that's bullshit. The Soviets were on the allied side of the war. They won the war. They were the victors. And yet, it's put down in history that there was a massive amount of rapes during their invasion of German lands. Historians know about these rapes because they did what most historians do. They interviewed survivors. They documented the journals of soldiers. They analyzed the official reports by Russian officers. And they even went as far as cross referencing German propaganda reports of the rapes with other existing information.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second example is the Austro Hungarians in WW1. The chief of the Army is now known to have been a terrible commander who bungled the war effort for his country. But for 50 years after WW1 it was commonly considered that he did an amazing job and was simply hampered by exterior factors. I shouldn't have to remind you that the AHs lost the war. They were not the victors. And yet, the lie was believed anyways.

       Agreed. Most confederate soldiers never owned a slave, and yet they fought and died for the confederacy. Making the Civil War out to have been only about slavery is a blatant lie.  For many, it was about a tyranical government and state's rights.

       Don't be silly. All those poor farmers who would never own a slave in their lives did not fight and die to protect the institution of slavery. A little common sense will show you which side is engaging in historical revisionism.

       Bullshit. You can read the explicit reasoning each state had for secession. States rights might have been how they got poor farmers to fight, but the war was over slavery.

        ...A geographical line has been drawn across the Union, and all the States north of that line have united in the election of a man to the high office of President of the United States, whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery. He is to be entrusted with the administration of the common Government, because he has declared that that “Government cannot endure permanently half slave, half free,” and that the public mind must rest in the belief that slavery is in the course of ultimate extinction. This sectional combination for the submersion of the Constitution, has been aided in some of the States by elevating to citizenship, persons who, by the supreme law of the land, are incapable of becoming citizens; and their votes have been used to inaugurate a new policy, hostile to the South, and destructive of its beliefs and safety.

        Our position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery—the greatest material interest of the world. Its labor supplies the product which constitutes by far the largest and most important portions of commerce of the earth. These products are peculiar to the climate verging on the tropical regions, and by an imperious law of nature, none but the black race can bear exposure to the tropical sun. These products have become necessities of the world, and a blow at slavery is a blow at commerce and civilization. That blow has been long aimed at the institution, and was at the point of reaching its consummation. There was no choice left us but submission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union, whose principles had been subverted to work out our ruin…

       Its almost as if some wealthy slave owners fought to protect the instituiton of slavery, and others fought because they didn't want to be under control of a tyranical, unaccountable, and distant central government! Some of the very same reasons that the US declared independence from Britain!

       I realize this more nuanced and accurate view of the war isn't as satisfyingly simple as your own. It also makes it harder to think of all southerners as evil racists. But its reality.

       Many of the ordinances don't mention slavery, but instead discuss issues of State's Rights and tyrannical government? Are you just ignoring that fact and cherry-picking a couple that do?
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, an excerpt from Arkansas' Ordinance:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Whereas, in addition to the well-founded causes of complaint set forth by this convention, in resolutions adopted on the 11th of March, A.D. 1861, against the sectional party now in power in Washington City, headed by Abraham Lincoln, he has, in the face of resolutions passed by this convention pledging the State of Arkansas to resist to the last extremity any attempt on the part of such power to coerce any State that had seceded from the old Union, proclaimed to the world that war should be waged against such States until they should be compelled to submit to their rule, and large forces to accomplish this have by this same power been called out, and are now being marshaled to carry out this inhuman design; and to longer submit to such rule, or remain in the old Union of the United States, would be disgraceful and ruinous to the State of Arkansas:
       </p>

       All of the original seven states explicitly listed slavery in their declarations of secession. It prompted the war, not some notion of state sovereignty. They wanted stronger states rights so they could have slaves.

       Lots of it regarding WW2. For example, the Nazis "invaded" Poland because ethnic Germans were being persecuted and massacred there, especially in the Danzig corridor, followed by Bloody Sunday in Bromberg shortly after the invasion. Meanwhile, Russia was invading Poland to the east. And yet this was supposedly the reason that England and France declared war on Germany.

       Historical revisionism? The conservative parties propaganda against liberals. Every way, really. The lies about the civil war being not being about slavery. The blaming of european chattel slavery on anyone but the Europeans. The misleading comparisons between the european slave trade and african/arabian slavery, done only to excuse western slavery. The denial of the southern strategy and the original conservative ideology of the southern democrats. The Reagan worship. The conservative statues put up in the 20s and 60s. The lies about native indigenous americans.

       In my experience I've seen books recently published that fail to discuss philanthropic contributions of the major industry Tycoons and Barons like Carnegie, who built libraries in India as well as other cultural centers and schools (think Carnegie Hall or Carnegie-Mellon)
      </p>
      <p>
       Some other inconsistencies with my education that I'm seeing in recent publications/ cirriculums:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Crusades are taught in a lump-sum, not by distinct crusades (like the major three):
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember learning that the heretics that formed the second crusade were so ignorant of byzantine/ eastern European culture that they attacked their own Christians (abelit other non-catholics sects) and Jews, not Muslims (or rather not as many Muslims as is reported today)
      </p>
      <p>
       In literature (when looking at historical texts) Chuancer's Canterbury tales, school didn't focus on the mugol king being Genghis Khan. I think this leads to a HUGE disconnect in understanding the Western understanding of the world and the origin of certain prejudices.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world isn't and never was, as homogeneous or tribal as we thought it was:
      </p>
      <p>
       Nation states didn't have people that just "looked" all chinese or all &lt;insert country westerners think have people that look one way&gt;  . Going back to Khan: they were from the steppes which were mostly ethnic Mongolians OR Eastern Europeans (this nomadic life led to idea of western construct of "backwardness" that put Russia/easterneurope under serfdom long after its collapse in the west. ) Steppes is a natural plains-like land that connects inner Asia to eastern Europe. We cant verify for sure because his grave is unmarked,and has yet to be discovered, but Khan might have been a white man. Look into early European science and the prevalence of "mongolism" or works such as vestiges of the natural history of creation. Whites born with "mongolian" features were deemed to be caused by birth defects from deviant behavior such as incest, rather than the chance that "Caucasian" mongols intermarried and mixed with the other "Asian" mongols (when indoctrinated into mongol life, skin color, religion and previous creed did not matter, you were a mongol, and bound by a code of ethics Khan made for his diverse clan hence pan-mongolism, even though whites are included). There is some truth to the birth defects, as the flat features of far Asian persons at the time were the same features observed in children with down's syndrome, the contemporary diagnosis for "mongolism". Gene expression varies between generations so even healthy persons who looked like Asians in Europe where even thought to be disfigured.
      </p>
      <p>
       Genghis Khan was a Chinese Barbarian:
      </p>
      <p>
       Genghis Khan was not a Chinese Barbarian. What books propose today is actually representations commissioned by the Chinese emperor who at the time, what a blood descendant of Khan (his grandson). Khan's army was nomadic, and was not in the position to build as he conquered. (good examples of conquers who built while they conquered were Alexander of Macedonia (Hellenism), and the romans (Aqueducts, coliseums)). Huns invading china were just cousins that vied for the throne once Genghis Khan died. It was all family Drama. Same for many other Asian wars throughout the 1200s. His decendants all took different names and religions. Books never point out they are all from one blood line, this is also true for Monarch-era Europe, where everyone intermarried from kingdom to kingdom). The empire under Khan (like Alexander, Phillip,Ceasar etc.) was mutli-ethnic. Some reports indicate even crusade knights lost during campaigns themselves became "mongols." Khan's barbarism originates from texts created by islamic scholars (who were the only literate mongols at the time of HIS rule) and circulated as propaganda to incite fear into khan's enemies. Mongol culture initially did not accept public displays of blood and torture, such accounts are muddled with the reigns of his descendants such as Kublai Khan. The Khans were even allies during the crusades to the Christians and East-west trade DID exist before Columbus.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reconquest was influenced by connecting to Mongol power more so than religion:
      </p>
      <p>
       Many Khans left eventually converted to Islam and started strengthening their forces again.  Commissioning Colombus to make contact with asia was not from hearsay and rumors of wealth, the Western world already had a taste of it and wanted to get in contact with their Mongol friends, whom were christian when they last spoke to them. The religious war came more prevalent after realizing there were no more Christian kings in the east. Khan's unification of Asia lead to combination of Asian technologies and war strategies that became much more powerful with synergy. (Bonus fact: The German Blitzkrieg is based off of Khan's "lightning army". Khan's army was all Calvary and many of his maneuvers when studied were applied but in place of horses were tanks).
      </p>
      <p>
       The common narrative is that the reconquest and exploration was to find knowledge that was rumored to be true but not seen before,ever. According to modern Books, Europe was NEVER in contact with Asia (this contradicts almost every ancient empire). If they were never in contact, then how did conquistadors have muskets and gunpowder?
      </p>
      <p>
       For more on Genghis Khan, I recommend Jack Weatherford's "Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World"
      </p>
      <p>
       The civil war was all about slavery:
      </p>
      <p>
       There were economic factors as well as political factors in the creation of the confederacy, especially in regard to the jurisdiction of the individual state vs the union. What is also not discussed anymore is the fact that France wanted to aid the confederate south to help bolster their textile sales. When I was in school we did learn about Napoleon III's empire attempts but never was encouraged to put the two events together.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Nazis were very very evil and in no way contributed to society in a good way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not here to debate the holocoust's occurrence or substantiate weither or not it was good or bad what Hitler did to the Jews. What I will point out is the hypocrisy of blind Nazi hate when many institutions still willingly choose to use their research. Project paperclip gave us vaun braun's rocket tech for the space race, and medicinal breakthroughs from Nazi torture "experiments" are used today, such as techniques to prevent hypothermia and amputee stabilization. All this was discovered by cutting off the limbs of camp detainees or dunking them in ice baths and seeing what would happen. It was more common to see doctors using Pernkopf's anatomy because it is still the most detailed medical atlas ever created, but its use declined once its dark history got out. But even today it's a coveted book and I know doctor friends who would still love one for their private collection. After Vaun braun and other german scientists got tired with NASA, they moved on to Wall Street. Many of the big firms in the 60s and 70s were the companies of ex nazi scientists. They made millions with algorithms they wrote to play the market, the earliest were just slight variations of fluid dynamic or particle physics equations. (even today, this occurs, physicists and engineers with higher math skills are asked to find financial trends or write  programs for things such as high frequency trading. They are called "quants" ).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's scary when what you and your contemporaries know varies so much from what is going on in the current education system for what is hopefully a next generation of intellectuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even something so trivial to some like "pluto is not a planet" baffles me. All because of a public intellectual like Neil DeGrasse Tyson's one thesis. Now there's steps to somehow reclassify Pluto as a planet or dwarf planet now because we have the technology to see pluto has characteristics like a planet and not a ice cluster or whatever he called it. While on topic of public intellectuals, you folks should google how the remastered versions of Bill Nye the Science guy on Netflix has been edited to fit today's narrative on gender (spoiler: the original clearly states there are two genders, the Netflix version skips that skit).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also amazing the lengths at which certain things are suppressed; the blitzkrieg was implemented after a German translation of what the mongol people call the "secret history" ,a verified ethnic mongolian account of Genghis khan, was commissioned. shortly after, the book ban in Germany led to remaining translations of the text being destroyed. Many more copies in France or other Parts of Europe was lost in Allied Bombing. 
What interests me is up to today, there was never an attempt to English translation. To this day it only exists in native Mongolian, Chinese or if you're lucky a very old rare hidden soviet copy meant for Eastern studies Students. One such Eastern Studies student was Yuri Bezmenov. He has a very good documentary from 1985 after he defected to America that discusses subversion through conditioning and indoctrination. An essential component to said indoctrination is historical revisionism.

       On the question of the Labor Movement, and what happened to it in history books so that few young people know much about it:
      </p>
      <p>
       First, I would say that it worked too well for its own good. In order to keep the movement strong you had to have really bad conditions to protest about - low pay for dangerous work, no health care or insurance, etc. During the 20th century those conditions slowly improved, making the blue collar worker able to move into the middle class, live a comfortable life, and send their children to college.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the labor movement was undermined by organized crime, to the point where the Teamsters Union was synonymous with Mob connections. I think that bad PR ended up turning people off, and devaluing the progress that was made earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, Capitalism evolved into a more acceptable version, with the help of lots of PR and advertising. People came to accept that corporatism with large profits for the few and just enough pay to workers was the only game in town that didn't involve excessive societal coercion, hence less freedom, as they could see in the obvious examples of Soviet Russia and Communist China.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking forward - I foresee a new labor movement, but this time it will be to set up a guaranteed minimum income and expansive worker entitlements, possibly the end of existing credit and currency systems as they get replaced with crypto-contracts.
