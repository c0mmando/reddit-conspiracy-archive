<p>A study specifically made to discredit thought that is outside of the official narrative. </p>

<p>Once again I point people to <a href="https://youtu.be/c63awtAyHdU">this</a> documentary that quite clearly illustrates that the current scientific community is only interested in furthering a very specific narrative, philosophical naturalism, reductionism, and materialism.</p>

If anything an absolute shutdown of conspiracies forums would be perfect, bring it on, it would give so much credence to everything that&#39;s been said, and it would send millions of people into the threads of discussion on other forums, not that we aren&#39;t there already</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The study makes sense - people who are more likely to see patterns in random data are more likely to believe theories that link random events. Doesn&#39;t &quot;discredit&quot; conspiracy theorists, I think most rational people that study conspiracy and alternate history would agree that most theories floating around the web are probably BS, that doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t conspiracies to control the population and subvert institutions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed there, it is the blanket association with both conspiracy and spiritual belief that concerns me.

    <div class="md"><p>I believe so. They bear the hallmark of disinformation by wrapping truths in lies. Jones for instance is responsible for breaking the news on the Bohemian Grove but he exaggerates it to the point of absurdity and innacuracy. He said that they do human sacrifice to Moloch when the statue does not resemble Moloch at all and it later turns out the &quot;sacrifice&quot; is just a paper effigy. That on top of his often over top and downright irrational behavior prevents anyone from looking much deeper than, &quot;Lol look at the lunatic who thinks politicians kill people like Hollywood Satanists&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You apparently need to read the whole document. The context here is that US Military Intelligence do research on The Monroe Institute&#39;s Gateway Experience to see if they could use it fo their own ends. It&#39;s similar to the CIA&#39;s Project Stargate, but in this case it&#39;s OBE&#39;s. That report is a record of everything they figured out in the process including an entity they dubbed &quot;The Absolute&quot; that fits the description of God nearly every religion with even mildly monotheistic themes has been describing for thousands of years. It is nonlinear, having no beginning, and, or locality. It permeates every instance of time and space making it omnipotent and omniscient. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done astral projection a few times, yes. I&#39;d recommend trying it before simply dismissing it. How you think it reads doesn&#39;t really matter as much as the source, this comes from the mouth of the CIA itself. I&#39;m not sure how you would expect something of this caliber to read anyway, it&#39;s pretty matter of fact and straightforward and steers away from oversensational language.</p>

<p>Besides, I gave you two links anyway. My point here is that the scientific consensus on this stuff is quite obviously unresolved, and that is not what the mainstream narrative is at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The history of humanity says there&#39;s something to it, our current government obviously thinks so as well, and there is a good amount of supporting scientific literature along with literally millions of anecdotal experiences, and the mainstream narrative does everything it can to mock spiritual belief. </p>

<p>I believe what I do because of all that and because of direct experience and years of research and experimentation as my link expands on.</p>

I don&#39;t have any kind of link to point to, but I believe you would be hard pressed to find openly atheistic or anti-religious characters throughout television, especially news programs where it would be almost career Suicide to be openly anti religion,unless you&#39;re Fox News and being anti muslim.

    <div class="md"><p>What are you talking about? Pretty much all of Seth MacFarlane&#39;s cartoons mock various religions, so does South Park, and &quot;celebrity scientists&quot; that are routinely given media platforms are all avowed atheists. In our society it is perfectly okay to take a dig at a person&#39;s religious beliefs but if you question the integrity of the scientific community then you&#39;re automatically a stupid person.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, stop goalpost shifting. Second, when they are wildly popular and many other TV shows share similar themes, i.e. Rick and Morty&#39;s blatant nihilism and denial of God despite Rick having met the Devil, they form an overarching theme. I mean, we&#39;re literally having this discussion under a post about an actual scientific study that was made to try and pin conspiracy theory and spiritual belief with terms like &quot;irrational&quot; and &quot;cognitively deficient&quot; all while the atheist Bill Nye is given a platform on Netflix to preach things like non-binary sex. Not to mention that when media comes out that goes against this obvious bias it does horribly, e.g. Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed which was mostly only played in small indie theaters because large, mainstream theaters wouldn&#39;t play it. And you&#39;re sitting here trying to tell me that the mainstream treats these subjects at all equally?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re starting to seem cognitively deficient yourself. For every thing you are seeing and raging against as attacking your beliefs, there&#39;s ten other programs that embrace spiritualism and religion. Rick and Morty isn&#39;t anti-religion at all, Rick himself is god in many universes. You claim I&#39;m moving the goalposts, but you don&#39;t even realize that your goalposts aren&#39;t even real</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve given you plenty of examples and you&#39;ve given me none supporting your own view save for ad hominems. Oh and let&#39;s also not forget James Randy who dedicated a large portion of time and money into debunking supernatural abilities and the large uptick of anti-religion atheist YouTube channels a couple of years ago. That&#39;s where people like Sargon, TheArmoredSkeptic, Thunderf00t, and many other &quot;skeptic&quot; YouTubers got their start. The list of things just keeps going.</p>

<p>Also, nothing has to be specifically anti-spiritual in order to be anti-spirituality. All it has to do is promote the opposite of that, materialism, nihilism, or philosophical naturalism. Or just simply act like that&#39;s the obvious truth. You act like someone has to outright say something like, &quot;religion is for stupid people&quot; for it to be anti-religion. Not that there is any shortage of that kind of content either.</p>

<p>And, again, you seem to be ignoring the very study we&#39;re having this discussion under as well as the link to my other post wherein I detail a lot of evidence surrounding both the pineal and our electromagnetic aura. Knowledge of the pineal and the aura precedes the scientific method and comes from inherently spiritual thought, and yet despite the mounting evidence establishment science still scoffs at the idea of even just a 6th magnetic sense when it would appear we have everything necessary for telepathy to be possible with thousands of anecdotal experiences of such. It&#39;s pretty obvious which way the establishment leans on these things.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then you are blatantly ignoring everything else the document has to say in order to compliment your own narrative of the world. Yes, it could be developed into a technological method of control via suppressing certain mental states through electromagnetic manipulation. But this implies such mental states are something to be covered up, and if they are simply hallucination as the corrupt mainstream scientific community would have us believe then such manipulation is not necessary nor is a 10 page report that was kept classified until a FOIA request more than 30 years after the fact.</p>

<p>that always been what conspiracy theories have been about, if&#39;n you ask me</p>

<p>the problem as I see it is the amount of patterns, random and otherwise, that are currently available to us: it&#39;s hard to argue against the fact that most of what passes for conspiracy on the web is some combination of wishful thinking and opportunistic conjecture.....probably BS :D</p>
