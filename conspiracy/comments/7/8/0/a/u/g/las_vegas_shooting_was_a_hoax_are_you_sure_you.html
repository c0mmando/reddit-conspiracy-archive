        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why does nothing make sense about the entire event? After chasing down a million bullshit rabbit holes you still haven&#39;t figured out anything of substantial value? Why? There is nothing to figure out. It was a military drill passed as a live event to test local, state, and federal emergency management.  Why is there no footage of the shooter in the casino? He was never there it was a hoax. How could he carry machine guns upstairs past security? It was a hoax. Oh, what about the possibilty of more shooters? Bullshit rabbit hole. It was a hoax.
How did they pull this off? With the military. It was the only way. You may say &quot;why wouldn&#39;t they really have killed people? It would be easier&quot;. First, It would make it more difficult, and more angry people to deal with. Second, if no one died. Then no one will be charged for murder. Therefore, what crime did they commit that was  serious enough to warrant the military? All they did was fool you. How could that be? Heard of hollywood? Very similar to this <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3xyYYv-S8">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bh3xyYYv-S8</a> </p>

<p>There just happened to already be a FEMA  drill planned.  Admitted to test local, state , and federal emergency management. It seems to work like this- State department, and Department of Defense are responsible for the event. FBI is responsible for the cover up. Including the bullshit rabbit holes for those damn pesky conspiracy theorist. How could I dare say this? H.R.5736 Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012. The military has always been allowed to do these videos, and events, but was only allowed to be disseminated by a foreign audience for propaganda purposes.  Now we have come full circle, and it is legal to turn the massive military propaganda machine loose on you. Now that you know what now? What really can you do about it? Especially, if no one was really murdered? You would see now that it being a hoax is actually the best way for the Military to pull these events. It&#39;s a massive mind fuck friends.</p>

<pre><code>   It became legal for the state department, and the department of Defense to conduct these hoax shootings since 2012. It has been going on for, or at least since 1948, but never intended  for a domestic audience to be disseminated by the American media, etc.

    <div class="md"><p>I cannot stand the official LV narrative and definitely believe something more sinister was going on. I am not a huge fan of “conspiracy” theories, but this event just has too many holes to be called a solved shooting. </p>

<p>My one, glaring, huge issue, is that I know someone personally who was “shot” (grazed) by a bullet. I know others will pin this as bullshit, but it’s the truth and it’s the facts. I’ve gone back and forth with it and have thought about a special king of bullet being used to cause less damage? “Shooters” aiming for spots not to kill? Anything to make sense of how both stories can work together. Your post makes sense, and had I not known this person, I would have been all over it. But as of now, I can’t help but think that there was some kind of real shooting paired with a huge coverup. Feel free to let me know what you think. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t believe that anyone was really shot. If someone you know said this they are either in on it, and won&#39;t tell you the truth. I&#39;m sure to be a part of this you have to sign your rights away on it. To tell you the truth would risk them to be sued for every penny they have , or prison. Would you tell anyone under those circumstances? It is also possible they are lying. I don&#39;t know this person. To play devil&#39;s advocate for a moment. If that was the case (which I don&#39;t believe, but is possible) maybe fire a few rounds away from people with like you said &quot;safer&quot; bullets, and it ricochet and hit them. They would want to catch on film some &quot;real&quot; shots being fired. This would be a great idea, but really I don&#39;t think none was shot at all. The entire concert was prepared for this ahead of time. If the concert speakers were used. They could have easily set up more loud speakers hidden around. Just sounds like multiple shooters. FEMA prepared ahead of time. This was a drill put on by the state department, department of Defense, FBI, etc. I don&#39;t think anyone was shot, but if you were in on it you might as well have been, cause you won&#39;t  tell anyone otherwise.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the well known definition, but I’d appreciate if you didn’t patronize me. You actually stated that they were either in on it or lying to me.

    <div class="md"><p>True, but I don&#39;t know of this person you are referring , so I still will leave it up to a possibilty of a ricochet, giving you the benifets of the doubt. I assure you though no one opened automatic machine gun fire on a crowd of thousands. That did not happen.  </p>

<p>Intelligence agencies create fake personas for spies and assets all the time. It&#39;s not that hard. They can also easily hold mock funerals.</p>

<p>The only convincing evidence is actual video evidence of bullets striking someone or strafing the ground. So far there is none.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They have obvious further political agenda to gain by this being a &quot;real&quot; event. Why in the world would they go to all this trouble to tell you &quot;yeah it was a hoax&quot;. A very small less than 0.01 percent of the population is seriously asking anything about a hoax. As long as you believe this event truly happened that is all that matters to the psy-op (psychological operation). They gave you the 65 year old man as the culprit. Is that not good enough for you? Why not? That is all you will ever get. Why? There was no mass shooter. When I said that they have turned their massive military propaganda machine on us instead of foreign audiences through the h.r. 5376 Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012, I&#39;m telling you the American public doesn&#39;t stand a chance. they have perfected these techniques over seas while we all were chasing a dollar distracted in life.

I also randomly ran into <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74iu3y/we_should_settle_the_debate_of_a_single_vs/dnyy6xq/?context=3">another redditor who knew her through family</a>. Not expecting this to convince you of anything, but I am convinced that the violence was not faked. I live in Vegas and had a number of friends who were at the concert that night. My buddy is also an EMT and was off duty that night but one of his workmates was shot in the leg. He showed me a photo of the wound. There are many narratives to this event, but I can&#39;t swallow the no victim story, no matter if it&#39;s happened before or not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just watched the YT video re:the military training crisis actors. If we assume 1 Oct is a hoax, that would mean there were at least 58 faked deaths and hundreds of faked injuries. Perhaps they were paid VERY well to not disclose that it is crisis acting, but do you think that not 1 of the hundreds of paid actors would see how this event is being used to lie to the population and want to expose the lie? I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not possible, but at the very least that theory seems highly unlikely.</p>

<p>Then there are the claims that these crisis actors have been involved in multiple staged events. Are we saying these people continue to be paid exorbitant amounts of money to dispense further lies that are affecting the peace of millions of people? Do these people not have family and friends? Are they psychopathic liars? How can they hide the truth, willingly or not?</p>

<p>You keep saying you don&#39;t want to go down rabbit holes with all these various theories, but the crisis actor theory is just as much a rabbit hole because there is no clear answer and therefore seemingly no end to the questions (just one question after another with nothing but stolen time). And yet, here we all are, continually sacrificing our time is speculating on what the truth really is, when we may never fully have it.</p>

<p>What is the solution?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What we are all searching for is truth and that must be supported by evidence. We should take the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2017/10/06/here-all-victims-las-vegas-shooting/733236001/">list of victims</a> and create a graph of relations that would support that these were real people that are now dead. We could also use the videos of victims at the scene and use face recognition to verify if any of the victims can be corroborated by more than one source.</p>

<p>&quot;their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes they receive up to millions of dollars in donations.At Sandy Hook all. the &quot;victims&quot; families had their houses paid off on Christmas Eve. Merry Christmas. It is not only the fear of getting in trouble.
