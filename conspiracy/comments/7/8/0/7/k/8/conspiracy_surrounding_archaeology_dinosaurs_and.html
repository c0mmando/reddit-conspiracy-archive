        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>After taking an interest in Graham Hancock, James Randi and a handful of other non-mainstream scientists. I revisited a theory I had a few months prior about dinosaurs (I&#39;ll be referring mainly to T-Rex), the recent discovery of feathers, and logic to craft a theory.</p>

<p>I apologize if this ends up being short, I don&#39;t have the time to invest in research and really just want to document this prior to it being &quot;discovered&quot;.</p>

<p>Lastly, when thinking in today&#39;s terms, compare the Trex to a chicken, I&#39;ll be doing it to illustrate the theory.</p>

<p>The theory: Trex and other similar dinosaurs were winged. </p>

<p>Argument / evidence: With the recent discovery of feathered dinosaurs per an activated gene, we now have strong scientific evidence showing dinosaurs were likely feathered. I&#39;m not going to dig for examples, but there are few, to no feathered creatures without wings. Even birds that cannot attain flight have wings (chicken, ostrich, emu, etc.).</p>

<p>Another piece, is the lack of evidence. Currently, we think the Trex nubs were used &quot;to help it get up from a resting position, or help it eat&quot;</p>

<p>So let&#39;s rip into that, first, this was the most dominant killing machine on the planet for 65 milion years (?), how the fuck did it manage that at a <strong>two limb handicap</strong>, it&#39;s like a double amputee being an MMA fighter, it&#39;s just not logical.</p>

<p>Second, after reviewing skeletal reconstructions, it is entirely possible that those are wings, and this is where I refer to chickens, they have the same type of wing.</p>

<p>The last piece of evidence is actually verbal and written. It&#39;s in our fairy tales, our movies, popular culture. Dragons. Mother fucking dragons, all of our verbal history came from <em>somewhere</em>, so where did dragons originate from?</p>

<p>I also tend to think, that the fire breathing aspect of their mythology has more to do with the fire that destroyed the dinosaurs and not so much an ability for them to literally breath it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll add sources once I get the chance, but there isn&#39;t much out there TBH.</p>

<p>Humans were technologically advanced enough to experiment with genetic manipulation, and many of the &quot;monsters&quot; from ancient lore (Sumeria, etc) were the results of our experiments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I hear you, and would even dare to state that it&#39;s more likely than not.</p>

<p>There is documented manipulation of even our own genetic code. It&#39;s more logical to assume humans had achieved that (because we have now), rather than aliens doing it.</p>

<p>Our recorded history is such a small fraction of the earth&#39;s history, and it&#39;s not hard for the planet to completely wipe out all evidence in a global catastrophe.</p>

<p>Personally I think we were around for a large number of massive terrestrial impacts, but humans are and were smart enough to go underground until the dust had settled. There is a massive ancient underground city, but I cannot for the life of me remember it&#39;s name, I believe it was located in central asia.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Feathers don&#39;t equal wings.  Wings have bones/morphology different from what&#39;s in the fissile record.  Also things that fly have different <em>kinds</em> of bones (hollow).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In order for birds to exist as we know them today, they would have had to go through the stage I&#39;m presenting at some point in their history.</p>

<p>As for wings, that&#39;s speculation based on smaller, similar dinosaurs having them. Sure, that <em>could</em> explain them, but we simply don&#39;t know. This is an educated guess based on causal evidence we have today of modern birds and their path through the evolutionary ladder.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Think of it this way: Birds are a modern surviving subset of dinosaurs. All dinosaurs may have had feathers, but only some evolved wings or flight. We see something similar today: all mammals have fur (in some form), but only some evolved wings or flight (bats, gliders).  </p>

<p>It&#39;s quite possible that the smaller flying dinosaurs were better adapted to survive cataclysm than their Earth-bound cousins.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, archaeologists have gotten it wrong in skeletal reconstructions before. There have been several famous examples over the years. Missing out on vestigial wings on all/most dinosaurs seems like a bit of a stretch, in my opinion. It&#39;s just on the fringe of possible in my mind.  </p>

<p>However, the hypothesis that humans co-existed with T-rex raises far more questions than it answers. You may want to spend a bit more time thinking over the evidence for the timeline of human evolution relative to the mass extinctions. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It would be physically impossible for a dinosaur like a t-rex to fly.  Look at the size of it&#39;s leg bones, the t-rex was an extremely dense, heavy creature, it&#39;s wings would have to be half a mile in length to generate the necessary lift.  It was the smaller, more agile dinosaurs that evolved into birds, Velociraptors certainly had feathers but their evolutionary chain didn&#39;t make it far enough to begin flying.  </p>

<p>Exactly, I never claimed they flew, I&#39;m just saying these fuckers had big ass wings, I&#39;m not sure how it could be <em>more</em> obvious, just based in the span of their dominance. They weren&#39;t at a -2 limb handicap on the top of the food chain for millions of years, like we assume to know.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just presenting it in a constructive way, because &quot;trex looks like it&#39;s a kid running laps at the special olympics&quot;, isnt going to get me far.

    <div class="md"><p>I read somewhere sometime that one possible use for the vestigal wings on dinosaurs wasn&#39;t flight, per se, but augmented running and jumping.</p>

<p>Analogy:  The first use of a sail was in China, as merchants attached a sail to poles atop their cart, and could harness wind power to augment their horse or cattle power.</p>

<p>In the same vein, the dinosaurs couldn&#39;t fly, but they could run and jump and use their vestigal wings to augment the speed and distance.</p>
