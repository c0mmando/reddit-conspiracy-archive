Is the elimination of the African slave trade a lie told to masses in schools and it hasn&#39;t actually stopped at all and still continuing up to now? What am I missing?

<p>In las vegas, there is no backlash one person, no real power. With major companies while there might be cover up, they still have people working &quot;on books&quot; and a legit business to it.</p>

<p>Those rings are hard to track, dangerous to ask around for and all information on them by the goverment has to be kept a secret otherwise you can lose the trail.</p>

<p>So basically the ring (and their disassemble) to work, it makes an effort to stay out of media radar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. The system is stacked against the 98%. The establishment controls the media and the media controls the narrative of what people think. And with so much fake news and misinformation online, it&#39;s hard to ferret out the REAL truth. It takes work. And when you&#39;ve had a hard fucking day and you&#39;re tired and you&#39;ve got to feed the kids, get them ready for bed, clean up and so MORE work at home, all you want to do is kick back and watch some mindless reality TV. I&#39;m a free thinker and I have trouble sifting through what is real and what is not real on places like this sub and elsewhere. So other than something getting exposed undisputedly, I don&#39;t see anything changing any time soon I&#39;m afraid.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The vast vast majority of child trafficking and sex trafficking in this country is through our southern border. If you go look at news before Trump announced his candidacy, you will see that the issue was very much discussed. Huffpo was a loud trumpet of the 80% of women are raped by smugglers statistic. Ms-13 stories were everywhere. The unaccompanied el Salvadoran girls, it was all an issue. Then Trump offended Latino viewers  and all media went to absolute silence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because there&#39;s no money in it. </p>

<p>Remember that above any sort of political bias, most news companies only care about making money. It&#39;s much easier to generate outrage, and therefore clicks/views, at a Trump tweet or something John McCain said or X Democrat supporting socialized healthcare because those things are divisive and get people riled up. A story about a human trafficking ring is much harder to generate similar amounts of revenue. </p>

<p>Further this with the fact that, at least in the US, it&#39;s hard to get people to care about things that don&#39;t affect them. That&#39;s why Fox News slowly let go of stories talking about Obama drone strikes in the Middle East ah and why CNN didn&#39;t bother talking much about anything Trump has done over there. Americans simply don&#39;t care. </p>

<p>The media caught on a long time ago that the best way to keep people&#39;s attention, and to make the most money, was to start politicizing. They&#39;re not controlled by the government because they don&#39;t have to be: they willing threw themselves into that role. </p>

<p>That&#39;s why you don&#39;t hear much about human trafficking rings or the tons of hard drugs being imported,  why you don&#39;t hear about our rampant opioid and meth problem.  It&#39;s not profitable enough to cover. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>my one question -- since this is being applied to adult prostitution -- are independent prostitutes and escorts being considered as &#39;sex trafficked individuals&#39;?</p>

<p>because really that sullies the whole name/idea of sex trafficking and just becomes more stupid war on drugs styled vice enforcement for something that cannot be stopped.</p>

<p>really only the subset of prostitutes who do not have a choice -- i.e. are abducted and threatened and forced to do it -- should count as sex trafficking.</p>

<p>even though technically the word trafficking applies to economic exchange... </p>

<p>I personally believe ONLY individuals bought or sold as chattel should count.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One explanation might be that it is simply too horrifying to report on constantly. News is a business ultimately and constant headlines of child abuse likely drive away customers. No one wants to eat their breakfast, open the newspaper, and ask &#39;well let&#39;s see who was raped and murdered today.&#39; </p>

<p>One class of stories that do tend to make the news generally support a narrative behind a political agenda. Any time a gun owner stops a violent criminal, you bet your ass that&#39;s getting plastered on as many pro gun leaning news pages. Or a black man killed by a white cop. News loves to repeat anecdotal evidence to create a perceived pattern that may not exist statistically. But what political agenda is served by a narrative of constant pedophile/rape/trafficking? Obviously there are outliers when the perp is famous or the story particularly gruesome, or within a particularly worrisome environment like college where parents are first letting their children out on their own and excessively worry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because our systems are kept alive by corruption, including things as high-level drug smuggling, assassinations, human trafficking, sexual blackmail, slavery, deception, etc. Take out any of those elements without providing a better replacement element that fulfills the same function and the whole thing collapses, taking everything that&#39;s good about our systems with it. Schools, hospitals, infrastructure.</p>

<p>This is what makes releasing shit willy-nilly without adequate forethought and caution is such a precarious thing. That&#39;s why we keep seeing chess pieces being moved around by Assange, Clinton, Trump, and everyone else involved in the current unraveling, without anyone really willing to be the one to pull the trigger. I don&#39;t blame em. As much as I want to see the House of Cards gone, I don&#39;t wanna see it collapse. I&#39;d rather see it dismantled and replaced with something that&#39;s built on a system that is just and truthful, whatever that might look like.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it doesn&#39;t get covered because it doesn&#39;t change.  My local news covers when a local prostitution ring gets busted, but you know a new brothel will still open somewhere else.  Drug stuff, environmental stuff, poverty issues, those don&#39;t get covered because the narrative never changes - just the details.  Plus, there&#39;s no film footage, and THAT&#39;s what gets covered ad nauseum.  For example, road crashes kill over 100 people DAILY.  But the Las Vegas shooting (59 dead?) had screaming and running and shooting, so that got covered for a long time.  Sometimes the things that statistically cause the most damage just aren&#39;t interesting.</p>

<p>Hastert was the Speaker of the House 1999-2007. As an FBI translator &#39;01-&#39;02, Sibel Edmonds discovered he was raping young boys, and a Turkish deep state criminal network was blackmailing him to use his political sway to their benefit. She revealed this to media in 2005, but although they reported on some of his corruption that she uncovered, they refused to mention the pedo stuff. Hastert wasn&#39;t busted for pedophilia until a <em>decade</em> later. He just got out of jail early after serving only 13 months of his 15-month sentence.
