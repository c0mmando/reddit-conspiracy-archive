    <div class="md"><p>This one, it&#39;s long and is someone recording Hooters, from a hotel room in the MGM Grand. It shows tons of ambulances going to Hooters, people being taken out of there. matches with testimony of the woman whose FB post said she&#39;d run to Hooters and tons of people had run out of there screaming so they thought there was a shooter in there. Basically the whole video shows something was going on at hooters, and in the news report in the background, they confirm 2 shooters on the news and another suspect. I&#39;m sure at some point someone will condense the video to pull out the most pertinent bits, but it basically proves that the eye witnesses who said there were shooters elsewhere were right. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3JwEbBMt-Q&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3JwEbBMt-Q&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

It just seems like some pathetic academic &#39;hit piece&#39; on anyone who questions official government narratives, as though they have something wrong with them. Sick.</p>

This article isn’t at all disparaging towards people who believe in conspiracies.  Also, the article didn’t talk about which conspiracies are true because that’s not the point, the point is that some people find evidence where it doesn’t exist because our brains are hardwired to look for patterns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The article linked to by the post in <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> is this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/37463-conspiracy-beliefs-illusory-pattern-perception">https://www.inverse.com/article/37463-conspiracy-beliefs-illusory-pattern-perception</a></p>

<p>It is a very poorly written article with obvious errors. For instance, the writer says this:</p>

<p>&quot;People are bad at judging what’s random and believe that, often times, patterns are actually coincidences, which leads to irrational connections between unrelated stimuli.&quot; </p>

<p>This the opposite of what the writer is trying to argue. They should have said this:</p>

<p>&quot;People are bad at judging what’s random and believe that, often times, <strong>coincidences are actually patterns</strong>, which leads to irrational connections between unrelated stimuli.&quot;</p>

<p>Interestingly, not a single person in <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> appears to have noticed the mistake. That said, <a href="/r/science">/r/science</a> is much more open-minded and willing to question established orthodoxies than somewhere like <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a>. When individual scientists stop challenging the &quot;scientific consensus&quot;, then our species is done.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure if that&#39;s the article, but that&#39;s not as important as your last paragraph. </p>

<p>Science minded people aren&#39;t nearly as close minded like you said, and I think a lot of people here approach this stuff with the scientific mindset. I think there&#39;s some very loud people that get upset when those science minded people say something that goes against what they want to believe.</p>

<p>There was another post about this that simply was a screenshot of the science post, and there were plenty of people attacking science itself, calling it a religion, saying it&#39;s all fake.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m glad I saw your comment and that most here seem to be more rational. The comments in the other post seemed to be talking specifically about people like them.</p>

<p>Also, I think far too many people comment on posts that use links, and don&#39;t actually read the article. I think it happens just as often here as anywhere else. It&#39;s sad.</p>
