<p>But many people from the event likely had their phones wiped and many others who were more closely affected may be under gag order in the name of &#39;national security&#39;, at least that&#39;s my guess.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I worked IT for a casino for a few years. While the surveillance cameras were indeed of the IP variety, they ran on a completely different physical network from the rest of the company. Said network also had absolutely zero outside network access. I bet Mandalay  Bay is the same.</p>

<p>Additionally, at the casino I worked at, Surveillance would only keep 2 weeks worth of video before deleting what they had, unless a request came through to archive some footage. </p>

<p>At this point it&#39;s entirely possible Mandalay has no stored footage, and if they did, there&#39;s no way a hacker is going to get data off an air gapped intranet without having physical access.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mandalay having no footage stored is absolutely unlikely. If this is the case, the head of their security department and anyone associated should be terminated and prosecuted immediately. </p>

<p>Internet Protocol cameras generally work on Network Video Recorders. These NVRs allow the video to be stored locally and accessed/recorded off site. Well built security centers always have a backup location as a contingency. The back up location is generally in a different location/state incase a disaster occurs. For MGM, I would guess that this location was most likely relocated to the new MGM National Harbor in Oxhill, Maryland</p>

<p>At a recent conference I attended, a special agent who works specifically at a local Caesars affiliated casino was doing a presentation. She said that are laws that come into play with retention of video for casinos. If I remember correctly, she said they have to hold all footage for 5 years, and any video with motion for 8. Other things can impact the length of storage, such as persons identified in suspicious activity reports. These reports generally indicate persons trying to launder money, pass fraudulent bills, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From when I have dealt with casino networks, the security network had no external connections. They were totally isolated, and the security systems didn&#39;t have an outside connection to the internet. Someone would have to have  physical access to either a computer  that is  on the security network or  to the server recording the video itself. Some backup video and store it for a certain amount of time though. I can&#39;t speak to Mandalay Bay itself, but that&#39;s generally how they are operated.</p>
