       Hello folks, i posted this peculiar video and article earlier with the title glitch in the matrix.... Annnnd had quite the personal oddity occur.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       Some of you may know i work at a "Memory Factory" we take old VHS and film and convert to digital formats.
      </p>
      <p>
       So i get a stuck tape in a VCR and after some trouble i get it out. I noticed it says "VERY Important ,do not record over." I suspected it was somebodies birth or a wedding.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not those things, but it was a Collection of N-Sync videos from MTV and award shows. What was written on the box was quite hilarious.
      </p>
      <p>
       My name is Justin C btw.
      </p>

       "Justin looked AWESOME!! I think they were all there not sure about lance but JC Definately JC was there."
      </p>
      <p>
       So i didn't know there was a JC as a part of N-sync so seeing my name and my Initials is kinda odd........
      </p>
      <p>
       Specifically because the most recent episode of higher side chats. This episode was all about Synchromysticsm, Which i recently have been diving into.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
       In the episode Greg mentions JESUS CAMPOS has the initials JC, I was like those are my initials, As i notice i work on Jimmy Carter blvd..... Also Jesus Christ, and Julius Caesar and Jim Carry also have the same initials....
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok so i want to highlight the phrase "JC definately JC"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of those spelling ME's that always gets me definitely/definately..... Its funny to see she spelled it the same way as i always have.... and that sandwiched in between  my initials.
      </p>
      <p>
       More from the case....
      </p>
      <p>
       “Justin,Justin,Hes my Juuuustin.””Why do I love JC, Because every word that comes out of his mouth is beautiful. I love him, I do.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This is showing the Powerhouse that was the Micky mouse club. The level of preteens and young girls ensnared and utterly helpless to the sexiness that is JT.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that seemed like a love letter from the universe to ME in a way. The playful nature is very clever in its ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       So my wife comes to visit and we sit down to eat and I tell her the story. And on the Tv behind me as I am saying Justin Timberlake, his  face pops on the TV.... Apparently they chose the moment I was talking about JT to tell the people that JT would be back for the Superbowl.
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife then asks the restaurant we got this Salad dressing recently. I said Houston's and I followed that up with Hurricane Harvey. That was what the restaurant name reminded me of. She asked me why I said it out-loud. I didn't know why.... until she pointed at the TV as one of the People on TMZ is talking and the subtitled said “Harvey:” as in the guy speaking was Harvey, But Harvey was talking about Harvey Weinstain.......
      </p>
      <p>
       So I tell my wife about Justin tiberlake as Justin timberlake goes on tv, She mentions Houston's which pings Harvey and I say “Hurricane Harvey” as Harvey from TMZ is talking about Harvey Wienstien
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I thought of Hurricane Harvey was because I just heard Hurricane By Halsey and I said out-loud Hurricane Halsey.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as I am writing this I see another SYNC. Justin timberlake coming back for the Superbowl halftime shot..... Last super bowl was in Houston TX....
      </p>
      <p>
       This all may seem like a lot of nonsense but this Sync chain happened in the course of 2 hours or so......
      </p>
      <p>
       My wife has to bring up the obvious. “Maybe you are just N-SYNC” LMFAO this phrase is dripping with metaphor and fractallity.  JUSTINSYNC Justin is in N sync....
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe we ARE in a matrix of sorts.

       The synchronicity of the LV event hit me hard in the face.

       When the shooting began Jason Aldean was on stage. Jason has an upper arm tattoo with a joker and an ace.

       Jason aldean isn't even his name. That was the manufactured persona and logo givin to him by the music industry.
