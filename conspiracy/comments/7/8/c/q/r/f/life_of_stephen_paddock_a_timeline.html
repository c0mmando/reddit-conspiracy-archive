<p>And at the other end of that, he set up his life for that one event, dragged 23 guns, thousands of rounds of ammo, &quot;a stockpile of what officials described as survivalist equipment in his hotel room, including a bullet-resistant vest&quot; and gas masks up to the room and had binary explosives in his car... yet stopped shooting after just 10 minutes (2 minutes before police arrived), and was found dead of an apparent suicide wearing a bathroom and slippers. </p>

<p>Like, what??</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>A quick question, is there even any released evidence of him doing the criminal act?  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the 10/6 LVMPD press conference (the Friday following the shooting):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>REPORTER: Undersheriff, have you been able to resolve the question of whether there was – whether he had any help or whether there was an accomplice? Or can you eliminate the question of whether he was simply trying to find someone else? </p>

<p>UNDERSHERIFF MCMAHILL: The question is can we confirm whether there&#39;s an accomplice or not. I can tell you this: we&#39;re very confident that he did not – there was not another shooter in that room. What I cannot confirm to you today and what we continue to investigate is whether anybody else may have known about this incident before he carried it out. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Later that day, he did an on-air interview with CNN: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>WOLF BLITZER: Let&#39;s get to some other key issues while I have you, Undersheriff. Can you confirm that there was no other shooter in the room? </p>

<p>MCMAHILL: Yes, I&#39;m very confident, I&#39;m very certain that there was not another shooter in the room as he conducted this mass murder rampage. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those statements were made before authorities revised the timeline to reflect Campos being shot before, rather than after the crowd shooting.</p>

<p>But then on 10/10, the day after authorities changed the timeline, McMahill repeated his statement of confidence in an interview with KNPR radio, saying: &quot;I&#39;m 100 percent confident there was one shooter.&quot; </p>

<p>He has <em>never</em> explained why they are so confident in making that assertion? </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Cameras in the hallway? Nope, can&#39;t be that, since they&#39;ve confirmed there are no hallway cameras in the hotel. </p></li>
<li><p>Cameras in the room? Nope, the authorities already confirmed there were cameras in the room but they weren&#39;t recording. </p></li>
<li><p>Fingerprints in the room? I find it very hard to believe that there&#39;d only be one set of prints in a hotel suite, and even if there were, the accomplices – or real shooter(s) – could have been wearing gloves, so that doesn&#39;t seem like enough to make that statement of confidence. </p></li>
<li><p>What&#39;s left? Witness testimony – from Jesus Campos, who was at the end of the hallway and would have been able to confirm for police that he didn&#39;t see/hear anyone leaving the room. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Not saying Campos is lying (well, he&#39;s obviously lying about some stuff, but not necessarily about that), but it seems awfully dangerous to be basing your assertion that there was only one shooter and one person in that room on the testimony of Jesus Campos. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Could someone have tied Paddock up, committed the massacre then untied him and made it seem like he killed himself? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still think this is very possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wonder how a guy with a bank robbing father who was wanted by the FBI managed to get 3 government jobs (including Lockheed). You <em>know</em> they do background checks, and I find it very hard to believe that they would totally ignore who his father was. My sister works for the Federal government and her background check was so extensive they went and interviewed all the neighbors on the street we grew up on. I just don&#39;t see how this guy got multiple Federal jobs. </p>
