       I'm new here and I only came in after the vegas shooting. Initially I found a wealth of good information here and even better discussion. I haven't been around long enough to know better and maybe I'm way out of line but fuck it here goes....
      </p>
      <p>
       Loomed, she had way more substantial breaks that she broke with far less hype. I think it was a psi-op. Get everybody all worked up, them release some 2006 Motorola razor quality video along with some over the top dramatic editing. The disappointment was so strong I was about ready to stop caring. Maybe that was the point. It can easily be explained as a body brought in from the festival. Someone carried their expired friend back to the hotel or they expired shortly after getting there and they put the body to the side until it could be appropriately addressed. Nothing indisputably earth shattering here.
      </p>
      <p>
       look at what's happened to this sub since the last news conference. It's been flooded with all kinds of inflammatory posts and comments that either have theorists defending themselves or explaining something else. I've seen a lot of distraction posts as well. Bring back old conspiracies that people felt passionate about to get theorist focused on that again. 911,pizzagate, weinstien, all kinds of politics. Conspiracy candy everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a lack of any new Information to pick apart, and a whole lot of other stuff to focus on the whole Vegas discussion has kind of died down here. When it was the "hot topic" this sub was tearing it apart. Quickly dismantling the red herrings and focusing in on real abnormalities in the narrative. Putting the attention where tptb don't want it. I think this sub was doing a good job of picking it apart, too good of a job. One that merited a full scale counter op. The posts of substance don't get the attention they were getting. Shills everywhere. There's a lot more bickering than there was before and a lot less constructive conversing. Far too much focus on inconsequential details that won't go anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compos is a distraction and not an answer. My advice, if it's obvious bs or it's already been covered ignore it and let it die. If someone starts an argument or is just being a tool in a post of substance ignore them and don't get distracted by it. Try to keep the focus where it matters.

       Laura Loomer might have freaked some people out with her crowd funding tweet. She might have been bought out. Maybe that's what she was looking for all along. Her past proves she seems to value money over her own integrity. Jake from End Times also said Mossad tried to buy him out a few weeks ago after his tires got slashed but he ignored them.

       I could see that. I thought it was suspicious if she had something substantial that she would give an hours notice as a heads up to tptb before releasing it. Why give anyone a chance to stop her? Not that they'd make a martyr of her, but maybe she was looking for a buy out she could chalk up to suppression.

       That's normally where I would have gone with it, but with all the concern of suppressed information and gag orders it seemed excessive. Also, for a snippet that was released on you tube and Twitter it's gonna get the views and shares either way.

       This. One point people need to focus on is the complete lack of video coverage from Vegas surveillance cameras prior, during and after the event. Vegas is one of if not the most surveilled cities in the world, and we have seen none of that surveillance. Why do you think that is?

       I don't recall, but I believe we got videos of the hijackers from 9/11 pretty soon after the event.  It just seems really odd to me.  I am not saying you are wrong or anything, but it seems unusual.

       I think we did. Weren't they looking for anyone who could give info on the highjackers tho? Anyway...in a "normal" crime they won't release stuff til it is closed. Plus, this is footage from a Vegas casino (perhaps more than one) and they will fight to keep that sealed due to their security concerns. And now that there are lawsuits it will be even longer.

       If it confirmed their narrative they would have already released it in support of said narrative. If it's damaging to the narrative it would be withheld. I fail to see how a simple desk video of him checking in or any videos of him transporting bags  could do any damage to an ongoing investigation. Perhaps the bags would be damaging to MGM if it was blatantly shady, but none the less the check in video shouldn't hurt. It's common knowledge at this point there are cameras everywhere.

       Vegas isn't surveiling their hotels like that. The whole "what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas" thing.

       Yes!  That would be interesting to hear.  I think they would have to modify their timeline again, though.  LOL.

       I agree. I know this is r/conspiracy and not r/Las Vegas, but I just found it suspicious how their cover up was in shambles, everyone in here was drawing a lot of attention to the inconsistencies, and all the sudden the sub was flooded with nonsense.

       Pizzagate, uranium one, JFK, are all very interesting topics and deffinately worth discussing and I hope to see them fully brought to light. It's just weird to me the number of inflammatory posts and comments. Also, how some posts are followed with a barrage of off topic posts. Like they are being buried before they are seen or discussed.

       We must have been getting somewhere for it to illicit such a response. Sure everyone's talking about it and tons of people are investigating it, but for a while this was a focal point where all the best information was coming together.

       I think It is beyond obvious we will never know what really happened , but we will always know that the bullshit they tried to feed us is not the True Story and there is more to the Vegas Massacre
