        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There have been a number of threads recently about Special Counsel Robert Mueller, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/786psa/mueller_now_investigating_democratic_lobbyist/">two</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/787es5/mueller_now_investigating_democratic_lobbyist/">today</a> on the front page of this sub, where people seem to be getting their hopes up that Mueller will nail Tony Podesta or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6su93u/robert_mueller_subpoenas_paul_manaforts_global/">Paul Manafort</a> or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6ogrse/mueller_expands_probe_to_investigate_trumps/">Trump</a> or whoever else he might be investigating.</p>

<p><strong>A history of cover-ups</strong></p>

<p>I think that some people are aware that Mueller was the director of the FBI but most people are probably unaware of his history of white washing important deep state events. </p>

<p>Former FBI agent Coleen Rowley charged that Mueller <a href="http://www.accuracy.org/release/911-whistleblower-rowley-on-muellers-history-of-cover-up/">presided over a cover-up</a> with regard to his handling of 9/11. Mueller also, of course, was in on the <a href="https://shadowproof.com/2009/11/01/fbis-robert-mueller-still-engaging-in-an-anthrax-cover-up/">Amerithrax investigation</a> which sought to find who mailed the anthrax letters in the wake of 9/11, and <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/2017/05/21/comey-mueller-bungled-big-anthrax-case-together/">bungled that case too</a>. Mueller was appointed to head the FBI <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/17/7-things-know-robert-mueller-new-special-counsel-russia-investigation/101811990/">a week before 9/11</a> and reaching even further back into Mueller&#39;s past, when he was a U.S. attorney he abetted the cover-ups in Waco, Ruby Ridge, and the Oklahoma City bombing by <a href="http://themillenniumreport.com/2017/05/robert-mueller-the-old-fixer-is-back-in-town/">changing rules of evidence</a> so that the FBI did not have to share as much with defense counsel in those cases. </p>

<p>Mueller was also a senior Justice Department official and ran the criminal division there from 1990-1993 when the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1991/07/25/opinion/essay-bcci-justice-delayed.html">BCCI scandal</a> was being investigated. What was the Bank of Credit and Commerce International and why haven&#39;t most Americans even heard of this? From the above-linked New York Times piece:</p>

<p>&quot;The Underworld Bank scandal is oozing out all over.</p>

<p>Conceived in Karachi, financed in Abu Dhabi, the conspiracy reached into the world&#39;s Western capitals and perhaps the U.N. under the protection of high-paid lobbyists and naive spooks. The B.C.C.I. scandal involves the laundering of drug money, the illicit financing of terrorism and of arms to Iraq, the easy purchase of respectability and the corruption of the world banking system.</p>

<p>For more than a decade, the biggest banking swindle in history worked beautifully. Between $5 billion and $15 billion was bilked from governments and individual depositors to be put to the most evil of purposes -- while lawmen and regulators slept.</p>

<p>Now the fight among investigators is coming out into the open. Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, who gave impetus to long-contained probes, told a Senate subcommittee headed by Senator John Kerry that he is getting no cooperation from the Thornburgh Justice Department.</p>

<p>Justice&#39;s Criminal Division chief, <strong>Robert Mueller</strong>, tells me he will have a hatchet-burying session with the independent-minded D.A. next week, and vehemently denies having told British intelligence to stop cooperating with the Manhattan grand jury.</p>

<p>And what about the revelation last week by the New York Times reporter Jeff Gerth that the C.I.A. was using B.C.C.I. for payoffs abroad, which may have been used by the swindlers as a cover? &#39;At no time have we received a request from the intelligence community,&#39; insists Mr. Mueller, &#39;to alter or suspend or in any way change the course of our investigation.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p>Even <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/bcci-cia-connection-just-how-far-did-it-go-195454">mainstream news orgs like Newsweek</a> connected the dots on the BCCI scandal and were able to uncover that BCCI &quot;(...) was involved in some of the most sensitive intelligence operations of the Reagan-Bush years, including the secret sales of arms to Iran&quot; but out of that entire affair which interlocked with the Iran-Contra affair, basically the only government figure to suffer any sort of consequence was Oliver North and a couple of other minor figures even though the case was still being probed by a special prosecutor <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,157496,00.html">right before 9/11</a>. </p>

<p>There&#39;s so much more that I haven&#39;t gotten to but suffice it to say that Mueller has long been an insider and to me it is not surprising that he has been called out of the bullpen to be the designated white washer of this most recent series of deep state events. <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/06/21/good-agent-bad-agent-robert-mueller-and-9-11/">This</a> CounterPunch piece does a great job of summarizing Mueller&#39;s complicity in the 9/11 cover-up. Let me know if I&#39;m missing any other instances of Mueller&#39;s cover-up work or if anyone knows any other interesting details about Mueller and his career. </p>
