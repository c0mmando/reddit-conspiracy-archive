        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>one day on conspiracy reddit, someone posted a thread on a CBS NEWS YOUTUBE CHANNEL posted a video on the sherif of los vegas answer questions. When the sherif mentions he was going to talk about padlocks car, a man wispeared &quot;DONT GO THERE&quot; i watched the clip 2 more times before texting my girlfriend. She told me to record it with ios new recording device. i opened up youtube. The clip was cut out! IT WASNT JUST CUT OUT IT WAS CHANGED. He said &quot;dont ask me to make accusations about the los vegas shooting&quot; (they changed the video, used a type of video editing that can look like the man said something he didnt, been used a couple of times with obama and others)  and then he went on and gave the floor to an agent. this shocked me and scaried me! then I got my reddit comments crashed. my youtube history crashed. This is beyond the scariest moment that happened to me on the internet. i felt like my ip address was infected by the FBI. 
Dont even assume this is fake. this is real. had to write it for i can remember it forever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I posted something about Steve Wynn on here the other day (after reading about how he threatened to murder Joe Francis and bury him in the desert, how he threatened to choke Meredith Viera in an interview...) and a few hours later, no joke, two police officers showed up at my door asking if I was suicidal. I have <em>never</em> had to cops show up at my door before, and I have never been suicidal. I was freaking out.</p>

<p>They said they got a call from &quot;a man&quot; who told them I threatened to hurt myself, and they wanted to come in to make sure I was okay. I honestly thought Steve Wynn had put a hit out on me or was sending cops to plant something in my house so they could arrest me. It was so, so creepy and bizarre. </p>

<p>I ended up stepping outside (closing my door behind me) and told them to call the station to find out who the &quot;man&quot; was before I let them in. Turns out they had the wrong address! When I walked by that other address a little while later, there were 3 police cruisers out front, so I think something did legit happen. </p>

<p>But now I&#39;m kind of terrified to talk about this stuff online...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, so you&#39;re saying in the original video, the sheriff doesn&#39;t say &quot;don&#39;t ask me to make accusations (I think he said assumptions btw) about the Las Vegas shooting&quot;? Because in the video I saw (which wasn&#39;t live, but very soon after the press conference) I did hear the spook behind the sheriff instructing him under his breath not to go there, as well as the sheriff than telling the reporter not to ask him to make assumptions.</p>

<p>If I were the FBI and I wanted to alter the video to make it less suspicious, the simplest correction would be to remove the two seconds where the spook says &quot;Don&#39;t go there&quot; by putting a bit of room-tone there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for mentioning this. I had a “LV shooting video” sent to me about 7-10 days ago. I watched it at least 5 times and passed it along to my friends in the know. About an hour or two later I pulled it back up to show my son and the part was no longer in the video! I thought I’d lost a chromosome or something....but apparently this is their newest method. Scary stuff!!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you feel up to it, try to get some sort of partially shielded bag to hold it in and interact with it using a headset rather than holding the phone to your head and see if that makes you feel any better.</p>

<p>There was a period where my phone was making me feel &#39;off&#39; and the skin and muscles near the pocket I&#39;d keep it in would sort of subtly ache. It was subtle enough in both cases that I was never quite sure if it was psychosomatic or not, but I&#39;ve been sort of leery about the thing ever since. I use it a lot less, switch to speaker when I can and store it in a backpack or car seat rather than my side pocket now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;ve noticed the ache. I actually never noticed it when I had a Samsung. Any ideas the scientific cause? This is very worrying</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m pretty sure the reason it&#39;s happening is that contrary to what scientific experts claim, em-fields of the type made by our technology, specifically the type emitted by an active cell phone, actually interact with various cellular and nervous system functions in disruptive ways.</p>

<p>Officially, cell phones, wi-fi systems, smart meters and other such devices are completely safe and have no negative impact on human health or the functioning of the body, but I don&#39;t buy it. Don&#39;t ask me what specific mechanism is causing the biological interference, but it sure seems like something is doing it. Active routers in a room I&#39;m in make it so I can&#39;t sleep unless they&#39;re turned off, even if I put tape over the blinky lights so it&#39;s not the lights it&#39;s something else...</p>

<p>I suspect keeping your phone on airplane mode when you aren&#39;t using it might help a bit as well. Turn airplane mode on and then just switch it into active mode every once in awhile to see if you have texts, e-mails or calls that came in. Sometimes people can&#39;t do that for work reasons or whatever, but if you can do it and don&#39;t mind not getting messages the exact instant they are sent, you can cut down on a lot of unnecessary activity from the phone that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, as this is a conspiracy reddit, if you want to get into really muddy water, it could very well be that knowledge about the health risks of cell phones is intentionally suppressed so that it&#39;s easier to subtly interfere with people&#39;s health and well being en mass in a way that comes pre-defended psychologically with associations with tin foil hattery.</p>

<p>Whether it&#39;s normal ignorance or something darker is entirely left to the imagination of the reader, but even if one is skeptical I recommend trying to spend a week or acting like cell phones and wi-fi routers are potentially harmful and seeing if you feel better by cutting down your exposure to them with a mind for minimizing the amount of unnecessary em emissions you&#39;re exposed to. You may be surprised at how much better you get to sleep and what other weird ailments get better.</p>

<p>Wait what? In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/776tnv/las_vegas_sheriff_told_dont_go_there_when/">this video</a>, you can hear someone say &quot;Don&#39;t go there&quot; but nobody on stage&#39;s lips move, so I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s someone operating a camera or working security who was standing close to a mic, and could have just been stopping a late journalist from wandering in front of the camera. Given the broader context of the clip and that part of the interview, it didn&#39;t strike me as suspicious. </p>
