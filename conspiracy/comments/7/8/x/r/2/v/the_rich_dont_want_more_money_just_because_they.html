       It's a zero sum game. And money is power. So once you already have Billions, and now lust for power, the answer isn't more money, it's ensuring you have less.

       Ensuring you don't have debt is what you should focus on. The social pressure of buying a house or a car is on purpose. Debt (interest fees) feeds the beast. You want to cut their balls off? Drop your bank and try to find a legit credit union.

       I have to agree with this, sadly. I bought gold over a decade ago, I've made almost nothing. If I sunk that money into Bitcoin five years ago, I'd be able to take a year off.

       Credit unions are owned and operated by their membership. It is literally socialism. It's just interesting to me seeing credit unions recommended in places that are typically anti-socialist, like here or
       <a href="/r/personalfinance">
        /r/personalfinance
       </a>
       (I tried pointing this out on there, but I believe the word "socialism" triggers a shadow-deletion...). The general perception is that credit unions are great- even among people who think socialism is literally interchangeable with "evil."

       Nah just register at a crypto exchange and start building a portfolio. I invested 100$ in june, now holding 3800$. Added another 100$ each month, rest is profit from trading and good investments. This Christmas I'll put in 10 000 $ and spend the winter babysitting them:)

       Oh, I wish it were the case. I argue with people on the subject of socialism quite often, and honestly a large percentage of people (especially in this sub) have deranged views on libertarian socialism (well, all socialism). Namely that it's an oxymoron, and that any attempt to define it is "leftie word games" or "playing semantics." Or they think that all socialism is the same, and they insist that even opposing ideas like anarcho-syndicalism and Marxism-Leninism are the same thing (but they just call it "Marxism). It's pretty wack.

       Public and private are meaningless distinctions when it comes to socialism, because the word refers to a range of ideologies primarily connected through a common support for the social ownership of the means of production.
       <em>
        Some
       </em>
       of these ideologies include the application of socialism via collectivization under the ownership of a centralized state. That is not all socialism, however, as libertarian alternatives such as anarcho-syndicalism exist. A credit union, being a cooperative, is owned and operated by its membership and is therefore a socialist institution.

       semantics. most people who are "anti-socialism" have no qualm with credit unions, collectivist organic food markets, neighborhood operated broadband, etc. they are scared of a centralized totalitarian government that controls the means of production claiming it's in the interest of the people.

       , dude. Credit unions are an example of libertarian socialism in action. There is no "in spite of libertarianism" in anything I've said, ever. In fact, I frequently advocate for libertarian socialism. On that note, lol, in my

       I mention people throwing accusations of "playing semantics" and here you've gone and done it not half an hour later.

       If multiple people repeatedly claim you're arguing semantics, it might be because you're arguing semantics. I didn't even disagree with you, let alone refute you. I just implied your corrections are exhausting, boring, and don't advance the conversation.

       When most people talk about socialism, they are referring to a system of government, not a philosophy used by a private entity. But go ahead and repeat yourself again.

       Or, gosh, maybe they are just uninformed and resistant to new information regarding something they regard as being literally evil?

       People can think whatever they want, but they're
       <em>
        wrong
       </em>
       and that's my
       <em>
        point
       </em>
       . Socialism isn't "The government owns it and it's bad," it describes a wide range of ideologies commonly held together through support for social ownership. I'm repeating myself because you
       <em>
        don't seem to get it
       </em>
       , and it's quite simple.

       Okay, if you "don't disagree," then why can't you simply admit that I'm right? Why can't you just say, "Okay, credit unions are a socialist institution after all" unless you still think I'm wrong?

       But the entire conversation concerns whether or not credit unions, being worker and member owned/operated co-operatives, are examples of socialism. I pointed it out, the guy went "huh," I explained further and then you kind of proved my point (that people are unaware that CUs = socialism) by stating that they're "private institutions" and calling me a dingus like I'm wrong.
