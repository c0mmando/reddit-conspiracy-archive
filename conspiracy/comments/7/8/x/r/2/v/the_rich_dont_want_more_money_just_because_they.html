    <div class="md"><p>Credit unions are owned and operated by their membership. It is literally socialism. It&#39;s just interesting to me seeing credit unions recommended in places that are typically anti-socialist, like here or <a href="/r/personalfinance">/r/personalfinance</a> (I tried pointing this out on there, but I believe the word &quot;socialism&quot; triggers a shadow-deletion...). The general perception is that credit unions are great- even among people who think socialism is literally interchangeable with &quot;evil.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh, I wish it were the case. I argue with people on the subject of socialism quite often, and honestly a large percentage of people (especially in this sub) have deranged views on libertarian socialism (well, all socialism). Namely that it&#39;s an oxymoron, and that any attempt to define it is &quot;leftie word games&quot; or &quot;playing semantics.&quot; Or they think that all socialism is the same, and they insist that even opposing ideas like anarcho-syndicalism and Marxism-Leninism are the same thing (but they just call it &quot;Marxism). It&#39;s pretty wack. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Public and private are meaningless distinctions when it comes to socialism, because the word refers to a range of ideologies primarily connected through a common support for the social ownership of the means of production. <em>Some</em> of these ideologies include the application of socialism via collectivization under the ownership of a centralized state.

<p>When in my post above I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Hermann_Schulze-Delitzsch">link the wiki</a> on the guy <strong><em>who invented credit unions</em></strong>, his reasoning for doing so. It is libertarian <em>socialism</em>, dude. Credit unions are an example of libertarian socialism in action. There is no &quot;in spite of libertarianism&quot; in anything I&#39;ve said, ever. In fact, I frequently advocate for libertarian socialism. On that note, lol, in my <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78xr2v/the_rich_dont_want_more_money_just_because_they/doxuzfr/">other comment here</a> I mention people throwing accusations of &quot;playing semantics&quot; and here you&#39;ve gone and done it not half an hour later.</p>

<p>People can think whatever they want, but they&#39;re <em>wrong</em> and that&#39;s my <em>point</em>. Socialism isn&#39;t &quot;The government owns it and it&#39;s bad,&quot; it describes a wide range of ideologies commonly held together through support for social ownership. I&#39;m repeating myself because you <em>don&#39;t seem to get it</em>, and it&#39;s quite simple. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I didn&#39;t even disagree with you, let alone refute you. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay, if you &quot;don&#39;t disagree,&quot; then why can&#39;t you simply admit that I&#39;m right? Why can&#39;t you just say, &quot;Okay, credit unions are a socialist institution after all&quot; unless you still think I&#39;m wrong? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I just implied your corrections are exhausting, boring, and don&#39;t advance the conversation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the entire conversation concerns whether or not credit unions, being worker and member owned/operated co-operatives, are examples of socialism. I pointed it out, the guy went &quot;huh,&quot; I explained further and then you kind of proved my point (that people are unaware that CUs = socialism) by stating that they&#39;re &quot;private institutions&quot; and calling me a dingus like I&#39;m wrong. </p>
