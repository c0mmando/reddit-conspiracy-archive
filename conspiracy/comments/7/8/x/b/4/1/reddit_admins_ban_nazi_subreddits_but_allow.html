        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://archive.is/UjV91">This post</a> is on the front page of <a href="/r/Anarchism">/r/Anarchism</a>. In it, <a href="http://archive.is/oGUb3">a group that describes themselves as insurrectionists</a> is calling for the <a href="http://archive.is/Da2BS">illegal removal of the president and threatening &quot;action&quot; until &quot;their demands are met.&quot;</a></p>

<p>Antifa <a href="https://www.njhomelandsecurity.gov/analysis/anarchist-extremists-antifa">is classified as Anarchist Extremist Domestic Terror group by Homeland Security</a> and Insurrectionist is defined as <a href="https://www.bing.com/search?q=define%20insurrection">a violent uprising against an authority or government</a>.</p>

<p>How then are the admins able to justify letting <a href="/r/Anarchism">/r/Anarchism</a> remain unbanned, yet banning all the Nazi subreddits, when these Anarchist Extremist Domestic Terrorists <a href="https://i.imgur.com/FSQsC8K.png">have been causing violence and riots for over a year at the same events organized by the same people</a>, are <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XffACTI.png">targeting members of a particular race</a>, and have been prosecuted for violence countless times at these &quot;events&quot; they organize, by the same people, which are always promoted on <a href="/r/Anarchism">/r/Anarchism</a> and always end up having violence, vandalism, and rioting?</p>

<p>Edit: Added a <a href="http://archive.is/Da2BS">link</a> that I forgot to include</p>

<p>Edit 2: Some more goodies on their front page for the Admins to ignore:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://archive.is/w7aSR">Threatening to shoot liberals</a></li>
<li><a href="https://i.imgur.com/qNtiDhz.png">User flares plastered all over the front page right now promoting killing cops</a></li>
<li>Multiple threads promoting violence against &quot;Nazis&quot; (remember how they call the democratically elected president of the United States and his 60 million voters all Nazis?): <a href="http://archive.is/8Ns5s">1</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/yqNuO">2</a>, <a href="http://archive.is/Y6MUR">3</a> (They will remove these because they&#39;re under scrutiny, but check the users comment history and you&#39;ll see he&#39;s been posting the same stuff there for months.)</li>
</ul>

<p>It&#39;s really problematic that they would do that just because of who they are. Reddit really should be more inclusive. Diversity is progress. Excluding them makes us to different from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>On the first one  (had to find a better source for it), you are right, he indeed killed a officer, and was indeed a member of BLM. (Didn&#39;t know that)</p>

<p>And it&#39;s sad he did it, because:
&quot;Some of y&#39;all don&#39;t understand the more violence that occurs is less justice for Mike Brown the focus should be on him,&quot; he posted on a &quot;Justice for Mike Brown&quot; Facebook page on Aug. 14, 2014, one week after Brown&#39;s death.</p>

<p>Yes, but the Night-watchman state is an extremist Libertarian philosophy, actually to be accurate, minarchist. It proposes having the government as small as it can possibly be without being completely ineffective so as to provide protections for the individual. You could argue that Minarchism is kind of like Anarcho-Capitalism, but that kind of just adds weight to the horseshoe political theory. Just because they&#39;re similar doesn&#39;t mean the people that subscribe to the beliefs won&#39;t hate each other. Cognitive dissonance is a thing.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>See cognitive dissonance. I mean, if you were to just look at policy alone, anarcho-communism is far closer to Libertarianism than Socialist Democracy. Nothing about communism intrinsically warrants the state taking all private property to transition into a communist society, unless you&#39;re a Marxist, which is why I&#39;d rather suggest that the reason for why anarchists there hate Libertarians is because they aren&#39;t anarchists, or anarcho-communists, or anarcho-syndicalists. They&#39;re Marxists.</p>

<p>Horseshoe theory is just status quo bullshit.
You just have no ideia what anarchism is.
But I&#39;ll weigh in. Minarchism, anarcho capitalism, liberalism and other variants are just capitalism on steroids, the basis of anarchism is anti-capitalism and the end of the state is just a symptom of that, as anarchists consider the state to be a tool of bourgeois oppression.</p>

<p>The intellectually reponsible thing to do would be to read actual anarchist authors like Proudhon or Kropotkin or even just reading about the story of anarchism within the labour struggles.</p>

<p>Also many anarchists subscribe to marx&#39;s reading of history and most of his analysis of society without actually being marxists.</p>

<p>There is a deliberate agenda to make higher education a mandatory minimum requirement to earn a livable wage in society, so while you&#39;re right no one forces you to take out student loans, our society definitely makes it hard to make an honest living without an education, which is expensive as fuck. There are scholarships, sure, but what about the rest of the middle class that doesn&#39;t get scholarships?</p>

<p>I can understand why, as a marxist, you feel threatened by something like the horseshoe theory. I won&#39;t try and prove to you why it is valid. You have your beliefs, I have mine. You&#39;re right, though, Anarchism inherently is opposed to capitalism, as it is opposed to all hierarchical systems, including the state. I never suggested otherwise, we&#39;re in firm agreement there, but that&#39;s not my explanation for why the anarchy sub here is so hostile towards Libertarianism and Minarchism, but so receptive of democratic socialism and Marxism. Anarchism, true to the bone anarchism, is just as vehemently opposed to marixsm as it is capitalism. The reason the anarchy sub is so biased in this regard is because the people there are Marxist, not anarchist. It&#39;s the same with many of the progressive subs here, and before being Marxist, they&#39;re social justice warriors.</p>

<p>Kinda supports my points, really. If you want to be a anarcho-marxist, that&#39;s cool. You&#39;re allowed to have your own opinions-we all are. This socio-economic argument has been done to death on the internet, and you and I certainly aren&#39;t going to solve it here (if what happened below is any evidence as such).</p>

<p>I like your comment about Einstein being pro-socialism. I wouldn&#39;t consider myself anti-socialism by any measure. I like bits and pieces of different philosophies, and I don&#39;t think we necessarily need to become true 100% communist, socialist, capitalist, or any other socio-economic &quot;ist&quot; to make our world a substantially better place to live in. However, I&#39;d like to acknowledge that even Einstein noted the nuanced difficulties of socialism. While being pro-socialist, he didn&#39;t present his argument for socialism as so cut and dry. From <em>Why Socialism</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual. The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power, to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1st,  Marx is not Jesus,  and many communists do not agree with him on everything.  Second he became a leading philosopher in a tendecy thay was already coalescing.    Trade unions already existed,  the Paris commune had already occured.</p>

<p>Communism posits that the workers should control the means of production.  Some believe a state is necessary,  some disagree on how much state,  some disagree on if a state is even needed.  </p>

<p>The communist manifesto literally does not say state control of the means of production is necessary for communism.  I just searched the manifesto i downloaded for free off some commie website.  Did a pdf search and &quot;state control&quot; does not show up once.  &quot;Means of production&quot; shows up in 10 instances,  only two of which use the phrase in a post revolutionary context and used in association with &quot;the commune&quot;.</p>

<p>Sseriously bud,  if you want to be ignorant well you wont be alone,  but you have definitely been misled at somepoint about the basics of communism. </p>

<p>A major issue has always been the state communism vs free communism.  Again,  do some studying or keep being an altright lunatic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone hits your car with a bat, and you feel threatened, then accidentally drive into a crowd while fleeing for your life, it&#39;s the fault of the person who committed a felony making you fear for your life.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Having violent rioters surround your car and blocking traffic, while searching for people dressed like you to kill - well, that is &#39;fearing for your life&#39;. Sorry, but that&#39;s exactly the circumstance the guy was in. He was surrounded by violent, criminal rioters. And there are multiple instances of them violently attacking people from earlier that day. And at that moment, they were illegally blocking a road, and some were hitting his car with clubs of some kind.</p>

<p>The violence in Charlottesville was 100% the fault of the left. They didn&#39;t have to come looking for people to beat. They could have let the whole thing go down without any trouble. But they didn&#39;t. They&#39;re afraid of free speech. They hate it. They hate that anyone could disagree with them - let alone out-argue them and win over the hearts and minds of the country. So, out of hate and fear, they seek to silence those who dare disagree with them publicly. They choose to attack alt-right meetups and commit many felonies in the process.</p>

<p>It&#39;s their fault. They created violent, dangerous circumstances. The blood is on their hands.</p>

<p>You are in a vehicle. A metal cage. One person <em>maybe</em> hitting your car (because again, the video doesn’t show anything, just a movement that could be guessed at hitting the car), accelerating into a crowd of people is not ‘proportional response’</p>

<p>This has already been discussed in this thread.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traumatic_cardiac_arrest">Heart attacks can be caused by blunt force trauma</a></p>

<p>Blunt force trauma.... such as being hit by a car <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chest_injury">Listed as &#39;motor vehicle collisions&#39;</a></p>

<p>Can and did are two different things.  Simple fact is she was a morbidly obese smoker who probably massively over exerted herself and then died of a heart attack caused by the shocking series of events.</p>

<p>The woman everyone claims to have died by being &#39;crushed&#39; by a car was a total lie, nobody seems to know what happened to her, heather was far to the right of the car.</p>

<p>Oh, you&#39;ve seen the death cert? I though the whole argument was &#39;she died because she was fat because they won&#39;t show us the cert and her mom said she had a heart attack, so watch this random youtube video of her mom saying heart attack&#39;.</p>

<p>And those are great links that only have slight ties to people who say they support BLM, but ... that&#39;s it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a matter of fighting discrimination. In case you&#39;re unaware - the nazis killed a lot of jewish people (as well as gays, communists, &quot;subversives&quot;, and disabled people) in this thing called the holocaust.</p>

<p>Hating and discriminating against jewish people is a really major part of their &quot;beliefs&quot; (although given these historical actions, it&#39;s fair to say these views go beyond mere belief alone)... those beliefs are magnified by that historical context - and have no place in polite society. </p>

<p>It is unreasonable to defend such beliefs, just as it is unreasonable for a person to argue against their own rights and interests (ie arguing for or on behalf of fascists). I hope you understand now.</p>

<p>And to answer the question you asked earlier, plenty of people hold views that absolutely warrant discrimination. Nazis, Incels, religious extremists, etc. As long as the government isn&#39;t doing it, it&#39;s not in violation of the First Amendment. In fact, it&#39;s an exercise of the right to free speech for Reddit to say, &quot;We don&#39;t like the retarded bullshit you&#39;re saying and you won&#39;t be allowed to use our platform to do so anymore.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really are a fantastically stupid person or a troll with a huge amount of time on your hands. </p>

<p>Did I say I was against free speech? Free speech is great, but the constitution doesn&#39;t apply to how privately held businesses are run. The first amendment refers to the government not being able to stifle private citizens. Reddit is not the government. They have the freedom to do whatever they want with their own privately held website. If the people that run Reddit don&#39;t want Nazis congregating here, that&#39;s their right. Maybe one day the United States will have a citizens forum online where you can say whatever you want. Until then, get over it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure. They can ban whatever they want. But when they ban stuff over arbitrary definitions, while using that arbitrary definition to not ban others, they are explicitly condoning the stuff they don&#39;t ban. </p>

<p>Sure. Banning Nazi shit is good because it&#39;s a horrible ideology that&#39;s lead to shits of death. But communism/socialism is also a horrible ideology that&#39;s lead to even more deaths. So, when they ban Nazi shit over the fact that it&#39;s an ideology that spreads hate and killed a or of people, but let&#39;s open communists/socialist Not only exist, but flourish, they are showing that these arbitrary rules against &quot;hate and violence&quot; are only directed at &quot;hate and violence&quot; they disagree with. Meaning they actually aren&#39;t banning hate and violence, but are just banning shit they disagree with. </p>

<p>Reddit is like the town message board. If you live in that town you can post a bill for whatever you want. If that town then says &quot;well moderate it to stop hate&quot; but then only moderates the hate they don&#39;t agree with, but still leaves the hate that they are for, doesn&#39;t mean they are against hate, but hate they disagree with. </p>

<p>All in all, by doing this Reddit has only shown that they aren&#39;t agasint hate and violence, but only against hate and violence that goes against what they want. All while signalling they are totally for hate and violence if it&#39;s directed at what oe who they think violence and hate are acceptable, rather than just being generally against hate and violence. </p>

<p>This is a huge problem we face generally in society. Because of course there are horrible ideologies. But when you say you&#39;re against horrible shit, but then do something that only stops part of the horrible shit, while tactfully not going after the other, shows you are complacent. </p>

<p>In the past month I was given a shirt by a gay man that had Che Guevara on it, but the text around it said &quot;socialism is for fags&quot;, I&#39;ve wore it around a few times as an experiment. Not one person took offense of the communist revolutionary or the word socialism, but only took offense at the word &quot;fag&quot;. Che was a brutal genocidal maniac that literally purged gays and minorities from Cuba, but no one took offense to that, and merely the word fag. This is pretty much the same thing that&#39;s happening here, people (the Reddit staff) are only taking offense to mean words people write by banning places and people that speak those mean words (which is a good thing), but are complicently giving the thumbs up to literally the same shit because it fits their agenda/narrative. That&#39;s horrible because it shows they actually aren&#39;t against bad shit in general, but are for bad shit if it aligns with their views. It&#39;s only being hypocritical. </p>

<p>Well just reading his wiki. Richard Spencer doesn&#39;t talk about JUST &quot;preserving European heritage&quot; ..he goes quite a bit further than preservation doesn&#39;t he? The man wants an ethno-European homeland with a &quot;peaceful cleansing&quot; of those who aren&#39;t white. That&#39;s not preservation of ancestry: that&#39;s openly advocating for the removal of millions of Americans--many who have been here far longer than whites or europeans. Everyone knows that would never happen peacefully.</p>

<p>Richard Spenser sitting as president of a white nationalist think tank--literally an underlying value of Nazis. Do I think he&#39;s a Nazi, no--I think he&#39;s a smart person who&#39;s trying to figure out how to accomplish a lot of what Nazi&#39;s wanted, but without using violence. Do I think he&#39;s inspired and has borrowed a lot of Nazi ideas, values and strategies. Yes. And I think he needs to try a lot harder. I had soooo many of Christian Republican friends draw the line when they watched he and his buddies salute with their hands in a manner just like Nazis  while yelling &quot;Hail Trump&quot; and &quot;Blood and Soil&quot; in Charlottesville. </p>

<p>There could be a lot of racial mixing during the Roman empire. Soldiers hailing from provinces in Syria could (and some officers did, from various parts of the Middle East and Africa) be awarded land in England which was occupied by Rome. In the history of Rome there were several black Roman Emperors and African/Middle Eastern Romans were all over Western Europe. I mean you&#39;ve heard the term &quot;Black Irish&quot; right? Well recent genetic testing in 2015 has shown that earliest Irish descendants were Sardinians (southern italians from before 5BC when southern italians looked even darker than they do now. Incidentally this is kind of why why Irish, Italians, Greeks and Spaniards were discriminated against by &quot;White People&quot; in the late 1800s and early 1900s. You&#39;re claiming there&#39;s some sort of unifying genetic bond--but there is no evidence of that. Just surface skin color which gets diluted in what..4 generations? Furthermore there&#39;s even less evidence of white european ancestors sharing some sort of politically unifying bond--quite the opposite. Let alone a desire. Lol look at Europe right now. White Americans want an ethno-European homeland, but the real Ethno-European homeland, still after 2,000 of some of the bloodiest wars and violence, still aren&#39;t sure if they want to work together--let alone remain white. lol </p>

<p>Is there evidence that white people will be better off by themselves? Cuz all history shows is ethnic homogenous states are still susceptible to devolving into alternate caste/class systems and hierarchies--and nationalism (if we&#39;re looking at history) has yet to show itself powerless to stop from sliding into rampant tyranny. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The man wants an ethno-European homeland. What is the problem with that?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I&#39;m white and I consider America my home. So I don&#39;t dream about the destruction of my home and subsequent removal of many of my friends. What&#39;s wrong with a guy dreaming about removing my friends (and some family members) from my home? Well, how much time do you have? I can get pretty wordy.</p>

<p>...and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone. It&#39;s safe to say I think most Americans don&#39;t dream of a world where their non-white friends and family don&#39;t/can&#39;t live here anymore.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>He&#39;s never stated that. He described the Paris peace treaty of 1919 as such. He&#39;s never called for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ok, yes you&#39;re right. He didn&#39;t use those words literally after each other--he didn&#39;t say &quot;I want peaceful ethnic cleansing.&quot; What he said was that he wanted and advocated for population removals that could be done peacefully in way similar to the Paris Treaty in 1919. At the American Renaissance in 2013 he said,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, in the public imagination, ‘ethnic cleansing’ has been associated with civil war and mass murder. But this need not be the case. 1919 is a real example of successful ethnic redistribution—done by fiat, we should remember, but done peacefully.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>...Yeah.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>His goal is simply to raise White consciousness. He&#39;s never called for the removal of people, other than maybe illegals.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He describes legal immigration as a war against white people today. Spencer loves to fear monger and get white people scared about their future. That&#39;s his &quot;raising white consciousness&quot; . Spencer is afraid that white people will be treated in the future, a little less worse than the way white people have treated minorities not that long ago. Yeah it&#39;s not a convincing argument (white people have bigger problems and there&#39;s not evidence of rising anti-white violence...except in response to hundreds of years of white racism), but who cares if he doesn&#39;t explicitly call for the removal of people today. People aren&#39;t idiots. They can read between the lines and they know that Spencer&#39;s endgame is a utopian vision that is unavoidably racist--there would be no peaceful way to enact his vision because it would split families apart. lol like how would that even happen? They&#39;d be checking melanin or administrating genetic tests?</p>

<p>There is no way to stop white people from becoming a minority in this country without using violence against both white and nonwhite people. So...yeah. They aren&#39;t necessarily a Nazi, but they&#39;re wanting to act in a uniquely politically racialized authoritarian way...not unlike the Nazis or I guess the Japanese towards the Koreans and Chinese throughout early 1900s or I guess Muslims and Hindus along the Pakistani/Indian border. etc. etc. </p>

<p>He described a historical fact. And another fact, ethnic cleansing is happening right this moment. Migration of people with a high birthrate to a country of people with a low birthrate is effectively peaceful ethnic cleansing. </p>

<p>Do I even need to comment. You just admitted that there is rising anti White violence and this is obvious. Racial tensions are incredibly high right now.</p>

<p>See, this is the problem. This isn&#39;t true. We have solutions, but we are called Nazis for talking about them. Incentivized sterilization, net neutral immigration, and ending dysgenic welfare programs would be a very, very good start. </p>

<p>Ignoring the obvious ad hom, I think you&#39;d be surprised at how many people actually agree with the altright. 10% openly identify as such and over 50% think that Whites are actively discriminated against or some metric like that, and 30% think it&#39;s important to preserve the White heritage of the country. </p>

<p>And thing is, our ranks can only grow. More and more White people are coming to our side every day. The only way for you to win this is by importing more and more non Whites. </p>

<p>This &#39;definition&#39; of fascism is not remotely close to being close to accurate. Like it&#39;s what a parody of a communist would say.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t even have to use some alternate source for this...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fascism /ˈfæʃɪzəm/ is a form of radical authoritarian nationalism, characterized by dictatorial power, forcible suppression of opposition and <strong>control of industry and commerce</strong> that came to prominence in early 20th-century Europe.</p>

<p>While we&#39;re at it...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Communism means the state owns the means of production in its entirety. It attempts to create a classless society run by workers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the as to now completely baseless claim of communists. In reality it means the state owns the means of production in their entirety, which creates, for the vast majority, a two-class society. Those who compose the body known as &#39;the state,&#39; and those who are starving to death. </p>

<p>Arguably communism is &quot;better&quot; by two classes. Those dying in prison and those who are not actually employed by the state, but benefit from relationships with those who are. Bravo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is this fucking memery straight out of /pol/?</p>

<p>Encyclopedia Brittannica on Communism:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Like most writers of the 19th century, Marx tended to use the terms communism and socialism interchangeably. In his Critique of the Gotha Programme (1875), however, Marx identified two phases of communism that would follow the predicted overthrow of capitalism: the first would be a transitional system in which the working class would control the government and economy yet still find it necessary to pay people according to how long, hard, or well they worked; the second would be fully realized communism—a society without class divisions or government, in which the production and distribution of goods would be based upon the principle “From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.” Marx’s followers, especially the Russian revolutionary Vladimir Ilich Lenin, took up this distinction.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Classless society and a government controlled by workers with NO PRIVATE INDUSTRY. It seems you have no fucking clue that Prisoner is not an economic class.</p>

<p>Fascism however:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although fascist parties and movements differed significantly from each other, they had many characteristics in common, including extreme militaristic nationalism, contempt for electoral democracy and political and cultural liberalism, a belief in natural social hierarchy and the rule of elites, and the desire to create a Volksgemeinschaft (German: “people’s community”), in which individual interests would be subordinated to the good of the nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Communism wants a classless society, Fascism wants a society of hierarchy of might and rule by the very rich who are native to the country which is what they mean by control of the economy. Foreigners are not welcome in the economy.</p>

<p>2 different fucking worlds. At no point is Mercantilist protectionism anywhere near nationalizing every industry in existence and running it by government.</p>

<p>Your entire post is proof that you are completely disconnected from reality and should seek immediate mental help.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fascism in practice is Mercantilism to enforce native private control of industry. It is closer to Capitalism than Communism.</p>

<p>Mercantilism enforces private industry with laws to stop foreigners taking over.</p>

<p>Communism in practice is a central economy in Russia, or state capitalism in China. Both are government run markets with NO private industry or land. It is not Mercantilism because Mercantilism wants private industry not directly run by government and private property.</p>

<p>Every single god damn country is government controlled. There is not a single spec of dirt on this planet that isn&#39;t controlled by some form of government, even tribalism is considered government.</p>

<p>At no point is any of this the same and only the most deluded person can equate all governments and economic theories the same by over generalizing to the point no words mean anything anymore.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a core aspect of communism. Nominally, communism wants to spread power amongst more people than almost any other type of government (it doesn&#39;t turn out this way for a variety of reasons). Fascism is pretty definitively dictatorial.</p>

<p>It seems like you don&#39;t really know what these words mean.

<p>tl;dw: National Socialism (why do you call them &quot;Nazis&quot;?) was a resistance movement against the international banking cartel. It was mercilessly crushed, using every means available. It must not be allowed to rise again, as this threatens the world oligarchical order.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everything you just wrote is complete bullshit. The Reichsbank was founded in 1871 as the national bank of Germany and the Reichsmark was created as the national currency in 1924. Both existed through the fall of the the Third Reich and Hitler or his party had no influence on either of them.</p>

<p>Hitler after WW1 formed the Reichswehr who infiltrated the German Workers&#39; Party (DAP). Hitler and a bunch of members of the Thule society, like Rudolf Hess, Alfred Rosenberg, Hans Frank, Julius Lehmann, Gottfried Feder, Dietrich Eckart, and Karl Harrer, created the Nazi party out of the remains of the DEP. They built the party around the ideas of the Thule society who believed Germans were members of a superior Aryan race and held other cultish beliefs. The NAZIs fronted a position of socialism and workers rights to gain support of the former members of the DEP. Hitler&#39;s rise to power was not a grassroots &quot;resistance movement&quot; like you make it out to be, they first tried to take power with military force and stage a coup to overthrow the government and enact a right-wing autocratic regime in it&#39;s place during the Kapp Putsch.</p>

<p>Hitler used his Military prowess to elevate his political status within his own party and other right wing members of the government (kind of like how Trump used his wealth and celebrity status to get a political platform in the Republican party). Hitler got president Hindenburg to name him chancellor. In the 1933 federal election he ran on a platform of anti-comunism and anti-semitism. He used the jews as a scapegoat for the country&#39;s problems (like Trump with Muslims and Mexicans) and then he made farfetched claims that he could easily solve the complex issues facing the country even with little political knowledge (like Trump). He made grand speeches evoking blind nationalism and exceptionalism (like Trump). Then he used the false flag burning of the Reichstag building to exclude communists from the Reichstag and gave himself unchecked powers.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m sure we have no reason to fear what Trump might do with the power he has.</p>

<p>This hate and violence by the political left isn&#39;t new. The other year when a woman of Indian heritage gave the Republican rebuttal to the sotu address, there were tons of comments in politics that went undeleted that called her a &quot;cunt&quot; or told her to go back home. </p>

<p>There are mods on politics that literally defend comments calling for killing workers in an industry that employee 15 million people in the us. Their reasoning is &quot;well it&#39;s not advocating violence against an individual&quot;. Which that comment in my mind was worse, because This mod was only concerned that one or two people may have been targeted, but was actually saying it&#39;s fine if you advocate the deaths of millions of people. </p>

<p>People with this mentality are truly the greatest threat to humanity. The only difference between them and Nazis burning jews and communists starving entire ethnicities, is the fact that they aren&#39;t in complete power. And, it&#39;s a scary fact that more and more people are falling for their lies to the point where they might get into more power than they have. </p>

We don&#39;t want a leader period. You conspiracy theorists are always going on about the NWO which is propergated by the president? Yet you don&#39;t support the removal of the president? And to be quite honest anarchism is nothing like communism, it has similar tendencies but communism is nothing more than a dictatorship. Anarchists want a mutual society that works in communities for the greater good of the people and where class and inequality is abolished, where we all don&#39;t get trampled on by the ultra rich class thats running the planet. Wait is that the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers of the world?? Oh and one where the environment isn&#39;t getting destroyed, cause we aren&#39;t killing the planet we are killing ourselves. 
It&#39;s not that we want to kill the fucking president we just want a revolution to overthrow this fucking system that you all want abolished yourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Looks like OP needs the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence">False Equivalence Fallacy</a> explained to them.</p>

<p>Anarchists don&#39;t advocate genocide, they don&#39;t advocate white supremacy, racism,  misogyny, social hierarchy, class, or allowing anyone to starve because &quot;the market&quot; has deemed their skills and talents to be of little utility. They are diametrically opposed to all those things. Please get your facts straight.</p>

<p>Anarchism is not equivalent to Nazism. Anarchism is a legitimate political tradition that is as old as capitalism (it emerged as an alternative proposal to industrial capitalism, after all). Nazism is not a legitimate political ideology for the above-mentioned reasons.</p>

<p>I agree that minority populations historically have not fared well. Hopefully this country will treat minorities better by the time white people enter that category.</p>

<p>So why is it an issue that Whites would want to prevent themselves and their children from becoming minorities?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The man wants an ethno-European homeland</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is the problem with that? He&#39;s said, repeatedely, that he does want America to be that ethnostate. He&#39;s always described it as a post American utopian vision. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The man wants an ethno-European homeland with a &quot;peaceful cleansing&quot; of those who aren&#39;t white.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He&#39;s never stated that. He described the Paris peace treaty of 1919 as such. He&#39;s never called for it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s not preservation of ancestry: that&#39;s openly advocating for the removal of millions of Americans--many who have been here far longer than whites or europeans. Everyone knows that would never happen peacefully.</p>

<p>Well seeing as that isn&#39;t what he is after, the point is moot. </p>
