        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Why would Campos hop in a rental car and head to Mexico? Because he was taking a big suitcase full of cash to his family.</p>

<p>MGM sat him down and said &quot;Look, we know this is a big payday for you. We know you can make the rounds on the talk shows and news channels and rake in a ton of cash. Rather than have you do that, and open up a can of worms and potential liability for MGM, why don&#39;t we just pay you. We&#39;ll set up one interview with a MGM-friendly host, Ellen, who will recount our version of events. All you have to do is nod. In exchange for this being your ONLY interview, we will pay you a large cash sum. Take it to Mexico and give your family a good life.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not hard for a casino to come up with a large amount of basically untraceable cash, so they do. So, Campos throws the suitcase full of cash in a car (because you can&#39;t fly with that much money undetected) and heads across the border. Cars are rarely checked on their way down, just the way back. The money is staying in Mexico so there&#39;s no problem there.</p>

<p>This is a simple explanation that fits with all the facts.</p>

<p>But why wouldn&#39;t he fly, especially with a leg wound, and especially when MGM or any number of other parties would have gladly bought the guy a plane ticket?</p>

<p>I think the fact that he chose to drive such a distance while injured, and that basically nobody knew about it until some fed leaked a customs form is worth considering.</p>

<p>I have US auto insurance (but no Mexican auto insurance) and am able to drive back and forth into Mexico no problem. I also have Global Entry and went through that whole car inspection and verification process though, so maybe that&#39;s why? I&#39;ve never heard of anyone needing special auto insurance to drive into Mexico from Cali.</p>

Remember Cucker Carlson didn&#39;t show the document so you can&#39;t say for certain that he rented the car. I could very well see him wanting to be away from everything after this event.

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>where the main witness was allowed to leave country</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the fourth amendment still applies to pretty much everyone outside of a person being legally detained. Law enforcement might prefer a given course of action but legally they are not always able to pursue it. Full on criminal suspects in murder cases are not detained to the level some here are expecting of Campos, as a witness. </p>

<p>Oh sure law enforcement will fallow a person around and in many cases bring charges if they think a suspect is planning to run. Like for example when Scott Peterson was near the border with his hair now blond. Yet this idea that law enforcement can just demand a citizen do something because &quot;reasons&quot; is just not there. They can&#39;t make you give a statement, they can&#39;t force you to testify unless it&#39;s a grand jury. Yet some how people think they can totally restrict a private citizens travel options, as a witness? Real life is not like tv people. </p>

<p>also keep in mind the wording of a lot of the articles about Campos. They leap from talking about unknown this and that, from his union&#39;s point of view, then project that lack of knowledge onto law enforcement. It&#39;s not law enforcement saying they did not know where he was, it&#39;s just the union and the interviews. 
I&#39;m thinking a lot of sites are just going for click bait here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no one (except ...making a stretch... people with diplomatic visas...dea, cia etc) can cross the US/Mexican border ....with a rental car ! ...in either direction. If you could do this, can you imagine how many US rental cars would be stolen inside Mexico. The Mexican Aduana will NOT allow rental cars from the US into Mexico...period. I&#39;ve lived in Mexico for nearly 30 years and have crossed the border hundreds of times ! This is common knowledge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>An uncle of mine snuck a rental car into Mexico once... you&#39;ll be shocked to find out it was stolen :)</p>

<p>Never told me how he did it (passed away a few years back) but knowing him I&#39;m sure it involved violating a few laws - almost certainly involved some bribery, forged documents, and drugs. </p>

<p>This happened ~40 years ago, I imagine it&#39;s a lot harder now. Also, I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s a huge red flag of something shady going on.</p>
