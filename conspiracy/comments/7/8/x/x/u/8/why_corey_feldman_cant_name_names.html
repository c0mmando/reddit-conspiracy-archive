       Because this pedo ring has been common knowledge since the fifties. Shirley, goddamn, Temple talked about being sexually harassed by her producers on the Larry King show.
      </p>
      <p>
       The police know, of course they know. Clearly something is stopping them from acting. If a private investigation finds and releases hard evidence of the assaults, their hands will be forced and Hollywood will become a much safer place.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Corey starts recklessly naming high profile figures without that hard evidence, he'll be sued into poverty and mocked into obscurity like everyone who tried before him. Just look at what happened when the BBC was protecting Savville.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he doesn't name people until after he has the evidence, nobody can sue him for liable and he can't be mocked because of naming such ridiculous people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember how people reacted to Cosby's acusers?
      </p>
      <p>
       "The black sweater guy? Yeah right!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Savville again
      </p>
      <p>
       "The guy from Jim'll fix it? As if he'd be a pedophile!"
      </p>
      <p>
       These people have complete control over public perception. Hollywood doesn't just make movies. Many of the big corporation owners also own news corporations. If they want you to disregard anything someone says, for instance, making you think Corey Feldman is an attention-seeking nutjob, they'll make you think they're laughable.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has happened time and time again to people who name names. Corey is trying to force the police into action by publicising real evidence. Why does it have to be public?
      </p>
      <p>
       For some reason, evidence of this ring seems to disappear when the police get hold of it. One former child actor gave an actual list of people who had raped her straight to a judge (again, not publicly accusing to avoid liable) and guess what happened. The police "lost" it.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is why it has to be a documentary, that is why it has to be publicly funded, and that is why Corey Feldman cannot name names.

       He can. 
Look at Harvey Weistein, he was named by many women. He did not go to jail, noone has been sued. 
It is not about pressing chargers, as soon as Corey Feldman gives name, those people will be fired, or shamed.

       a little late for that. I don't believe he has anything to lose at this point. If he wants to crowd source some money, why doesn't he crowd source money for a legal defense against these scumbags? Making a movie is retarded. It will probably NOT name names but will instead be "inspired by a true story".
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know the name he won't name. It rhymes with Beevin Mealsberg.

       What was your reaction when you found out Corey Feldman was launching a campaign against the Hollywood pedo ring?
      </p>
      <p>
       It should have been something along the lines of "That makes sense, Corey has been the leader of an International crusade against profile rings for a years, and this year more rings have been broken up than ever before in history, so now is an ideal time to strike"
      </p>
      <p>
       I bet it was more like "You mean that stoner guy?"
      </p>
      <p>
       The ring knew what he was going to do, and the reason so few people know about his resent work is because they've been preserving his image as "that stoner guy" so that people like you don't take him seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm sorry, but the legal funds idea doesn't make much sense. First of all, he'd be going up against half the lawyers in Hollywood, second, your not going to win a liable case against even the most incompetent lawyer in the world without evidence (especially if you're accusing them of wronging you directly, since if they're found innocent the court has officially said you were lying and are therefore open to liable), and most importantly, defending yourself against a liable accusation doesn't make the police perform a full investigation of an entire industry to root out organized crime. It doesn't even make them arrest the person you're accusing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corey is trying to poison the roots, not trim the petals.

       Like I said, if he's going to crowd source money for a movie, he should not waste his time. Where do you think this movie is going to play? YouTube? Do you really believe if he was coming out with a movie about a secret Hollywood pedo ring that named names, he wouldn't immediately get hit with an injunction? He's going to need legal help regardless because they will surely block this movie from ever seeing the light of day. Just name names and lawyer up.

       First of all it's ten mil, some of that is going towards lawyers. Second, you can't file an injunction against someone unless they are a threat to you, and Corey hasn't named anyone, so filing an injunction now would be an admission of guilt (not legally, but in the public eye) if he named them without making hard evidence public first, then they could file an injunction claiming it's to protect them from slander, and he wouldn't be able to release the evidence. He'd have no choice but to hand it in, and the police would "lose" it like they have with so much evidence before, and we'd never even know the evidence existed because of the injunction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Making a documentary is the best option Corey has because he need two things; he needs hard evidence (which he either doesn't yet have or doesn't have enough of to prove a conspiracy), and he needs that evidence to be as public as possible so that no one can deny the evidence's existence.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he names people before the evidence is public, Hollywood lawyers have league methods of preventing us from seeing the evidence, and illegal methods of shutting down the investigation, then Corey becomes a laughing stock in the public eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what detectives in Noir films mean when they say "blowing a case wide open" it means making the evidence public so currupt police and judges can't cover it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of the money would go into the investigation (you can see why this would be expensive), some of the money will go towards lawyers to protect them after the film is released, and some of the money will go into production and marketing so that as many people will see it as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corey was assaulted as a child. He's probably been planning this for a long time.

       Everyone already knows. Trouble is, if he dies the public will carry on pretending they don't in order to protect their mind from the truth of such a horrible idea, and the courrupt public servants will carry on pretending they don't to protect their wallets from the loss of such a lucrative business.

       for real.... it is hard to see Corey over the years revert and seeing all the dismissals about his drug abuse or his connection to MJ, let's hope he has sleeper cells with his evidence and should come out at the time of his death.

       His life? You may not think he has much of a career or much reason to live but that may not be how he views it.

       Because if he doesn't go public on a wide scale he will likely be killed or his family and no one will know or care.

       I myself have incredible info no one would believe if I went public. I myself knew that when I took my info public it had to be in a big way that the most people would see and understand before the people at the top got wind of it or I would be dead or get cancer mysteriously before they ever did.

       I would believe that but he's been on a crusade recently. More pedophile rings have been broken up this year than any year in history, and a surprising amount of that is thanks to Corey Feldman. I believe that man has real hatred in his heart and, better yet, he knows how to use it.

       These things are already out there and the police are ignoring them now. Firstly Corey needs undeniable evidence to force the police to investigate. Second, this information must be publicised, and I mean really publicised, so the police can't "lose" it. When he's got those two things he doesn't need to hide his identity because if it's true it isn't liable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Releasing a rumour on the dark web may be safe but it's even less effective than just accusing them before getting the evidence.
