       If anyone has read Jim Garrison's book
       <em>
        On the Trail of the Assassins
       </em>
       then they probably have a good understanding of how close Garrison came to proving undeniable CIA connections to Lee Harvey Oswald. Garrison was fairly convinced that Oswald had received military intelligence training in the years leading up to the assassination. On top of this he was able to place Oswald in New Orleans with three main suspects:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Dave Ferrie
       </li>
       <li>
        Guy Bannister
       </li>
       <li>
        Clay Shaw (alias Clay Bertrand)
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       We all know the famous trial of Clay Shaw but most don't know that the only reason why Garrison was left to only indict Shaw was because both Bannister and Ferrie were dead. Bannister died in 1964 of "natural" causes shortly after getting into a drunken altercation in a bar with Jack Martin admitting to being involved in the assassination of Kennedy. Ferrie was ruled dead by suicide just a week after the New Orleans Times caught wind of Garrison's investigation (which Ferrie was cooperating with).
      </p>
      <p>
       I
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       want this community to find information that will implicate either Ferrie, Bannister, or Shaw as CIA assets because it would blow the entire case wide open. I believe that Ferrie and Bannister (maybe less so Shaw) were involved in organized sheep-dipping operations to leave Oswald as the lone patsy after the assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clay Shaw admitted at trial to cooperating when he could with the CIA but did not admit to being an agent. Any information proving he was employed by the CIA would be huge.

       If you think Jim Garrison wasn't a part of the overall conspiracy, I have some Ocean front property in Phoenix for sale dirt cheap,act now!

      <p>
       This is the same man who had a permanent weekly breakfast sit down with Carlos Marcello, also known as The Godfather and "The Little Man" Marcello (Sicilian-American mafioso who became the boss of the New Orleans crime family during the 1940's and held this position for the next thirty years).... yet SWORE ON A STACK BIBLES there was no Mafia presence in New Orleans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jim Garrison was just more smoke and mirrors.

       Sorry but I can't stand when people come into Jim Garrison threads and pull out the same retired and repeated claims to tarnish his name and discredit his findings without refuting ANY of the aforementioned evidence and facts he puts forward.

       JFK was not assassinated because he wanted to dismantle the CIA, he wasn't killed by the Mafia, nor the masters of the Federal Reserve. He was assassinated for attempting to strip Israel of its nuclear weapons.

       I'm not arguing there weren't Israeli connections... I'm simply arguing that we 100% have solid evidence linking Oswald to the CIA. Why would we spend a ton of effort and resources looking for Israeli evidence (which doesn't exist at this point to where it would be provable) when we have an actual link connecting him to the CIA?
