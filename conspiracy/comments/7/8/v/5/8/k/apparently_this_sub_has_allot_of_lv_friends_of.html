       I do think the victim doubting is a bad angle with the case of LV. Whether there were real victims, whether there weren't or whether the number was inflated, is less relevant to figuring out the motives behind the attack as MSM isn't really pushing any political narratives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although I choose to not believe SH was fake, it being fake is much more relevant to that scenario.

       Whether there were victims or not is irrelevant to the conspiracy theories, yes. Many have noted it would have been way easier to shoot people than to fake the whole thing. So arguing whether or not that aspect was real is a waste of energy and can seem disrespectful

       It's a psychological operation. People only have to believe and accept that an atrocity took place.
      </p>
      <p>
       It simply doesn't physically need to occur for people to do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media is fully complicit. It is not there to keep the masses informed of world events; it's there to sell a story for the benefit of whichever group it serves. The story is repeated over and over again, until it's psychologically accepted as fact.

       Youre right that there is a possibility that it was a hoax, but you really need to get away from the internet sources and even the media and just talk to people and you would realize people were shot during this event. I didnt know anyone personally, but a girl from my university was shot and killed.

       I 100% think its possible for the media and agencies to pass off an event as real. But I don't believe that is what happened... entirely. I believe these people are dead but there is a far different truth compared to the story being perpetuated by the media in cooperation with the FBI. Patsy, different shooter(s), arms deal gone awry, Radical Islamic terror attack... hell maybe even mind control all seem more likely (to me) than a hoax.

       I had the same doubts as you, but then I found out that
my brother's work colleague, knows someone - who spoke to someone - who has an American pen pal - who's very chummy with a chap whose cousin was at the concert on that fateful night - who, I was reliably informed, still has a bullets wedged in his left ankle, right knee, spine and brain!
      </p>
      <p>
       Turns out there
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       was a
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       shooter,
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       bullets and
       <em>
        real
       </em>
       victims....
      </p>
      <p>
       Finding that out certainly put my mind at rest....I can tell you.

       If people could just move on from the whole "no one was shot" bull crap it might give the rest of us a foothold. Its possible there are people carrying out these events with assistance AND still actually killing people. 60 people the proverbial drop in the bucket in the grand scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any of these events are indeed government assisted the body count in merely collateral damage and the government clearly has no problems killing their own

       No two people are going to agree on everything; so to block someone for saying

       thing you disagree with is a tad strange.

       I didn't say anything about blockīng people who disagree with me. I block dishonest people &amp; people who no think 2 gud. Saying no one died isn't voicing an opinion, it's displaying a lack of intelligence and/or critical thinking skills. Engaging such peopele, on any topic, is a waste of everyone's time. This is why schools have entrance requirements. The whole world doesn't stop spinning just because a self-styled free thinker wants to spend the day arguing that everything he doesn't understand is part of a scripted soap opera.

       But there are plenty of people who question the validity of
       <em>
        certain
       </em>
       mass casualty events, sure. There are probably mass casualty events  happening every day around the globe; but they don't all make the "news".
When they do, it's for a reason.

      <p>
       "Events" which clearly promote particular agendas certainly need to be questioned. Especially on the

       sub, I would have thought.

       Is it really surprising that people personally affected by events have an opinion on the subject?
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in Sandy Hook. I saw the aftermath (not the bodies can we not go there) in town and it was quite eye opening for me, as it showed how little evidence it takes to get a lot of conspiracy folks calling hoax and perpetuating some stories about the kids not being killed, while defending those beliefs venomously. It would take a ridiculous amount of local cooperation to make 26 locally known people disappear, classes in session in a supposedly closed (school was definitely in session I see the busses in the morning) school, etc etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did I see the actual shooting, of course not. Does it mean there wasn't some kind of operation or agenda behind it, also no. It could have been a planned event for something I guess. But to say it didn't even happen is ridiculous. To visit the parents homes and call them liars is horrendous and inhuman.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really think these black ops groups that would have perpetrated this event, if it was indeed a false flag, have any qualms about killing children, they do it regularly. Maybe not in the US but abroad for sure. Entire villages eradicated. What do they care?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't accept witness testimony from regular people who have no reason to lie, why even bother researching an event? You guys have no prob pointing to some joe shmoe firefighter talking about explosions on 911, but someone who lives in the little town who just got rocked by a mass shooting is a shill?? Confirmation bias works both ways guys.

       Not everyone who questions aspects of the Sandy Hook shooting questions ALL aspects of it. To me there's enough evidence that they're not telling us EVERYTHING openly and transparently about that day. There's a spectrum of what doesn't "feel right" about the story to different people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure - some people might question the entire thing. Just like some people completely believe the events to have taken place the exact way we were told.

       I never thought Sandy Hook was 100% hoax. But I have some serious questions about it. Las Vegas has muddied the waters for me though. I live here, right by MB, and I heard the shots and screams. So, the people who call it all a hoax are obviously frustrating. Although I have lived here all my life, and I do not know a single person effected by the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing how this was handled makes me reconsider aspects of SH. I think both these events shine a bright light on the actual problem. That LEOs lie to us about everything. If they were just honest in the smallest fucking way...ever...it would defuse a lot of the people who think everything is a hoax. But they won't, time after time we are lied to by LEOs and the media. So, the hoax theories are frustrating, but I can't blame anyone for thinking that.

       It's possible they're not actually here to research an event, but rather, to act as a deterrent to those who have first or second-hand information from people who were actually present at (or otherwise affected by) the event.

       Look, i get thar people lost loved ones in LV and Sandy Hook, but goddamn why aren't these people more interested in the truth??!! Why aren't they mad at the coverage?? Or the holes in evidence and timelines?? People...if you lost someone I'm so sorry...i truly am...but that will not stop alot of us from wanting the the truth. Why? Because maybe we can stop something else like this from happening again. Silencing curiosity is denying justice for everyone

       Why is it hard to believe that the government or whoever was behind what happened wouldn't legitimately kill US citizens in order to push an agenda?  Trying to fake an event with 20,000+ people seems rather impossible.  One of my friends was at the concert (survived), and a girl my girlfriend went to high school with was shot in the head and survived but is blind in one eye.
