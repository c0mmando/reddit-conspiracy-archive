       All of these are news sources. So how's the media ignoring this and also reporting it? Are you just upset that they're not sensationalizing the topic? The best way to fight terrorism is to not give them the platform they are looking for. The whole point of a sensational event is to generate press coverage to draw attention to the cause. By covering without comment they are defusing the impact. Another approach would be to give them extraordinary coverage so that they won't feel the need to resort to desperate measures and escalate the attacks. All terrorist attacks are a cry for help and an act of desperation.

       The US Media also consistently ignores Terrorist attacks that occur in Turkey, Lebanon, Indonesia etc. Do you expect the swedish media to cover every gang shooting that happens in the US? The media in the US doesn't even cover every gang shooting that happens in the US.

       I'm really surprised that foreign media does cover the local US events. I really don't understand why. I was just in Sweden until the 10th. So I missed this stuff. But in the hotel I was amazed at how much US TV there was. There was also a Swedish show just like the Batchelor. I couldn't understand any of it but by looking at it it's pretty much the same thing as we get. Including Swedish guys dressing like rappers to look cool.

       Europeans will hate me saying this, but they're kind of strangely obsessed with the US. They know our politics intimately and follow our cultural events more closely than those of their neighboring countries.

       The US military don't defend my interests nor those of the vast majority of Europeans. They defend the interests of an elite that is primarily American, but whose interests coincide to a large extent with elites across the globe, including Europe.

       What kind of incidents are you talking about in France, England and Germany? Due to the sensationalizing by OP, I think you might have gotten the impression that these are some high profile terrorist attacks. One of the links OP posted refers to what is believed to be a fire cracker thrown into a building, another refers to a called in a fake bomb threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       These things aren't really major enough to make international news. It is the same with UK and even many US based stories. search Google for Chippenham explosion or Brighton bomb threat and see if you can find a lot of US media reporting on those.

       Because like everyone said, it's gang related. Not terrorism. The murders are happening against other members of other gangs. It's a gang war. The car killed and hurt several innocent civilians, now that's something to write about. Not gangmember #1 shooting gangmember #2. And still, all this is written about in Swedish newssources. It's not like we don't hear about all these shootings.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I bet you've heard about more car attacks in France than Swedish bombings
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I have heard about exactly 1 car attack in France, it killed 84 people. This is comparable to the car attack in Sweden that killed 5 people and it was heavily reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare this to the "bombings" you linked (one story appears to be about firecracker thrown into a building). They have no causalities, they seem to be mostly gang related in that they don't target people at random. There are lots of similar attacks that go unreported in international media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets take one example you have, the bomb hoax in Lulea, you claim it received to little attention. Rather than compare this to a French attack, I'll compare it to a UK one since I don't know French. The Grand Hotel in Brighton was evacuated over bomb threat last month. Did you hear about it international media? Most likely not, it wasn't notable enough to be reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similarly, none of the stories you gave are especially notable from an international perspective.

       And these are only the incidents we know about. So now we shift the narrative to "gang related". Interesting, I wonder just exactly what culture, conditions, family life, religion, and other variables caused these gangs?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are 6th gen Swedes, financially successful, and great stability, all of a sudden being put under a stress condition that is causing then to form gangs and go posta?
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps it's an externality foisted upon them?
      </p>
      <p>
       We'll just never know. Nothing to see here. If we question any further we might be called something that is literally worse than death, and we can't be thought of as that. Virtue signaling is the height of salvation now. Don't ever forget that.

       Of course it is bad either way, but the title says terrorist bombings which clearly tries to draw the connecting to terror groups such as ISIS. Made further evident by the fact that OP in this thread linking them to ISIS.

       It didn't say 4-5x as many murders. It said 4-5x more fatal shootings. Its also Breitfart that is completely unreliable. Newsflash: The United States has the highest fatal shooting rate in the developed world and it isn't even close.

       Remove a certain population from those stats and this is no longer true.   The same holds true for the problem in Sweden.  Why did Sweden have to import this problem?  It makes no sense to me why you want to take responsibility for this terror.

       People wonder why the UK passed Brexit. The open boarder refugee issue is going to be the cancer that starts world war 3. You allow millions of unvetted migrants refugee status. Those refugees who have come from war torn countries have babies at twice the rate of the local majority. Five years those refugees become citizens. Those citizens apply for EU open border migrant status. They move to any country in the EU they want. Odds are they move to countries with less refugees. Those refugees in return birth more and more. Eventually those who still side with radical Islam decide to push the agenda on their new homes. Twenty to thirty years later you have World War 3. Germany is over thrown by radicals Islam and becomes the headquarters for the movement. The U.K., Russia and US team together to take back Europe. Millions of lives are lost. We can't decide which refugees are radicalized and which aren't. Innocent people are pulled from their houses and vetted. Concentration camps are set up to house all the migrants while they are throughly vetted for ties to Radical terror. EU reevaluates their open border policy.

       I've heard somewhere in a video, a guy describing the future of Sweden... Saying it'll be a 3rd world country in x amount of time, thanks to their open border policy they had.  People who want open borders here in the US just baffle me.  I guess it takes certain people to be a victim before they call for change.

       First I'm hearing of it. Although Sweden seems to be content in their situation. I've seen on Twitter Swedish accounts (or what appear to be) that simply laugh off ANY list or evidence you provide with non-related comebacks or that we are simply falling for Western propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dunno though, 7 bombings in 2 weeks (multiple on the 19th) seems like a real problem Sweden.

       It is a problem, one the politicians and swedish media hardly recognize and do anything about (due to political views and limited resources).
But its hardly terrorism, its gang vs gang or gang vs police, insurance fraud etc as it has always been, just more murders and explosives now.
And as you can see no-one died in these events, only structural damage.

       It's because as far as I've gathered (being a close neighbour of Sweden), many are gang related shootings, and criminals settling scores. Some have even used grenades against opposing gangs. I would guess they apply car bombs as well, but that'll be my speculation for now.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the scenario of some disgruntled individual every now and then, with no specific affiliation with any ideology or having a political agenda that calls in a bomb threat out of personal beef.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what the latter incident/lick suggests. The aim was to clear the entire builiding, there was no bomb, and there weren't many people around. Could be someone with a quarrel.
      </p>
      <p>
       The attack against the bar I would say fits more the M.O, so I wouldn't rule it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It doesn't get coverage internationally in the same sense that I don't hear about specific instances of gang voilence in America or elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not ruling anything out by default because I wouldn't be a good conspiracy theorist otherwise, but this post misleading.

       Islam means to submit to God and live as mohammad says to and did.  Mohammad says lies, steal, rape and kill non-islamists.

       I'm asking for honesty. As in not to have something like this spun towards Islamic terrorism for the sake of intergrating that with a narrative and claiming there's a wave of terrorist incidents in Sweden at this scope and it's somehow not even mentioned.
      </p>

       That's dishonest.

       Well, the lowest classes of the society are often overrepresentated in the criminal communitys, even in a country like Sweden where the lower classes gets alot of help. And right now the recent migrants/refugees are at the bottom of the foodchain.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple of years ago it was the refugees from the balkans that did all the major crimes, but that has decreased as they been integrated into society.

       Although well off, both Denmark and Sweden have had gang problems since I can remember. 90's had a bunch of bazooka attacks, it was mostly Hells Angels and Banditos if I remember correctly. Then eastern European gangs and Turks got added to the mix.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all of course getting turned into ISIS terror attacks being run through the US right wing media grinder. Everything for the narrative.

       Like: Holy crap, murders rose by 10%, so now instead of having 1/5 of the murders per captia compered to the US, they have a staggering of 1/4 of the murders per captia compared to the US. Phew, good thing we don't live there, we would be murdered in an instant.

       I assume all crime should be tolerated by Swedish people, because your country is worse? 
Or are you saying that they are fear mongering? Because I can assure you that crime has gone up as a direct link to letting in unvetted 'guests'.
Why should people have to put up with that? 
Even if only one of them was a thief, it would be one thief too many.

      <p>
       The latter. Sweden should definitely deal with all her own problems nationally and look at rise in crime from a national perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I mean is that there is a lot of fear mongering going on from an international perspective. It feels like Sweden is brought up unproportionally in these cases to be painted as some kind of hellhole; while in reality, things are looking much worse for us in the US.
