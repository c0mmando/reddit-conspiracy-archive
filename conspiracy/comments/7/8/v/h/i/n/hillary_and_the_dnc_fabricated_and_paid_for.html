       With groups like ANTIFA and BLM turning violent, do you agree then, with the context of the Hillary/DNC dossier, that the political left used Trump Russia to cause more division and cause more hate among, not just Americans but others in the world?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 1: The political left say Trump is dividing the country. BUT, with Hillary DNC paying for the fake dossier, it is them dividing the country. Let me point out, Trump is a
       <strong>
        duly and legally elected president
       </strong>
       and they are telling everyone that he is dividing the country because of golden showers and Putin helped him become POTUS. Get my point?
      </p>
      <p>
       EDIT 2: It is the political left making up stories, as we can gather from the bizarre obtainment of the dossier. So how can you trust anything they say? Look at this objectively.

       Technically it was  fabricated, I mean it did not just spontaneously appear. Oh and the progressive agenda is dead so yes by your definition he is destroying the country. Well at least the socialist utopia you envisioned.

       So he just picked up the dossier? It was laying on the floor? Yeah get a dictionary please, to collect means gather or pick up this means it already exists. To fabricate means create or make since the dossier did not exist before Steele he fabricated it. He may have collected information but he used that to fabricate the dossier. This is an apple.....facts first! Lol

       Meh.  The dossier was most likely originally financed by someone in the GOP during the primaries.  Many speculate that it was Jeb! who helped pay for it originally.  After he lost the primary, the DNC picked up funding on the dossier.  Plus, many of the items from the dossier have been verified to be true from what I understand, so it's hard to say it's a fabricated report.  The dossier's author is a well respected investigator, and I doubt he would want to tarnish his own image by making up lies.

       I'm from England, and my impression after reading the entire Steele dossier is that it is real. And Trump set out to divide the country. That's his MO. He thrives on conflict because he has no conscience and no morals. He is a despot and would-be dictator. It would be nice to be able to laugh at America's idiot child president, but he is too scary to be funny.

       No, really? How astute of you to spot it. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and suggest that maybe you're a teensy bit biased yourself.

       I think it's you with the language problem. I am not stating anything is true or false, and as a retired journalist I am quite prepared to wait for the outcome of any investigation before making that decision. In the meantime I am allowed an opinion, and that opinion is that the dossier is probably real. If you disagree with that, fine. That's what this sub is here for: Debate.

       not only has it NOT been substantiated - you have an admitted bias.

       And strangest of all not many Democratic people seem to even know the DNC had paid for the investigation to continue.
