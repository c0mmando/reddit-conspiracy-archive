        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With groups like ANTIFA and BLM turning violent, do you agree then, with the context of the Hillary/DNC dossier, that the political left used Trump Russia to cause more division and cause more hate among, not just Americans but others in the world? </p>

<p>EDIT 1: The political left say Trump is dividing the country. BUT, with Hillary DNC paying for the fake dossier, it is them dividing the country. Let me point out, Trump is a <strong>duly and legally elected president</strong> and they are telling everyone that he is dividing the country because of golden showers and Putin helped him become POTUS. Get my point?</p>

<p>EDIT 2: It is the political left making up stories, as we can gather from the bizarre obtainment of the dossier. So how can you trust anything they say? Look at this objectively. </p>

To fabricate means create or make since the dossier did not exist before Steele he fabricated it. He may have collected information but he used that to fabricate the dossier.

<p>it is a fabricated, unsubstantiated piece of shit meant to have the country pull their support from Trump and crown Hillary Clinton.</p>

<p>it failed. they failed. Hillary failed.</p>

<p>that&#39;s what happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Meh.  The dossier was most likely originally financed by someone in the GOP during the primaries.  Many speculate that it was Jeb! who helped pay for it originally.  After he lost the primary, the DNC picked up funding on the dossier.  Plus, many of the items from the dossier have been verified to be true from what I understand, so it&#39;s hard to say it&#39;s a fabricated report.  The dossier&#39;s author is a well respected investigator, and I doubt he would want to tarnish his own image by making up lies. </p>

please link us to ANYTHING that substantiates the material in the &quot;dossier&quot;.</p>

<p>Anything at all.... there has been no proof provided so..... congratulations on believing whatever it is you WANT to believe.</p>

<p>There has been absolutely ZERO proof provided. Words, it&#39;s all just words.</p>
