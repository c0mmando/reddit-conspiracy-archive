Establishing a no fly zone would have prevented the US from handling it&#39;s business and fucking ISIS, all the while escalating the tensions with Russia.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a Korean-American.  My father is originally from Seoul, but my mother fled the the North with her family just before the War in 1948.  Her relatives did not leave and were closed off to the rest of the world after the Korean War ended.  We know from first hand accounts what goes on in NK.  We have family and friends who were allowed to visit NK because we were willing to give money to them (which the gov&#39;t takes a majority of then gives the rest to the actual families).  We heard first-hand what goes on in NK.  How cruel they are.  How you can&#39;t even throw a newspaper away if has a picture of any of the 3 dear leaders.  How someone, somewhere is executed everyday for even being suspected of defecting.</p>

<p>I lived and worked in Korea for 11 years in the late 90&#39;s, early 2000&#39;s.  I even hired some NK defects to work at my business.  And they would talk about what happens there.</p>

<p>So no, American propaganda didn&#39;t teach me these things.  If you don&#39;t believe me, why don&#39;t you look at some interviews of NK defectors on YouTube?  There are plenty.  See what they have to say about NK.</p>

<p>My point in my original post is to say NK is that stupid and would be crazy to attack SK or US or Japan. Because once they do, the coalition including China, Russia and Europe would annihilate them in a week. This is also a fact and fat boy knows it. </p>
