       Love how when Hillary suggested a no fly zones in Syria, she was a warmonger ready to start work war three. But when Trump bombs Syria and threatens war with North Korea, he's just being "tough." It'd hilarious watching blind hypocrites change their convictions every day depending on what Trump recently tweeted.

       Nothing Hilary does nor ever did was for anyone but herself and her masters. Establishing a no fly zone would have prevented the US from handling it's business and fucking ISIS, all the while escalating the tensions with Russia. It would have been the equivalent of entering a literal pissing match during a firefight.

       I'm a Korean-American.  My father is originally from Seoul, but my mother fled the the North with her family just before the War in 1948.  Her relatives did not leave and were closed off to the rest of the world after the Korean War ended.  We know from first hand accounts what goes on in NK.  We have family and friends who were allowed to visit NK because we were willing to give money to them (which the gov't takes a majority of then gives the rest to the actual families).  We heard first-hand what goes on in NK.  How cruel they are.  How you can't even throw a newspaper away if has a picture of any of the 3 dear leaders.  How someone, somewhere is executed everyday for even being suspected of defecting.
      </p>
      <p>
       I lived and worked in Korea for 11 years in the late 90's, early 2000's.  I even hired some NK defects to work at my business.  And they would talk about what happens there.
      </p>
      <p>
       So no, American propaganda didn't teach me these things.  If you don't believe me, why don't you look at some interviews of NK defectors on YouTube?  There are plenty.  See what they have to say about NK.

       Just like we've evolved beyond solving problems with violence and guns; don't say that here though... Too many Americans that still believe they'll be able to achieve more with guns than peaceful protest. It's too big apart of their culture... Obviously that rubs off on military and other people in charge.. NK is definitly not gonna play along though, they've seen what happens with nations that give up their nuclear weapons. Get invaded shortly after...

        NK has threatened to nuke other countries, kidnapped Japanese for spies and has done small attacks on SK. They might not do it, but they sure like threatening that they will . What if they act on it one of these days? They are already being stupid by testing their luck.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       My point in my original post is to say NK is that stupid and would be crazy to attack SK or US or Japan. Because once they do, the coalition including China, Russia and Europe would annihilate them in a week. This is also a fact and fat boy knows it.

       Sorry but the world needs a power like the US around.  Europe had its chance to rule the world and they did nothing but kill each other for Centuries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason why America fights all these "small" Wars and tries to stop Nuclear proliferation is because they are tired of fighting in "Big" Wars they didn't start.

       What other Nation would we be better off with as the World's Preeminent SuperPower?  Russia, China, Germany, Japan or India?  Good luck...

       This whole Team America World Police thing isn't all Glory and Fireworks it's a huge strain on our economy and causes a lot of civil unrest here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes America Profits from it's stake in Middle East Oil but  we have a ton of Oil here between Texas, Alaska, The Gulf of Mexico we have enough Oil we've been the biggest Exporter of Oil in the World for the last few years when people started getting upset with these Wars were fighting that are never going to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are always going to be Wars especially in the Middle East we didn't start this it's been happening since recorded history basically.  Just know what ever Country takes over as the next Leading World Power is going to inherit all of our problems these things are going away.
