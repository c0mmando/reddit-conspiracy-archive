        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I have watched quite a few documentaries lately and I went pretty deep. </p>

<p>With that being said I am pretty much convinced there is something huge about Egypt that the world is hiding from us. I don’t know exactly what it is per say but the fact that the elite base their entire lives on their ancient practices and the pyramids/obelisks etc. there has to be something they know that we haven’t exactly come across right? They still lead us to believe that they have no idea how the pyramids were made ? I think that’s bullshit obviously but why is it they surround everything they do around these things? </p>

<p>It makes me sad because as a kid I loved ancient Egyptian history so much.  It was always my favorite thing to learn or write papers about and the more I research the more this place stand outs to me as a big question mark. They obviously lie to us in the history books but how far did they lie to us about this place exactly. </p>

<p>Maybe there is more to find out as to why the elite worship this place etc. and I haven’t come across it yet but the fact that the Vegas shooting happened across from the Luxor (pyramid) with the obelisk directly across from it I truly believe was done on purpose. 
I watched <a href="https://youtu.be/rHi-1PJsgbI">this video</a> and he breaks down how “terror attacks” always seem to happen around a pyramid and obelisk and he backs it up with pictures &amp; info etc. </p>

<p>We have the pyramids everywhere but specifically our money which is weird. I know the Illuminati love this symbol but why are they so obsessed with it?  Also this led me to Washington DC where I learned that the streets and positions of literally everything have been perfectly placed and mapped out to be entirely satanic symbols and meanings (including the famous obelisk). And once you see the streets you can’t unsee that and it’s so obvious I can’t believe more people don’t know about this. </p>

<p>Sorry if I’m rambling and if I have missed a lot of stuff but I know if I post in here it’s the best place to get answers quickly. Also feel free to DM if you have better sites or something where I can find more info. Thanks- </p>

<p>Depends what you mean. I agree that there are those in power who base many beliefs on systems developed in Egypt, but they are not the first civilization and form a part of this cohesive philosophy, in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but the fact that the elite base their entire lives on their ancient practices</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not just Egypt. The history of Magick begins in Sumeria and Babylon, then through Egypt and eventually to the West. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>They still lead us to believe that they have no idea how the pyramids were made ? I think that’s bullshit obviously </p>
</blockquote>

<p>IN ways yes and no. I agree it&#39;s bullshit, but there is also ltos of mainstream academia that believes these questions are answered already, or close to it. The most recent proposal I saw was an internal ramp which could be tested for by analyzing the corners of the Pyramid to check for hollow spaces, some of which were found in preliminary investigations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe there is more to find out as to why the elite worship this place etc</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Egypt has always been seen as a place of reverence and wisdom, even by the Greeks and Romans. Plato claimed Solon received the story of Atlantis from Egyptian priests. Roman Aristocrats toured Egypt because it was already a <em>very</em> ancient land by the time Rome was even founded, let alone gained its empire.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We have the pyramids everywhere but specifically our money which is weird. I know the Illuminati love this symbol but why are they so obsessed with it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Symbolism and Numerology have their origins in ancient Astrology, Augery, and Divination. Here are a couple of links to get you started: </p>

<p>Occult Numerology and symbolism primer- <a href="http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1766.cfm">http://www.cuttingedge.org/news/n1766.cfm</a></p>

<p>Masonic Numerology and Occult symbolism primer, overlaps somewhat with the previous link- <a href="http://www.whale.to/b/duke.html">http://www.whale.to/b/duke.html</a></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Don&#39;t apologize, you are on the journey for knowledge and Truth along with the rest of us, though I caution against your idea that answers come quickly. Anyone who says they can give you the Truth in a reddit post or comment run down are liars, as we are all on this journey still. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll provide some quick links below that I have come across in my own research into Magick, and the traditions associated with it with roots in Egypt and beyond as well as important deities and figures associated with this like Hermes Trismigestus and Thoth. (using some copypasta from previous comments of mine)</p>

<p>This is the wiki entry for Hermeticism, a fantastic place for anyone who wishes to begin investigating the ideas surrounding Hermes Trismigestus, the Mystery Schools, and more-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism</a></p>

<p>This is a good primer for Gnosis and also dives in to Hermetic magick- <a href="http://gnosis.org/hermes.htm">http://gnosis.org/hermes.htm</a></p>

<p>Here is a link to start research on Thoth, the Egyptian god of writing and Magick, who was also associated with Hermes in the Greek Mythological tradition. <a href="http://www.crystalinks.com/thoth.html">http://www.crystalinks.com/thoth.html</a></p>

<p>Here is a primer from wiki on Crowleys&#39; definition of Magick and a rundown of this Thelema, an absolutely essential piece to understanding the modern Occult- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Thelema)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magick_(Thelema)</a></p>

<p>Also, for modern Magick systems like Enochian, it is best to start with John Dee and Edward Kelley.</p>

<p>Here is a place to start on John Dee, the man responsible for &quot;channeling&quot; the instructions to Enochian Summoning Magick, which is utilized by Mediums and anyone who is serious about communicating with other spiritual entities. He worked part in parcel with the Medium Edward Kelly in their attempts to discover this Magick system- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee</a></p>

<p>Here is the wiki on Edward Kelly- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Kelley</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>No not at all haha. I have never been into aliens but I am pretty convinced that aliens don’t exist and Area 51 has nothing to do with aliens but much deeper and probably where all the sick shit in our world happens.  And if aliens do exist I don’t think they have come to our earth yet and our government wants us to get caught up with it because it distracts us from the real shit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like that movie where they have to sacrifice a bunch of people every year to the gods to keep them happy (I forget the name)?</p>

<p>Ritual sacrifice has been around for a long time, and we seemingly find evidence for it in alot of past civilizations...</p>

<p>Almost like... Some force expects blood to be shed near an obelisk? Put it on money, now people who kill to steal money are technically contributing to the cause...</p>

<p>Yeah, you&#39;ve taken me pretty deep here lol</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mannnn, this, this, this, so much of this, and this and this and this. Ancient knowledge is fascinating. They knew some shit and their secrets have remained secrets. The fact that all of these sites align geographically with Egypt in the dead center is ridiculous as well. And the supposed connection in Shakespeare&#39;s Sonnets and encoding it&#39;s title page with all of the dimensions expressed in the Pyramid like pi, phi, e, etc. Would love to know what the ancients knew. </p>

<p>With that being said I am pretty much convinced there is something huge about Egypt that the world is hiding from us.<br/>
If by world you mean Zahi Hawass, then yeah you&#39;re right. He&#39;s halting everything regarding Egyptian excavation, so until he&#39;s dead good luck with the mainstream actually making progress in Egyptology(shitty no nothing field atm with no real backing).</p>

<p>If you mark all the known pyramids on a map of the earth, they form sort of a grid pattern.</p>

<p>Egypt is where much of our history begins. There&#39;s a ton of alien theories on that, which I find absolutely fascinating.</p>
