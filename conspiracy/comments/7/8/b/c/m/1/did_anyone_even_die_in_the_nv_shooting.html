       I have seen so many videos of the shooting from many different angles and I never saw one person appear to be shot or trampled. The more I look at these videos, the fewer people I see. It appears that maybe 200 people are standing around at the time of the shooting. It reminds me of when I went to the MTV Sports and music festival (20 years ago) and there were a few hundred people standing around. I was amazed to see it air several months later to show a full crowd of thousands. So, I know there are panning tricks to make venues look full. The more I think about it, I haven't seen one bullet wound from a survivor. I've see bandages, but those can be covered up. I saw a botched video of a guy trying to help the dead, but all the blood is misplaced and looks very fake. Now, Harvey Weinstein has attracted all attention away from this event and it seems like Mandalay Bay never happened.

       I have not seen any convincing evidence of deaths. I have also not seen a plausible explanation of what was happening at the 17 hospitals involved, if there were indeed no gunshot victims.

       Very good question. They wouldn't need to be in on it. They'd all believe the worst victims went somewhere else.

       Eh, I don't buy that. Hospitals talk to each other, staff work at both places, rumours would spread too easily for zero patients from the shooting to not go to any of the local hospitals.

       No, all hospitals in the area coordinate which level of injury goes where. They have to so that if someone shows up at their er they can direct them to the proper place. Not every er is a trauma center and equipped to handle gunshot wounds or other severely critical injuries.

       You think all the Facebook memorials involving thousands of real people are ALL fake??
      </p>
      <p>
       You must be from a shitty little town in the middle of no where. Seems like anyone in a big city could ask around and themselves find a REAL person that knows someone personally who died.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm from San Diego and I personally knew a victim... Jennifer Irvine. She wasn't a personal friend of mine so I won't pretend to be personally hear broken by it, but I've met her twice and we have mutual friends who I also know are real.

       Another one of my former classmates was there but she survived.

       You won't see any evidence that can confirm anything. They have presented the story and it is up to the public to choose which they believe because we will never get any more on the subject. This is how I know it is fake. Everything afterwards the "families" that will go on tour talking about how it affected their life will milk the public for every dime they are willing to give. New laws will be put into place to prevent these types of things, then another event and new families will be affected and some more laws need to fix it will be need. Nevermind that we have the FBI, NSA, Homeland security, CIA and all these other intelligency networks. Which have unfettered amounts of acccess to personal details of each and every citizen in this country. Supposedly they can't keep us safe. But let us give them more money so they can still keep doing a piss poor job at keeping this country safe. They are the producers of their own enemy. Just like the war on drugs creates its own enemy. Rather than help people they want to control them.

       Okay. Don't let my thoughts on the matter take away from that. They are simply thoughts, I am not going to pretend I don't have them. I also won't be afraid to share them either. If there was indeed deaths than my thoughts don't affect the situation. They certainly can't change the situation either. Unless they have merit in their own right that is.

       Okay, I see you assume I'm just taking the words of alternative media and didn't arrive to this conclusion. While alternative media might have played a role in helping me dig into the subject a bit further, it wasn't what lead me to my conclusion. It is a multitude of reasons as to how I arrived to my conclusion. Perhaps some are no doubt leaps of faith on my own judgment and discernment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sorry you feel disgusted, given the current state of affairs in media, alternative or otherwise. It is a circus out there. You can choose which clown shows you what but most assuredly they are all clowns.

       Yes. People did die. Real people who were important to other communities died and left their families to fend for themselves.

       None of the dead were public figures as far as I know, so their funerals generally wouldn't be newsworthy. You'd be most likely to find information about funerals in the victims' local newspapers, or from families' social media posts.

       You could be right.  I was just curious if it is a significant omission.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the lack of videos of Paddock checking into the hotel is significant.  There are also no videos so far of him hauling up all that luggage.  It makes me think the video does not exist.  After all, I believe we got video of the 9/11 hijackers going through airport security pretty quickly.

       Well, airport security video is property of the gov't, whereas casino security video is property of the casino. That may explain why the former was released publicly much faster than the latter. MGM isn't exactly incentivized to show the world a mass murderer strolling through their lobby. The police probably can't just release private video without permission.

       That is a good point.  I have been hearing stories that the police confiscated a lot of the security video.  That also makes me suspicious.

       No, not really. Or, yes, the whole thing is strange, but it should be. There are posts sometimes showing video of victims reacting in a way that the poster thinks is unusual or inappropriate, and my internal reaction to that is always, "how is a person supposed to act in that situation? How do we even know what normal looks like?" The hotel footage is the same to me: I have no baseline to compare this against.

       I was in Vegas a couple weeks ago...the concert venue still had all these parked cars from that night, abandoned by the victims who owned them. This was like a week after the massacre...the idea of all these dead peoples' cars still out there was so odd, even though it makes perfectly logical sense. It's just not something I would have thought of. It's all very surreal.

       Wow.  That is strange and surreal.  You would think they would make arrangements to get the cars home.

       I was involved in a random shooting and it is not what people expect.  It is not like in the movies.  First of all, you have no idea what is going on.  When you begin to realize it, you do not want to believe it.  Then you want things to go back to the way they were before.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I see shootings on video, I understand why people react the way they do.

       Being on the receiving end of an ambush is the most difficult situation to be in, even for trained military personel.

       I saw a quick "after the break..." type of thing of a local guy who died. I wasn't really watching it, but they showed a quick shot of the vigil the community had for him.

       I see.  I would think there would be pretty extensive coverage.  It is the deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in the US.  Like I said, I have not been paying attention to the MSM coverage of it, so maybe they were covering more than I suspect.

       Regarding why hospitals arent saying anything. Its because its protocol, they dont and never will give out patient confidentiality and information. You enter the hospital as a patient and you are to be given anonymity for whatever you are there for.

       No, all hospitals in the area coordinate which level of injury goes where. They have to so that if someone shows up at their er they can direct them to the proper place. Not every er is a trauma center and equipped to handle gunshot wounds or other severely critical injuries.
