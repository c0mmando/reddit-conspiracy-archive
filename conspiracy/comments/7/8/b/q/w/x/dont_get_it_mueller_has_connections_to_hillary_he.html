<p>Edit 1: Yes, one of the comments got me thinking. He was FBI director 2 weeks before 9/11. Some alluded that he was placed there to do a clean up of that information coming in. So with that in context, and because of current events, is he NOW cleaning house? </p>

<p>Edit 2: By Rocksolid1111 &quot;Why was the Podesta story pushed by the MSM today but Uranium One was ignored?&quot;</p>

<p>Edit 3: Are the Podestas going to be the high profile fall guys to take heat off most of them?</p>

<p>Yet she has just had Perez purge 4 Bernie appointed members of the DNC Executive Rules Committee, and replaced them with the likes of the cheater Donna Brazille. Your language here betrays you.

<p>Nope, that&#39;s <em>your</em> side. <em>You</em>, and HRC, and all of her sycophantic supporters, started this party civil war. You are still attacking Bernie and his allies and voter base. I can&#39;t wait for you Neoliberal centrists to go away permanently to the dustbin of history. I welcome your hatred. I am a proud Progressive Populist and will continue to fight you and your corrupt Neoliberal Centrist Establishment party until there is nothing left but ashes and the People regain control and return the Party to its New Deal roots.

<p>Lol you&#39;ve disagreed with a few and you&#39;ve criticized Trump a few times.

<p>Nope I&#39;m not a Clinton supporter but go ahead and tell me who I support. Clinton lost, she&#39;s out and she&#39;s not coming back. Bringing her up over and over again is meaningless. Lmao you can sling whatever buzz words you want and pretend for as long you want you support Bernie but people are not as dumb as you. They will not be fooled by your shitty attempts to sow division.

</blockquote>

<p>So of the dozens of submissions I have made, you refer to four of them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>shilling for bannon</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are referencing this post? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/63mk83/steve_bannon_removed_from_national_security/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/63mk83/steve_bannon_removed_from_national_security/</a></p>

<p>Hardly shilling, more like pointing out that a key leader of Trumps base, which he was elected on, was being forced out of the inner circle. Seems pretty significant to me considering this showed the ascendancy of the Kushner/Ivanka wing, and their Goldman appointed friends, like Gary Cohn and Mnunchin. I don&#39;t have to support Bannon to see he was a check against these forces in his own way.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>posting garbage about deep state coming after Trump</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, you mean this post? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5tonsj/the_spy_revolt_against_trump_begins/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5tonsj/the_spy_revolt_against_trump_begins/</a></p>

<p>It was some pretty significant speculation at the time, and it&#39;s no secret that the Alphabet agencies and the entrenched bureaucracy do not like Trump, as evidenced by the leaks and their own statements. It&#39;s not &quot;supporting Trump&quot; to point out the fact that it&#39;s a <em>major fucking issue</em> that elements of the government are openly hindering a democratically, constitutionally elected president. This isn&#39;t about defending Trump, it&#39;s about seeing the incredible attack on the office of the Presidency itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>talking about democrats want apparently want to move on from Russia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this post? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nu9vm/some_on_the_left_want_democrats_to_move_on_from/">https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nu9vm/some_on_the_left_want_democrats_to_move_on_from/</a></p>

<p>Sorry, but I don&#39;t believe the Russia narrative. It has always been a convenient excuse to ignore the fact that HRC abandoned <em>key Democratic Constituencies</em> in states like Michigan and Wisconsin with her ties to NAFTA, TPP, TPIP, TISA, CAFTA, and more. Or that she didn&#39;t campaign more than a handful of times in either state after the convention. Her hubris and career failures allowed her to lose to a reality TV star that she and the DNC helped create with their pied piper strategy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t give a shit about labels I&#39;ll judge you by your posts and it&#39;s clear you&#39;re a right winger.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve clearly not spent enough time reading what I&#39;ve said lol. You cherry pick examples that don&#39;t even prove your point.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Glad your only support of him seems to be posts trying to drive a wedge between democrats. Not suspicious at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your focus on &quot;dividing the party&quot;, and &quot;driving a wedge between Democrats&quot; is suspicious. Why are you defending a Party that is corrupt and unresponsive to the People? Why are you claiming that those who speak up against this corruption and demand better politicians and a more leftward policy are conservatives?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lol a few Keith Ellison supporters were removed. That&#39;s disappointing but hardly means there is a fight for the soul of the DNC going on no matter how badly you want that to be true</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wrong in every regard. These position were meant as a compromise to the base of the party and they brought significance because of their oversight and power over the 2018 and 2020 primaries. This is a power play by the Establishment Wing to take back what little control they gave. And it&#39;s a slap in the face when they are choosing Donna Brazille as a replacement, and they know it. The fight for the soul of the party began in the 2016 primaries and the Establishment has guaranteed there will be party civil war. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Clinton lost, she&#39;s out and she&#39;s not coming back. Bringing her up over and over again is meaningless. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clinton and her donor base still wield significant power, as does Obama and his. This can be shown in Kamala Harris&#39; hiring several former Clinton staffers and her time spent in the Hamptons with major Hillary donors.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lmao you can sling whatever buzz words you want and pretend for as long you want you support Bernie but people are not as dumb as you. They will not be fooled by your shitty attempts to sow division</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People are very smart, and see exactly what you&#39;re doing. I am not the one sowing division, it is the Establishment and people like you that have guaranteed there will be a fight.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You&#39;re side is so pathetic not only do you rely on fake news but you have to make up personas trying to sow discord. Republicans are such a fucking mess they control all three branches and can&#39;t even pass their legislative agenda lmao</p>

<p>Oh he does. He knows <em>exactly</em> what he&#39;s doing. They say this bullshit in the hopes that people wont respond.

<p>The difference between some of us in this sub and the rest is that we wouldn&#39;t mind if Mueller tossed a whole lot of both parties into the clink. Clean them out. But this sub now mostly cares about pretending democrats are the corrupt ones and Republicans are just victims of the deep state, despite the fact that the Republican party is much more the party of corporate power, military industrial complex, and big oil.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>“The classified cable released by WikiLeaks was authored by Hillary Clinton’s State Department on August 17th, 2009.  In the cable it states –</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“‘Over two years ago Russia requested a ten-gram sample of highly enriched uranium (HEU) seized in early 2006 in Georgia during a nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices. The seized HEU was transferred to U.S. custody and is being held at a secure DOE facility. In response to the Russian request, the Georgian Government authorized the United States to share a sample of the material with the Russians for forensic analysis.’</p>

<p>“The cable also states that, ‘Given Russia’s reluctance to act so far, FBI Mueller’s delivery of this sample will underscore to Russia our commitment to follow through on this case.’  It continues in stating, ‘Embassy Moscow is requested to alert at the highest appropriate level the Russian Federation that FBI Director Mueller plans to deliver the HEU sample once he arrives to Moscow on September 21.’</p>

<p>“Of all people, why would the Head of the FBI be selected to transfer uranium to Russia?  It would seem that the US has a number of individuals who could perform this transfer and it would seem that FBI Director Mueller would have enough on his plate in the US.  When Mueller couldn’t make the transfer in April the transfer was postponed to September so Mueller could be there.”</p>

So since they thought that was a sure thing, they went hands-off and let it happen, and have been kicking themselves ever since.</p>

<p>Check out which states these are. Spot a pattern? People who study gerrymandering can tell you statistically that its much worse in Republican controlled states. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No he wasn&#39;t, he had zero connection. Your side is pathetic and it shows with its reliance on fake news. </p>

<p>Bullshit, you&#39;re a right wing loon. Your &quot;I&#39;m a Bernie bro&quot; is so easy to see through I can&#39;t believe you think people fall for it. The only thing you&#39;ve posted in support of Bernie is attacking the DNC. We all get the DNC fucked over Bernie. Dws is out and Clinton lost. The Dems are going to move forward from that by embracing Bernie with open arms. Your side can try to push division within the Democrats all you want but people will see it for what it is </p>

<p>He is connected, via his FBI tenure and that he was explicitly stated in the email leaks to have been involved, but keep obfuscating LOL.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Noice. You are ignorant if you believe that. Throughout many of my posts I have elucidated my thoughts on politics, socioeconomics, and human society. I have argued vociferously with Conservatives and Trump supporters. You are utterly pathetic at attempting to paint me as otherwise LOL. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>LOL. Can you cite any examples from my post history from which you can ascertain this, fool? Oh wait...you can&#39;t. LMAO. Sorry that your preferred Neoliberal Corporatist candidate HRC lost because she was a terribly candidate and a terribly person. I proudly voted Bernie in the Primary and wrote his name in on Election Day.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yet she has just had Perez purge 4 Bernie appointed members of the DNC Executive Rules Committee, and replaced them with the likes of the cheater Donna Brazille. Your language here betrays you. The fight for the soul of the Party continues, and they fucking <em>hate</em> Bernie and the Progressives LMAO. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Nope, that&#39;s <em>your</em> side. <em>You</em>, and HRC, and all of her sycophantic supporters, started this party civil war. You are still attacking Bernie and his allies and voter base. I can&#39;t wait for you Neoliberal centrists to go away permanently to the dustbin of history. I welcome your hatred. I am a proud Progressive Populist and will continue to fight you and your corrupt Neoliberal Centrist Establishment party until there is nothing left but ashes and the People regain control and return the Party to its New Deal roots. Try harder, fool. </p>
