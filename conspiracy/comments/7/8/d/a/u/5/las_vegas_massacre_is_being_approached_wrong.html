        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It’s a fact that the FBI has the most to lose due to the MGM having video evidence. It’s likely to think the FBI can delete the video evidence easily, but consider something first. The MGM has a ton to lose if the official timeline does not coincide with their story. If the FBI and LVPD timeline contradicts the MGM timeline, then they are opening the MGM to possibly being sued, or fined or some form of punishment for lack of awareness. The fact that the timeline changed against the favor of the MGM back to “ the MGM was right all along” proves that they have leverage over the FBI. What else happened in that hotel room we possibly won’t ever know, but we have to pressure the MGM to release information/tapes and not the LVPD/FBI.  </p>

If you&#39;ve planning an attack on a big festival like Route 91 or Rock on the Range or Lalapolooza etc you know the most casualties are gonna be at the end of the night when the biggest stars are on and the most people are present. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any ballistics data yet? Op, have you seen any video that clearly shows any <em>real</em> bullets striking anything? There&#39;s no evidence that suggests this was anything other than a hoax. No screaming relatives or angry parents at the site. Two of the nationally highlighted &quot;victims&quot; I looked into ended up dead ends. I won&#39;t name people, but the one local news report of a man who &quot;died&quot; in vegas and his parents&#39; news interview with dry-eyes and no emotion - this after hearing their son was shot dead by machine gunfire less than 24 hrs ago. Just two boomers lousy with dupers delight &quot;sad&quot; about their son&#39;s passing. wtf? Anyway, after the 10/3 final report on this guy, it&#39;s ghost time. Nothing. After another round of heavy research, no further local or national reports on this person. No obit, no funeral info. Nothing. Just poof. hmm</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s also plenty of video evidence, along with the &quot;End of Watch&quot; radio call for Officer Hartfield. That alone proves to me it wasn&#39;t a hoax, because you don&#39;t involved a dead police officer in your hoax. The people that would have perpetrated the hoax are still people, and thus still want to spend as little money as possible to make it work. Why &quot;kill&quot; a &quot;cop&quot;? You&#39;re now having to finance that cover up in addition to the original, and if the LVMPD are in on it you&#39;re paying OT for the whole department, <em>lots</em> of highway patrol, Henderson PD and North Las Vegas PD officers to manage traffic, show up at the funeral, be involved in the motorcade/procession, block intersections around the procession route, etc. </p>

<p>An on duty cop getting shot while responding? Sure. That makes sense. Gotta sell it as a real event. An off duty cop losing his life? Why? Just knock the total down to 57 dead and don&#39;t include him. Saves you tons of money, tons of headache, and doesn&#39;t lead to LVMPD actually trying to solve this case because they lost one of their own. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adelson owns the <em>Las Vegas Review-Journal</em>. He purchased it in December 2015 in a notoriously <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/12/16/sheldon-adelson-bought-the-las-vegas-review-tribune/">shady deal</a>. </p>

<p>For the past three weeks, the <em>Las Vegas Review-Journal</em> has been publishing heartwarming stories about shooting victims, sympathetic human interest stories on the LVMPD and FBI, and hit pieces on MGM, with the occasional Stephen Paddock update. </p>

<p>But even prior to the shooting, Adelson&#39;s newspaper (the #1 newspaper in Nevada, since before he purchased it), was publishing MGM hit pieces, such as this one in late August: <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/opinion/opinion-columns/wayne-allyn-root/commentary-mgms-ceo-risks-angering-many-of-his-customers/">&quot;MGM’s CEO risks angering many of his customers&quot;</a>. Quick excerpt from that article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Not because of his personal views. I don’t care about them. It’s a free country. But no CEO should involve his company in controversial politics, let alone the funding of extreme and radical organizations. Murren has just put MGM in bed with an organization that has ties to Islamic terrorism.</em></p>

<p><em>Does MGM’s board approve of the CEO using company statements and shareholder money to offend 63 million Trump voters? How about every conservative in America? How about Christian customers? Families with children? How about anyone who is not a fan of Hamas or the Muslim Brotherhood?</em></p>

<p><em>Because I am certain millions of MGM customers will be shocked when they find out to whom Murren has tied his company.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Might be worth mentioning here that Sheldon Adelson has been the largest US political donor, of any party, in both the 2012 and 2016 presidential campaigns, and was the largest donor to Donald Trump&#39;s 2016 presidential campaign with a total of $25 million. (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/23/sheldon-adelson-trump-super-pac-donation-25-million">Source</a>)</p>

<p>And on the day after the LV shooting – <em>the very next day</em>  –  Adelson met with Trump at the White House in a <em>pre-arranged meeting</em> to discuss policy. From Adelson-owned newspaper, the <em>Las Vegas Review Journal</em>&#39;s article <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/adelsons-meet-with-trump-discuss-las-vegas-shooting/">&quot;Adelsons meet with Trump, discuss Las Vegas shooting&quot;</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>The afternoon meeting was pre-arranged and set to discuss policy, said Andy Abboud, who serves as senior vice president of Government Relations for the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino and the Las Vegas Sands Corp.</em></p>

<p><em>But the Adelsons and Trump also discussed the shooting and what they might do to help victims, he said.</em></p>

<p><em>The Adelsons, who have donated generously to Trump and his campaigns, also wanted to meet Trump’s new chief of staff, John Kelly, he said.</em></p>

<p><em>Son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, whose portfolio includes the president’s dream of brokering a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, also attended the meeting, Abboud said. The Adelsons reportedly have been disappointed in Trump’s failure to keep a campaign pledge to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem on his first day in office.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Adelson also owns the Israeli daily newspaper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Hayom"><em>Israel Hayom</em></a>. </p>

<p>What <em>doesn&#39;t</em> Adelson own? The LV shooter&#39;s perch. MGM owns that. </p>

<p>He also doesn&#39;t own the venue where concertgoers were massacred. MGM owns that.</p>

<p>Nor does he own ANY of the properties where people reported shots fired/spotted on Oct. 1. But you know who owns most of them? That&#39;s right: MGM! (Mandalay Bay, Aria, Bellagio, MGM Grand, New York-New York, Luxor, Delano)</p>

<p>Meanwhile there were NO shots reported at Adelson&#39;s properties (The Venetian, Sands) or <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/adelson-wynn-make-forbes-list-of-top-business-minds/">bff Steve Wynn&#39;s</a> property (The Wynn, Encore). </p>

<p>Oh, I forgot to mention that one of Adelson&#39;s first orders of business as new owner of the <em>Las Vegas Review-Journal</em> was to <a href="http://gawker.com/las-vegas-review-journal-columnist-resigns-after-paper-1773198376">prohibit the publication&#39;s journalists from writing about him or Steve Wynn</a>. </p>

<p>The same Steve Wynn who went on Fox News after the shooting and <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/10/08/steve_wynn_we_profile_or_inspect_or_examine_everybody_that_enters_the_building.html">threw &quot;his friends&quot; at MGM under the bus</a> and boasted about his hotels&#39; military-grade protection (which is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/75c2a9/dhs_is_the_worst_agency_to_possibly_ever_protect/do5048q/">a whole other rabbit hole</a>). </p>

<p>Then MGM abducted Jesus Campos right before his scheduled interview with Sean Hannity (on Fox News) and later places him on the MGM-sponsored <em>Ellen</em> show, where Ellen announces that this will be the first and only time Campos will ever speak about that night. </p>

<p>And there&#39;s a lot more that I haven&#39;t included here. This is based on the research I&#39;ve been conducting and compiling for the past couple of weeks, based on hunches I got from the Bill Young article, the Steve Wynn interview, the lopsided <em>Review-Journal</em> reporting, and even the Kaya Jones stuff. And all roads led to Sheldon Adelson (which, ironically, is what MegaAnon predicted 3 weeks before the shooting) but I haven&#39;t shared yet because I&#39;m still fact-checking, sourcing and organizing. </p>

<p>But what I know for sure is: Sheldon Adelson bought the #1 newspaper in Nevada to control the Las Vegas narrative. Then he bought the presidency to control policy (and in particular, foreign policy with Israel). And now, if MGM gets sued for billions over this shooting and ends up bankrupts, who do you think is gonna swoop in and buy the whole damn strip (or, at the very least, broker the metal detector deal for the whole strip)? My guess: Sheldon Adelson.</p>
