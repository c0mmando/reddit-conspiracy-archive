<p>“Divide and rule, weaken and conquer, love and enslave, these are three tenets of politics” </p>

<p>― Bangambiki Habyarimana, The Great Pearl of Wisdom*</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>We are most likely all familiar with the divide and conquer tactic:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_conquer</a></p>

<p>Yet, even in a conspiracy forum, where we should be aware of this tactic, we fall prey to this tactic. Urban dictionary says it well:</p>

<p>“The people were so busy arguing about racism, they failed to notice they were slaves.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/tags.php?tag=divide%20and%20conquer">https://www.urbandictionary.com/tags.php?tag=divide%20and%20conquer</a></p>

<p>I would like to examine the divide and conquer tactics that lead us away from the truth constantly.</p>

<p><strong>Divided by the Details</strong></p>

<p>Before I go into the obvious stuff, I find it amazing that we are all divided by the details of conspiracy-related incidents. I’m a big picture kind of person, and I have realized that even if I do not know the ultimate truth about JFK, for example, I know that the mainstream media’s representation of the event is not accurate. I will likely never, ever know the whole truth (even if they do release all of the files), but there is enough evidence to conclude that is a conspiracy, and something is <em>very</em> wrong with the big picture. In fact, the majority of Americans believe JFK was killed in some type of conspiracy plot:</p>

<p><a href="http://news.gallup.com/poll/165893/majority-believe-jfk-killed-conspiracy.aspx">http://news.gallup.com/poll/165893/majority-believe-jfk-killed-conspiracy.aspx</a></p>

<p>But what happens on conspiracy forums? We are divided by the details. Let me give you more examples:</p>

<p><em>9/11</em> - Planes, bombs, or no planes at all? In the end, we may never know the truth, but most of all know there is enough evidence that there is something extremely shady behind the events…or at least half of us anyway, if we can trust Huffington Post:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/half-of-americans-believe-911-conspiracy-theories_us_5804ec04e4b0e8c198a92df3">https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/half-of-americans-believe-911-conspiracy-theories_us_5804ec04e4b0e8c198a92df3</a></p>

<p><em>Vegas Shooting</em> - Crisis actors? Real deaths? Multiple shooters? Most of us have investigated enough to know that something is up with the Vegas shooting, even if we cannot all agree on all the details. Again, we may never know the ultimate truth, but most of us agree that there is a larger agenda behind the shooting (and even then there is a debate).</p>

<p><em>Sandy Hook</em> - Crisis Actors? Weird parents? Fake school? Again, we may never know all of the details, but most of us agree that there was just something really off about Sandy Hook (like how the school website had no internet activity?):</p>

<p><a href="https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2015/09/09/sandy-hook-hoax-6-signs-that-school-was-closed-before-massacre/">https://fellowshipoftheminds.com/2015/09/09/sandy-hook-hoax-6-signs-that-school-was-closed-before-massacre/</a></p>

<p>Whatever you believe,  in the end, there was something really, really wrong about the Sandy Hook incident, and again, we all ask ourselves, what is the larger agenda?</p>

<p>I can do this with just about any conspiracy. The point is most of us agree on the big picture stuff, but when it comes to the details, we are divided. In my opinion, this is just another technique to keep us moving forward.</p>

<p>We may never know the ultimate truth, but we have enough evidence to put together the pieces that something is just not right. What is the common theme with all of these events, even if we cannot agree on the details?</p>

<p>As for the people who do not believe any of this stuff is conspiracy, well then why are they here anyway? ;) (I have an answer but I won&#39;t say!)</p>

<p><em>Everything we know is wrong</em></p>

<p><strong>Division is Everywhere</strong></p>

<p>Even if we hypothetically agreed on all of those conspiracies, we are divided in every other way.</p>

<p><em>Black vs. white (race)</em> - This one is classic. On most conspiracy boards, there are people who instigate race wars.  Interestingly, I see many posts about the whites hating the blacks and the blacks hating the whites (and whatever combination you want to insert here), but I never hear about hatred for the 8 people who have the same wealth as the world’s poorest half:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/15/global-inequality-oxfam-report/96545438/">https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/01/15/global-inequality-oxfam-report/96545438/</a></p>

<p><em>Man vs. woman (sex)</em> </p>

<p>The conspiracy is that the CIA infiltrated the feminist movement to further divide society:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rense.com/general21/hw.htm">http://www.rense.com/general21/hw.htm</a></p>

<p>And it has worked! Men are going their own way:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Going_Their_Own_Way">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Men_Going_Their_Own_Way</a></p>

<p>Less are getting married:</p>

<p><a href="http://theconversation.com/why-are-fewer-people-getting-married-60301">http://theconversation.com/why-are-fewer-people-getting-married-60301</a></p>

<p>There are (and will be) fewer united families in the long run.</p>

<p><em>Rich vs. poor (class)</em> Earlier I mentioned that people seem to forget that 8 people rule the world. They really do. Most people do not look at the ultra rich when it comes to problems in the world. Instead, they look at their neighbor:</p>

<p>George Carlin explains that they keep the lower and middle classes fighting so that the rich can take off with all of  our <em>fucking</em> money</p>

<p><a href="https://me.me/i/george-carlin-on-how-the-ruling-class-keeps-us-divided-18417953">https://me.me/i/george-carlin-on-how-the-ruling-class-keeps-us-divided-18417953</a></p>

<p><em>Educated vs. Uneducated</em>: Many feel ‘privileged’ that they received some sort ‘better’ or ‘higher’ education than others. As an educator myself, I am not dismissing the power of education. However, I am here to claim that any person can be intelligent, even without proper education, and a person can be a complete idiot, even when educated.</p>

<p>I could write thousands of articles on education, but that isn’t the goal of the post. </p>

<p>However, have you ever heard somebody say, “Get educated”? There is the division in action. </p>

<p>It is unfortunate that even today, there are many who do not receive proper education in the United States. I was able to directly see the contrast between living in an ultra rich community, and an ultra poor community. There <em>is</em> a difference in education among the rich and the poor, and it is purposeful. As a quick example, I was writing college level essays in 10th grade at one of the top high schools in America. My life changed forever when I was moved to a community where I eventually helped tutor students who could not add or subtract in the 11th grade.</p>

<p>Now before we all get divided on the details of this subject, we could probably all (mostly) agree that everyone deserves a proper education, no matter their class. Unfortunately, that is not happening in the United States, and it keeps people more divided than ever.</p>

<p>This is extremely complex subject that I do not have all the time for – I’m willing to expand if needed.</p>

<p><em>Old vs. Young</em></p>

<p>This division is more apparent than ever. There seems to be a huge disconnect between the younger generations (Millennials and younger) and the older generations (baby boomers and older).</p>

<p>I feel part of this has come from the breakdown of the family in general. Still, there seems to be a generation war between the old and the young:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2014/the-generation-war.html">https://www.aarp.org/politics-society/advocacy/info-2014/the-generation-war.html</a></p>

<p>It seems that children are no longer honoring their parents, and parents do not seem to be properly taking care of their children (but this is a whole other post).</p>

<p><em>Liberal vs. Conservative.</em></p>

<p>This one is so common and so widespread that I’m not even sure how we are still falling for it in this conspiracy forum. </p>

<p>Even if our political beliefs are inherently different, we have to remember that many of the politicians we are fighting for are tools themselves – they are selected not elected. </p>

<p>Franklin D. Roosevelt once said, “Presidents are selected, not elected.”</p>

<p>Perhaps we can unite on that one issue alone.</p>

<p><strong>False Unification</strong></p>

<p>As we are all divided over petty issues, they are telling us we should unite in other, strange ways:</p>

<p><em>No Borders</em>: There is a huge movement right now to accept all with no borders, no nations, no barriers. They use celebrities to promote this movement:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/05/23/katie-perry-on-manchester-bombing-no-barriers-no-borders-we-all-just-need-to-co-exist/">http://www.breitbart.com/big-hollywood/2017/05/23/katie-perry-on-manchester-bombing-no-barriers-no-borders-we-all-just-need-to-co-exist/</a></p>

<p>Yet, there is no doubt that there are plenty of issues associated with refugees and immigration in Europe:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911">http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-34131911</a></p>

<p><em>No religion?</em>: This may be far-off at this point, but ‘they’ seem to be painting all religion as idiotic and useless. Of course, I am aware that religion has largely been contaminated, but it is access to spirituality for many. Either way, atheism is absolutely on the rise:</p>

<p><a href="https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/">https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/160422-atheism-agnostic-secular-nones-rising-religion/</a></p>

<p><em>No gender?</em>: It seems that end result of gender equality may be some type of strange androgynous society. Maybe this is us to get prepared for when we are replaced by robots? : ) </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgenderism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postgenderism</a></p>

<p>Whatever ends up happening, families are breaking down, and less and less are getting married or having children. But don’t worry, they are starting with the kids when it comes to ‘gender neutral’ clothing:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/parenting/we-have-to-start-with-kids-the-rise-of-genderneutral-childrens-clothing-20170720-gxfa9j.html">http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/parenting/we-have-to-start-with-kids-the-rise-of-genderneutral-childrens-clothing-20170720-gxfa9j.html</a></p>

<p>Plus, what will it matter when eugenics and cloning will be norms eventually?</p>

<p><em>One World?</em> I find it interesting that many ignore the many signs that there will be some type of new world order, where there may be no religion, no gender, and a lot less people. Whatever ends up happening, this is not really a conspiracy. George Bush himself said that we will all be more secure in this quest for a new world:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MADYzQstpsU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MADYzQstpsU</a></p>

<p><em>When we are successful, and we will be…</em></p>

<p>Maybe it will take some act, like aliens, or something to unite us?</p>

<p>Reagan said, “ “Perhaps we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond. I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside this world.”</p>

<p>In other words, we will all eventually unite in some way, but it may not be for the right reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Two things will happen with this post. It will get downvoted or ignored, or it will get upvoted and the comments will be divided. 
I would love for once if we were willing to unite on a basic level of…we are all being fucked.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am a tad bit pessimistic. I feel there will ultimately be a paradox where the quest for ‘equality’ divides us even further. </p>

<p>To end on the note of equality, some do not seem to understand the difference between <em>equality</em> and <em>equity</em>.</p>

<p>Equality – giving everybody the same thing</p>

<p>Equity – giving an individual what he/she/xir needs.</p>

<p>There are some rights in our society that should be equal – there is no denying that. However, there are some things in our society that should be equitable. Here’s an image to sum up what I mean:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=equality+for+equity&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvyOXts4jXAhUKw2MKHWJqBncQ_AUICygC&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=652&amp;amp;dpr=1#imgrc=UYdsj5hoMpaW9M:">https://www.google.com/search?q=equality+for+equity&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvyOXts4jXAhUKw2MKHWJqBncQ_AUICygC&amp;amp;biw=1366&amp;amp;bih=652&amp;amp;dpr=1#imgrc=UYdsj5hoMpaW9M:</a></p>

<p>I fear that many of us will fall for ‘equality’ and unification rather than ‘equity’ and unification.</p>

<p>In fact, it is already happening. To end with a quote,</p>

<p><em>” If you make people uniform, you can control them. If you teach people to read, and think, and question things, you lose control. So, the best idea is to separate people if you wish to maintain a monetary system. It&#39;s called divide and conquer. By dividing people, they&#39;re not a threat, you can control them.&quot;</em>-Jacque Fresco </p>

<p>Divisive tactics.</p>

<p>I read the bible as it is presented. I consider texts not included in the bible.</p>

<p>You are proving the point of my post. I didn&#39;t even mention Christianity in my post.</p>

<p>You have done nothing to breakdown my argument otherwise.</p>

<p>If anybody is interested in my beliefs on Christianity, they can talk to me any time.</p>

<p>No, I was pretty specific in mentioning Dominionists, and Creationists.    The point is that Christianity contains plenty of divisive elements. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Nobody pitted dominionists agianst the rest of society,  that is a home grown movement of christian fundamentalism.   In fact this whole argument is just a way to justify conservative christian nationalism.    It is simple in how it works, every fundamentalist denomination uses it to manipulate its members.  Conform to our ideology, in this case, reading the bible leads to rejection of internationalism, a defense of conservative gender roles, and other christian nonsense, but if you dissent or criticize you are engaged in divisive tactics organized by &#39;them&#39;.   These are dynamics of a cult, not conspiracy theories. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reading the comments, and while I can&#39;t say Christ intended to divide people, the religion itself has only been used to divide people. This may not be the case of believers, but the people in charge.. absolutely, every time.</p>

<p>Christians versus non believers, Christians versus Muslims.. in essence, their perspective is that they are right, and anyone who believes differently is wrong. And that&#39;s the essence of the Bible, it&#39;s very nature is about dividing them from everyone else, and as you consider the breakdowns of denominations, it&#39;s more and more successful division of people, each one claiming to be right while everyone else is wrong.</p>

<p>The guy who brought up religion is just trying to point out that one of their beliefs is hypocritical to what they&#39;re trying to say is another. If anything, simply examining her one belief through the lens of this post.. would be healthy, rather than flat out denial, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the definition of slavery in the 13th amendment more likely coincides with “a condition compared to that of a slave in respect of exhausting labor or restricted freedom” when someone commits a felony, the state has the power to strip rights away from the perpetrator. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;What many fail to understand is that slavery in biblical times was very different from the slavery that was practiced in the past few centuries in many parts of the world. The slavery in the Bible was not based exclusively on race. People were not enslaved because of their nationality or the color of their skin. In Bible times, slavery was based more on economics; it was a matter of social status. People sold themselves as slaves when they could not pay their debts or provide for their families. In New Testament times, sometimes doctors, lawyers, and even politicians were slaves of someone else. Some people actually chose to be slaves so as to have all their needs provided for by their masters.</p>

<p>The slavery of the past few centuries was often based exclusively on skin color. In the United States, many black people were considered slaves because of their nationality; many slave owners truly believed black people to be inferior human beings. The Bible condemns race-based slavery in that it teaches that all men are created by God and made in His image (Genesis 1:27). At the same time, the Old Testament did allow for economic-based slavery and regulated it. The key issue is that the slavery the Bible allowed for in no way resembled the racial slavery that plagued our world in the past few centuries.</p>

<p>In addition, both the Old and New Testaments condemn the practice of “man-stealing,” which is what happened in Africa in the 16th to 19th centuries. Africans were rounded up by slave-hunters, who sold them to slave-traders, who brought them to the New World to work on plantations and farms. This practice is abhorrent to God. In fact, the penalty for such a crime in the Mosaic Law was death: “Anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be put to death” (Exodus 21:16). Similarly, in the New Testament, slave-traders are listed among those who are “ungodly and sinful” and are in the same category as those who kill their fathers or mothers, murderers, adulterers and perverts, and liars and perjurers (1 Timothy 1:8– 10).&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So slavery is &quot;okay&quot; as long as it&#39;s not based on race?  Seriously?  You condemn people for &quot;divide and conquer&quot; tactics yet believe that social status based slavery is somehow acceptable?</p>

<p>Furthermore, here Jesus literally promotes only &quot;light&quot; punishment for slaves who didn&#39;t even know they were doing something wrong and &quot;severely punished&quot; if they didn&#39;t carry out their master&#39;s instructions:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>“And a servant who knows what the master wants, but isn’t prepared and doesn’t carry out those instructions, will be severely punished. But someone who does not know, and then does something wrong, will be punished only lightly.&quot;</em> <strong>(Luke 12:47-48 NLT)</strong></li>

<p>It was used as an example of obeying a master under severe punishment.</p>

<p>The point of the OP was divide and conquer. She didn&#39;t even mention Christianity. Someone else pointed out she was a Christian and people like you started dividing and conquering using religion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because religion is inherently divisive.  Don&#39;t blame me for the OP being a hypocrite.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Please stop following polkadotgirl around as well. You use these same tactics on her.</p>

<p>I post frequently on this forum as you can see, often on many posts on the front page or in the new queue.  If people don&#39;t want to be called out for being hypocrites, then they should stop spouting hypocrisy. </p>

<p>Education in my mind is the great equalizer, but there is no cultural impulse to want to get educated in the US, the environment for too many American families is adverse to getting educated, AND active powerful interests want to keep it as such. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, the title is a great example of the kind of shit I see come out of r/the_Donald. I&#39;m a conservative, and I have plenty of liberal people I know, so when I see &quot;liberalism is a mental disorder&quot; and such constantly pushed.. it&#39;s ridiculous, and obviously propaganda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more likely to be adopted by people that don&#39;t actually know people in real life with opposing views, people living in ideological echo chambers. All the rest of the propaganda is simply efforts at demonizing the opposing side, making them evil, dehumanizing them..</p>

<p>And I see tons of comments here that do the same thing, they&#39;ll inject partisan politics into posts that have nothing to do with politics.. and it&#39;s usually users from t_d. Trying to manipulate people&#39;s views.</p>

<p>All the anti Hillary posts.. pretty sure no one of either side in this sub likes Hillary in any way, but it&#39;s only intent is to have a divisive conversation, to bait anyone to say anything that doesn&#39;t conform to the group think.</p>

<p>Dozens of posts about uranium one, with the same intent. Even in the dozens of posts you&#39;ll commonly see about Weinstein, that have nothing to do with politics, you&#39;ll see people unnaturally trying to bring it in somehow.</p>

<p>Yes, divide and conquer is bad, and I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s not only allowed to proliferate this sub, but reinforced by users here, even though most of us should be aware and decry the tactic.</p>

<p>My comment isn&#39;t about r/t_d, but the tactic I see their users here constantly use in an effort to divide the users here more and more against each other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m reading the comments, and while I can&#39;t say Christ intended to divide people, the religion itself has only been used to divide people. This may not be the case of believers, but the people in charge.. absolutely, every time.</p>

<p>Christians versus non believers, Christians versus Muslims.. in essence, their perspective is that they are right, and anyone who believes differently is wrong. And that&#39;s the essence of the Bible, it&#39;s very nature is about dividing them from everyone else, and as you consider the breakdowns of denominations, it&#39;s more and more successful division of people, each one claiming to be right while everyone else is wrong.</p>

<p>The guy who brought up religion is just trying to point out that one of their beliefs is hypocritical to what they&#39;re trying to say is another. If anything, simply examining her one belief through the lens of this post.. would be healthy, rather than flat out denial, etc.</p>
