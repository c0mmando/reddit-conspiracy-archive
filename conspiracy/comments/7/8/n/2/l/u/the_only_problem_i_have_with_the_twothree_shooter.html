       Still pretty unrealistic. 489 injuries is impressive, but if there were 2/3 shooters like this sub said, it would probably be 2x that number

       A lot of those injuries aren't from being shot... a lot of those injuries are from people getting trampled/falling trying to escape.  Not everyone of those nearly 500 people was hit with a bullet.  Most of them weren't.

       There was a video here a couple days ago where a Marine combat vet opined that the death + injury rate was way too high. He said a single shooter from that position using that gun could not hit that many people. Not with a bump stock, and (iirc) not even with a fully automatic rifle. It seemed counter-intuitive to me, but then again, I've never been in a war, so how would I know, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying the guy is right. I'm only saying that I have every reason to believe that he is in a better position to know than I am.

       perhaps the strike of fear is more important than the blow itself.  They had made sure to rack up the count enough to be the deadliest shooting but not so much that they had to kill "unnecessarily".  If this is a staged op, they need to follow thier rules

       They can just throw us numbers without killing anyone. The majority of the world takes whst the news says as true without doing a seconds worth of research.

       No one can prove shots were really fired. Talk of multiple shooters is moot, speculative, and based on fabricated evidence i.e. the sound of gunshots issuing from speakers.

       Hmmm... so the people who were shot dead didn't exist?  The hospitals and the EMTs and the Police and the coroner and the families and friends of the deceased are all in on it?  This is another one of those amazing staged events where hundreds of people are in on it and none of them even anonymously admit it?  Brilliant.

      <p>
       Why would that be necessary? For example, if a busy hospital sees a rush of patients, ostensibly from this 'shooting', how many staff do you think see a single patient from admission all the way through to surgery and release?
      </p>
      <p>
       Create enough fuss and a few people playing along with the act and most staff will act like total bystanders, assuming "someone else" is treating the guy who died, or that girl with the gunshot wounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all an illusion. A magic trick. A total fraud.

       The people "in on it" are likely a travelling circus of professional military drill specialists who do this all over the world. It's not that hard to envisage.

       They can't reveal what they do to anyone because nobody would believe them anyway. Just look at this sub, once a narrative is in motion even hardened skeptics fall for it... or so it appears.

       It's not a traveling circus.  People know the victims.  They have neighbors and family members and coworkers.  If some guy dies and they say "here is where he lived and here is where he worked and here is his facebook page etc." and that person didn't really exist then some of the people who were supposed to have known this person/worked with this person would say "hey.. wait a second... that guy didn't work here!"

       Because if you are John Smith and you were killed and you lived on 123 Allen Street in Bisbee Arizona and worked at the local grocery store, for example... if somebody else who lives on Allen Street in Bisbee and goes to that grocery store sees you on the news and realizes they never heard of you before and you aren't a real person they'd say "hey wait a second.. this is bullshit.. I live right next to where they say this guy lived and he doesn't exist!"

       Why not try looking into these alleged victims in more detail. I'm willing to bet that's exactly what you'd find if you start digging. Either that or you'll find a prime candidate for a faked death: someone with huge business loans, shady business connections, media or government ties...
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody in the media will ever verify these things for you, certainly not the so-called investigative journalists. They'll happily tell you everything is just the way they say it is though, all day long.

       Scrolled through a few. I'm still not convinced, sorry. Nice feel-good stuff tho. Every single 'victim' was "the worlds best, most caring wife/mother/husband. All doing what they loved. 
Right. Sure thing. In Vegas everyone is wholesome and all about family, thats why its the number one destination for wholesome families, right?

       I'm certainly not going to change my opinion when there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that nobody died but there is video footage and pictures and victims names and family members and hospital workers and coroners and emergency responders etc., who all corroborate the idea that an actual shooting happened with actual victims.  22,000 people at the concert who were eye-witnessing people being shot and they were all having a mass hallucination.. or were they all in on it also?  It's just ridiculous the amount of hoops you have to jump thru to convince yourself that no shooting actually happened.  It's way harder to fake a shooting than it would be to actually shoot people so if this whole thing was a false flag why wouldn't they just actually carry out a shooting?  What's the benefit of faking the whole thing?
