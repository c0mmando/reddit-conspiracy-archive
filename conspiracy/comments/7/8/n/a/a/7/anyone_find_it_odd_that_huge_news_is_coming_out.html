       The Russian lawyer that Don Jr met with, had met with Fusion GPS a month prior. This meeting and the dossier is what was used in FISA court to approve the wiretapping on Trump and his associates. The DNC and Clinton essentially manufactured and paid for oppo research that the FBI and Obama then used in FISA court to spy on a political opponent. Huge deal.

       Actually, that's not true-
       <em>
        Manafort
       </em>
       was the target of the investigation and the wiretap, remember? And not because of the dossier- he was already under investigation for money laundering. If he was such scum, maybe Trump shouldn't have hired him?
      </p>
      <p>
       And besides, if Trump's opposition research turned up illegal things in the Clinton campaign, would you object to
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       being investigated? Heck, what happened to "lock her up", anyway? I still see people yelling that around here, but Trump can't seem to find anything to nail her with.

       Fusion GPS is a D.C. opposition and research firm founded by an ex-Wall Street Journal writer.  They have lots of different clients.  I hate the genre of "These two people both hired the same vendor therefore they're connected."

      <p>
       The FISA warrants were on Paul Manafort because it appeared he was laundering money for eastern European tyrants.  There was also an open investigation into Carter Page, because he had been contacted by Russian spy recruiters.  The government didn't get the Steele dossier until much later, when its contents freaked John McCain out enough for him to forward it to the DOJ last summer or fall.

       You implied the warrant was a result of the dossier.  They may have added allegations from the dossier to their submission when renewing the warrant, but the fact that he's been under surveillance for years suggests sufficient independent basis for the warrant.

       Right, they were rejected and had to go back and get more "evidence." It looks like that evidence was likely the dossier.

       <p>
        By the way, as far as I know none of the allegations in the dossier have been materially disproved.

       It needs to be validated, and it hasn't. The burden is on those pushing it. Pretty tough to disprove made up allegations. How do you disprove the allegation that anonymous hookers pissed on a bed at Trump's request?

       You're going beyond saying the claims aren't verified -- which nobody is disputing -- to saying they're "made up."  That's a positive allegation, and the burden is on you to prove that.

It would be like Nixon tapes on steroids.  This is dependent upon actually having the evidence and if he\she is still alive.  I'm sure they have a fail safe in place.

       Yup. Starting to look like the Jeb campaign started the dossier research, but DNC continued paying for it. People think the DNC and the "GOP Donor" (who was probably supporting Jeb) made up the dossier. They only paid for a list of dirt to be uncovered and itemized. Trump was a wild card both the Republican and Democratic party didn't want to be president. Establishment or not, this was in the end a non partisan paper.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still trying to figure out what the big gotcha is. If a Trump donor had started a Clinton dossier, I'd be like, cool sounds like something politicians do when running against a candidate in a large political race. Unless the outage is just that people paid to dig up dirt on Trump, then why is it different for Trump to want to dig up dirt on Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want the people who have gotten so pro Trump or anti Clinton or pro Clinton or anti Trump to realise we're all being played against each other.

      <p>
       The problem, but you know this already, is that Clinton payed to have the dossier manufactured (not "dug up"), and then that manufactured 'evidence' was used to obtain a FISA warrant to spy on the Trump campaign.

       So does that mean the president would not be considered a credible individual to testify in court? I do believe that once you've shown yourself to be a passive liar (you lie just to lie, either bc it's inherent to your nature - we've all met chronic liars who can't help it - or you have been lying so long about stuff for personal or business reasons that you can't stop yourself) that everything you say needs to be validated against a more trustworthy source.

       Agreed. Some of the dossier has been verified as true.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         The dossier details about a dozen conversations between senior Russian officials and other Russian individuals.
        </strong>
        Sources would not confirm which specific conversations were intercepted or the content of those discussions due to the classified nature of US intelligence collection programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        But
        <strong>
         the intercepts do confirm that some of the conversations described in the dossier took place between the same individuals on the same days and from the same locations as detailed in the dossier, according to the officials.

       It really depends on the pool of anonymous sources. If I have a working history with you for 10 years and you've never once been proven wrong - and you tell me something is true, I will believe you. Then if several other people tell me the exact same thing, this builds more confirmation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously we have to take anonymous sources with a grain of salt, but based on who is reporting the anonymous sources, we can begin to get a gut feeling as to the validity of the claim.

       You are quite right in the general case, but in this specific case the actors are heavily biased with multiple conflicts of interest and poor ethical histories.  So I think I'll be taking the claims with a giant hunk of salt, not just a grain.

       So the problem with the bot activity is that all we know is that the bots come through Russian IP space.  I am no computer security expert, but as someone who does manage a few small websites, I do know that a very large portion of electronic hacking comes through Russian IP space.  Why?  Because it is almost impossible to track back due to the political and legal enmity between the US and Russia.  If you are a computer hacker in the US and want to fuck up someone's shit, the way to do it is via VPN through Russia because nobody is going to be able to track you home.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, we have bots coming from Russian IP space.  Are they affiliated with the Kremlin?  Are then DNC bots proxied through Russian IP space?  Are they an unaffiliated 3rd party?  Nobody (so far as I know) has been able to actually answer this question.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, we have the Kremlin funneling a fair bit of money through the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine to the Podesta Group via Paul Manafort, and this whole Uranium One situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 2015 Ukrainian coup was dirty.  I'm not sure of the players and I have no proof, but it has been my opinion since then that Russia is indeed meddling in American politics but aligned with the DNC/CIA axis.  In looking at the pieces of the puzzle that are visible and the actual facts on the ground, this is more of the picture that is supported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my opinion.  Worth nothing at all.  I'm really looking forward to seeing what Mueller comes up with, especially with this business about digging into Manafort's involvement with the Podesta Group.

       This still does not address the actual money trail.  Furthermore, the bots themselves aren't quite as specific about supporting only one party as one might suppose.  Aren't they more focused on fomenting friction and disagreement in our society?

       yes, but they promote trump and denounce the dnc as often as they can. they promote BLM and urge them to separate from the democrats. they promote bernie primarily to pull voters away from hillary. one thing youll never find them doing is promoting hillary or bringing down trump, despite them being very divisive figures

       You mean to tell me you have not heard about Rick Wilson's roll in this sordid affair?  Here's a radio station reporting on it way back in January.  You'll even find a screencap of the segment I retyped for your reading pleasure.

       Dude you can stop now. I know you are making shit up. I linked you to the actual dossier twice. If your quote was in it you could have given me page number and paragraph. You cant though because your source is fake news. There is no bullet point 22 in the dossier.

       That was a mistake that I made in haste.  I meant to say fanfic. 
 That's why that part has since been edited from the original comment.  Sorry that I made one mistake and it set off your turbo-autism.  I'm not really sorry though.

       My only problem with this line of thought is that you can't just unmask someone. It isn't just "click this button to unmask" it's a bureaucratic process. You also don't get to unmask just anyone. In one of the conditions, have to show that the unmasking is crucial to determining the context of what you've found.
       <strong>
        You don't know who you are unmasking
       </strong>
       , this is why it is called an unmasking and not "oh yeah we totally know who this is, but can you replace PERSON1 with their name, thanks".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, but if our IC found information to be unmasked and it turned out to be HClinton smuggling children or DTrump smuggling children, I wouldn't care who it was smuggling children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same goes for this political arena. I've been in the conspiracy game too long to just accept Susan Rice and the DNC wanted to fabricate a story around DTrump that would sink his ship. What I do believe - is that they and the other GOP options for presedential nomination would definetly pay big bucks to uncover truths, crimes and moral ambiguities that DTrump has been involved with throughout his life. The same way I'd expect the Trump camp to pay big bucks to uncover truths, crimes and moral ambiguities that HClinton has been involved with throughout her life.

       While you're correct that names are redacted before the unmasking, if the unmasking was requested primarily for intercepted comms with individuals known to interact with Trump campaign then it would be fairly easy to tell who you were unmasking.

       Parallel Construction is a Republican-created (GWB era) system of taking what you already know illegally and creating a legal trail so that you can introduce evidence. In other words, you mixed it all up. In PC, first you have to
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       -- in unmasking first you
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       know.

       But here's the bigger story. Who cares? So what? They paid for opposition research. Everyone does that. In fact the Trump campaign had meetings with Russians over opposition research. It's been proven in emails from Kushner. What's the big deal?

If a Trump donor had started a Clinton dossier, I'd be like, cool sounds like something politicians do when running against a candidate in a large political race.

       IDK, I think there's a good foundation to argue that it was Manafort who got the Trump Campaign pulled into an unmasking and not a FISA warrant. You don't even know who you are unmasking when you put in an unmask request...that's kinda why you need to unmask, to see who it is.

       Exactly.  The alt-left is trying to call this Opp Research.  And that’s fine. Opposition Research is ok.

      <p>
       But when the knowingly false research was given to the FBI and weaponized to investigate Trump, that’s huge.

       People also forget that Crowd Strike (the firm that declared the DNC was hacked by Russia) was hired by the same firm that paid for the dossier.

       So at this point, the majority of “collusion evidence” has come from the DNC.

       Add it all up and it sounds like the DNC is funding the investigation by Mueller into Trump.  That’s shady as fuck.

       I do IT consulting for a living, and THAT'S the reason I thought the Crowdstrike report was shady as fuck. The report is long and detailed, and was produced in a matter of hours.

      <p>
       As someone who literally does this for a living, "long and detailed" and "produced in a matter of hours" usually means that the report was already written long beforehand.
      </p>
      <p>
       IE, a lot of IT consulting firms will write a report, sell it to one customer, then sell the same report to another customer. We'll change a few paragraphs and sentences to suit the situation, but 95% of it is boilerplate.

       Crowdstrike will never be verified, because they won’t let anyone see their data. Why is that?

       So the “Russian collusion” is based on secret Criwdstrike data and a fake dossier, both of which were paid for by the DNC.

       That's what makes things so convenient here; because a server is being attacked day and night, it's easy to point the finger in a dozen different directions. You can blame Russia, China, Turkey, the United States, take your pick. If you put a server on the internet, someone is going to try and break into it.

Then when Trump gets the nomination, GOP is like "welp, not gonna pay for this anymore" to which DNC slides in and goes "oh we got this" and continues funding the effort. Also the dossier's author is a well known IC member Christopher Steele. He worked for the Brits. This is like trying to say Bill Gates' advice on computers would be knowingly false, despite him being you know, Mr. Computer. If you don't like that example, swap in any respected member of the computing field instead of Gates.

       They weren't working to take down - they were looking for political information to use in political ads, debates, the presidential primary, etc. It wasn't created so "
       <strong>
        when
       </strong>
       Trump becomes president, we'll have some gotchas!" it was created for
       <strong>
        before
       </strong>
       the election-vote activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest thing we need to remember is who STARTED the dossier? It was a GOP donor (again most likely in the Jeb camp). This tells us that it started as any other type of opposition research. Which, imho, takes a lot of the steam out of the dossier short of it just being opposition research that I wouldn't be shocked any candidate paid to have done.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I paid to have the background of a neighbor who might beat me in this year's neighborhood Christmas decoration contest and I find out through the paid research that they are smuggling children across the border or heroin or cocaine....would you a third party be yelling more about the fact I had the background research done...or what the background research found?

      <p>
       I feel like too many of us are getting stuck on the creation when we should be focusing on the results. I don't get mad that the doctor ran my blood work and found cancer. I'm not going to sue the doctor because "I wouldn't have known about this cancer and it is ruining my life if you hadn't had those labs done doc!". I'd be very glad the information was uncovered.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, this dossier is nothing but more smoke and mirrors as pushed from the right wing MSM in this country. I don't care what the dossier has in it - I just want to know what is true, kinda true and straight up a lie. Then based on what is true (again, parts have been verified and the non verified parts have not yet been debunked - just not yet verified) I want a mature and common sense decision to be made.

       What results?  You mean the sham investigation of President Trump for collusion which originated from bogus opposition research and the DNCs examination of their own servers?  Everything here leads us to believe that the DNC took their “evidence” of collusion to the FBI and that the FBI (mostly Comey) used that to target Trump
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       he had already won the election.

       The truth is that A. The dossier is bullshit opposition research and it’s meaningless.  But B. The problem is that meaningless, inaccurate, partisan opposition research is being used in an attempt to impeach the President of the United States.

       When has any other opp research been hand delivered to the FBI for use in a presidential investigation?  This is clear and simple.  DNC dug up bogus dirt.  They lied about it for a year.  They gave that bogus dirt to the FBI who used it to attack President Trump.  It doesn’t get any dirtier than that.

       Nigga, what? Once again, you seem incapable of recognizing that the "fake" (it's not fake you nitwit) document may have only been a part of the case to geet a FISA warrant (that wasn't even for Trump). Conveniently, you ignore the facts about guys like Manafort and Page though. Nice. I can tell you're a Trumpanzee.

       It's been common knowledge that anti-Trump GOP candidates started the process and the DNC picked it up when it was clear Trump was going to win the GOP primary. WaPo updated their article to show the Clinton campaign was involved, so the campaign involvement might not have been as widely accepted.

        The Republican donor hired Fusion in September 2015, according to an account in the New York Times. But once Trump won the Republican nomination, the GOP donor lost interest. But in spring 2016, Fusion was able to persuade donors to Hillary Clinton to keep funding the research. (Update, Oct 24:The Washington Post reported that the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee funded the research.)

       Its a big revelation in light of how this document was likely used to obtain FISA warrants and spy on the Trump campaign. If true, that is some serious corruption. Especially considering that the Dossier looks like something that 4chan put together. It looks like it was just a fabricated tool to be used for Hillary to get an unfair advantage over Trump.

       Others who have been here longer say it started to change in 2012, but even in my 3.5 years here I've seen it change
       <em>
        radically

       . The 2016 election was a watershed moment for Reddit....and not a good one. I've seen entire subs be coopted first hand, places like r/politics and r/Wikileaks. It's madness.

       Then don't confidently assert that kind of shit if you can't even be bothered to check if it's true. If you're gonna play the victim card at least

       Seriously..it's amazing how this is the timeline: 
Ron Paul -&gt; Bernie Sanders -&gt; Hilary Clinton
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, magically, it's anti-capitalism.  I went in to give it a quick look, first comment section the top comment is a list of every failure of trump, first reply "Literally no one can support this man anymore" next comment?  They talk about how they finally understand how people support
       <em>
        Kim Jun Un in North Korea
       </em>
       because there are are people in America that still support trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't even support Trump, but this is beyond naive, every thread is like this, there is an intense echo chamber here and I don't think the people realize where the first voices are coming from.

       I've been on reddit for 10 years and it has always been "fake" to a certain degree. The worst of it (that I noticed) was during the time Obama was pushing Obamacare. One day there was a new post with 30k up votes and it was something like "I know everything about Obamacare AMA" but it was blatant propaganda, only discussing the selling points and excluding any of the real details. Every comment was cricle jerking how great health care was about to be. If you search Obamacare with Top and All Time, that propaganda has been removed and now all that remains are stories talking about how stupid Trump is to try and repeal it.

       If you think huge news came out about the dossier, you weren't paying attention to the story this year. The only new information is that before we knew "democrats and the DNC" paid for it after  trump won the nom, and now its "hillary's campaign and the DNC". That's it. It's not huge news and nobody would need to cover that up.

       Um, I'm sorry but there's a
       <em>

       difference of importance between "[Random] democrats paid for this" and "The Clinton campaign for this".

       The story is, basically, now that Clinton used campaign funds to try and collude with Russia (and yes, the dossier needed information from Russia). You know, the same exact thing they have been accusing Trump of.

       It was said to be the dnc, not only random dems, so what's the big difference? If the dossier needed info from Russia, do you think it's all true then? It was gathered from secondhand sources in Russia which is why it was questioned from the beginning.

       No, but that's irrelevant. The truth of it doesn't matter at all in this case. Clinton used campaign funds to collude with Russia to help her win the election.

       There's nothing illegal about paying an american firm to do oppo research. There are other things that could make it illegal, but none of them are proven or even alleged in the "huge news"

       This is based on the faulty assumption that the dossier could only be made with cooperation with the russian government, which is pulled out of your ass. The difference is the email chain said the meeting was about the russian governments support of trump, to which jr said I Love it!

       That email chain and natalia were both paod by the oppo research, so they paid someone Russia to go talk to him. Just so they could get fisa warrent on everyone. Let's not ignore that she also had an out of date visa and Lorretta lynch specifically helped her get into the country....

       Aside from there being no proof of "the oppo research" being behind the meeting with natalia, trump jr thought he was meeting with representatives of the russian government as part of an operation to help trump win the presidency, it doesn't matter if it was really ashton kutcher in a wig who showed up to the meeting, what matters is what trumpjr(and manafort and kushner) thought he was doing

       Your info is outdated, she got "special" help to get into the country months before, to work on a court case, and by the time the trumpjr meeting happened she had normal permission to be back in the country.

       She worked for a company that also EMPLOYED the company who did the dossier to get info on a case of theirs, that is a large distinction.

       Who is calling for DonJr to be arrested based on just that meeting happening? we don't know exactly what the info even was, the point made by the email chain is that when they say "golly gee we would never get help from the russians!" we know they would glady do it if given the opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deflection to the left is also very different, as a person went over to ukraine, and worked with a ukranian journalist on information in public records.

       Having contacts in russia is not the same thing as the russian government helping make it. In this case, "trusted compatriots" of those high up sources gave steele the secondhand information in exchange for cash.

      <p>
       Your entire point is that the dossier could only have been made with the russian govt's help, so now that we know hillary's campaign helped fund it, that means she colluded with the russians. That's like saying the NYTimes colluded with the trump administration everytime they get a leak.

       So it doesn't matter that Clinton paid someone to talk with Kremlin agents, but it matters that Trump Jr. talked with someone who was, at one point, paid for by the Kremlin.

       Yes there is a big distinction on if they hired an investigator who got leaked information from kremlin agents, and if the kremlin handed the information to the investigator to help clinton. Do you really not see that or are you this desperate for the narrative reversal?

       As I said, I don't even care who it was trump jr met with or what their ties were(we cant ever prove what was said or exchanged in that meeting so it is moot) I care about what we know trump jr/manafort/kushner thought the meeting was, which was information directly from the russian government to help Trump win the election.

       That's sort of how law firms work. They hire someone, you're assigned to the case, the person they hired effectively works for you.

       This is where you're being extremely hypocritical. You care about where Trump Jr.
       <em>
        thought
       </em>
       he was getting information from. You don't care that Clinton thought she was getting insider Russian information.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're going to say "Clinton didn't know Steele would talk to the Russians!" then you'd be lying. She know who Steele was. She knew what kind of contacts he had.
      </p>
      <p>
       The differences here are 1) Who reached out to who, and 2) Someone spent campaign funds on their collusion. That's really it. You, as you've said, care about Trump but not about Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Democrats created these rules, we are to care about any and every interaction with Russia during the election. These are the rules (what appears to be) your team created. Either play by them or admit you're biased and you don't wanna face the music about your own team.

       So using my earlier example, do you consider the NYTimes to be colluding with the trump administration every time they print a leak that makes him look bad?
      </p>
      <p>
       When a whistleblower exposes a company's wrongdoing, do you pat the company on the back for coming forward?
      </p>
      <p>
       How are you not able to see the difference between a person in an organization leaking information, and the organization itself giving the information away to suit their own needs?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're making a strawman that I think "anyone talking to a russian ever" is the issue, which it is not. The comparable example would be if steele had told hillary "the russian government wants to help you beat trump so, they will give me a dossier of info on bad things he's done" and hillary replied "I Love it!" even if that dossier was complete bunk or didnt exist, accepting that offer would not look good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as if all we knew about trumpjr was that he met with a lawyer to talk about russian adoptions, it would not be a story still.

       Yes, I do. When the NYT solicits leaks from within Trump's administration, and someone complies, they are colluding to leak information together. It's, almost, quite literally the definition.

       Oooh, so the Trump Jr. meeting isn't important because no information was gathered from it? Last I checked the DNC, the media, and their lackeys spent months talking about it. Hell, they're still talking about it. Not only that, how many times were the Wikileaks emailed "discredited" because "Assange is a Putin pawn!"

       So the story is.. if a democrat gathers information, it doesn't matter who or where it came from.. or how they got it. However, if anyone gathers information about the democrats, the only thing that matters is the messenger.

       You realize that paying a firm to gather opposition research is
       <em>
        legal
       </em>
       , and that working with a foreign government to affect an election is
       <em>
        illegal
       </em>
       , right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're conflating the two when there's a striking difference. The dossier was opposition research: someone paid someone else to find Trump's dirty secrets (it's called politics).
      </p>
      <p>
       The accusations against Trump is that he partnered with a foreign government (illegal) and used their help (illegal) to affect the outcome of the US election (illegal).
      </p>
      <p>
       If Hillary or the DNC paid the Russian government to gather the dirt, that would be illegal.

       Speaking to the Don Jr. story, you state:

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The problem is, you're making assumptions. This is not a matter of "anyone gathering information", it's a matter of Don Jr. releasing his own emails which show he met with someone
       <em>
        claiming
       </em>
       to be representative of a foreign government.
      </p>
      <p>
       You call me a hypocrite while you defend Trump's collusion by mischaracterizing it, while lying about the Steele dossier. There's a word for that... it's called projecting.

       Your assumption is that this dossier was not made with the help of Russian government operatives. You assume that because, well, you don't want "your guys" to be in the wrong. Well, they are, and there's actual evidence. So much evidence, actually, that Mueller is now investigating them.

       You're correct - I quickly browsed the Vanity Fair article, but there is a difference between using a foreign government to subvert a democratic election, versus gleaning information about ongoing criminal activities from a foreign government's security agency.

       Except they are the same. According to Democrats, it's against the law to work with foreign governments during an election (it's actually not since Russia was considered friendly under Obama). It seems pretty hypocritical to just shrug at what Hillary's CAMPAIGN did but scream for impeachment over who Trump Jr met with.
      </p>

       Also, lets remember that the lawyer Trump Jr. met with is connected to Fusion GPS, who subcontracted Steele for the dossier.

       lol I love how they keep pushing that false equivalency down everyone's throat. Just because the shill dems lied about Russia for the last year plus it now follows that actual proof of dnc Russian collusion must also be an equally blatant lie? The logic is so fucking stupid yet everywhere I see plastered "the Russia conspiracy trump likes" and shit playing it off like some type of ideological split on a philosophical matter. Lmao

       If the research was never vetted, taken as truth by the party collecting the research without any validation of the content of the research, and passed to fisa court as justification for a warrantless wiretap on American citizens, then yes, it is. Which is exactly what happened, provided everything we know now.

       You realize your first link uses

        this

        Officials familiar with the process say even if the application to monitor Page included information from the dossier, it would only be after the FBI had corroborated the information through its own investigation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You literally just disproved your own claim that none of the info was vetted by posting sources saying that it was. Congrats!

       Everytime something new indicating corruption in the Trump administration comes up some negative things that happened months before are brought up by the alt-right media. Seth Rich and Uranium One are a prime example of this.

       Our political processes are a mess because of $$$$$$$.  One way to start to unravel this is allowing a candidate or anyone supporting a particular candidate to receive campaign donations from US Citizens that are registered voters in the candidate's voting district.  Examples: A Congressman can only receive campaign support from voters in his district; a Senator could only receive funding from registered voter in his State.  Since we do not directly elect President and Vice President, only the state candidates for the electoral college could receive campaign funding.

       What huge news?  What information came out recently that you did not already know?  Reconfirming what we already knew six months ago isn't huge news, it's an intentional attempt at distraction.

        In 2009, Trump went to the bathroom in his Moscow hotel. Once in the bathroom, he yelled out, "I hate black people!" then proceeded to relieve himself in the toilet. After he was finished he reportedly said, "I take the biggest dumps, nobody takes bigger dumps than me, believe me."
