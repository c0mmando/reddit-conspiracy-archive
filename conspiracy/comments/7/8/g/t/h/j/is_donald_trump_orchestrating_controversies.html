       Yeah, the media and DNC can't let 10 minutes pass without attacking the guy and it's somehow his fault. I hope to god you're just trolling, buI have a sneaking suspicion you're not. I'm thinking about dressing as you for Halloween. This is some of the scariest shit I've ever seen.

       You've just shifted the issue. Let's review what you said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        the whole protesting issue had quieted down tremendously until he stoked the flames
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is categorically false. It had not died down. It had not subsided. It was getting worse. Yes, it may have escalated after he commented. That is not what we're discussing here. You said it had died down. You are wrong. Your comment says exactly nothing about whether it had died down previously.

       This is over the last five years, you can see spikes throughout last football season, but they come back to a low level in the offseason. Then, we see a giant spike when Trump brings it up at the campaign rally and continues to bring it up on Twitter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that google trends isn't a perfect tool but the pattern seems pretty clear to me at least

       It seems clear to you that people searched for "National Anthem" after Trump mentioned it?  No kidding. Again, you've said nothing about it from
       <em>
        before.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       The "controversy" has only existed for a year and a half, so I don't know why you're using 5 years. But didn't you notice that the previous 3.5 years, before the knee thing even started, are largely indistinguishable from most of this &amp; last year's football season? I mean, you can see bumps for on season &amp; off season, but there ain't much data here. I would guess that most of the smaller numbers are not statistically significant.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that doesn't even really matter, because it's a measure of what people are typing into google. Fans weren't searching the internet for it because they were sick to death of hearing about it. Every sports radio show, every sports TV show, and every NFL broadcast talked about it almost constantly. It was not possible to watch anything NFL-related without it coming up.

       Some guys were still doing it such as Brandon Marshall but it had definitely died down till Trump brought it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think he did it because it was an easy target. Look at these millionaires kneeling for our flag it dishonors the US/Military. yaddah yaddah yaddah. Easy points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he got back into it when the season started again because more people joined and Trump doesn't pull punches.

       Absolutely. The guy has been swimming in shitty PR all his life, he lives for this shit. This is where the media has miscalculated at every turn in regards to trying to stop him. Bad press is his domain, he knows it, we know it, everybody knows it...and yet they cannot resist the bait. It is kinda funny and tragic at the same time.

       He is the president of the united states. I would say that at the very least it is not...not working for him. His situation is surely less then ideal for any of us, and I am sure on some level all the toxicity bothers him. But like any good sociopath, it probably does not bother him in the way it would bother us.

       I mean he did win, and 1 year before he won I was following this guy doing vids on him showing how he manipulates the media to his advantage. The kid knew he was going to win from this. For this reason I'd say it was definitely affective.

       i think he is a master of PR, not in a traditional sense at all thought.
more like WWE villain wrestler manager.
      </p>
      <p>
       he knows you wont love him, but you love to hate him.
      </p>
      <p>
       frankly i think he has been using this to push public opinion which ever way he wants to. everyone is falling over themselves to do the opposite of what he says, all he has to do is play the bad guy and claim to take the opposite position.
      </p>
      <p>
       too many people are diving at the chance to score PR points just from disagreeing with him, and i think we would be foolish to rule out the fact that he knows this game better than most.
