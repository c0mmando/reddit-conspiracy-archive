       Has anyone else heard about the conspiracy theory that suggests Paul McCartney died in an automobile accident in 1966? A colleague was telling me about it, I had never heard about it before. I feel I’m pretty aware of most theories out there but never had heard of this one. Just curious if anyone else had.

       There's a really interesting Miles Mathis paper about it.  I went into reading it thinking it sounded dumb, but he nearly has me convinced.  There are photo comparisons etc.

       I'm not convinced of this, but I will say that the notion of there being two Pauls from early on is WAY more plausible than the original Paul dying and being replaced.

       There's so many ways that wouldn't work though. Like, for example, which one of them lived in Hamburg for 2 years playing strip clubs before the band was famous? Which one flew on planes with the press during world tours? Did they sneak the other one around? And there's no actual proof that it did happen.

       There's so much that goes unanswered in this though, all it does is compare pictures. They say 'Mike' is the one that doesn't like the limelight but has the voice, and Paul is the one who likes the limelight. So which one lived in Hamburg for 2 years playing strip clubs? You can
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R4BuQit5_s">
        hear
       </a>
       and
       <a href="http://www.beatlesource.com/savage/1961/61.03.27%2007.02%20top%20ten/03%20Gerd%20Mingram/4.jpg">
        see
       </a>
       that he both likes the limelight and has a good voice, so which one is he?
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's just the first part of Beatles history, basically every stage of Beatles history has something that would make this impossible.

       The conspiracy came out of a spoof film that the beatles made.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, it seems either they kept the spoof going (in press releases and album art), or synchronicity is at play.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have seen a few photos that look a little like different people but ive seen too many that i know are the same person, to believe the conspiracy.

      <p>
       But who knows... Its a lot more interesting unsolved :D

       I used to care about this then I realized that whoever Paul is, he's a great singer/songwriter/musician. It's like saying Shakespeare didn't really write Shakespeare. Who cares? We have a tremendous body of work.

       I heard about this one recently, too. It's a fun one. I don't believe a word of it, but I appreciate that it's a well crafted theory, which is rare. Most of today's conspiracy creators are dumb &amp; lazy.

       After you read about this, it seems overwhelmingly likely that Paul was replaced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a good podcast about it:

       I don't know if the whole podcast is about it, but if you search "Sage of Quay" on Youtube, that guy interviews a bunch of people about it.

       I quite enjoyed this documentary, which goes over lots of the evidence of Paul having died in 66, but it has a surprising conclusion that I don't really wanna give away now. It's well worth the hour.

       The whole "Paul is Dead" theory was pretty big at the time (late 60s).  Fans found all kinds of clues on album covers and in lyrics.  I think it mostly disappeared for a few decades and then reappeared on the internet.

       There’s a hilarious ‘George Harrison Confession’ on YouTube where he explains the whole ordeal from his hospital bed recovering from a home invasion.  It’s over an hour and a half long.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hilarious because the accent sounds terrible,  and it’s clearly not the beetle..  but if you stick through it there’s some interesting stuff-  the production on the video is very good for YouTube - a lot of time went into editing old clips and photos as well as the backwards messages hidden in the songs.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was better then most movies I’ve seen in a while is all I can say.

       I was born in '49 so I was 14 years old in September, '63, when The Beatles first came to our attention here in the USA. I lived the whole thing, like anyone else did who was alive at the time.  This is absolute nonsense. End of story.

       I'm a huge Beatles fan, and love this theory. (My own personal hypothesis is that there was a parallel universe-slip, and that Paul 1 replaced Paul 2 . . . and that neither is aware that a change occurred.) The current Paul McCartney (so far as he knows) has always
       <em>
        been
       </em>
       Paul McCartney. He is completely earnest and sincere in his avowals.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there wasn't a "look-a-like" switched out for him. No look-a-like would have been able to sound like him, or play bass with approximate proficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
       That fact notwithstanding (as with any set of identical twins), there are notable biometric differences: Like height disparities, ear-shape variations, dental differences, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       My own observation is that it's interesting that pre-1966 Paul's music was almost universally guitar-based. After 1966, he's always on the piano. In one interview Lennon was asked about McCartney's new piano obsession and Lennon said, "Yeah, we can't get him off it."

        has had very chilling stories about other "parallel-universe" jump stories and Mandela Effect situations. I think McCartney (because he was so famous) was easier to document as having "changed". But how many more normal people have undergone the same situation?

       His wife as in Linda McCartney? What did she say? She didn't meet him until the middle of 1967 anyway so even if he did die she only ever met the 2nd Paul.
