    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s so much that goes unanswered in this though, all it does is compare pictures. They say &#39;Mike&#39; is the one that doesn&#39;t like the limelight but has the voice, and Paul is the one who likes the limelight. So which one lived in Hamburg for 2 years playing strip clubs? You can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R4BuQit5_s">hear</a> and <a href="http://www.beatlesource.com/savage/1961/61.03.27%2007.02%20top%20ten/03%20Gerd%20Mingram/4.jpg">see</a> that he both likes the limelight and has a good voice, so which one is he?</p>

<p>And that&#39;s just the first part of Beatles history, basically every stage of Beatles history has something that would make this impossible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The conspiracy came out of a spoof film that the beatles made. </p>

<p>After that, it seems either they kept the spoof going (in press releases and album art), or synchronicity is at play. </p>

<p>I have seen a few photos that look a little like different people but ive seen too many that i know are the same person, to believe the conspiracy.</p>

<p>But who knows... Its a lot more interesting unsolved :D </p>

<p>Hilarious because the accent sounds terrible,  and it’s clearly not the beetle..  but if you stick through it there’s some interesting stuff-  the production on the video is very good for YouTube - a lot of time went into editing old clips and photos as well as the backwards messages hidden in the songs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a huge Beatles fan, and love this theory. (My own personal hypothesis is that there was a parallel universe-slip, and that Paul 1 replaced Paul 2 . . . and that neither is aware that a change occurred.) The current Paul McCartney (so far as he knows) has always <em>been</em> Paul McCartney. He is completely earnest and sincere in his avowals.</p>

<p>So there wasn&#39;t a &quot;look-a-like&quot; switched out for him. No look-a-like would have been able to sound like him, or play bass with approximate proficiency. </p>

<p>That fact notwithstanding (as with any set of identical twins), there are notable biometric differences: Like height disparities, ear-shape variations, dental differences, etc.</p>

<p>My own observation is that it&#39;s interesting that pre-1966 Paul&#39;s music was almost universally guitar-based. After 1966, he&#39;s always on the piano. In one interview Lennon was asked about McCartney&#39;s new piano obsession and Lennon said, &quot;Yeah, we can&#39;t get him off it.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li>Footnote: <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has had very chilling stories about other &quot;parallel-universe&quot; jump stories and Mandela Effect situations. I think McCartney (because he was so famous) was easier to document as having &quot;changed&quot;. But how many more normal people have undergone the same situation? </li>
