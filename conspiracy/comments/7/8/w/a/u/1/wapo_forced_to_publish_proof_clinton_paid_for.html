       WaPo was forced to publish due to overwhelming evidence provided by recently ungagged congressional witness. This is worse than Watergate.
      </p>
      <p>
       While a Republican paid for the initial Fusion GPS opp research on Trump/Russia, it was the Clinton campaign lawyer who paid for the British spy's fake Trump/Russia dossier. Dossier is a fancy french world for a big pile of bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same whistleblower said that Obama, the DOJ, the State Dept. and the FBI all knew about the pay to play Clinton Foundation kickbacks from Russia for 20% of America's uranium as far back as 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton took Russian bribe money to sell America's uranium to them, and then she tried to start a new cold war with them because she lost the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was all not supposed to happen because she thought she was going to win and that the Trump/Russia dossier would be fall back plan.

      <p>
       Just a small correction: it should read "a company capable of 20% of America's production capacity of Uranium" - not 20% of America's Uranium. Big difference. There are enough facts to talk about - no need to stretch any.

       Yes we did know this. It is a big deal now because the Trump suppoters didnt know this because the media they follow didnt report about it until now. It is a very useful distraction for people conditioned to hate Clintons.

       the new news is it was paid for by the Clinton campaign. its illegal for campaigns to work with foreign agents in a federal election.  the Clinton campaign actually did what Trump Jr. has been accused of

        almost

       no.  my (limited) understanding is they're the intermediary between the Clinton campaign and the law firm that got the payments to the foreign agent.  and i don't know much about the papertrail link.  iirc, there's a court thing with Fusion GPS trying not to release financial records that would show payments specifically coming from the Clinton campaign rather than the party.

       Remember he said he was waiting on some information on the JFK files release?  If it was me I think I would have said - if you guys admit to who paid for the dossier then I will release the JFK files redacted - otherwise I will release them unredacted.
