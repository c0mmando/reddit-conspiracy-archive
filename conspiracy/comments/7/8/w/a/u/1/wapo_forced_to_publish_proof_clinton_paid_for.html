<p>While a Republican paid for the initial Fusion GPS opp research on Trump/Russia, it was the Clinton campaign lawyer who paid for the British spy&#39;s fake Trump/Russia dossier. Dossier is a fancy french world for a big pile of bullshit.</p>

<p>The same whistleblower said that Obama, the DOJ, the State Dept. and the FBI all knew about the pay to play Clinton Foundation kickbacks from Russia for 20% of America&#39;s uranium as far back as 2009.</p>

<p>Clinton took Russian bribe money to sell America&#39;s uranium to them, and then she tried to start a new cold war with them because she lost the election.</p>

<p>This was all not supposed to happen because she thought she was going to win and that the Trump/Russia dossier would be fall back plan.</p>

<p>Just a small correction: it should read &quot;a company capable of 20% of America&#39;s production capacity of Uranium&quot; - not 20% of America&#39;s Uranium. Big difference. There are enough facts to talk about - no need to stretch any. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>no.  my (limited) understanding is they&#39;re the intermediary between the Clinton campaign and the law firm that got the payments to the foreign agent.  and i don&#39;t know much about the papertrail link.  iirc, there&#39;s a court thing with Fusion GPS trying not to release financial records that would show payments specifically coming from the Clinton campaign rather than the party.</p>

<p>They weren&#39;t forced to do shit. They decided to do it, because it was news.</p>

<p>This is worse than Watergate.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>What is the difference exactly?</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. You don&#39;t seem very smart, so I could see how you could get confused.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>She didn&#39;t take Russian bribe money, and she was one of a host of people in both the US and Canadian governments who signed off on the deal. And it was only a fraction of current US Uranium production.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>then she tried to start a new cold war with them because she lost the election.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What are you even talking about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This was all not supposed to happen because she thought she was going to win and that the Trump/Russia dossier would be fall back plan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The dossier was released before Trump even became the Republican nominee.</p>
