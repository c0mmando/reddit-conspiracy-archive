        Sherri pappini was a woman who was supposedly kidnapped and left a month later on the freeway, most think it was a hoax or at the very least she's lying about something. I went far down the rabbit hole when it happened lol

       I read  through the Sandy Hook or a lot of the documents. Everything good is blocked out. Only reports of testimony and investigations after fact, absolutely no piece of evidence or testimony proving anything from that day... literally as if FBI did an investigation after fact and published their interviews with people, none of whom were there on the day of the crime. So it doesn't prove a conspiracy - in fact in one doc FBI seemed to side with a YouTube conspiracy theory video maker because they weren't malicious or violent in intent. However, if there was a conspiracy or anything fake about this, there's also no way to rule it out as these docs don't really seem to prove anything. One could say FBI wouldn't ahve been in loop even if there was something up. I choose to believe it was a real awful event and grieve for the victims but those were the docs from what I could gleam....

       That never happened. It's something the neighbor said the mom told her. No one corroborated any of it. The mom sounds like a nut telling weird stories about her weird autistic kid. She said the fbi or the cia (didn't remember which?) came to the house because he had made it past two levels of security in a government computer system and then his screen went black. And then they didn't arrest him. This isn't a movie. That's not how hacking works and like I said there's no corroboration for the story ever happening.

       Right! And tried to recruit him. Also though keep in mind --- where is this testimony coming from? Not Nancy, she had passed at this point. So neighbors who didn't know much. So it's still all pretty thin if you ask me.

       The only thing I want to say about Sandy Hook is children died that day. I believe myself to be very open minded about conspiracies and i watched all the conspiracy videos came out and I had questions but I know people that went to those funerals. I’m close with people who had family members in that school that day. How it got to be that it happened, is where (if any) the story is.

       Well and all I can say is these documents give us no additional insight into what happened that day unfortunately, literally all hearsay and testimony from people who were not in the vicinity that day. Definitely strange people about AFTER event (nothing to do with Lanza, apparently) that were documented as well. It was hard to read everything so someone else found something interesting, please share.

       I have no doubt that when the media is jammed with a slew of stories that only serve to confuse you on what is real and what is not and test your skepticism, that something is quietly happening in the background, probably in plain sight and documented in those dusty political journals nobody reads except policy makers and people in the State Department.

       If you cant prevent information from being released, a proven method of protecting onself is to flood channels with distracting information. The question then is what are the limmited hangout distractions vs the real dammaging stories...
