    <div class="md"><p>I read  through the Sandy Hook or a lot of the documents. Everything good is blocked out. Only reports of testimony and investigations after fact, absolutely no piece of evidence or testimony proving anything from that day... literally as if FBI did an investigation after fact and published their interviews with people, none of whom were there on the day of the crime. So it doesn&#39;t prove a conspiracy - in fact in one doc FBI seemed to side with a YouTube conspiracy theory video maker because they weren&#39;t malicious or violent in intent. However, if there was a conspiracy or anything fake about this, there&#39;s also no way to rule it out as these docs don&#39;t really seem to prove anything. One could say FBI wouldn&#39;t ahve been in loop even if there was something up. I choose to believe it was a real awful event and grieve for the victims but those were the docs from what I could gleam....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That never happened. It&#39;s something the neighbor said the mom told her. No one corroborated any of it. The mom sounds like a nut telling weird stories about her weird autistic kid. She said the fbi or the cia (didn&#39;t remember which?) came to the house because he had made it past two levels of security in a government computer system and then his screen went black. And then they didn&#39;t arrest him. This isn&#39;t a movie. That&#39;s not how hacking works and like I said there&#39;s no corroboration for the story ever happening. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only thing I want to say about Sandy Hook is children died that day. I believe myself to be very open minded about conspiracies and i watched all the conspiracy videos came out and I had questions but I know people that went to those funerals. I’m close with people who had family members in that school that day. How it got to be that it happened, is where (if any) the story is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well and all I can say is these documents give us no additional insight into what happened that day unfortunately, literally all hearsay and testimony from people who were not in the vicinity that day. Definitely strange people about AFTER event (nothing to do with Lanza, apparently) that were documented as well. It was hard to read everything so someone else found something interesting, please share. </p>
