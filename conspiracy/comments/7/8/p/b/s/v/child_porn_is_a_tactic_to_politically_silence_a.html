       I believe that the influx of pedophilia is an indicator the deep state is silencing many people that can expose the real corruption, unrelated to pedophilia. Pedophilia is merely a tool to silence someone by assassinating their character. I also believe that different tactics are used depending on the individual. Many investigators gets the two bullet suicide such as Gary Webb and Vince Foster. We have Michael Hastings and Daphne Caruana Galizia who are journalists that got car bombed. Perhaps, insiders gets sexual assault/rape or pedophilia accusations, and outsiders gets the two bullet suicide or car bomb.

       Leave us not overlook that these are primarily unscrupulous and utterly ruthless people being taken advantage of, if it can be called that, by other and even more unscrupulous and utterly ruthless ones in a far bigger and even more sickening and sinister game once they've been put in a position to be blackmailed over their participation in it to get what they want by those who are capable of delivering it to them only because they have countless others just like them already under their thumb.

       It has been used as blackmail and also as a hazing practice in order to be accepted in their secret clubs. Of course it can be planted on people's computer but child abusers are a lot more common and networked than people realize as you can see with Epstein, hastert, wiener, Catholic Church leadership, and foreign dignitaries it seems to be a taste cultivated amongst the global elites. To assume it is false is a disservice to the victims who are already intimidated and terrified to break their silence.

       Too bad the sentencing for child abuse, exploitation, or molestation of a child on a first offense is very light.  Maximum sentencing  is around 3.5 years. Where as the child's life will forever be changed. Let's also consider that plea bargains are often entered to reduce the charges and sentencing.
      </p>
      <p>
       The system doesn't think child abuse is that big of a deal, but if you are choosing to ingest drugs on your own accord you better be careful. They will bring the hammer down and make sure you feel shame.

       On the bright side, it looks like there are 19 counts of child exploitation:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Paddock was charged Tuesday in a 20-count felony complaint for an arrest warrant.  He was charged with one count of possession of more than 600 images of child pornography, and 19 counts of sexual exploitation of a child, for crimes that allegedly occurred between Jan. 1 an Aug. 30, 2014.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Also, there is a hotline set up to gather any more information from the public.

       Well that is the nice side of things for this case. But it doesn't address the majority of cases in which the offenders get light sentences.

       Also I've yet to really dive into this case, so I can't properly comment on the merits to the charges.

       The system at the top is completely compromised judges, politicians, chiefs of police, military officers, too much to list are complicit and are themselves child abusers. I have a very liberal friend and she says she will vote for the most conservative republican if they would simply put children's protection on their platform. She is baffled that none of them talk about it. She has noticed how many pedo arrests have happened since trump is in charge and is not as anti trump as she used to be. Hopefully trump will leverage his record on child abusers because it will draw wide support across both aisles.

       It truly is horrible, how the system got so corrupted. It's been like this well before I was born. But now is not the time for hope, it is a time for action. Trump campaigned on action. I didn't vote for Trump but I'm glad he won. He isn't hoping America will be great again. His actions are a step in the right direction. Now it is our actions as citizens that will matter most. The light is shining bright on those who wish to hid in the shadows. It is time for the people to expose the criminals in our local government bodies. Put pressure on all fronts.

       And here I am again just talking about it. I need to really get off my ass. I just don't know where to begin, sorry for the ramblings. I'm trying to work up the will to act.

       I will be posting some research that is the follow up to a post I did about a month ago about the purity movement, and how they literally changed the course of history regarding children's rights. The actions they took can be replicated today on an even greater scale because of technology. We can all contribute in our own individual way, even artists are important for a movement, media, legal experts, all we need are passionate people who believe in the cause. 
I am putting an organization together to lobby for a constitutional amendment to make children a protected class, just as we do for minorities, women, and disabled. I am a bit overwhelmed in truth, I travel a lot and have a lot of family obligations, but I cannot give up. None of us can children are too vulnerable to put them in the hands of these corrupt psychopaths!

       I'm the product of abuse and I have a specific biases on the subject. It has taken a great deal of time to take control of my life. Still I'm not quite there. I don't really have an excuse any more though. So how can I help? If you can @ me on your follow up post. I'll look for your previous post to read.

       It was a BBC show that highlighted blackmail, and shadow govt, corrosion to torture and other things. Too real and got kicked off air maybe. I found it from a subreddit talking about the HBO show true detective and how that was also based on real events, as horrific and creepy as it was. True detective has crazy deep South Louisiana Santeria couple w child open. It was an incredibly well done show too. Eerie. It is even creepier considering all the pizzagate and Hollywood pedo info breaking headlines in a tidal wave currently.sooooo anyway both amazing shows. Utopia was BBC and I watched it on kodi. Also watch the wire.

       It's a little weird that on the same day it comes out that Bruce Paddock and Adam Lanza are both called out as pedophiles.
They are also linking Stephen Paddock and Adam Lanza together with the missing/destroyed hard drive.

       I saw that!  And that they named three other mass shooters who also did.  The impression I got from it was that they are saying "this happens all the time". Kinda like they are already making the counter-argument before people even have the chance to call bullshit on it.

       Maybe information is being released that wouldn't have been before, so as to make it obvious to even the general public that there are too many "coincidences" in these cases. Patriots fighting the deep state on the inside?  There's no way in hell that everyone with knowledge of these things is happy that they're perpetrated by, or with help from, our own government.

       I understand your viewpoint but at the same time,  pedophilia is becoming deeply ingrained in our society on all levels. There are darknet sites dedicated to amassing terabytes of cp, making accessible to anyone, there are criminal organizations pimping out children to any joe schmoe who has a few hundred bucks in his pocket. You have teachers, coaches, and beat cops abusing children as well. Even the scummiest addicts on the bottom of society are still prone to sexually abuse minors.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell even in ancient greece it was common for older men to have a young boy companion for sexual gratification. It is simply not logical that child pornography exists solely to discredit people. Especially since pedos normally hold positions of power in our society and 90% of people don't seem to bat an eyelash
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything the reason, I think, pedophilia seems to becoming more mainstream is as a result of our instant gratification society. We live in a society where we expect every pleasure to be at our fingertips. There is always another forbidden fruit to sink your teeth into,  pedophilia is just another kink these days, and it is a kink that just happens to be shared by the global elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had an absurd thought the other day with all this hollywood pedo talk hitting the front page recently. What if sexually abusing kids was like what golf, or cocaine used to be to the business world? A hobby you can share with others on your level, that lets you bond, build report, and of course have fun with others in your caste?

       I believe that the influx of pedophilia is an indicator the deep state is silencing many people that can expose the real corruption, unrelated to pedophilia. Pedophilia is merely a tool to silence someone by assassinating their character. I also believe that different tactic are used depending on individual. Many investigators gets the two bullet suicide such as Gary Webb and Vince Foster.

       Its not an influx. Pedophilia has been used as blackmail in political circles since at least the 80's.

       Many very powerful people tempt colleague/competitors into illegal acts to create a lifetime of leverage against them. Or you are Podesta, the Ronald Reagan Teflon of pedophilia and sadism. Leverage apparently doesn't always work.

       Watch Unacknowledged on Netflix. The last few minutes lists multiple reporters and journalists who tried to uncover the truth about UFO phenomenon who were all jailed for possessing child pornography. I would imagine it is fairly easy to upload kiddie porn to a hard drive for an experienced hacker. Easy way to shut someone up.

       I saw that!  And that they named three other mass shooters who also did.  The impression I got from it was that they are saying "this happens all the time". Kinda like they are already making the counter-argument before people even have the chance to call bullshit on it.

       Lanza was a pedo I read his original docs. I think he was mkultra and st.rose of lima abused. It was very apparent in his eyes.
