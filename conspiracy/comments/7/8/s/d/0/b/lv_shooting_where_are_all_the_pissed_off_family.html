<p>There are a lot of people who seem to think that I&#39;m suggesting no one was shot or died. I&#39;m not saying that at all. Like the title of my post says I&#39;m asking where are all the outraged family members?</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m a little surprised (<em>I probally shouldn&#39;t be</em>) by the number of people who keep saying they have inside information about this. They knew someone directly, etc., etc., etc. There are 323 million people living in the US and about 500k on this subreddit but magically a lot of people here seem to have inside knowledge on how the casinos work and have Facebook friends who knew someone blah blah blah. I don&#39;t buy it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, I believe that people did indeed die in LV. I also believe it was a False Flag, which makes it that much more heinous, considering that I believe our own government actually <em>murdered</em> 58 people. I think the reasons the media want&#39;s to move on, and will ignore these family members regardless, is because of the multiple holes in the time line and Campos&#39; story, because I think there was likely a 2nd shooter. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think so as well. The way it sounds to me is that he was the distraction. When the security guard came up, he popped out of 134 after shooting himself. Then yelled and took cover. The shooters in 135 blasted the hallway. Campos then distracts the security guard long enough to keep him from calling in the location. This gave the shooters enough time to do a little more damage and escape leaving paddock. They could of barricaded the stair door from The inside with through bolts so the police entering the floor couldn&#39;t access the stairs and see where they escaped.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was an AR round (~0.223&quot;), it&#39;s actually a fairly small caliber.  Also depends on where he was hit in the leg.  What it mostly grazed it?  --I&#39;m still suspicious he was allowed out of the country.  Whole LV story is fucked.  And how quickly it&#39;s off the news <strong>with many questions unanswered</strong>??!!! 500 people wounded, 58 killed, by basically machine gun.  Old guy is found dead in the room, no reasoning behind it, and oh yeah &quot;he made millions gambling and from his apartment complex.&quot;  But now we hear too that he was on an FBI surveillance list due to multiple phones, and money transfers from off-shore shell companies, etc.    <strong>There is WAY more to this story than has been told to us.</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Should&#39;ve passed through unless it hit the bone.<br/>
Aaaaaand that wasn&#39;t a high caliber. It was a .223... which is pretty small. Aaaand you don&#39;t know how direct the hit was.<br/>
Or if the bullet was full metal jacket, lead, copper, or hollow point. Or how thick the door was he shot through (i guess not hollow point then, actually)<br/>
aaand stfu. If you want to play armchair detective, that&#39;s a good thing. Just actually <strong><em>try</em></strong> to understand things before making claims about fact. Especially when making claims about a victim.<br/>
Try practicing these qualifying statements &quot;It seems to me&quot; or &quot;with my limited understanding of x, it seems to me that y should happen&quot; etc.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Speculating on Mexican... except that his name is Jesus Campos.<br/>
Close range wound THROUGH A DOOR.. and he managed to help the cops for a while after, so probably not too direct.<br/>
And did you know, people rent cars to drive places? That&#39;s not too weird. He was interviewed by the police immediately afterwards.<br/>
 The police obviously verified his employment... and I&#39;m sure swabbed his hands for gunpowder residue.<br/>
I mean, he was helping the police DURING THE SHOOTING!!!!<br/>
WTF are you thinking?<br/>
After that, he&#39;s pretty free to travel because this is a free country.<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure he was &quot;fleeing&quot; from the press and conspiracy theorists.   </p>

<p>Ya i seen that. But in the video you can clearly hear the nurse or whatever say turn off the flashlight. Its dark as fuck and you cant see shit why would you turn off the flashlight? Then he says of you been shot in the chest or side or whatever and the guy goes really? and doesn&#39;t show any sort of blood or anything. that is if we are talking about the same video</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Family members are probably keeping tight because of lawsuits.......................  Why don&#39;t you actually go out and gather some facts, instead of thinking no bad things can ever happen in this world without some crisis actors fooling you.  God that pisses me off.  I believe full on this whole las vegas thing is a false flag, and fucked up, but crisis actors is such a naive, easy way out to think.  Lawsuits are happening, that&#39;s a fact... go gather evidence for your little story of fake injuries, or wait, no injuries on people... I guess you haven&#39;t looked through pictures from the event.  Or seen video of people dropping, in blood.  I gotta stop reading comments in here by people like you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re looking at the theory and deciding which facts to examine based on which theory you like. I&#39;m asking you to just look at the facts, and then see which theory fits.</p>

<p>FACT: hundreds of people were supposedly shot.</p>

<p>FACT: there are hundreds of images and videos of this event.</p>

<p>FACT: none of these images and videos contain a bullet wound.</p>

<p>If you disagree with any of these facts, provide your source.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These peoples relatives with long facebook histories said their deceased one was in LV during this shooting.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that prove that the official explanation is correct? How?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>So all these people have no gun shot wounds? </p>

<p>If they do, there still isn&#39;t any proof, weeks later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen gunshot wounds. There was one guy showing off a wound in his side, it looked like a hole. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve also got to remember that people who are dealing with being shot or their loved ones being shot, people who are personally affected, are not going to be thinking about how to prove to people on the internet that they were shot or their loved one is dead to the extent that they are going to go posting detailed up close pictures of their injuries. There is plenty of footage of wounded and dead people, which is disturbing to see, but every time someone who is convinced no one died actually looks at any of these images they just claim they&#39;re faked.</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s hard to believe that your law enforcement agencies/government would ACTUALLY murder people, but the truth is that they do. Do they also use crisis actors? Yes, to drive the narrative the way they want and to confuse and divide the truth community with arguments about how this person is obviously a crisis actor therefore it must all be fake, but then this person KNOWS someone who was killed, so it must all be real. The truth is it&#39;s both. But people really did die and they really were hurt. There is tons of evidence, you just don&#39;t want to see it.</p>

<p>Just search in Youtube &#39;vegas gunshot wound&#39; or vegas eye witness compilation and you&#39;ll see a lot.</p>

<p>You also have to realise that many many many of the witnesses and victims are NOT saying the same thing as what the authorities are saying - they are claiming there were multiple shooters etc. If they were really crisis actors, why wouldn&#39;t they all be saying the same thing as the LVPD? Some of them are undoubtedly crisis actors, witnesses who are there to back up the official narrative. But there are many many many witnesses and victims who challenge the official narrative, they cause a problem for the LVPD and the FBI. So clearly they&#39;re not on their payroll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol... dude, sometimes you gotta use some kind of common sense.  &quot;We still can&#39;t prove&quot; please don&#39;t include me or anyone else in here with your logic of nobody being shot in Las Vegas.  You&#39;re one of those &quot;crisis actors&quot; excuse for every god damn bad thing that happens?  I can&#39;t explain it, so it must be crisis actors.  Jesus Christ, I believe full on that this thing is a false flag.  But thinking people on the ground were just laying there in blood, made from what? Ketchup packets in their pockets?  Go look for some victims your own self if you believe everything is a crisis actor.  That ignorant logic honestly pisses me off, it takes away what fucked up act actually happened.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>4 Canadians were killed there, including 3 from the province I live in. One of the victims, Jessica Klymchuk, was a <em>single mother of FOUR children, bus driver and teachers assistant</em> and well known in her small community of around 2000 people. Are you really, seriously trying to imply she was somehow in on some American conspiracy? There are really no words for how idiotic that is. You think she abandoned her life in some small town that is not even in the US, abandoned her children and her career in which she spent most of her waking hours helping children?</p>

<p>Here is a statement by her employer

I am not good friends with these ladies so as much as I would love to ask them about it, it would be rude to bring up a trauma. One of them apparently saw a girl get shot in the head in front of her, one of them was injured, and the other got away with just the psychological scars. That&#39;s all I know! And yes, the official story doesn&#39;t make sense for shit. But I guarantee if you lived around here, you would believe that people were shot.

<p>You guys really lack any kind of consequnece and logic.

Really, explain away.
Your point of view is untenable, unexplainable and unjustifiable. She was well known in her community, but you say she didn&#39;t exist and by extension, this school board doesn&#39;t exist, and the school she worked at doesn&#39;t exist, and the kids who go there.. don&#39;t exist?
Or she ran off to take part and die in some American conspiracy for no apparent reason.........?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know anyone who was in the shooting directly, but there were not one but two people shot - one who died (Sonny Melton) - from a town about an hour away from where I live called Big Sandy, TN. My wife grew up just down the road a ways from there. Big Sandy is a tiny (the paper said about 500 people), very insular town. Nobody who lives there isn&#39;t &quot;from&quot; there. Nobody moves <em>to</em> Big Sandy.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.wbbjtv.com/2017/10/03/big-sandy-community-shocked-las-vegas-shooting-affects-another-family/">Here&#39;s a local news report about it</a>. In the video they interview a local flower shop making ribbons for the family - I do know those people. My wife&#39;s parents know them well. That&#39;s where my wife ordered flowers for our wedding. Those are good people and I can assure you they are not &quot;making it up&quot; or faking it.</p>

<p>I understand skepticism. I&#39;m skeptical about some of the things in the official report that don&#39;t make any sense. But I just can&#39;t believe the whole thing is made up. The people in Big Sandy are honest, churchgoing people. If they&#39;re getting together for a vigil to mourn someone in the town who died, then someone in the town actually died. </p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t more people angry? I&#39;m sure they are, but I don&#39;t think most people, especially in a town like Big Sandy, assume that the official police story of what happened is wrong. And even if they did think there was something strange about it what would they do? 20/20 is not going to come down to Big Sandy to interview angry parents. </p>

<p>I think there is so much fuckery going on with LV, but I don&#39;t doubt the shooting actually happened and that people were killed (the videos that came out that Monday were really sad, like the one where the guy checked a woman&#39;s pulse (on her neck) and blood foamed out of her mouth). </p>

<p>However, I think there is a cover-up going on and I&#39;d like to know why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have inside information about this, as an avid lurker in this sub I know just about the same as everyone else here. However someone I know personally was there, and was shot. I have visited her, and I have photos of her in the hospital. She&#39;s been struggling with severe PTSD, and this event affected all of her friends and family members.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only become aware of conspiracy facts fairly recently, after going down the fluoride rabbit hole because of a white stain on one of my teeth. That&#39;s was what it took for me to starting questioning everything, but I hadn&#39;t really been immersed in it until I started lurking this sub. I didn&#39;t dig too far into Sandy Hook, so I don&#39;t have my own opinion about whether it was a hoax or a false flag. I did however do a lot of reading about 9/11 and what I learned has convinced me that the government can and will kill to push whatever agenda it has. I haven&#39;t personally met anyone who has died as a result of 9/11, but maybe because I have more knowledge of facts about it than I do about Sandy Hook, I believe that the almost 3k casualties truly did exist.</p>

<p>If I hadn&#39;t t actually known and seen someone who was shot in Route 91, I would most likely still be open to the possibility that it could&#39;ve been a hoax. Everything has just been so shady and information about the whole thing is so unreliable, I totally get where OP&#39;s coming from. What truly convinced me beyond a doubt that it was not a hoax was witnessing someone I&#39;ve known prior to the event as a victim in recovery.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to verify my identity as a normal person, but I&#39;ve been to the Global Meetups and other <a href="/r/LosAngeles">/r/LosAngeles</a> meetups, and have met some of the mods. So feel free to take my 2¢, or leave it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Should&#39;ve passed through unless it hit the bone.<br/>
Aaaaaand that wasn&#39;t a high caliber. It was a .223... which is pretty small. Aaaand you don&#39;t know how direct the hit was.<br/>
Or if the bullet was full metal jacket, lead, copper, or hollow point. Or how thick the door was he shot through (i guess not hollow point then, actually)<br/>
aaand stfu. If you want to play armchair detective, that&#39;s a good thing. Just actually <strong><em>try</em></strong> to understand things before making claims about fact. Especially when making claims about a victim.<br/>
Try practicing these qualifying statements &quot;It seems to me&quot; or &quot;with my limited understanding of x, it seems to me that y should happen&quot; etc.      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because the MGM CEO unloaded 80% of his MGM stock for a cool $10.1 million profit 3 weeks before the event, miraclously and coincidentally avoiding the 13% stock price loss since said event, it proves nothing.</p>

From a real user  Keep it up!

    <div class="md"><p>Then go to LV and ask the people directly, there are plenty of witnesses. And oh well, you can also make Background checks if they&#39;re &quot;real&quot; persons and not some actors too...</p>

<p>But it&#39;s easier to write all that bullshit while sitting on the ass at home in front of the computer in the comfort zone.</p>

<p>You guys really lack any kind of consequnece and logic. Always stating the same lame and stupid arguments, the media and internet is controlled by the government and may i ask from where you got all your &quot;hints&quot; that this could be supposedly a hoax, well you got it from the internet and media... Could be a bit too complex and paradox for you to understand, but don&#39;t worry you&#39;re not alone as some others here prove well.</p>
