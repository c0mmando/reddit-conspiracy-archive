    <div class="md"><p>Nope. It&#39;s just the audio that&#39;s been augmented. The background &quot;oh my gawd&quot; girl doesn&#39;t change pitch or energy in her demeanor at :19, not that she was the one who got hit, you just don&#39;t hear anybody react in a way that would be consistent with what OP claims in the video.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that, to be honest, I didn&#39;t see <em>anybody</em> getting hit (again) even though people keep putting that shit in the title. You can just <em>hear</em> the bullet sounds like they are approaching and hitting the ground - which sadly can be easily added to the video before being released, of course. I don&#39;t buy that anybody was hit there. Sorry, and cheers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lmao...apparently you haven&#39;t. Take your 5.56 and shoot a steak from 400 yards (small hole due to loss of acceleration...force = mass x acceleration). Not to mention, a leg is not a head. There isn&#39;t the same volume of a pressured cavity relative to surface area, you wont get the &quot;watermelon&quot; effect anyway...and, again, 400 yards = reduced impact. Also, 5.56 isn&#39;t what I would consider &quot;high power&quot;.</p>

Within 20 feet pretty fucked up damage. 1000 feet away would lose most of it&#39;s power. This looks real. Especially as it was probably lobbed up in an angle and just barely made it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As others are saying, two people def got shot in this video, girl in her inner thigh and the guy at the end. My question is though the girl gets shot from straight on and is still in the video as notice the two girls walking in the picture right before guy gets shot but they are all looking from behind in a diff direction like from behind so two completely diff angles of gun fire. Weird how the video cuts out RIGHT then. But then Again maybe he stopped recording when he got shot</p>
