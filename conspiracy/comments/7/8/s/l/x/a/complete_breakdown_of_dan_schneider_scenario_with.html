       So the story goes that Dan Schneider from Nickelodeon (creator of every Nickelodeon tween show since the 90's) is an alleged pedo who has slept with Jamie Lynn Spears, Jennette McCurdy, Ariana Grande, Amanda Bynes and COUNTLESS other young child actresses.
      </p>
      <p>
       He has a confirmed foot fetish, which can be proven by watching any of his shows, which always have a lot of barefoot scenes and scenes focused on feet. He has even SOLICITED pictures via Twitter of children's feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dan Schneider worked at Nickelodeon with Brian Peck, who was an actor and convicted child rapist who worked with Bryan Singer. These alleged abuses by Peck allegedly took place in a dressing room AT NICKELODEON!
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to working together on “All That”, Schneider and Peck ran a “Two Week Comedy Boot Camp” for children where they were separated from their parents. Here is an article connecting Schneider, Peck and Nickelodeon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an article from 2002 proving the Schneider/Peck Connection:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the article about Peck's arrest and subsequent conviction:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Another convicted Child Rapist and child acting manager Marty Weiss was convicted of raping one of his clients. Marty Weiss was able to get some of his clients on “iCarly” (another Dan Schneider/Nickelodeon project).

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a young actress talking about how she was BLACKLISTED from the business after walking out of a barefoot Dan Schneider audition for Nickelodeon as a child. They also discuss the devious ways the agents and producers separate children from their parents and have complete supervision of them.

      </p>
      <p>
       He was also alleged to have unsupervised pool parties and sleepovers with kids. Here is the link to that:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, it has been confirmed that only recently, ALL of the usual phone numbers at Nickelodeon have been routed through some sort of automated voicemail system now. You have to leave you name, phone number and hope to get word back. But you cannot reach any actual people if you call Nickelodeon. This only started recently as the rumors began swirling online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a good rundown written recently for Red State:

       When my niece was 7 she watched Nickelodeon all day. I have noticed these foot fetish references more than once but assumed it was nothing sinister.

       Just look around. It's more then just subtle feet references. This man (and Nickelodeon) have verifiable, tangible DIRECT connections to convicted pedophiles.

       Just trying to keep this going. We have to keep making waves until they say something. I can tell you we confirmed that Nickelodeon has switched into full "straight to voicemail" mode right now. They are panicking.

       Just to clarify, what exactly does a straight to voicemail system accomplish that a person couldn’t take care of already? A receptionist can just say “he’s not in” or “I’ll get him you’re message” or just hang up. I’m lost on that one.

       Because believe it or not, Nickelodeon's main offices aren't totally besieged by phone calls every 2 seconds. It's not like they are running a giant call center. Like any normal busy office, a volume of calls come in and get handled by one or two main receptionists. But when you have your normal phone activity/traffic, and combine it with a few dozen more calls every hour on TOP of that, it begins to get a bit overwhelming. People have been slamming them with calls relating to Schneider (and to an extent, Chris Savino too).

       Where did you get your information? It’s THE LARGEST child broadcast network in America. How do you figure their call volume isn’t large. My friend works as a graphic designer for Nickelodeon in NYC and she says they’re always getting calls from people suggesting new ideas for shows and shit. Seems like you’re just assuming a lot and based on those assumptions and the little tiny bits of suggestive facts we have, combining that into a Dans a pedo theory. Don’t get me wrong, the dude is fucking weird. But what grown man that makes children shows for a living isn’t. To jump to pedo is kinda crazy.

       Oh. You have a friend who worked at Nickelodeon? Cool story. I've actually worked at multiple media companies. They are broken up over so many offices, locations and divisions. And their MAIN numbers filter out the majority of the trash calls you are talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about MAIN offices, upstairs. At a corporate level. The other numbers that are usually answered by a secretary or a medium-level receptionist at a higher level. Straight to voicemail. I Know what I'm talking about, despite what your "friend" tells you.

       You know what you’re talking about but I’m the one with a current direct source. You’re going off assumptions and I’m going off of a current employee. But YOU know what you’re talking about? No doubt theirs a pedo problem with the TV and Film industry, but this conspiracy is loony toons. Too many assumptions to be plausible. When you’re looking at videos with pedo in mind all you’ll see is pedo. When I watch these videos people claim are creepy I just see the zany kids show I grew up watching.

       Big deal. Leaks had begun by then. For years we’ve heard he wasn’t the most gentleman like person in Hollywood. It was said on the podcast that it isn’t news. What’s your point? I’m not saying it’s impossible for Dan Schneider to be a sleezball pedo. I’m saying there’s not a single shred of legitimate evidence suggesting so, no accusations, nothing. Amanda got sober, she’s got her act together now, she could come out and say it if it were true. She’s not. No one is. This is extremely an extremely asumptuous theory. Loose links no facts.

       We have discussed at length why. People like Amanda would lose what little income they have in the form of royalties as Nick is re-branded and vows to never show any Schneider created shows in syndication again. It's the Cosby effect. For someone who is trying to act so knowledgeable and pissy with me, you're a bit of a retard.
