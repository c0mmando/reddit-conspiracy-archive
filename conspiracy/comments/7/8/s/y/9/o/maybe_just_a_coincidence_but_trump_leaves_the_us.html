    <div class="md"><p>Fascism is many things. It&#39;s really just National Socialism, hyper capitalistic on the outside to deal with other entities, but entirely socialized internally in order to provide the best output for the state as a whole. Individuality is lost for the &quot;greater cause&quot;</p>

<p>Refusing Fascism, or being Anti-Fascism, does not make you immune from having fascist tendencies. Like jailing those who misgender people, or jailing those who would not give their kids hormone treatments because at 8 they think they want to be a girl/boy forever.</p>

<p>This terrifies me, when an Indian senator holds a rally of less than 50 people and thousands turn out to protest.</p>

<p>When Milo/Ann Coulter were shut down even though the Federally funded college planned it with them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the examples you listed are fascism (and the thought of RF or Antifa jailing anyone is absurd). Participants of Antifa are largely either communist, anarchist, or a hybrid of the two, which doesn&#39;t fly with fascists at all. They are very pro-gay, pro-trans, pro-feminist, etc., which are things that fascists consider degenerate. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an article on fascism that you may enjoy. Some of the points can apply to almost any group, such as a sense of group identity, but the points start to paint a clearer picture when looked at as a whole, along with the article. It&#39;s an interesting read if you&#39;re interested in the subject. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anti-Fa and RF are a toxic hivemind. Ideology has been lost.</p>

<p>When they riot in the streets and break windows and protest free speech on federally funded properties, and tear down federally funded statues, they are committing economic terrorism against the US taxpayer who has to front the bill for repairs and police.</p>

<p>This is not a winning movement for many and seen as deliberately polarizing. I will never accept their &quot;opinion&quot; or protest to &quot;break my capitalistic spell&quot; by making my tax dollars go towards campus repairs instead of free speech.</p>

<p>The fascism obsessed loonies single-handedly propelled Milo into larger fame then if they just let him give his speech to 50 people that showed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Antifa doesn&#39;t need agreement to accomplish their goals. This is one of things I find interesting about the tactic. They can piss everyone off and still &quot;win.&quot; The only thing they need to do is attack neo-nazi rallies and frame the debate. Many people, perhaps even most people, want to be reasonable, or at least consider themselves reasonable. For many, the reasonable position is in the middle of two perceived extremes. Attacking neo-nazi rallies gets press attention, and they are identified as the left. This very slowly moves the middle to the left. Outside of sports, the left is more likely to riot, and the US keeps moving to the left. People condemn riots, but they&#39;re a winning political tactic. </p>

<p>If they&#39;re goal is to be so disgusting that normal people start to re-kindle their views of morality and perhaps religion, then yes they are winning.</p>

<p>I hope you realize they can &quot;slowly&quot; win themselves into a Christian resurgence if they go too far with there rioting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s being won, because local election after local election, the GOP is coming out ahead. If they were winning, 2018 should be a battle, not a blowout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The GOP is moving to the left. Tons of Trump supporters like Milo, who is openly gay. This wouldn&#39;t happen twenty years ago. Twenty years from now, a popular conservative could be trans. Maybe sooner. The whole left/right thing is fluid, and the center is moving left more than right. </p>

<p>Christianity is moving to the left as well, just as Judaism has. Islam will follow. </p>

<p>Human culture is two steps left and one step right. People voting Republican means very little when the Republican Party keeps moving to the left. </p>
