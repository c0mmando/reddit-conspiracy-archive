       I was just thinking that. It scares me that this is even a consideration that people will be breaking into homes for a "purge" of conservatives. How can you know if someone is conservative or not by looking at them?

       Yea man, I have pretty good Spanish but they are not going to stop and check if you live in a white Rich neighborhood they are just going to shoot and kill. That's why I am thinking of getting a short barrel shotgun, and maybe a 38special or 45 with a extra large mag.

       Yea, so maybe it is that "knowing that Trump is out of town, we'll just plan a civil war" type thing is more likely instead.

       Fascism is many things. It's really just National Socialism, hyper capitalistic on the outside to deal with other entities, but entirely socialized internally in order to provide the best output for the state as a whole. Individuality is lost for the "greater cause"
      </p>
      <p>
       Refusing Fascism, or being Anti-Fascism, does not make you immune from having fascist tendencies. Like jailing those who misgender people, or jailing those who would not give their kids hormone treatments because at 8 they think they want to be a girl/boy forever.

       None of the examples you listed are fascism (and the thought of RF or Antifa jailing anyone is absurd). Participants of Antifa are largely either communist, anarchist, or a hybrid of the two, which doesn't fly with fascists at all. They are very pro-gay, pro-trans, pro-feminist, etc., which are things that fascists consider degenerate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an article on fascism that you may enjoy. Some of the points can apply to almost any group, such as a sense of group identity, but the points start to paint a clearer picture when looked at as a whole, along with the article. It's an interesting read if you're interested in the subject.

       Anti-Fa and RF are a toxic hivemind. Ideology has been lost.
      </p>
      <p>
       When they riot in the streets and break windows and protest free speech on federally funded properties, and tear down federally funded statues, they are committing economic terrorism against the US taxpayer who has to front the bill for repairs and police.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not a winning movement for many and seen as deliberately polarizing. I will never accept their "opinion" or protest to "break my capitalistic spell" by making my tax dollars go towards campus repairs instead of free speech.

       Antifa doesn't need agreement to accomplish their goals. This is one of things I find interesting about the tactic. They can piss everyone off and still "win." The only thing they need to do is attack neo-nazi rallies and frame the debate. Many people, perhaps even most people, want to be reasonable, or at least consider themselves reasonable. For many, the reasonable position is in the middle of two perceived extremes. Attacking neo-nazi rallies gets press attention, and they are identified as the left. This very slowly moves the middle to the left. Outside of sports, the left is more likely to riot, and the US keeps moving to the left. People condemn riots, but they're a winning political tactic.

       If they're goal is to be so disgusting that normal people start to re-kindle their views of morality and perhaps religion, then yes they are winning.

       I hope you realize they can "slowly" win themselves into a Christian resurgence if they go too far with there rioting.

       I'm not sure what's being won, because local election after local election, the GOP is coming out ahead. If they were winning, 2018 should be a battle, not a blowout.

       The GOP is moving to the left. Tons of Trump supporters like Milo, who is openly gay. This wouldn't happen twenty years ago. Twenty years from now, a popular conservative could be trans. Maybe sooner. The whole left/right thing is fluid, and the center is moving left more than right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christianity is moving to the left as well, just as Judaism has. Islam will follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Human culture is two steps left and one step right. People voting Republican means very little when the Republican Party keeps moving to the left.

       Left and Right are division tactics, please stop dividing.

       We are all humans, and common sense party is prevailing, this is why you see the GOP becoming more centrist/populist

       The left/right paradigms are alive and well. I said "right," and you thought "GOP." As long as the terms are used on a regular basis, the paradigm will thrive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Culturally, what was left 20 years ago is centrist today, and what is left today will be centrist 20 years from now. Economically, the wealth gap keeps widening, so the right is winning on that front.

       are using the same costumes and techniques used during the at that time "anarchist," protests against G20, the violent demonstrations used as a reason to block anti-G20 demonstrations.  black clothes, masked faces, carrying sticks.

       Blac block's been an anarchist tactic for a while now. And they were going to block anti-G20 protests anyway, thats why the anarchists were so passionate about protesting them in the first place.

       Shit that was 20 years ago.  I was immediately struck by the similarity in costumes and techniques. The violence, the masks, the sticks and how totally out of step with the main body of demonstrators, just lie now with antifa.  The fake antifa gang is each time completely disconnected with the main demonstrators.

       Just reporting what is out there.  If you use it as an opportunity to better prepared than use it.  If you wanna continue with the lambs to slaughter, then go with that.  Or the third choice - make up your own mind and prove things otherwise
