       Only conservatives care about solving a mass murder of this scale? How is this a partisan issue?  Is the political left too busy investigating that Nazi that crashed his car into a lady 3 months ago? Why is Fox the only channel that will allow the questioning of law enforcement narrative?

       I didn't say that. There is a conservative bias to Fox News. You criticized the source. I say the silence from CNN/NBC/ABC is deafening.

       That son of a bitch needs to go... he's the one who refused to show wtc7's collapse when Dr. Steven Jones went on his show... fucking corperate con artist. Someone probably is paying him to act like he's actually investigating... he wont actually show anything that matters on his show, won't conclude anything about the story. He's still a scumbag.

       At least it's keeping the story alive and keeping a public spark for a real investigation. Hopefully by a 3rd party since it seems the police there are being silenced.

       Right, I agree. I'm not trying to not give him credit, it's just too late for him. He defended the official narrative in the first few weeks, when it was most critical. And he has a long history of lying through his teeth. He's an absolute snake, this doesn't change that fact.

       Basically. Tucker is "red pilled" and definitely runs the risk of mysteriously disappearing. Honestly though, I figure they would use financial leverage to shut him up rather than violent.

       On the other hand, if he keeps pushing and there is something big at the bottom of this, he becomes a household name and his name is written in history books. So if he is just asking obvious questions for clicks, i bet he backs off if pressure is put on. If he actually sees something bigger, could be hard to stop him

       I just began watching him semi occasionally over the summer. I have a feeling he is pretty /pol/ like in mindset at this point, especially with his willingness to bust out FBI crime stats when ever convenient. He does that, and how he questions so much seems to really show how open minded he is, and what he thinks. It makes me happy at least one guy like that is still a part of the legacy media.

       It all gets pretty interesting and downright curious, maybe even  a tad "conspiratorial" as soon as you start turning over a few rocks...
      </p>
      <p>
       the Saudi Prince, Alwaleed bin Talal, who is a major shareholder in the Four Seasons Hotel in the floors just above where the shooting supposedly took place and why the Saudi Royals are said to routinely stay there, also just happens to be the second largest shareholder in Murdock's "News Corporation" that also just happens to own and control Fox News, doncha-know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Going after Campos and the Mandalay certainly continues to distract any attention away from the Four Seasons or any possible involvement in the shooting either coming from or escaping to that upper and completely separate portion of the building the Four Season's owns and controls rather than MGM which seems to be scrambling and falling all over itself in a state of damage control that implies that all the fault and lack of security, etc. etc.. lies strictly on their part.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was looking for a possible motive or reason why Fox might let Tucker loose or encourage him to go after this particular line of inquiry while all the others have steered clear of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not implying anything about Tucker who's exceeding good and downright entertaining when it comes to taking certain events and certain people apart that obviously aren't on the up and up, or as truthfully given as they've been presented as being, and that's perfectly OK and a job, as I've said, that he's very good at doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are, of course, all kinds of news items that what he's either advised or instructed to concentrate on are decided by others, whether Tucker is involved in that decision making process or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would be driven by a consensus of it being important enough, not to mention good for Tucker's image and ratings for him to go after and put a show together on which this is, but may also be convenient in other ways that aren't so apparent.

       This is what I'm not getting either. This is nothing but controlled opposition. He's going to be totally safe and fine.

       Nothing's going to happen to him. He's an establishment controlled opposition puppet. Man, how easily you guys take the bait. They appeal to the "conspiratorial types" even slightly and all of a sudden the MSM has won your trust. Blows my mind.

       There will be some smear campaign against him started any day now...  Inappropriate sexual advances are all the rage now.  I expect something like that from some intern 10 years ago to mysteriously surface.

You are supposed to be edgy rebels, saying fuck the man and stuff!! You're not supposed to actually want the truth known and the responsible held accountable!!!1!1one!
