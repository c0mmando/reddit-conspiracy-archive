    <div class="md"><p>It all gets pretty interesting and downright curious, maybe even  a tad &quot;conspiratorial&quot; as soon as you start turning over a few rocks...</p>

<p>the Saudi Prince, Alwaleed bin Talal, who is a major shareholder in the Four Seasons Hotel in the floors just above where the shooting supposedly took place and why the Saudi Royals are said to routinely stay there, also just happens to be the second largest shareholder in Murdock&#39;s &quot;News Corporation&quot; that also just happens to own and control Fox News, doncha-know.</p>

<p>Going after Campos and the Mandalay certainly continues to distract any attention away from the Four Seasons or any possible involvement in the shooting either coming from or escaping to that upper and completely separate portion of the building the Four Season&#39;s owns and controls rather than MGM which seems to be scrambling and falling all over itself in a state of damage control that implies that all the fault and lack of security, etc. etc.. lies strictly on their part.</p>

<p>I was looking for a possible motive or reason why Fox might let Tucker loose or encourage him to go after this particular line of inquiry while all the others have steered clear of it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not implying anything about Tucker who&#39;s exceeding good and downright entertaining when it comes to taking certain events and certain people apart that obviously aren&#39;t on the up and up, or as truthfully given as they&#39;ve been presented as being, and that&#39;s perfectly OK and a job, as I&#39;ve said, that he&#39;s very good at doing. </p>

<p>There are, of course, all kinds of news items that what he&#39;s either advised or instructed to concentrate on are decided by others, whether Tucker is involved in that decision making process or not. </p>

<p>That would be driven by a consensus of it being important enough, not to mention good for Tucker&#39;s image and ratings for him to go after and put a show together on which this is, but may also be convenient in other ways that aren&#39;t so apparent.</p>
