    <div class="md"><p>I just watched a three-part segment over at the End Times News Report with Jake Morphonios.  One of his theories is that Paddock&#39;s brother Bruce was caught up in that child pornography bust back in February when 426 people were arrested.  I don&#39;t think Bruce was arrested at that time, though.</p>

<p>Jake&#39;s theory is that maybe Stephen Paddock agreed to work with the FBI in orer to keep his brother out of jail.  Or, Stephen Paddock himself could have been involved - maybe he had child pornography on his own hard drive and the FBI found out while investigating Bruce Paddock.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve also read that even though Stephen Paddock had been at the Mandalay Bay for a week before the shooting, he could have driven back to Mesquite, Nevada one or more times during that week.  Could he have left his hard drive in his Mesquite home during one of those trips?  Is that why his home was broken into after the shootings?</p>

<p>I&#39;m just throwing out ideas here.  </p>

The ones who give conspiracy theorists a bad name by literally thinking everything is a conspiracy and calling you a shill/plant/stooge/etc if you don&#39;t buy in, and the ones who like to have an open mind about things and question from alternative perspectives.

<p>No, I can&#39;t agree. They can&#39;t detain someone just because he witnessed a crime. He told the cops what he saw, and after that, he was free to do whatever. </p>

<p>I&#39;m confused; you&#39;re upset that the cops <em>didn&#39;t</em> detain him (or imprison him) weeks after he witnessed the shooting? Or by what specific method are you thinking the police should have revoked his freedom to travel?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I agree with you that this is weird, but can we please stop pushing the MSM agenda that a standard 5.56 AR is a &quot;high-powered&quot; weapon!! You&#39;re just feeding into the &quot;Assault Weapon&quot; agenda when you say that. The 5.56 round was specifically designed and adopted because of its ability to incapacitate without killing in most situations. You&#39;re not even legally allowed to hunt deer or any large game with it in most places. Just because you can shoot rapidly doesn&#39;t make it a &quot;high-powered&quot; gun. Just look at a comparison between the 5.56 and the 7.62 and you&#39;ll understand what I mean. You&#39;re just feeding more legitimacy to the people that want to attack your constitutional rights.

    <div class="md"><p>While the combat effectiveness of the .223 has been the subject of debate since Vietnam it is none the less a lethal round. The same debate has existed for the 5.56. It was designed to be more lethal than the .223 not some ‚Äúless than lethal‚Äù alternative. You‚Äôre talking about the ability of a to kill / incapacitate with a single round. Obviously the 7.62 or larger is more lethal in that regard. When you‚Äôre talking about lethality of burst or full auto fire you can‚Äôt try to claim it is a deadly weapon. Tumbling and fragmentation will cause wounds that are very difficult to treat. The MSM has latched onto the AR-15 because it‚Äôs so common and shares commonality with a military assault rifle. I don‚Äôt know what point you‚Äôre trying to make. The MSM ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù is your preconceived notion based on listening to the obvious bullshit they continue to spout.</p>

<p>It&#39;s starts right at the <strong><a href="https://youtu.be/6AZ8mDUbXpY?t=54s">0:54 mark</a></strong></p>

<h1>Just to clear things up:</h1>

<p>Tucker Carlson did <strong>not</strong> say he <strong>went to</strong> Mexico 7 days after the shooting.  He <strong>returned to the US from Mexico</strong> 7 days (almost to the hour) after the shooting.  So that would be about 10:00 p.m. on Sunday October 8th.  </p>

<p>I guess he had to get back so he could attend the &quot;award ceremony&quot; held in his hnor on October 10th.</p>

<p>We do&#39;t know exactly when Campos <strong>went to</strong> Mexico.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this user on conspiracy telling people they don&#39;t trust the MSM coming out to expose false flags is definitely suspicious.... Or not. It&#39;s pretty fucking peculiar that the media are questioning THEIR OWN narrative when we know that they run off of a script and have been involved in false flags and the cover ups in the past. So coming from a 5 year old account, I agree with this guy. Whilst it&#39;s possible for liars to speak truth at points, it does not suddenly make them trustworthy. I think it is important we don&#39;t forget the role of the media in all of this, and don&#39;t blindly trust or follow what they say just because it suits <em>our</em> narrative. A broken clock is right twice a day, don&#39;t think you can trust Carlson, FOX, so on, just because on this ONE instance, they are questioning the narrative. If anything, this should make us entirely suspicious of what the goal is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>One of the questions Tucker Carlson asked in his segment was  &quot;ABC Nes talked to Jesus campos on October 4th.  Did they know he was in Mexico at that time?&quot;</p>

<p>And if you remember, October 4th was on a Wednesday.  It was the same day President Trump went to Las Vegas and Jesus Campos <strong>did not meet with him.</strong>  Maybe because he wasn&#39;t <strong>in Las Vegas?</strong></p>

<p>Here is the ABC tweet:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/KenLayne/status/915806315611512833">https://twitter.com/KenLayne/status/915806315611512833</a></strong></p>

<p>Posted October 4th at 10:10 p.m.</p>

<p>Something else interesting I noticed is the first comment after that.  It&#39;s a link to an article from people Magazine:</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://people.com/crime/heroic-unarmed-security-guard-took-on-las-vegas-shooter-stephen-paddock/">Heroic Unarmed Hotel Security Guard Took on Las Vegas Shooter and Led Police to Stephen Paddock‚Äôs Room</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Despite being injured Campos heroically continued to help police, <strong>using his key pass</strong> to help police clear hotel guests out of the other rooms on the floor, until authorities made him leave to seek medical treatment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Jesus Campos had a key pass according to this article - meaning he could have gone into the adjoining room 32-134.</p>

<p>Also - at the time the police were clearing the other rooms on that floor - had they already been told that Paddock allegedly had rented that adjoining room to his suite.  If not, wouldn&#39;t they have tried to clear that room, too, or did they stay away from it because it had the room service cart in front of it with wires going underneath the door and they were afraid it was booby-trapped?</p>

<p>And what time did the police make Campos leave to seek medical treatment.  Where did Campos go to get medical treatment?  Did he go to a hospital and if so, which one?</p>
