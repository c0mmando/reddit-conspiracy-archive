        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I think TPTB are overseeing this &quot;toppling&quot; of the entertainment industry and its ties to sexual abuse. The peasants need to see one of the pillars fall down, so they still
Have faith in the system. </p>

<p>The elites will topple one institution after another, to save their own skins and divert attention away from where the problem really lies, so long as the public demands answers as we are now. </p>

<p>They cannot let the general population realize, that many of their most respected public servants and trusted officials are actually potential child rapists and serial killers. They do not want the general public getting a peek at their secret and deviant  &quot;culture&quot;. </p>

<p>I feel as if they have had this planned for years in advance.</p>

<p>So, knowing that this is likely their plan, a &quot;limited hangout&quot; scenario, how are we able to subvert this? How can we better expose them? </p>

That is the real blackmail material holding this house of cards together. It&#39;s systematic in all high ranking facets of society. Everything from the media to politics. They will lose in the end.

<p>Other thing is, by this point isn&#39;t it obvious to just about all of us that there is SOME kind of counterforce pushing against these satanic pedophile assholes?
