       Okay I'll try keep this short and sweet. So I've been in and out of the rabbit hole many times to the point it has affect how I view the world and also has had an impact on my overall happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is. If everything is evil and influenced by Satan according to many religious people. How can I even enjoy anything anymore knowing there could be a chance I'm dancing to their tune in some sort of way. Following this stuff drains the fun out of literally everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Playing videogames, watching movies, listening to music. People believe all of this is influenced by evil. How much merit is there to all of these claims and how can I reclaim my sanity and be okay with just existing and not paying any attention to it. If the higher ups want to control us then isn't this what they're accomplishing by conspiracy theorists spreading all these theories around by people believing in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we don't pay any of these claims no mind won't they lose a lot of control the supposedly have over us. We give these topics and theories all of energy and I believe this is what makes them so powerful to the point they have an impact on the mentality of people. Are we destroying ourselves by buying into all this conspiracy crap?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm so confused about everything lately. What is right? What is wrong?

       Capitalism is mind control, principally consumerist. This should be obvious, alternatives might be better if more genuinely democratic and less warlike. We seem to have the technology and scientific potential to make the world better within a more democratic and egalitarian paradigm.

       Modern capitalism is based on consumerism, this in turn depends on mind manipulation without full individual consent or awareness.

       This statement doesn't make sense, your world view is so brutally skewed.  Yours is an argument they've used to indoctrinate people into wanting communism.  The ironic part here is you probably already live in a communistic nation, you just don't know it or what those terms mean.  They are simply trying to hammer a self destructive behavior into you, and you eat it up like a dog.

       It is very direct, you can use your attention to relax it from going out towards objects and let it fall back to its source.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you ask yourself what am I, what is my essential self and let awareness be aware and investigate your experience, you will arrive at your true nature of boundless peace.

       How do I break my conditioning without relying on psychedelics though? Also can I still enjoy playing videogames and watching YouTube and stuff if I was fully aware. I would love to discover my true self but how on earth do you actually do it?

       Finding your true self seems like an impossible task when you live in a world that focuses on the superficial. I'm just really confused by all this.

       The thing is that your very awareness is already your true self. Check out teachings of nonduality from Rupert Spira on youtube.

       After realisation you will continue to act and do stuff just as before.

       Don't assume that you must isolate yourself from everything and everyone to start searching for your true self. Nothing wrong with YouTube, playing videogames but you will never know if it's your concious decision to do so if you don't try to understand yourself.

       The fact that you listen to underground music makes me think you're on the right path and will find happiness soon enough. I was in your same state a few years ago. I could relate to nearly everything you mentioned in your post. I personally found happiness by letting go of the social stigmas and rebelling against them as much as possible. Details would be too much to type, but feel free to pm me with specific questions or w/e

       That he is. I might take you up on that offer. Thanks bro :). Also I'm very particular with what media I consume in general. Its like what they say with food. 'You are what you eat' can be translated to you are what you consume in regards to entertainment. I like music with heart and soul in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me wrong now, I'll bop my head to a lot of mainstream music that is garbage with no substance but its only throwaway music so I treat it like so. I'm conscious enough to not let it affect me subliminally. I know it poisons the mind of a lot of people.

       I used to dj in college for a pretty big club, so I had to try and enjoy the mainstream stuff although I would typically mock it in person.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also particular about the media I consume. I couldn't agree more. The second I see/hear some propaganda or Bernays type tactics being used, I shut it off. I feel like I'm hyper aware of it now, which can get annoying. It's almost like having a sixth sense..
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm trying to do the same with the food I consume, but that's turning out to be a lot harder for me to say no to :)

       Just continue to do what you're currently doing and enjoy the world around you. I don't condone living in ignorance but part of the advantage that the "higher ups" have over us is that humanity wakes up and progresses individually, not as an entire race so they'll basically always have a nice supply of people to manipulate.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're having trouble letting go of some of these things, it means you are not ready to let go of their influence, which is fine. It takes time to awaken.

       I always question everything. I don't watch the news. I try to think for myself. I'm trying my best in life but for whatever reason I never seem to be happy with my outlook on life because I know deep down that all of it is bullshit. I'm having a pretty significant existential crisis right now lol. I know there's more to life than what meets the eye. Its just finding it seems to be the holy grail of lifes journey.

       Being self aware in a world full of a sheep is a curse because you alienate yourself from a lot of aspects of modern day society making it near impossible to relate to most people :(. Its really hard to deal with. Trying to even talk about something like this to a person not in the know results in them staring at you like you have 3 heads.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I'm crazy when I try talk to people in real life about stuff like this. They say I'm too deep and shouldn't take life too serious but my brain just over thinks everything.

       It is a curse. But it is also a double-edged sword. People become hermits and live in seclusion for exactly this reason. You said you were never really happy with your outlook on life. That's because this life we live really isn't genuine. It is not a conspiracy theory that the world we live in is nothing short of terror. The truth is, humanity is regressing and it has been for ages. Nobody knows this because the majority collectively regresses together, so they compare themselves to each other instead of in the past tense.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is a tough life when one is actually aware of the predicament at hand. It isn't supposed to be easy, you're up against majority rule. In a world full of skeptics and ignorance, there isn't even a point in mentioning anything of any nature to anyone. The majority's sole goal is to knock down anything that doesn't fall in line with their fabricated sense of history. It is just simply out of their scope of comprehension. Learn the reality of the situation for your sake and use it to liberate yourself. You do not have to completely isolate yourself from society, either. Sometimes, it is okay to feed the  crocodile so you do not get eaten. But don't let it talk you into anything else, lest you become another sheep.

       There is far more to life than this nonsense game of political figures and Illuminati that virtually everyone seems to play. Unfortunately, it is up to you to find it.

       I try to find pride in going against what the system wants you to do. Don't buy shit, learn how to not pay for things including taxes, don't go into debt unless you're using it to play the system. Turn off the tv and don't participate in mind numbing conversations with stupid people about what's on "the news". Hell even be a narcissist about it if you want to. Just don't give into social pressures for no reason. Think before you act and ask yourself are you doing this bc you want to or bc you feel like you should.

       Get outside and enjoy the beauty of natural. That's one thing that isn't controlled by evil. Being  inside watching movies &amp; tv, playing video games are alll influenced by evil. So, go hiking or kayaking. Go hang out with your friends and enjoy friendship. Don't let this evil world steal your happiness. 
And if your new to digging in "rabbit holes" you will be in shock for a while bc your blinders are off now and you now see how fked up this world really is. Once the shock wears off.... your happiness will come back bc you learn how to deal with it.

       I'm not religious though by any means. Everything I've witnessed in life makes me believe everything is by chance. There is no meaning to anything. Nobody actually knows the truth. We just believe whatever makes us feel good about ourselves.

      <p>
       I've tried praying. I've been told I'll burn in hell if I don't accept Jesus as my lord and savior. How can I get onboard with something that would so easily judge and crucify me just for asking questions and being open minded. I find it best to go against the grain and that goes for religion too. If the masses think something is true that more than likely makes it the opposite because that would be too convenient for life. Suspiciously convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to be apart of some group that all have the same beliefs because I think that severely limits the capacity of our brains and is an insult to our intelligence as humans. And as for the rabbit hole. I've been looking all this stuff up for years now and its confusing now more than ever.

       meditate. yoga. chakras. this is not fake.  it will allow you to find tourself.  Think about how your senses tell you about the external world.  Now ask yourself how do you explore the internal world? Your mind is just as vast as the universe itself but most people have been denying what we refer to as spirituality.  If you open your mind and give it a chance I think you will figure things out.  The point of life, to me, is simple.  We chose to be here in this physical manifest to experience life in a different form so as to build ourselves and improve.  If you are here, you have a lesson to learn, you are the only one who can say what that is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also specifically referring to the mindfuck that is the state of our world, I try not to dwell on the goings on of rich evil people, instead try to spread this knowledge of what you have researched within your circles of friends and family.  Make it fun and informative but get people to ask questions and engage.  I have been doing this and I can notice a more aware sense of being from my circles.

       If yes, then don't worry about it.

       Start by defining what evil is to you. You mention satan so I assume you are using the biblical interpretation of evil. Evil in the Bible is anything that goes outside of God's plan for you. Read all the red text in a standard Christian bible and you will either find what you should be doing or not doing. In summary, it is about loving God first and everyone else equally as you would yourself (assuming you care for the general well being of yourself).

       Whether Christian or other religion the point is learning to live a happy loving life free from material obsession. Everything in this world, especially now is tied to profit, control or whatever on the material plane. That's what idol worship is really in the Bible is fiending for material garbage to fill our lives up and replace organic joy.

       That includes our leaders and anyone else in power. So, as Jesus said in mark 12:17 - "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."

       Let the world bury itself alive (mentally) with the next new trash designed to get your money and you simply focus your mind and energy to something greater than yourself. I believe it is a tactic of subversion to destroy religion (an individuals focus on something intangible that they view as having more authority than any human, that's a no-no for control freaks).

       If you can convince a population to become narcassitic, paranoid and isolated, you can control them better.

       The history of 'public relations', propaganda and Edward bernays. Freuds nephew I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Research psychology or philosophy. Read from the greats.

      <p>
       Jung, Allan watts, and Kierkegaard are very relative to you and your question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kerikegaard if you are experiencing a bit of existentialism (spiritual).
      </p>
      <p>
       Watts if you want to clear out the mental dust (or any other source of eastern philosophy. I find Taoist concepts to be very powerful for this. (Taoism saved my relationship with my SO!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Jung if you find yourself really fucked up and kind of need to get your shit together. Integration of the emotional baggage you couldn't shake from religion or philosophy.

       I am so glad I happened to see this post just now. I have been feeling the exact same way as you have. For most of my life, I've been particularly non-religious in a very small, conservative town. Once I moved away to University, I found myself reading up more on science, conspiracies, what the meaning of life is...etc. Sometimes I wish I were like my friends who are blinded by their cell phones, makeup, and reality TV. Try to talk to them about these subjects and you start to convince yourself that you're insane. It's rough.
      </p>

       Now that my eyes have been opened to all of the craziness happening in this world, I can't help but think knowledge is truly a curse sometimes. I now feel like I'm two separate persons living in one body. When I'm alone, I'm reading up on what is going on with the world, formulating my own opinions about current events, asking myself what the hell is going on... And when I'm in public or around family and friends, I'm who I wish I could be all the time: happy-go-lucky, not worried about anything...just a bubbly 20-year old girl that can't wait to finish her degree, have a career, and settle down.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope this is just the initial shock of it all. I hope this is a normal way to feel once you take off the rose-colored glasses. I'm not sure I have any advice to give you just yet as I am still figuring out how to deal with it on my own. I just want you to know you are not alone. You are not insane for questioning anything. You are human.
