       yeess! the true conspiracy is the history of humanity/civilization.. take the piri reis map that the ancient aliens used a lot in there show.. it dosent show the cost line of the south pole under the ice, they control the narrative by pointing that out so you cant se the really important parts of the map!

       That's exactly the goal of the flat earth notion, to discredit legitimate aspects of our world and our history. If you think humanity hasn't had previous contact with extraterrestrial/extradimensional entities then you haven't read into it. Our ancient history is filled to the brim with references to other beings.

       Nope. I think it started a few years back when some jokers from the Church Of The Subgenius looked around for the most bizarre and ridiculous conspiracy theory they could find and reboot it for the shits and giggles thereafter. So they chose the old Flat Earth idea which had been floating around since Victorian times, and what we have now is the result. A whole new subculture of home schooled ignoramuses who've never traveled further than the State Fair and have been brainwashed into believing every word in the Bible is true (not that they actually ever read it).

       I'm pretty sure it goes deeper than that. I know one guy who was promoting it, and he's also one of those sovereign citizen types. They float it like it's a franchised confidence game along with the whole "The laws don't apply to me, join my seminar and find out how you can be law free" schtick. He nearly had a heart attack when I started to talk to him about shortwave radio propogation and why it proves the earth is round.

       Equating a world religion, which millions if not billions of people subscribe to as a belief system, which can also loosely be credited for a lot of advancements in our western society and culture historically, with the flat earth theory is pretty small minded of you.

       Most if not all flat earthers identify as fundamentalist Christians who take their FE cues from the Bible. I am not a Christian (any longer) in part because I could not reconcile the dichotomy between Biblical belief and scientific truth. Science says the Earth is a globe, and I find that easier to accept than the beliefs of a bunch of nomadic goat herders who had no idea where the sun went at night. In fact I don't find FE belief any more bizarre than much of the rest of the Christianity story. Unicorns and talking donkeys? Really? At least Harry Potter states clearly on the cover that it's fantasy fiction.

       Yeah, and science says we all evolved over billions of years from a gigantic explosion called the Big Bang...yeah we all evolved from star dust floating around the galaxy. You know I work with an atheist p, and even though our beliefs are polar opposite we still have discussed this whole volition thing...I always go back to where are the millions of missing links that would have to exist as we've made this supposed transition from tadpoles or whatever bs scientists say we came from up the evolutionary ladder to where we are today?

       You'll only answer those questions if you look at the evidence for evolution with an open mind and a willingness to accept new truths in the light of solid evidence. So play 'Devil's Advocate' for a while. Doesn't mean you have to accept the other point of view, just explore the world from that perspective.

       He didn’t weigh the earth with the balls. He was able to approximate the density of the earth and extrapolate from there. I read the page and watched some of the video. A quick Wikipedia search of the cavendish experiment shows that the moron that created that page and video has absolutely no idea what he’s talking about. He’s such a idiot that in his mind, if he can’t understand it then it must not be true. Don’t believe a word that page says.

       Ok. You’re crazier than I thought. You’re one of those mental midgets that thinks science is a religion. I don’t understand how they figured out the value of the gravitational constant, I’m not a physicist or mathematician, but if they didn’t have an accurate value then we wouldn’t have space travel or satellites.

       No, mass and weight are not the same thing, so to find the weight of something is not to find its density. Not at all, sorry. But they have a relationship that can be understood, because the less dense something is the less it weighs.

       Yes I do. Why do you keep saying without electricity? Man has only had electricity for a short period of time, We were able to cope quite well without it. For instance around 200 B.C. Eratosthenes calculated a rough circumference of Earth.

       I told you what to type into a search engine, and like I said, you won't have to hunt, the top results will be what you'd need to see.  I provided a way for you to see the evidence, but you're too lazy (?) to do anything that takes one more step than clicking a link.

       Actually people thought the earth was flat for most of human existence...and then some scientist or philosopher decided to state the earth was a sphere...even though they had no technological ability to prove their theory...no planes, no space ships, no high altitude balloons...nothing but a theory that has somehow become fact because it's been said over and over and over again...and backed up by NASA's complete bs photo of the earth on their supposed way to the moon.

       Isn't that the point? You trick a handful of people in believing something that is obviously false and stupidly so to most other people. Then you point out that the gullible idiots believe other crazy things 9/11 conspiracy theories. It's all just to discredit valid claims.

       I'll keep my mind open to anything until proven otherwise. Do I believe we went to the moon...no. Do I believe the constantly changing earth "blue marble " NASA photos...no, do I feel the earth rotating 1000s of miles an hr...no, have I ever witness in my life water leveling itself on a sphere, no. Do I believe the obviously fake international space station videos with all crew sitting in the same spot with all their pants hiked up to their chin, shirt tucked in, women with hair pointing straight up, not moving at all, all while appearing like they're being suspended by wiring harnesses...um no I don't believe they're in space. I could go on and on with questions I have that cast doubt on the supposed fact we live on a ball earth. I didn't say definitely that I believe one way or the other, just I have many questions that need legitimate answers.

       Why do you care what someone else believes. If the majority of the human population believes in some type of God that created everything why can something like a flat earth theory be 100% untrue?

       I myself believe the Earth is a globe, I still read up and hear other peoples perspectives about flat earth because some have a very strong argument.

       Dude, people can fly around it. And when boats sail beyond the horizon they start to disappear because of the CURVATURE of the earth. If the earth was flat you would see them forever. And these are things you can see by yourself, and if that is not enough for you then you need help.

       50 Kms = 31.069 miles. The earth has a radius of 3965 miles. Using Pythagorean theorem, that equates to an average curvature of 7.98 inches per mile. So using your 31.069 distance that would mean that boat would be 248 inches below the horizon... 248/12 equals 20.666 feet below the curve that object would be.

       Oh we can fly around it, but just not over the poles...sorry I forgot. We can explore anywhere in the world but not the North Pole or Antarctica.  The whole boat sailing over the horizon has been debunked many a time...you've obviously haven't researched much if you still believe that line. There are many videos online with people going to the beach and focusing on a boat "going over the horizon..I mean the curvature of the earth"...but funny you use any modern zoom lense and that boat that appeared to disappear over the ball earth's curvature magically comes right back into frame. It's all based on humans eyes and their limited ability to see long distances and the horizon's vanishing point. Just as we can stand on a street with light poles going all the way to affinity and the farther the poles the smaller and smaller they get until they appear to vanish...but I'll bet you that if you continue walking down that street you'll find that the poles are indeed the same hight it's just our eyes perception of them getting smaller.

       there are telescopes that can 'see' something the size of a car at over 500kms and so you're telling me IF I were to put it outside NY harbor I'd be able to 'watch' those ships
       <em>
        all the way
       </em>
       until the telescope could see no further, i.e. 500kms?
      </p>
      <p>
       You're saying I'd be able to see Lots of ships with such a scope

       Did you know that for a few decades, RADAR couldn't "see over the horizon" as it travels in a straight line?
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        The super high frequency radio waves used by most radars, called microwaves, travel in straight lines. This generally limits the detection range of radar systems to objects on their horizon (generally referred to as "line of sight" since the aircraft must be at least theoretically visible to a person at the location and elevation of the radar transmitter) due to the curvature of the Earth. For example, a radar mounted on top of a 10 m (33 ft) mast has a range to the horizon of about 13 kilometres (8.1 mi), taking into account atmospheric refraction effects. If the target is above the surface, this range will be increased accordingly, so a target 10 m (33 ft) high can be detected by the same radar at 26 km (16 mi).
       </li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Siting the antenna on a high mountain can increase the range somewhat; but, in general, it is impractical to build radar systems with line-of-sight ranges beyond a few hundred kilometres

       I've studied the Space Age at university and the idea that we didn't get to the moon is laughable. Not only have we taken stuff from the Moon, but we have left retroreflectors on the Moon that people can shine lasers at. How would they get there?

       First, just because you "studied space age at a university" doesn't mean a dang thing...Yeah, and we've ALL been told throughout our education indoctrination that the earth is round, and we've went to the moon...what does that prove?  That our school propagates lies to push an agenda? So, because I didn't learn about true monetary policy and the fact the FED is a privately owned centralized bank in school, does that make it any less true?

       I'm not saying there aren't reflective mirrors on the moon, but what's to say man put them there, and not a robot? Soviet Union supposedly sent unmanned robot to leave mirrors there to...doesn't mean man went to the noon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of moon...why haven't we gone back? Kinda convenient NASA has lost all telemetry data for all the supposed moon landings. Also convenient they've supposedly erased over original moon footage. Oh and also the fact the moon never appears to rotate...we always see the same side of the moon.

       We haven't gone back because it's prohibitively expensive and there's not much on the moon but rocks. Out of interest, when everyone would watch the rockets go into space, where do you  think they went? The whole world was watching and the USSR didn't say shit about it being fake because they knew it happened. It's just a weird conspiracy to have imo

       Ok, so now your turn...speaking of planes...if the earth is rotating a certain way, should a plane going with the rotation of the earth get to its destination a lot faster than if it were to go against the rotation? How can a plan flying at 500 mph go against the rotation of the earth that is going thousands mph and ever get to its destination...and why would they even try? How about a helicopter that hovers in one spot...wouldn't the earth be rotating under it? But that's not what we see...a helicopter can hover in one spot for hrs and the earth magically has not moved underneath it has it?

      <p>
       Its actually slightly faster to fly with the Earth, but remember everything including the air is being pulled downwards to Earth. The North Winds are a result of the coriolis effect and that is why flying with rotation is a little quicker (Not by much though) but the winds are the driving force not the rotation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything is moving at the same speed. This is the reason why when you jump on a plane moving 600mph you dont fly to the back. You the plane and everything in it are all moving the same speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same principle applies to the planet. The planet and everything on it are all moving the same speed.

      <p>
       Again because the helicopter is moving at the same speed as the planet when it takes off. Look back tot he jumping in the aisle of the plane analogy.

       Why do you not fly to the back of the plane?

       Man...I thought the exact same thing when I first heard about this so called flat earth conspiracy...I was like WTF...now this is going to far! But I also thought the same about 9/11 conspirators back in 2007/2008, but when I actually indulged those crackpot conspirators...you know what, they were right, and I'm so very glad I did, as it has opened my eyes to the true world we live in, and not the world we've been told and taught by our ancestors and teachers in school. Like I said, I don't definitively say it's not a sphere, but man I'm sure have some legit questions now that I've actually looked into it. I never believed the moon landings after I looked into it, but I'm sure as shit did prior to. Too many anomalies, too many convenient mistruths and conflicting accounts, and it just doesn't line up. Think about it...we went all the way to the moon and back on less technology than we possess now in a smart watch...through the Van Allen Radiation Belts 6 various times without any major incident. No stars in the pics...NO STARS...why, because it was impossible to fake that without someone researching and debunking...so they just left it out!

       Well as far as I know the earth is may be a cube. I've never even left my home system or been up in the air. I live a 2d world. Heck maybe there is nothing outside my immediate area and this is all fake. Or maybe I'm fake and you're real.

       Reptilians were invented by David Icke well before 2001, so unless you're saying he knew 9/11  was coming and made it up way beforehand as part of some elaborate plan, I'm afraid not.

       It's based on the premise that NASA is lie. And given all the blatant fucking lying that happens by TPTB, it's easy to get sucked into the evidence of NASA fuckery. I can say 100% it's not a PSYOP, because it has deeply religious undertones.

       Earth is flat. You dumb asses think you are spinning 1000 mph while hurling through space at 67,000 mph. It's so retarded people believe this is true ,despite never seeing the earth. Then thinking it's a psyop to discredit truth. It is The Truth and you thinks it's not. You are hopeless.  Even after you are shown NASA is faking space, you guys still believe their lies. You are hopelessly brainwashed and are going to look ridiculous in the very near future when you brainwashed fools release what's going on.

       its because you and everything else, including Earths oceans and atmosphere, are spinning along with the earth at the same constant speed
      </p>
      <p>
       its only if earth stopped spinning, suddenly, that we would feel it. Then it would be a feeling similar to riding along in a fast car, and having someone slam on the brakes
      </p>

       Think about riding in a car or flying in a plane. As long as the ride is going smoothly, you can almost convince yourself you’re not moving

       That makes no sense at all. Pour some water on a ball and spin it. Everything flies off , it doesn't stick to the center. Water never curves.  Never. I live on a lake. There is no curvature. I drive to the ocean. There is no curvature. It's a flat Horizon. Horizontal line. If it wasn't a flat line it wouldn't be called a horizon.

       You ball earthers don't use common sense. But it's understandable when indoctrination has replaced your ability to reason.

       Exposed? Notice I'm the only one here? If it were a psyop it would be shilled non stop. Flat earth threads never get Upvoted . And , most the usual suspects are the ones trolling the threads about it that do get posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for your satellite. If you had half a brain you would know they are models. And they never get launched into space and there are not thousands of them orbiting the earth at 17,500 mph( about 30 times the speed of a bullet, btw).
      </p>
      <p>
       I just told you are someone else water doesn't curve around a ball. Notice how your indoctrination completely ignores that fact, and instead tries to disapprove that with satellites? It's retarded. Water Doesnt Curve.

       Gravity is a theoretical pile of crap. They don't know what is at the center of the ball, at all! It's a theoretical pit of fire and magma and you dumbasses believe that too. You think Vegas is full of b.s. evidence, so is the ball earth psyop.

       Have you been in Argentina? Lovely place it doesn't look like the end of a flat disk... Sadly I never could go to the cape of hornos en el archipiélago de fuego cuz that is chile territory(didn't have visa)
      </p>
      <p>
       So, my suggestion is every time you have a discussion with a FE you should say "hey boludo, take a plane to buenos Aires(yes get your cospiranoic ass of that couch) once you are there ask about the Argentinian transpolar flight it used to go from the capital to Auckland directly!

       Of course you didn't expect that. And naturally it will offend your NASA programming. What do you think is going on for an object to illuminate the way the moon does? And if you say it's the earths refraction from the sun casting a shadow, you lose, because that's the crap you are taught. But use your critical thinking and what do you think is happening?

       Well apparently we live on a flat disk but everything else we can see isn't a flat disc and the moon is a transparent ghost thing. I'm not sure what both of them in the sky at once has to do with anything... Flat earth or round. so please explain.

       That one came out of nowhere fast. One explanation is that it was a coordinated effort by some organization that has a decent financial backing. It's possible that the campaign is being run on social media to force an association between the people who investigate corruption by authorities with people who believe impossible ideas.

       I agree. Flat earth theory is a disinformation campaign to keep people from looking into "conspiracy theories". They do this with a lot of shit too. For 9/11, you'll see people saying that the planes were holograms or that the towers were destroyed by magic alien weapons, and they do this to keep people from considering the fact that the attack was carried out by "allies" to the US. For JFK, they'll say there were magic bullets and secret additional shooters, and they do this to keep people from considering the fact that Lee Harvey Oswald worked with US intelligence and was likely a patsy just like he claimed before he was assassinated.

       I don't, but I'm beginning  to think that constantly dragging that dead cat here and harping on it when there's better fish to fry is certainly beginning to look like a conspiracy of it's own.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you have the temerity to say you haven't even bothered to look any of it up!
      </p>
      <p>
       By and large the vast majority of Flat Earthers thought the idea was utterly preposterous and set out to debunk it thinking it should be a piece of cake.
      </p>
      <p>
       The more they delved into it the flimsier the arguments and unproven assumptions the globe model depends on actually turned out to be and they continued to find increasingly more evidence that challenged and conflicted with that perspective.

       Efforts to actually find and mechanically verify the curvature that should exist and be easy enough to prove over appropriate distances simply wasn't there. Instead they found that there are perfectly flat and level plains that run for more than a hundred miles without any sign or interruption of what can be seen caused by a curvature that by all rights should be there if the model and dimensions of the globe were correct but quite simply aren't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Slowly and steadily they are accumulating precisely those kinds of contradictions and asking for answers that they're not getting because those who should be able to answer them can't and are resorting to ridicule and ad hominem attacks instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, precisely the same kind of attitude that is directed against those of us attempting to investigate any number of other possible conspiracies here because of flaws, anomalies, and inconsistencies in the official narratives we've been handed about those.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I have no idea who any of the "truth movements" are outside of any ordinary everyday people who happen value knowing the truth for themselves and know that truth doesn't depend on what any majority of people or consensus of experts happen to think or believe no matter what they happen to call themselves, including a whole lot of attention seeking "truthers" making money off of being ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now the Flat Earthers keep to themselves and have their own forums and don't bother with the hodge-podge of others that get kicked around here that don't directly apply to their efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doubts about the Moon landings, the ISP, and NASA fakery in general, that many of here know isn't completely on the up and up and seems to be deliberately hiding something from the rest of us are all genuine conspiracies from their perspective, have to be, from their perspective, in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line they are no different than any of us here and they have taken nothing if not practical and intelligent ways of pursuing whatever the real truth may be in the face of some very hefty odds that not only don't need any help from us, but would actually be promoting the same kind of attitudes we ourselves have to combat.

       Listen, my friend, "I know" what I studied and what I was taught in school and read in my textbooks and from other sources of reference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I "believe" that it was all 100% perfectly true and completely accurate? The answer is "no", of course not.
      </p>
      <p>
       A great deal more information exists now that explains many of those things both differently and better and there's no reason to believe that the new and present information won't be superseded by something else that may be different and better sometime in the future, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do I "believe" what is different and new now, even if it is better, to be 100% true and completely accurate? No more than what I originally believed what I studied and was taught to be, which is to say I've always left that open and subject to change because that's simply the actual reality and why new textbooks and reference works continually come along to replace old ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Does not believing what "I know" from that educational experience and process prevent me from using that information I was given for practical and pragmatic purposes for which it is good enough for what I want or need to accomplish? As matter of fact it doesn't, even though the explanation I was given for why I'd get those same results has changed from what it was.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the nature of what I have tried to explain. "Belief" is an act of faith. A psychological commitment to some particular idea, concept, or theory,
       <em>
        as if
       </em>
       it was 100% perfectly true and completely accurate which nothing is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it may interest you to know that there isn't a single scientific experiment that can prove that the Earth is moving or in motion. Not one. Yet there are no less than three, perfectly repeatable ones, performed by respected scientists that demonstrably prove that it isn't and can't be moving at all, and although they are a matter of scientific record none of them are taught in any science courses at any level. Do I need to tell you why they aren't, or do you think you can guess the only logical reason for that?

       Yes well just don't look too hard at any of those tests or bother your little mind about any other just as possible explanations for them besides the pre-conceived one you already have or who knows what might happen to you if the "shadow of a doubt" ever disturbed your smug certainty about this very uncertain and unusual little world we happen to live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I am not one of "you guys", as you put it. I'm simply open-minded enough to realize that where there are genuine inconsistencies, anomalies, and contradictions in any official or orthodox narrative that narrative isn't and can't be completely true.
      </p>
      <p>
       How, and in what ways it's not true, and that can range all the way from a little to being completely false, remains to be seen but one thing is certain and that's that isn't and never was worth anyone "believing in" or fighting over and that's where you and I differ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I happen to find the experiments the Flat-Earthers are exploring and conducting and the questions that they're raising to be both interesting and worth paying some attention to, if for no other reason than the fact that the globe model you happen to believe is the only smart, modern, and sophisticated way to look at and interpret what we observe is a 500 year old concept that no one has really bothered to re-consider or re-check in all that time because truth be told they have been just as forbidden to as they were previously forbidden to entertain that idea itself, and you my friend are among the kind of people who want to forbid and deny the existence of any other possibilities besides the one you have been inculcated from childhood to believe in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not realize that if you didn't wholeheartedly subscribe to and endorse Newton's completely materialistic and mechanistic model of the Universe you couldn't be a scientist and couldn't get any experimental work that implied that it was wrong, no matter how repeatable it was, published? Or that Newton's core assumption on which all else was based was that energy was a property of matter and that it took two hundred years to finally accept that matter is only an expression of energy?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are there newer and better models since that was proven a hundred years ago? Yes there are. Are any of them taught? No they aren't, Newton's model is still taught as if it was perfectly true. Why? Because the scientific establishment won't accept any model that can't also preserve the Newtonian doctrine that 200 years worth of science is predicated on that would all have to be completely re-thought and re-explained in another and totally different way.
      </p>
      <p>
       That another and totally different way is Quantum Mechanics that the single greatest impediment to understanding is the materialistic perspective of Newtonian physics that was and still is taught as if it was completely true to such an extent that most people are unable to conceive or grasp anything different.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I'm concerned even if they can prove that the globe model is wrong that doesn't automatically mean that their idea of a flat one must be true. The same applies to the reverse of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now maybe paying any attention to that undermines your faith in the globe model enough to create an irritating form of cognitive dissonance that compels you to rush to the defence of it and condemn anyone that dares to take issue with it, but it's a problem I don't happen to have or share with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether plane or planet or anything else in between it isn't going to make the slightest bit of difference to this world or "realm" as Tesla liked to call it or the way we happen to experience it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I don't care what anyone else thinks "about it" or what ideas or concepts they can come up with "about it". The simple fact is that any ideas or concepts we may have "about something" aren't the same thing as what it actually is.

You're right about people who are questioning this whole flat earth at first thought it was completely ludicrous and just dropped by to see what the fuss was all about...then once they got there, there were some pretty damn good questions that make you scratch your head and ask similar questions.

       Regions where there seems to be an "increase in belief" regarding Flat Earth will be targeted via IP tracking for military recruitment facilities and other government exploitation facilities due to being identified as regions where there are groups of people incapable of critical thought.

       Oh fuc$&amp;ing course there's a point where the boat disappears...you think the camera has unlimited zoom or light refraction, weather conditions, smog, etc don't play a role in how far you can see an object? Is the water in the ocean completely flat, with no ripples or waves?

       It's clear you're a narrow minded tool of the establishment who thinks they're so 'special' random people online
       <em>

       I truly feel sorry for you millenials with your absurd sense of ''entitlement'' ... good luck with that when you get to the Real World
