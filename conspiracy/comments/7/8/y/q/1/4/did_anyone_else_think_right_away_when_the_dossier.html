       You are thinking in way too short a time frame. If you truly wanted to take down the deep state, the fed, the clinton bush cartel, and al the other swamp creatures, you have to play such high level poker, you only get one shot to take em down, and he let them up the bet every week for years, knowing that when they shove all in, his hand is stronger and he's got em.

       Ha, yeah, that's why he was able to win the presidency.... you're inability to give trump credit is a flaw in your bias and you are not looking at it objectively.

      <p>
       Take a look at what's happening around you. Take a look at the cabals he destroyed just during. The campaign. If he's got you thinking that he's not that bright, then I would say sun tzu would be very proud of him. He's got both his enemies and even allies sometimes confused in an informational fog of war, and it's a great way to operate.

       lol you're retarded, he got 1% less white vote than Romney you dolt. Keep living in your identity politics world, it will be your downfall. Islam and immigration policy isn't about racism or bigotry, it's about job security,  living standards, culture, and value systems. Race has nothing to do with it. All of the things I just listed can have people of all colors achieving similar outcomes, it's not about race, but what's in their head. See past skin color dude.

       You cannot judge a historical persons moral character by today's standards. You must do it by the period standards. The first slave owner in America was a black man FYI. Everyone with money across the world, and in money countries still, had slaves back then, it was a way to produce goods for commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
       You think that iPhone or shoes you're wearing was made by wel paid workers? No, it's company store slaves in east Asia. Get over your falsely perceived moral high ground. Go fight slavery in the Congo, or Mexico, or Asia, or the Middle East. It's rampant. Middle eastern countries are still importing African slaves, castrating them, then selling to homeowners.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're one of the first countries in the history of the mankind to abolish slavery on such a mass scale, so save your judgements for some liberal who can tolerate your virtue signaling.

       You're right it is trillions, and oil matters, but country matter more. We're losing the petrodollar advantage daily, and Russia and China know how to poke that bear, but in the hand we still hold the power, and finally someone is using that power for our own countries good.

       What if trump is working with the Russians to obtain information on Hillary and past crimes? Russia is after all an extraditing partner. What if he is working with Putin to build a global case against George Soros? Putin already wants him dead for manipulating his economy. We know Russia wants to beat us, that's a given, but what's not a given is why our own officials want to crush us. We won't blame Russia, after all they're our enemy. It's our own leaders who've failed us, and maybe a good way to build a working relationship in decades to come is to work together on i international crime

       It's likely a puzzle piece on a much larger negotiation table. Remember he wants to change our relationships with everyone in the world for the better, that means tough love, tough deals, cutting some off, and rewarding others that cooperate. This IS what we hired him for, global relations. That's one of his job duties.

       He realizes the largest gain, and easiest one once you get through the wall of denial and misunderstanding, way to make our American lives better, and the worlds, is to change our policies and relationships withn foreign countries.

       What has the dossier got to do with it? It was commissioned by Hillary! Trump should go after Russia because of Hillarys campaign tactics?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the sanctions, Trump had no choice but to sign the bill- but rightfully complained it was removing his ability to directly negotiate with Russia. If the president can't do foreign policy, what is left for him to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       US/Russia relations are not good. Russia suspects America of preparing a surprise nuclear attack. This is about as grave as it gets. Gorbachev recently said the leaders of both countries should be holding an emergency summit; not meeting on the sidelines of international gatherings!

       I invite all "Russia hacked the election" believers to get over that false narrative and consider that they may be helping the world towards nuclear war.

       lol you just now figured this out because there was an altright story on it? That was not a secret at all. It started as opposition research from a fellow Republican and after the RNC and Trump won it went to Clinton. This has been known. lol.

        As for the sanctions, Trump had no choice but to sign the bill- but rightfully complained it was removing his ability to directly negotiate with Russia. If the president can't do foreign policy, what is left for him to do?

       Oh wow ok. Shock of the century. What clued you in? Was it when Putin signed a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children 5 years ago? The annexation of Crimea? When did you pick this nugget up?

       How about a dossier drops and all eyes are on Trump handling Russia and he's soft as a wet pretzel and it's kind sad as fuck.

       How about Trump and Putin talk about not starting world war 3? That would be smart. That's not being soft on Russia. That's having room and authority to negotiate. And do you realise that Crimea had a referendum after the coup in ukraine and decided, democratically of their own accord, to re-join Russia? Do you realise that other ethnically Russian provinces of Ukraine would have followed in a heartbeat, but Putin didn't accept them, realising the risks were too great?

       When the MSM is reporting how the Clinton camp and the DNC funded the dossier, how much clearer can it be? I don't think WaPo is a great friend of Trump.

       Reagan had a couple of summits with Gorbachev. It would not hurt for Trump to meet with Putin and discuss their security objectives. Imagine if, in the 80s, the media was screaming about a "bromance" between Reagan and Gorbachev. Imagine if any talk of them meeting to discuss NOT BLOWING UP THE WORLD was met with cries of "Russian collusion!" We may not be here today.
      </p>

       The media is currently in a dangerously infantile state. Only a few commentators such as Paul Craig Roberts can see how dangerous this dumbing down of the discourse is. The superpowers need to be able to communicate, without bedwetting partisan commentators distorting everything. One reason Trump got elected was to normalise relations with Russia. Considering that, anyone pushing the Russiagate lie is basically comitting treason. I would bet that if Trump knew what kind of treatment he was in for from the media, he wouldn't have run for president. As things are, the pettiness of the media could lead to a major war. Not that Trump isn't capable of starting one himself- he is. He's far from perfect. But we don't need the media goading him into it.
