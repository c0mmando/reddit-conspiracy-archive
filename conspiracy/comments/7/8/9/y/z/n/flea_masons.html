       Maybe if we all collectively laugh at them, theyll lose power, like It.

       But seriously... I think we should laugh at them,

        sometimes

       .  Feel free to try and make a joke about the psychopathic power structures that should not be.

       Been enough threads like that already. After people realize masons are tied to Hollywood and government, a bunch then started showing up here talking about joining and how cool their 'secrets ' are , and shit like that.

       I couldn't tell if those were bots/scripts or real people with a script or actual Freemasons so scripted from indoctrination they all sounded the same.

       Never a dull moment here. The minute anything starts trending towards certain groups they all send out their P.R squads. Like that mason guy showing his sword collection the other day, saying it shows the 'great secret of freemasons' ,then leads everyone on a wild goose chase. That type of shit is just to get people interested to join to find these things out , and probably to get indoctrinated.   This of course started after some posts about 33 and all the other Masonic symbolism showing up in the Vegas event.

       LOL yeah... because the guy was on the 32nd floor, he was CLEARLY a 32* Mason? Even though you would agree that 99.999% of the time you guys are like 33 DEGREE IS HIDING STUFF

       Isn't with you? Or is that just a secret too? Just a few nice brothers who are part of group conspiring with the elite, are the elite, and worship Lucifer. Lucifer is with you. Go be satanic on boards meant or that, your recruiting efforts here are desperate. Most here want to see groups that conspire against this nation to be disbanded and brought to justice.

       Just because you are compartmentalized should make you all the more questioning of the rest of the group. Low level masons do the PR work as usual. Top guys are sacrificing kids and running the f.b.I. at Vegas.

       You have a chatroom too, it's called /conspiracy. Your or your admins could set it up for notifications when "Freemason" pops up elsewhere on Reddit, but then you'd just be flooded with mundane posts from
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       chatroom that don't fit your paradigm of Masons trying (or having succeeded) to take over the world.

       There's always a mix of low level masons that think it's just a country club because they haven't killed anyone, and high level masons that are trying to get brownie points with the hierarchy by defending the craft.

       They are needy, like another group, I have top minds sending me stuff about r/SuperMinds still, and we all made fools of them like a month ago. Now they think they won because we shifted our attention to Vegas instead of their idiocracy. Real pathetic shit like that fills my box from these fools on a somewhat regular basis.   But when you ignore them they feel unimportant, because they want you to join their warped ideals to validate them.

       Omg ((they)) were beyond arbitrary. They were forced to shut down totes because we did the same cross posting game they were doing, only better. It was like three of us and we humiliated their whole board and mod team. They don't think it would take but 5 minutes to do it all over again?  They are a group of the utmost hypocrites , and the irony there is endless. Their disadvantage is they believe the indoctrination so the remain at a sixth grade aptitude. It can be exploited at will if anybody wanted to.

       You swore oaths to never tell the truth about Freemasonry. By definition, you are an untrustworthy source, both due to motivations and limitations. I reiterate, it's good for us when Freemasons like you show up, because it exposes the evils of the lodge.

       Per my obligation, I'm not allowed to tell you modes of recognition, or secrets arts, parts, or points of the craft. There's a book that's got, word for word, the three obligations a Master Mason takes in my jurisdiction. It's printed, meaning it's NOT secret. I could literally take photographs of the pages and send them to you, but you're not someone I can trust to be upstanding (unlike many people whom I trust but are not Masons). I'm unwilling to put it on the internet.

       Royal Arch Masons don't outrank Master Masons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even so, what community to which you belong tells you it's okay to speak evil of anybody, or hit people in anger?
      </p>
      <p>
       Does your trade union allow you to employ non-members when members are available? Those words don't mean a more qualified non-brother would or should be passed over for employment. That's not the case for trade unions.
      </p>
      <p>
       And those quotes, even if accurate, which I literally don't know anything about, are not quoted in the full context. Every obligation I've taken has more verbiage before and after that explain that there are limitations to the "furthermores." The "right or wrong" part is not "no matter what, even if it's illegal, or against your conscience or your faith."

       What is the relation between lying about Freemasonry and not striking someone in anger? Are you so fanatical about your conspiration theory that you are willing to say anything, even if it's completely unrelated to your own arguments, in order to keep your delusions in place?

       Part of the reason Freemasonry is immoral because it trains the initiates (you) on offensive use of rhetoric, while retaining the defensive use of rhetoric training for the adepts and sages. The ethical teacher shows the student the defensive use of rhetoric, to avoid unsound thinking, and reserves the offensive use of rhetoric for a cause that is just (Read Plato's Republic sometime).

       I thought to myself "no one can be
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       bad at staying on topic" so I looked through your history, and it's clear that you know

        exactly
       </em>
       what you're doing.

       Keep posting here, because I only need to get a person to look at the facts one time and they'll be won over to my side. You have to maintain the lie forever.

       If you mean the Rothschilds, Bilderberg Group, and the so-called Illuminati, how about them? Some few might also be Freemasons. Some few might also belong to your church/religion, have attended your college, wear your favourite brand of shoes, or enjoy your favourite Taco Bell menu item. Does that make you one of them?

       In order to gain hidden knowledge they must summon dark ethereal beings who are more than willing to give it and or deceive you for a price. That is where the rituals come in. This process is unnatural and one rips apart their soul by doing so. Universal knowledge is very powerful in the physical realm but the process descends your being in the ethereal realm.

       Only the Masons at the very highest echelons would be knowledgable about it, anyway. If you want to understand why people feel this way, it starts with understanding that people believe TPTB have their own religion where the worship Moloch/Satan/whatever you want to call him. I could expand a lot on this, but I'd rather not type it all out when it is readily available online. Next, people see the Masons as a tool of TPTB. Hopefully you can connect the dots.

       Are there bad guys who are Masons? Probably, yes. But those guys aren't acting Masonically. Just like there are guys out there who aren't Masons, but do act Masonically, though literally none of you who think you're entitled to sit here and be in judgment of other people.

       If my beliefs are so offensive to you, maybe just try not to care so much about what others think? I think you don't know the truth, and I'm honestly not very certain myself. I'd be a fool if I said I knew for sure that I was correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm not saying that I think Masons are bad people, I think most of them are actually probably very good people who join for good reasons. I also understand why my beliefs are insulting to you, but I can't help that that what I think.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an aside and because I'm curious, why do you think it is required that you believe that there is only one God? Why can you not be a Mason if you believe in many gods?

       You can sit there and tell people not to be defensive, but when people advise you not to be offensive your counter advice is to not care so much? Why do you care to accuse people of treachery? Why don't you just not care so much?
      </p>
      <p>
       I couldn't give a shit about what you think, but (a) Masonry teaches us to care about our fellow humans (even if they don't understand, notice, or appreciate it), and (b) that wouldn't change the fact that you are wrong about what Masonry is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'll happily go away and not care so much if you politely go away and stop accusing people of things which you know literally nothing about.

       You can believe in many Gods, but that's jurisdictional. Most polytheistic religions still have a single Creator-ish God. We literally, in my jurisdiction, don't ask what the person's religion is. We just require that they profess a faith in a higher power, basically so they can't say "I'm God."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now as to people who profess to worship Satan (and I know zero people who have said they do), they would then theoretically believe in God, too, unless they literally think Satan created the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know there are some who are Odinists, who identify with Thor, but still recognize that in their religion Odin was the main guy, so to speak.

       So if I  sort of "believe" you're a pedophile (I mean, you're a guy on the internet after all, and the internet is all porn, and all porn is basically pedophilia, especially since the "actresses" starting shaving their ladybits - that's how logical progression works, right?), even if I'm
       <em>
        not really sure about it
       </em>
       , you think I should go online and start spreading rumours I made up (or read about someone else) regarding your obscene and illegal behaviours, just in case it might turn out to be true? Would that be insulting to you? Would you care what I was writing, especially if I had more information about you than just your screen name? What if I sent my suspicions to your boss, or your mom? (Because my boss and my mom both know I'm a Mason, though they're not entirely sure what that means, beyond what I tell them and what they read online.) Because I can't help but think that since you're on the internet (following the "logical" progression I've outlined above) you're a confirmed pedophile (but I'm not, because
       <em>
        I know I don't

       use the internet for that sort of thing).

       It's large and old. Not particularly secretive, and all our secrets are online, if you can distinguish them from the pure speculation made up by people such as yourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a little difficult to "stop concerning" myself with people badmouthing an organization into which I've put a lot of time, care, and effort and by extension myself, as a member of said organization. It would be a bit different if you were using actual facts to bad-mouth us, but you're just making shit up and then saying "well, it
       <em>
        could
       </em>
       maybe be true, couldn't it?" The former is much more difficult, as there aren't many, especially as pertains to the organization, rather that certain individuals, while the latter is little more than schoolyard name-calling, with the larger problem that (much like you trying to spot our
       <em>
        exposed
       </em>
       secrets) those who come later might mistake your speculation for fact, which reflects poorly on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, your argument of "ignore it if it bothers you," isn't terrible advice, but the other side of that that we often see here is "if it
       <em>
        weren't
       </em>
       true, someone would have said so." I'm here to say so.

       You don't seem to understand the conspiracy, though. It isn't that regular Masons secretly worship Satan, but that the Masons are a legitimate organization that acts as a front for the leaders at the very top of the organization who do. And that would be kept a secret from regular Masons. So you can tell me that I'm wrong, but how would you know?

      <p>
       I get that this offends you, but I like to think about these things. For example, I'm Catholic and I have my suspicions about our current Pope.

       I know the "top leaders" in Freemasonry in a number of jurisdictions. Nice guys. Most don't wield any sort of political power, generally just retired middling-successful businessmen with families, though I do know a few low-level guys that are running for local office. That's how I know. The only thing that offends me is that you're throwing around these accusations without a shred of proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the problem is that you don't understand the
       <em>
        structure
       </em>
       of Freemasonry. It can't work the way you think it does, and I'll explain why below.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's just say for a minute that there is some shadowy organization trying to control the world behind the scenes (and honestly, if there was a Pope who was part of it, it would've been Benedict XVI...that dude was creepy a-f - and I was
       <em>
        raised
       </em>
       Catholic as well), and the top people there are also "top" Freemasons. How is that a cover for anything? They can't make us do much of anything (again, see below), as their influence doesn't extend outside of the Lodge. We can't be funnelling money towards their nefarious purposes, because books are kept at every level and regularly reports made, major expenditures (like the London air ambulances) are accounted for, new Treasurers are elected regularly, and any embezzlement is inevitably found out (it has been known to happen even to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars, though it's not particularly common) - besides, aren't they already supposed to be fabulously wealthy? Why aren't they Rotarians or Oddfellows or something instead/as well...you almost never hear conspiracies about those guys. But let's assume they are there, how does Masonry play into it? If they're just saying they're Masons to hide their attendance at Bilderberg type meetings by playing them off as Masonic meetings 1) Masons would notice when they say they're attending Masonic meetings but don't actually show up or 2) plenty of "regular" Masons would also be attending those meetings and seeing what going on (visiting other Lodges is one of the best "privileges" of Masonry, visiting Masons are almost always welcomed into Lodges), so there goes the top-level conspiracy, and even if they went to those meetings and other Masons didn't find out and want to go, you have now separated them from the organization - they are now individuals who run the shadow government, but also
       <em>
        happen to be
       </em>
       Masons, and
       <em>
        happen to be
       </em>
       Ivy League alumni, and
       <em>
        happen to be
       </em>
       residents of Pittsburgh, and
       <em>
        happen to be
       </em>
       in Tuesday night bowling league. That doesn't make the conspiracy extend to all Ivy League graduates (Skull and Bones conspiracies excepted), nor all residents of Pittsburgh, nor all player in the Tuesday night bowling league, so why does it extend to all Masons/Masonry as an organization?
      </p>
      <p>
       In your Pope example, I can see where being some kind of clergy, especially "high-level" clergy, could give cover to someone who needs to travel to secret shadow government meetings or whatever, but Masonry isn't a full-time career like that. It would be much easier to use "generic businessman" as a cover, with less people to explain why you didn't bump into Bro. so and so at the Masonic conference you said you were at, because "I just talked to him and he said he didn't see you there," not to mention additionally needing time off from whatever mundane day job you have/pretend to have while hiding your true power and influence. Also the fact that the Freemason conspiracy precludes any women in the shadow government (at least in the English-speaking world) - so much for Hillary or Condi Rice being in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still struggling to see what part Masonry
       <em>
        as an organization
       </em>
       plays in your conspiracy, as opposed to just a "hobby" conspirators might have in common, so perhaps you can elaborate. But before you do, here's my explanation of why it can't work the way I think you
       <em>
        probably
       </em>
       think it does. "Top level Masons" are mostly democratically elected, changing every year or two...or more often progressing from junior top leadership to senior top leadership over a period of 3-5 years (except in England, where a Royal is the figurehead, but the elected people below him do 99.9% all the work in his name while he is off doing Royal things). Each jurisdiction (individual states/provinces in large countries like the US, Canada, Brazil, and Australia, or at a national level in most countries) elects its own "top leadership," which is independent of each other jurisdiction. There is no World Masonic Council governing everything we do - the closest are a few international conferences/conventions that operate a little along the lines of the UN: recommendations can be made, but no one can really tell anyone else what they can or can't do in their own jurisdiction, with the primary penalty for not going along with generally agreed upon recommendations being a withdrawal of "fraternal recognition" between jurisdictions which amounts to "my mom says I can't play at your house anymore, and you're not allowed to come over to mine either," or, continuing the UN metaphor, visa/passport/immigration bans. Those elected top level Masons can influence Masonic policy, such as which public charities might benefit from our member donations, the minimum cost and time required to become a member and other things like that which occur within Lodges, but anything put forth by one "top leader" can easily be reversed or amended by his successor. More recently, like many companies with their employees, they might express an opinion on what sort of things their members can comment on online,
       <em>
        as Freemasons,
       </em>
       which might be seen as somewhat limiting free speech, but again this is both quite new and also common among employers as we've seen from people getting fired after being doxxed following attendance at Nazi/"nationalist" and/or Antifa rallies. What "top level" Freemasons can't do is influence political thought among our members, nor use our members as political capital, nor tell you how to spend or (with a few sort of prohibition-related exceptions in the US) how to earn your money, except that it should be within legal bounds. Serious legal transgressions will get you kicked out of Lodge, pretty much the most severe punishment at our disposal. Political discussion is banned in Lodges (for reasons of it being divisive among members with differing opinions; religious discussion is banned for the same reason) making it hard to sway people on issues, and a good recent example re: political capital is the Grand Loge Nationale de France - the elected Grand Master there promised the support of his Grand Lodge/all the Freemasons under him to a particular political candidate, which seems the sort of thing you might be concerned about, top Masons telling everyday Masons how to vote. The immediate reaction from the rest of the Masonic world was to cut ties with them, disavowing them as "regular/recognized" Masons and suspending cross-jurisdictional privileges, and this suspension of "fraternal relations" continued basically until the GLNF elected a new leader and issued a statement to other jurisdictions saying that they would not go down that road again. Similarly, while a member might run for political office, he can't show up to a Lodge to give a political speech to a group of Masons, nor can he say things like "since I'm Worshipful Master of the Lodge (or whatever Grand Lodge office he might hold), you have to vote for me in the upcoming civic election." So Grand Lodges can't get involved in politics, "top level" Freemasons can't use their position to rally political support, and they can't really tell you what to do in your daily life. We
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       admonished to obey the Master and Wardens of our Lodge and/or edicts of Grand Lodge insomuch as their orders pertain to the duties of their office...which only concerns things in the Lodge. With these limitations in mind, what sort of influence do you think a "top level" Mason can wield over the
       <em>
        organization
       </em>
       in terms of your grand conspiracy concept? Again, as an individual, anyone can do anything outside of Freemasonry (and occasional unsavoury/unethical individuals do slip in to our organization, as in most others), but you don't need to be a Mason to act as an individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is the organization a "front" for your hypothetical conspirators? (And I hope you have a better answer than "I don't know because it's a secret" because as a member, I'm privy to our secrets, and I have no idea what form your alleged conspiracy could take to be an effective use of our organization for nefarious purposes, which leaves you with little more than "but
       <em>
        what if
       </em>
       there is something?" What if I'm a robot? What if my wife is a lizard person? What if my cat is a dog? What if up is down?) I'd really like to understand your concerns here.

       Which end? I have yet to see that. At the 32° in Scottish Rite Masonry the philosophy still encourages us to be active in our churches. (On the other "side" in York Rite Masonry, the Knights Templar are required to defend the Christian faith from attacks by non-Christians, and they're at the top of that group.) Friends and family at the 33° assure me it doesn't suddenly change there...not that I know anyone who wouldn't immediately quit if it did, myself included, and I don't consider myself particularly Christian, despite being raised as such.

       Most Mason's at your local lodge are good men and do charitable events and the majority probably have little to no knowledge of the occult  so careful with your pitch fork and jumping to conclusions based on numbers and symbols. We have to look at both sides of the coin and it's contents. The knowledge at the top of secret societies that we know little about and assume it's all negative and assume that there's not positive way to use knowlage and watch YouTube videos of people that also have little esoteric and occult knowledge also doing the same thing will keep us in ignorance. Check out the modern alchemist on YouTube be open minded

       My dad once said, "we're all The Masons, we all build with or hands, right?".

       But seriously, the only difference between us and them, is that so many of us are ignorant of the true nature of reality and therefore abdicate our rights and responsibilities to "them".

       And yes, a good attitude and healthy sense of humor will only help to bridge that knowledge gap.

       Masons aren't really the problem though. Maybe most people that
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       the problem
       <em>
        are

       also masons, but freemasonry in itself isn't the same as "the illuminati." As others have noted, most masons are literally just normal people with jobs and family's who are basically in a grown up fraternity.

       All right. Get ready. I'm going to reveal what happens in our meetings. Brothers, bring me up on charges and kick me out if you must.

       You know those fish fry's that we keep having? You're right. It's all about controlling your mind. We are making you prefer Atlantic Cod over Catfish. And it's all in an effort to take your money so we can use it for the nefarious purposes of allowing us to argue over what color the new carpet will be, how thick the padding on the new chairs should be, and whether or not Brother Junior Warden will be reimbursed for the chili he made last meeting that caused Brother Junior Deacon to crap himself.

Made jokes about the aristocracy TO the aristocracy and they laughed until they realized....that’s..... that’s US he’s mimicking.

       If you mean the Rothschilds, Bilderberg Group, and the so-called Illuminati, how about them? Some few might also be Freemasons. Some few might also belong to your church/religion, have attended your college, wear your favourite brand of shoes, or enjoy your favourite Taco Bell menu item. Does that make you one of them?
