    <div class="md"><p>If the ingredients list is in the double digits, be wary. Gluten in the US is neigh poison, so no wheat. Drop anything with sugar. Meat, just don&#39;t, unless you know who killed it where when and how. Honestly it&#39;s the process these ingredients go through to be mass produced that make them hazardous. Be mindful of your environment and what you consume. School lunches as with the entire institution is meant to serve the lowest common denominator. Nutritionally or educationally they are doing you a disservice and its up to you to learn for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read the label, not what is says on the front of the box, look for ingredients that are real and not chemicals. The best products should have a short list of actual food and should be easy to read. Such as oatmeal, ingredient should be oatmeal.

    <div class="md"><p>To be perfectly honest I do use it on a daily basis though. I caught your comment in time, as well as the others. The fries though? Still ate those.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about how I&#39;ll obtain anything organic. My fridge is filled with nothing but GMO, with the exception of some cans of peas and some apples (hmm...wonder if it&#39;s healthy anymore if it contains glutamate..)</p>

<p>And as young as I am, organic things are out of question. I confronted my parents about this once. While they did take pride in the fact that I&#39;m concerned about the food I eat, they were hesitant when I inquired about the amount of organic organisms we could stock. Their budget, I&#39;ve now come to terms with, was not sufficient enough to make my transition towards a plentiful diet, specifically Paleo and another type of diet I couldn&#39;t remember at the moment.</p>

<p>Might I ask: is there any other way I could possibly limit the amount of inorganic consumption I do on a regular basis without starving me to death? I kinda do that already...pretty skinny...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi. You should eat that lunch because you need fuel to burn today. Then, you should pack your lunch tomorrow if you&#39;re worried about GMOs. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no such thing as GMO dairy, but the cows are often fed GMO corn and soy. There&#39;s also no such thing as GMO chickens, but they are also fed GMOs. You are what you eat eats. </p>

<p>That said, there&#39;s apparently not a whole lot of chicken in the tenders - it&#39;s mostly GMO soy. Aramark (caters many public school lunches and incidentally many prison meals too) doesn&#39;t want anyone to know what&#39;s in their chicken tenders, on the package it says &quot;Ingredients: chicken tenders.&quot; They had to be FOIAed to reveal the actual ingredients. <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/15/chicago-public-schools-chicken-nuggets_n_5155264.html">You Probably Don’t Want To Know What’s Actually In Public School Chicken Nuggets</a></p>

<p>You would also be smart to avoid flavored yogurts and flavored milks. They have waaay too much sugar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt there&#39;s a whole lot of nutrient faking on labeling going on, but hey who knows? Foods are less nutritious than they used to be, partially because Big Ag&#39;s production methods deplete healthy soils, partially due to <a href="http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511">The Great Nutrient Collapse</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>More than likely, if your school food is as bad as mine was, you&#39;re not even eating real chicken. It&#39;s some insanely processed soy or something with maybe some chicken garbage-parts ground up and thrown in for chicken flavor. But if it is real chicken, it&#39;s probably very low quality meat. But I could be wrong! Fries are fries, you know they&#39;re terrible for you but they&#39;re delicious. Your yogurt is probably just sugar, unless you&#39;re a good boy/girl and are having actual fruit. Although even if it is real fruit, it&#39;s almost certainly GMO, but there&#39;s only so much you can do about that. If you like fruits and healthy natural stuff, you should try going to a farmers market or produce store or something and look for things labeled organic/non-GMO. Maybe consider packing a lunch. I know it&#39;s an inconvenience, but you&#39;ll be healthier and more aware than all your peers. Maybe see what your parents would suggest if you told them you wanted to eat better food. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right?! I know exactly what you mean because I have dietary experience myself. Everything is made for cost and speed efficiency. Could care less about the ingredients it seems. Of course they watch sugar/fat/cholesterol levels (the fat/cholesterol thing is full of shit if you ask me) but people who can have sugar are given the crappiest forms available. High fructose corn syrup and the like. Since everything is borderline instant, you know that junk is chock full of some form of sugar as well.

    <div class="md"><p>To be perfectly honest I do use it on a daily basis though. I caught your comment in time, as well as the others. The fries though? Still ate those.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about how I&#39;ll obtain anything organic. My fridge is filled with nothing but GMO, with the exception of some cans of peas and some apples (hmm...wonder if it&#39;s healthy anymore if it contains glutamate..)</p>

<p>And as young as I am, organic things are out of question. I confronted my parents about this once. While they did take pride in the fact that I&#39;m concerned about the food I eat, they were hesitant when I inquired about the amount of organic organisms we could stock. Their budget, I&#39;ve now come to terms with, was not sufficient enough to make my transition towards a plentiful diet, specifically Paleo and another type of diet I couldn&#39;t remember at the moment.</p>

<p>Might I ask: is there any other way I could possibly limit the amount of inorganic consumption I do on a regular basis without starving me to death? I kinda do that already...pretty skinny...</p>
