       I'm currently at lunch right now, eating chicken tenders, fries, drinking milk and consuming a fruit yogurt. I just can't help but think about if this is all GMO. One question: is it? Should I avoid all this?

       Is there a list of the things I should look out for when viewing the ingredients? Or do they lie about the ingredients the food contains?

       If the ingredients list is in the double digits, be wary. Gluten in the US is neigh poison, so no wheat. Drop anything with sugar. Meat, just don't, unless you know who killed it where when and how. Honestly it's the process these ingredients go through to be mass produced that make them hazardous. Be mindful of your environment and what you consume. School lunches as with the entire institution is meant to serve the lowest common denominator. Nutritionally or educationally they are doing you a disservice and its up to you to learn for yourself.

       Read the label, not what is says on the front of the box, look for ingredients that are real and not chemicals. The best products should have a short list of actual food and should be easy to read. Such as oatmeal, ingredient should be oatmeal. One of the best snack bars I know of is Lara Bars, some of them have only 3 ingredients, no preservatives or chemicals, and taste great.

       To be perfectly honest I do use it on a daily basis though. I caught your comment in time, as well as the others. The fries though? Still ate those.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about how I'll obtain anything organic. My fridge is filled with nothing but GMO, with the exception of some cans of peas and some apples (hmm...wonder if it's healthy anymore if it contains glutamate..)
      </p>
      <p>
       And as young as I am, organic things are out of question. I confronted my parents about this once. While they did take pride in the fact that I'm concerned about the food I eat, they were hesitant when I inquired about the amount of organic organisms we could stock. Their budget, I've now come to terms with, was not sufficient enough to make my transition towards a plentiful diet, specifically Paleo and another type of diet I couldn't remember at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might I ask: is there any other way I could possibly limit the amount of inorganic consumption I do on a regular basis without starving me to death? I kinda do that already...pretty skinny...

       GMO crops aren't bad at all. It's the fact that we GMO them so we can dump gallons of fucking Roundup on them, that's why glyphosate is in everything and everyone.

       Hi. You should eat that lunch because you need fuel to burn today. Then, you should pack your lunch tomorrow if you're worried about GMOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no such thing as GMO dairy, but the cows are often fed GMO corn and soy. There's also no such thing as GMO chickens, but they are also fed GMOs. You are what you eat eats.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, there's apparently not a whole lot of chicken in the tenders - it's mostly GMO soy. Aramark (caters many public school lunches and incidentally many prison meals too) doesn't want anyone to know what's in their chicken tenders, on the package it says "Ingredients: chicken tenders." They had to be FOIAed to reveal the actual ingredients.

       You would also be smart to avoid flavored yogurts and flavored milks. They have waaay too much sugar.

       I doubt there's a whole lot of nutrient faking on labeling going on, but hey who knows? Foods are less nutritious than they used to be, partially because Big Ag's production methods deplete healthy soils, partially due to

       More than likely, if your school food is as bad as mine was, you're not even eating real chicken. It's some insanely processed soy or something with maybe some chicken garbage-parts ground up and thrown in for chicken flavor. But if it is real chicken, it's probably very low quality meat. But I could be wrong! Fries are fries, you know they're terrible for you but they're delicious. Your yogurt is probably just sugar, unless you're a good boy/girl and are having actual fruit. Although even if it is real fruit, it's almost certainly GMO, but there's only so much you can do about that. If you like fruits and healthy natural stuff, you should try going to a farmers market or produce store or something and look for things labeled organic/non-GMO. Maybe consider packing a lunch. I know it's an inconvenience, but you'll be healthier and more aware than all your peers. Maybe see what your parents would suggest if you told them you wanted to eat better food.

       Right?! I know exactly what you mean because I have dietary experience myself. Everything is made for cost and speed efficiency. Could care less about the ingredients it seems. Of course they watch sugar/fat/cholesterol levels (the fat/cholesterol thing is full of shit if you ask me) but people who can have sugar are given the crappiest forms available. High fructose corn syrup and the like. Since everything is borderline instant, you know that junk is chock full of some form of sugar as well. It's the other MIC... the medical industrial complex. Sad shit man.

       The tender and fries were most probably fried in GMO oil. Most people don't think about that. The milk and yogurt could also be from cows injected with artificial growth hormones.

       Yeah man. It is super difficult nowadays to truly eat healthy. There is gonna be issue somewhere in that list of ingredients. The way food is made now is fucked. All of this Roundup glyphosate crap is going to create a serious epidemic in our lifetime. Whether it it'll render soil unfit to grow crops or poisons our water supply for generations, the repercussions of using that poison will be soon seen and extremely difficult to reverse. All in the name of the all mighty dollar. The generation after us is gonna have a hard time.

       That's pretty cool. Do you know if they are antibiotic and hormone free? That's another angle you can get screwed.

      <p>
       There are so many facets in healthy eating. To the point where it is frustrating. It should not be this way. This is just absurd. We either eat the crap that's readily available and get sick eventually or break our backs trying to find honest foods that actually nourish us. You know, like what food is supposed to do.

       I have high hopes for younger generations if they questions things like you do. Are you a generation z? Or whatever they call the newest one. With your generations being brought up in the Internet age, there is so much promise to find the truth but also the most disinformation there has ever been. Keep questioning!! And if you think about that whether it has GMOS or not you are still stressing about it so I would just pack a lunch.

       To be perfectly honest I do use it on a daily basis though. I caught your comment in time, as well as the others. The fries though? Still ate those.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know about how I'll obtain anything organic. My fridge is filled with nothing but GMO, with the exception of some cans of peas and some apples (hmm...wonder if it's healthy anymore if it contains glutamate..)
      </p>
      <p>
       And as young as I am, organic things are out of question. I confronted my parents about this once. While they did take pride in the fact that I'm concerned about the food I eat, they were hesitant when I inquired about the amount of organic organisms we could stock. Their budget, I've now come to terms with, was not sufficient enough to make my transition towards a plentiful diet, specifically Paleo and another type of diet I couldn't remember at the moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might I ask: is there any other way I could possibly limit the amount of inorganic consumption I do on a regular basis without starving me to death? I kinda do that already...pretty skinny...
