        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of discussion concerning how the shooter&#39;s identity, motives, timeline, etc don&#39;t add up.  But I have a question for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> that seems to be overlooked consistently.  The timing between the volleys of fire.   From watching this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vdeHMqCscs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vdeHMqCscs</a>  from beginning to end, I have recorded all the time in-between barrages.  And arrived at the following:</p>

<p>Time it takes for the next barrage to start (obviously, the first barrage is time 0, so I&#39;m leaving it out):</p>

<ol>
<li> 45 seconds</li>
<li> 18 seconds</li>
<li> 21 seconds</li>
<li> 1 min 49 seconds</li>
<li> 1 min 2 seconds</li>
<li> 20 seconds</li>
<li> 26 seconds</li>
<li> 16 seconds</li>
<li> 44 seconds</li>
<li> 1 min 10 seconds</li>
<li> 18 seconds</li>
</ol>

<p>And then the two final single shots ring out.</p>

<p>So, we have a total of 11 barrages after the initial barrage that takes an average of 40.8 seconds in-between barrages.  40.8 seconds.  Let me state this again.  40.8 seconds.  It takes a well trained (trained enough to draw trajectory calculations) gunman with 23 guns and hundreds of loaded magazines, who has been planning this attack for days, and wants to kill as many people as possible in as little time as possible, 40.8 seconds to change magazines or rifles?  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?   My 15 year old son could swap out a magazine in less than 10 seconds.  And it ain&#39;t the gun jamming.  He&#39;s got 23 guns!  If one jams, move on to the next one.  It would take all of 4 seconds.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really happening here?  I don&#39;t know.  But I can only come to one conclusion.  The magazines WERE NOT ALL LOADED.  The long breaks of over 1 min can only be explained by the shooter having to reload the magazine.  If he was taking the time to fight off the swat team or something, we would still hear the shots.  But we don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Why would a person who wants to commit mass murder come to the site with dozens of magazines (as seen in the picture) but fail to load all of them before the shooting starts?  It makes no sense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same. Why would he wait so long between volleys?</p>

<p>Maybe he was swapping the bump stuck between guns?</p>

<p>Or loading magazines, but that would take too long. Suppose its possible with a speedloader.</p>

<p>Why wouldn&#39;t everything be ready to go? I&#39;m glad he wasn&#39;t more effective but does seen odd considering all the other preparations he made.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can load an m16 magazine in 40 seconds without a speedloader. with a speed loader it takes about 5 seconds to fill a single 30 round magazine. but then again I&#39;ve been on ammo detail many times. And you get good at loading ammo after you do it enough times.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you have more experience</p>

<p>These are supposedly 100 round capacity mags? I&#39;ve loaded several 30rd mags, and it takes me a couple of minutes. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve never used a speedloader, but I imagine it would take some time to stop firing, eject magazine, get your rounds together, reload etc. </p>

<p>But all of that should have been done beforehand. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just speculating</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is absurdly counter-intuitive to believe the shooter had (I would venture to guess) at least a $100,000 worth of guns, ammo, and mags. It doesn&#39;t seem to fit that someone with such a meticulous ability to cover his motives while living a player lifestyle would overlook something as simple as having many, many mags ready to go--not to mention all the firearms that could have already been locked and loaded. This whole thing is incredibly, unbelievably fishy.</p>

<p>The ONLY--I mean, the ONLY--explanation that makes sense to me is that he was up there talking to himself and pacing around like a friggin&#39; maniac in between his volleys, mumbling incoherent things and cursing whatever led him to that end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So he shoots himself in the chest with a .357 or a .38 special, and still has the ability to shoot himself once more (where??  Let&#39;s assume you&#39;re right) maybe in the chest again?  Is that how your theory ends?</p>

<p>Have you seen how much damage a single .357/.38 Special round does?  And to shoot himself at no greater distance than arms lengths away, you think he was capable of putting another round into himself?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The end of the theory is a bit of sarcasm based on the timeline not matching the two shots from a handgun at the end of the videos that don&#39;t match up with anything.  So the official story is he committed suicide, which is already fishy for an &quot;unstable man&quot; with &quot;questionable&quot; moral character based on Vegas hooker testimonials.  You would think if he lugged 23 guns up to his room with thousands of rounds of ammo, he would shoot his way out, not go out like a chump with his back to the door.  So two shots for a suicide shot to the head?  Yeah, it was a bit of a joke.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He definitely wasn&#39;t shot in the head.  Wounds aren&#39;t consistent with him putting the barrel in his mouth and pulling the trigger.  Definitely consistent with a center mass shot though.  I obviously don&#39;t have the answers, but I&#39;m thinking Campos was in on it in someway or another and we&#39;ll never find out how, but I believe he shot Paddock center mass and shot himself in the leg, or if Paddock did actually shoot himself, Campos has this brief moment of wanting to be seen as a hero and shoots himself to run with that narrative.  </p>

<p>Or actually the more I think about it while typing; in the bus stop video where we hear the two final shots, perhaps Paddock only was firing from one window the whole time, leaves that room goes to his other room (where he was found dead), and Campos comes in and shoots himself in the leg with a .22 (less damaging) and the 2nd shot of .357/.38 at the unbroken window seen in a few pictures and breaks the glass.  The bus stop video has a girl mentioning glass falling..</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m probably just reaching here as I don&#39;t think the timing would be remotely possible..who knows man?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The 240 is an exact match both in tone and rate of fire for the the unsuppressed bursts. Barrel changes was just a theory. It could be that the shooter was waiting too see if anyone got up to run after there was a pause and then focused fire at the choke points. It could have also been because he didn&#39;t want to allow people to pinpoint where the shots were coming from. Its pure speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not all magazines were 100 rounds.  Listen to the whole video.  There are long bursts and shorter ones.  The fact is, an average pause of 40 seconds between barrages when you supposedly have 23 guns and dozens of loaded magazines simply makes no sense. And the soldier dude in another comment confirmed that is takes him about 40 seconds to load a 30 round magazine.  Either way, all I&#39;m saying is that there is more to this than the scenario the FBI is presenting to us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just because theres a burst or 20-30 shots doesnt mean its not a 100 round mag. In all the photos of magazines we have seen they are much larger than 30 rounds.

You say in your theory the terrorists dont know how to use the guns, but firing that many rounds proves the shooter did know how to use them.

Then realized that the other mags weren&#39;t loaded. So they load and fire as rapidly as possible. Hence the delays in the bursts.</p>

<p>Incidentally, the first barrage is very long. I believe that was the 100 round mag they loaded first.  The others are 20-30 round bursts which they can easily load in 40 sec or less. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He had 2 rooms because one room was for himself and his girlfriend (I&#39;ll get to this in a minute) and the other room was for the terrorists and the guns.</p>

<p>Do you remember how the girlfriend was sent to Philippines just before the shooting?  And $100k was wired to her?  She stated that she thought it was a Goodbye payment.  BUT!  Do you also remember that the rooms were in Paddock AND Marilou&#39;s names?<br/>
Why would you reserve a hotel room with you and your girlfriend&#39;s name if you are separating from her?  And did you see how quickly Marilou came back to the US and the FBI had full protective detail and even disguised her to get her out of the airport?  Why all the secrecy when she wasn&#39;t even IN the country when this happened?  Did you notice that the girlfriend wasn&#39;t even investigated?  How she dropped out of the news entirely after 5 days?  Does any of this make sense?  Nope.  And here&#39;s why.</p>

<p>Stephen Paddock and Marilou Danley are FBI assets or agents involved in a sting operation to supply guns to terrorists.  Marilou went to the Philippines because Trumps travel ban makes it impossible for terrorists to come directly from the Middle East.  The terrorists went over to the Philippines first and to come to the US.  But they needed a guide, so Marilou was sent.  That $100k payment was sent to buy airfare and accommodation for the terrorists.</p>

<p>The plan was, Paddock would get two rooms, wait for Marilou to return from Philippines with their guests.  He would make the sale, then enjoy the rest of the week with Marilou in the other room while the terrorists slowly move the arms out of the hotel.  After tracking the terrorists to their cell, FBI would make arrests.  What Paddock and the FBI didn&#39;t count on was that some of the terrorists who were already here, got wind of the sting operation.  They stormed his room, killed Paddock, and started shooting.  This is why they take so long between bursts.  They are ill prepared.  This is why all the magazines aren&#39;t loaded.  Because they were to be sold, not used that night.</p>

<p>Did you see any of the videos where teams of agents (don&#39;t know exactly what branch) are sweeping the hotels, guns fully drawn, after the shooting?  It was because the terrorists were trying to escape after the shooting.  I&#39;m sure they were either killed or taken to a black site.  Loomer had come up with a video of a corpse under a white sheet.  Unfortunately, the quality of the video was so bad that everyone dismissed it.  But that body was probably one of the terrorists.</p>

<p>Do you see why the FBI cannot allow the truth to come out?  A sting operation that resulted in 59 deaths and about 500 people critically injured... What do you think would happen to the agency if the truth ever got out?</p>
