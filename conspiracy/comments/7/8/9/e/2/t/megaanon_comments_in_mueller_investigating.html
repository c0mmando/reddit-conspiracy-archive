<p>My favourite comment:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;No. He&#39;s not going to redpill the world. I&#39;ve already said it. The ultimate redpill is the realization that no one can redpill you, but you. You already know that a literal &quot;redpill&quot; itself, is the truth of anything. Trump is only going to hand you the redpills/truths of many things, but the masses have the choice of accepting the truth and swallowing it, or not.</p>

<p>For example, you&#39;d have thought the masses would&#39;ve swallowed the pill they were given when they watched DWS resign for rigging her own party&#39;s primaries, against her own candidate, on her own party&#39;s convention stage... but as history now shows, they still nominated their rigged primary winning candidate, for the presidency, right? The 2016 elections cycle only showed us all that you could literally punch millions of people in the face with the truth/redpill and they STILL wouldn&#39;t swallow it, if their lives depended on it. It&#39;s why (((they&#39;ve))) worked so hard, for so long, to dumb us down, put us against eachother, diversify is so much between race, religion, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, economically, educationally, socially, etc. they did it so that when the reality of what IS reality, punched us square in the fucking faces, we&#39;d be too fucking dumb and numb, to actually believe it.</p>

<p>Trust me, (((they))) love nothing better than us, everyone in the world, squabbling about who&#39;s the best race, religion, gender, who&#39;s smarter, more athletically inclined, which religion came first, whose God is really real, etc. The more we pander into the divided they created, the more divided we are and ultimately the more power and control we lose, as the mass. This is how the very few in the world, successfully yield so much power, over the very most.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>She said assange gave the investigators the October 21st date as the last day he absolutely would NOT release the files. After that date it&#39;s fair game for him to drop whatever he wants.</p>

<p>Basically he&#39;s saying you have a year to get this investigation right (which would implicate mueller and Comey) or he&#39;ll drop the goods forcing the issue. </p>

<p>What makes it even more interesting is MEGA claims mueller and Comey jumped ship and have been working with trump to turn the swamp inside out in exchange for information. She alludes to trump &quot;giving people chances&quot; and how 99% of the swamp was dragged in and begging for the chance to get out. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>I found it for you, <a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/146148518/#q146174105">anon said</a> yesterday (and probably several times before):</p>

<p>&quot;Because he doesn&#39;t need to see JFK files for it to come out. All he has to do is let their protections from public release, expire on the 26th.</p>

<p>I wish I never said anything about the 21st. Y&#39;all haven&#39;t read all the archives in succession and the point of the 21st was taken way out of context. The 21st was a negotiated deadline between Assange and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher this summer. I don&#39;t know where that meme image with tick tick came from. Someone said I got it from there. I didn&#39;t and when they presented it to me, I told them I hadn&#39;t seen it before.</p>

<p>Assange negotiated in the Rep. Dana meeting that he/wikileaks would refrain from publishing the 3rd remaining part of his October 2016 surprise, which was originally delayed thanks to the NBC &quot;grab em by the puss&quot; tapes released, then delayed AGAIN from the rescheduled OCTOBER 21, 2016 release date, because his Embassy and HQ went dark the week before in an effort to STOP HIM FROM RELEASING ON THE 21st of last year.</p>

<p>The only significance of the 10/21/17 was that AFTER today, Assange can do whatever he wants, whenever he wants to, legally and the admin. Nor their departments or agencies can stop him. I NEVER SAID HE HAD TO RELEASE OR WOULD DEFINITELY RELEASE IT TODAY. Did I say we should expect it coming though?! Yes. WHY?! Because AFTER THE 21st he can legally do whatever the fuck he wants, without losing any of the privileges he/Wikileaks negotiated, and because he released a new has my ties to his next release, the deleted it from twitter, after 48 hours... AS USUAL. &quot;</p>

<p>Lightbringer, please stop associating MegaAnon with VOTL.

<p>&quot;I am NOT affiliated with this twitter account, not a source. It&#39;s absolute bullshit and first time I saw it was HERE, on /pol/... just now. Believe what you will, but mark my words. Do not let people take or assume credit, off me. I come HERE. ALWAYS. FIRST. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think VOTL is legit. Most of these insiders are very loosely connected (usually they know each other only on twitter or pol). MegaAnon seems legit as well and he has his own opinion on others. For example, Kabamur called MegaAnon a Larp at first while VOTL said he was legit. Kabamur ended up not mentioning MegaAnon anymore so I don&#39;t know if he still feels like that. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very messy situation. The only thing we can do is trust our own instincts and hope we aren&#39;t being bamboozled. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assuming this all is true...and I agree that I also have &quot;high hopes and low expectations&quot; ... I&#39;m betting on Black Friday or Wednesday night before Thanksgiving for the Trump &quot;speech&quot; or whatever that turns out to be.   </p>

<p>Lots of time to look into stuff, everybody&#39;s off work.  Families will be together, so people will get the news when they are all together and will talk about it.  I have another wacky reason for that that maybe I&#39;ll share later.</p>

<p>Oh, and also Trump despises the media, and would probably like nothing more than to make them all work on a holiday weekend.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be surprised if Assange pre-empts the JFK release or drops his new material too soon right after.  Maybe the week before the off-year elections, after the world series is over and the weaponized autists have combed through the JFK materials.  </p>

<p>I think MegaAnon is someone in Bannon&#39;s orbit.  I also think her drops on 4chan are orchestrated leaks of sorts.  If you read everything she&#39;s posted this month, it will take you one hell of a long time, and she had to <strong>write</strong> all that, ergo, she&#39;s being paid to write this.  </p>

<p>Read her stuff about what she does and who she works for and does not work for.  I have only gone back to the September posts so far, I have not read July or May&#39;s stuff yet.</p>

Anon has stated that the 21st is a deadline that Assange can move forward with some releases, I believe from the Weiner laptop.  Don&#39;t pay attention to predictions- things can shift and tactics can change.  Anon does provide some interesting perspective and I enjoy following along without getting hopes up.

<p>Assuming this all is true...and I agree that I also have &quot;high hopes and low expectations&quot; ... I&#39;m betting on the Wednesday night before Thanksgiving for the Trump &quot;speech&quot; or whatever that turns out to be.</p>

<p>Lots of time to look into stuff, everybody&#39;s off work. Families will be together, so people will get the news when they are all together and will talk about it. I have another wacky reason for that that maybe I&#39;ll share later.</p>

<p>Oh, and also Trump despises the media, and would probably like nothing more than to make them all work on a holiday weekend, or at least get them running around with their hair on fire.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be surprised if Assange pre-empts the JFK release or drops his new material too soon right after. Maybe the week before the off-year elections, after the world series is over and the weaponized autists have combed through the JFK materials.  </p>

<p>I also think the JFK releases won&#39;t be that earth-shattering.  Some people will wind up looking bad, we&#39;ll find out Oswald was directed by Cuba, something like that, nothing like the CIA or LBJ planned the assassination.</p>
