        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Every day I Google &#39;Las Vegas shooter&#39;, &#39;Steven Paddock&#39;, &#39;Mandalay Bay&#39; and have to dig past a few survivor stories to find maybe one article from a possible fake blog. The Las Vegas Review Journal is pretty much the only mainstream media source trying to research or report anything about this. </p>

<p>I enjoy reading this sub because there are @ least a few threads dedicated to the story with well thought out theories and links. PLEASE, I&#39;m writing this to encourage you to keep posting. Don&#39;t let this story die. We&#39;re a small group of people but our voices matter. This story is so fucked up and absolutely ridiculous. They&#39;re selling a fairy tale even educated members of the public are buying. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have a specific theory but I studied criminals and their families. More often than not, a child raised with the knowledge of their parent(s) involved in criminal activity either go on to imitate that behavior or rebel against it-- going into social service jobs (government, police, mental health professional). I have no doubt in my mind SP was either working for the FBI, DEA or ATF <em>OR</em> became involved with criminals in Vegas who approached him while he was gambling. After the Phoenix trip came to light that sealed the deal for me. </p>

<p>In any case, I&#39;m employing you to keep digging and please don&#39;t forget about Vegas!!!</p>

<p>Thanks so much.....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The whole narrative stinks and the media has essentially moved on. Whether the government was involved or not, there are most certainly details about this event that are being withheld. I think it&#39;s important to consider that just because a cover up may be happening, it doesn&#39;t directly implicate the involvement of a three letter agency. It&#39;s entirely possible some other group was responsible and, even though the eff bee eye might know who, they&#39;re refusing to give out the information. Regardless, the American public (and the world, for that matter) deserve to know what exactly happened that night... Because it sure as hell didn&#39;t happen the way we&#39;ve been told. Every day I see less and less about this story, even on this sub! Stories of sexual allegations, uranium one, and other stuff continue to pour into r/conspiracy. Obviously these are important and possible even related topics, but I&#39;m very hopeful that we can keep digging into Vegas. I encourage everyone to scour the web for ANY other video footage out there. The real answers lie within the videos of bystanders.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You hit the nail right on the head. Exactly what I was trying to convey. I actually think it&#39;s more likely SP was working with a criminal element (traffickers, pimps, mob) but I figure there&#39;s no reason to rule out the government. Only because we have NOTHING! If the police want to rule themselves out give us some proof, information. I&#39;m so frustrated by this because this is a story that really matters to me personally. Thanks for reiterating my point.

    <div class="md"><p>How would someone else possibly be able to effect how much time I have?  I was a SAHM for 10 years and had no more time for reading than I do now, since kids need my time and attention.  There has never, ever been a time in human history when everyone had unlimited free time to learn and do whatever they wanted- people have always had to work to keep themselves fed.  In fact, I would argue that we have more free time now than ever before- mass production means that I don&#39;t have to spend hours of my day making bread, washing clothes by hand, hunting and killing my own food, etc. </p>

<p>Even if I had unlimited time, reading up on OBL would not make the cut.  I simply don&#39;t care enough about him to make the time to read about him.  There are other things I would rather do.  </p>

Let&#39;s say he was setting up a deal with one of these groups, and the group became aware of who Paddock truly represented (FBI/CIA) and what the true motives are.</p>

<p>If the group comes into the meeting with Paddock, kills him, pulls off a massacre and leaves the scene in such a way that it looks like Paddock did it, what kind of a position does that put their opposition (the FBI/CIA)? If they admit that Paddock is a CIA/FBI agent, they will be admitting that they supply guns to criminals in order to gain information on them. They also take indirect blame for the massacre by allowing a deal to go on in such a circumstance. The &#39;progression&#39; would be that it was pre-meditated, but that the 3-letter agencies involved were betrayed and taken by surprise, and now they either have to admit guilt or try to pin it on somebody else.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t make sense at all. Here is my take. If I were an arms dealer, would I be selling AR15 rifles with bump stocks or real fully automatic weapons. Why would anyone just be like screw it lets make noise and shoot everyone instead of killing Paddock and getting out of there in one piece. Let alone cops already all around the place and moving up the floors combing the scene. Why would they even do it an a hotel in the first place. Their in Las Vegas, they could easily done a  trade in the desert. The arms dealer theory is a dead end.</p>

<p>Do you know who owns the floors above where Paddock was found? The Saudi Royal family. If the deal involved terrorist elements that have been funded by the Saudis, everything makes a little more sense (especially the getaway).</p>

<p>No it&#39;s not logical at all - there is no motive. If he wanted to be famous, he would have left a manifesto or had some sort of message attached to it. He didn&#39;t - it&#39;s been completely obscured, and the LVPD have admitted that Paddock didnt&#39; expect to die (no suicide note, and they know he intended to survive according to the Sheriff).</p>

<p>So you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about, nor do you understand what &#39;logic&#39; is.</p>

<p>If yours is the most logical answer, give me the logic for his attack. There is no precedent of an old man shooting up a country concert for no reason. You&#39;re making shit up.</p>

They also had different times from the Taxi driver stereo saying 10:13 while theirs said 10:12. If anyone has checked the audio like I have, syncing most of it in Audacity, they missed the single scoped shots between 10:06 to 10:08.</p>

All of it intentional so we could come to the conclusion that the official narrative is a lie but the shooting is real.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s all 100% verifiable. Are you suggesting that the cover-up goes so far as to create 50+ fake people? Further, it would have to involve statements from their families who, according to you, would have to also be fake? One man from my state (MN) was killed in the attack and i read and saw interviews with his family. You&#39;re right that I cant assume everything is true (that&#39;s why we are all here right?) but I have to say that you are reaching. That is where the hoax theory loses its feasibility. Of course anyone can create a fake obituary but the fact is that these people are dead and Im certain that a record of their death can be obtained if one is willing to go to that length.

    <div class="md"><p>again i have no way to know if you really knew a guy who died.  not oroof.  obituaries, death certificate, all easliy faked.  Im not saying this is definately what happened im just saying that its possible.  The reach of the elite is far greater than most realize.  think about the fact that school, work, money, food, sex, and much more are all things that have been designed, not with good will toward humanity but for control purposes.  I understand that there is a line one can cross from CT to full blown paranoia and that line is incredabley thin but one must venture to the extremes to see if it fits. we are so well controlled by them that even this whole shadow govt and zionist talk is all just a big farce to have people question the reality to the point that they give up the search for truth.  The ones that continue are in places such as this where the manipulation continues.  and in reality they have snuffed us out because merely talking about this isnt changing shit.

    <div class="md"><p>Cointel = counter intelligence. These ridiculous, left-field speculations are deliberately seeded in the &#39;conspiracy&#39; communities so they will be attached to (and overshadow) anything even remotely under the umbrella of a &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; which is itself a term DELIBERATELY weaponized by cointel operations going as far back as the 1950s. </p>

<p>It&#39;s why when &#39;normal&#39; people hear the term &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; they don&#39;t think of thorough, critical thinking types of people, rather than immediately going to thoughts of tinfoil hat wearing lunatics who think the queen is a lizard. </p>

<p>The &#39;no one died&#39;/&#39;hoax&#39; claims in these mass shootings is a common boilerplate tactic used to infect groups of critical thinkers getting too close to discovering true evidence of government fuckery.  </p>

<p>Seriously. You need to read up on American CoIntelPro programs in history and learn why what your saying is harmful to the real investigation when it comes to the outside world taking any of it seriously or opening their mind to the possibility of more nefarious things at work. </p>

<p>Unless of course you&#39;re actively participating in a counter intelligence operation right now rather than just parroting one for shock value or a false sense of originality. Because then you would already know all about this sort of operation I suppose. </p>

<p>I disagree, I think pointing out these situations <em>rationally</em> helps shine a light on the problem. My eyes were opened to these artificial divides a while ago reading a thread in <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> where someone <em>I thought I should agree with</em> (because us vs them) was exposed by someone like yourself. Since then I&#39;ve tried (poorly) to set the same example. It&#39;s not much, but it&#39;s the most effective tool I&#39;ve seen in these divisive times. </p>

<p>Something something that line from &quot;thank you for smoking&quot;.  It&#39;s not about convincing the trolls they&#39;re wrong, it&#39;s about marking a path for those who haven&#39;t caught up to you yet. I&#39;m still trying to catch up :-)</p>

But I would argue that I don&#39;t see a &quot;far left&quot; so much as individuals with stupid opinions on Twitter making disgusting claims. In no way does it seem to reflect the majority, and more than actual Nazis reflect on conservatives.</p>

<p>But I think there&#39;s definitely a far right, and I don&#39;t mean alt right Nazis, I mean the shit that comes out of t_d.</p>

<p>Conservative and liberal friends alike have talked about the shit they say there. Whether they&#39;re all Bernie Bros, or they&#39;ve actually been compromised by Russians/whoever.. that sure as fuck doesn&#39;t represent conservatives.</p>

<p>I feel like the possibly artificial far right has made most actual conservatives feel more centrist. When you find yourself arguing more against the far right to be reasonable, than you spend actual time debating the opposition.. that&#39;s my main reason I think it&#39;s artificial.</p>

<p>Your point, MSM would be pushing this story to no end seems perfectly valid to me, yet that&#39;s not what&#39;s happening. Instead, I get a tweet that Hillary said about silencers. I&#39;m pro gun, and I don&#39;t see the need for silencers, if your aim is worth a shit, then the deer are going down no matter how loud the gun is.</p>

<p>I saw another post today, I wish I saved it.. but it argued that Russia would manipulate both sides. And it <em>makes sense</em>. You&#39;re on the left, basically saying <em>WTF</em> to the left, I&#39;m on the right saying the same thing to those who claim to be on the right..</p>

<p>Maybe the real conspiracy is that when powers attempt to manipulate us by trying to divide us, both real sides start to question those people.</p>

<p>But then again, here we are posting in a post that had nothing to do with politics.. and I&#39;m finding a new conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You mean a sub, that&#39;s real people, talking to other actual real people? That&#39;s crazy talk, no /s.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the crazy part, in a sub where calling anyone an actual shill is a punishable offense.. not even just here, but anywhere you talk to someone you actually don&#39;t know.. they could be a literal shill, and you&#39;re just wasting your time arguing against someone who will just simply cut the conversation once there isn&#39;t enough incentive to keep wasting your time.</p>

<p>Maybe I can track it down, but there were some comments I kept seeing that had a very special Russian/not American vibe on the Washington Post or some other news site. They made their comments and everything private, but they had sixteen <em>thousand</em> comments made in something like 2 years.</p>

<p>Sixteen <em>thousand</em> comments in one single place.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sadly unemployed at the moment (I&#39;m sure someone will use this against me at some point).. but I&#39;m pretty sure, I don&#39;t have 16,000 comments in the last decade. I use apps to save my texts, and I only have a few thousand in the last few years.</p>

<p>I text more than I comment anywhere, so the idea of responding that many times, here or anywhere else that many times, in only two years..</p>

<p>I&#39;m drinking now, I apologize if anything I&#39;ve said isn&#39;t making sense.. but the realization that I might be wasting time on a bot, or someone literally paid to &quot;divide and conquer&quot; was the biggest truth bomb I&#39;ve ever experienced.</p>

<p>My proof, I&#39;m real.. I tend to be long winded, but I now only waste time on people I think are actual people.. but between texts, comments, anything I say.. it&#39;s far less than 16,000 times I&#39;ve replied to anyone, in any way..</p>

<p>Drunk reply over.</p>

<p>A little creepy. I&#39;ll wait to see how this plays out but it <em>almost</em> seems like a ploy to make people think something was done when in reality nothing changed. Though here are two articles discussing it so hopefully I&#39;m wrong in one way or another (or at least people are noticing).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a big leap for me to think that the owners of Mandalay wouldn&#39;t hesitate to mislead everyone they could in order to save a few pennies on potential litigation if, say, they had evidence that shit was going to go down but kept quiet about it in a stupid attempt to avoid bad publicity. Say they saw him open carrying an AR up to his room on CCTV, sent up Jesus who gets shot (or maybe just sees something he shouldn&#39;t have). Jesus reports, but hotel security assumes they can handle it without bringing in the cops (and they don&#39;t want a reputation as the place where people bring shit loads of guns) so they don&#39;t call it in - &quot;We can handle this internally&quot;. </p>

<p>Could be something way worse, but I honestly don&#39;t think it would take much for someone to realize how fucked they would be if people died because of their negligence and decide to cover it up. </p>

<p>Everyone remembers that the mob created/runs Vegas right? I could imagine that maybe they <em>have</em> dealt with shit like this in the past through extrajudicial means and kept it off the radar - which is just good business. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am really interested in the full list of what guns were used. They stated 20+ but so far I have only found listed 4 Daniel Defense DDM4&#39;s, Colt AR, Sig Sauer AR (those are .223/5.56), AK47 (7.62x39) and an AR10 (.308). That&#39;s 8 guns. They said 12 had bump stocks. What are the rest? What were those tripods used? Was it a mount for an actual machine gun? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the common narrative is true, the caliber should have been a .223/5.56 round that is commonly found with AR platforms. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/75qqXk4.jpg">Those are generally pretty small rounds. Here&#39;s a target pic for reference.</a> This is where the &quot;bump stock&quot; truthiness needs to be explained, because if the rounds were fired out of an AR, they would probably need to be bump stock fired, which is not what the gunfire sounds like.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6o2qUwT7J9A">The gun <em>sounds</em> to me like something more along the lines of an m240, which would be using a larger 7.62mm round.</a></p>

<p>Either way,
 knowing the caliber (or caliberS) would be very useful information to figure out key pieces of this event.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. </p>

<p>I truly do not believe that they are some sort of experts simply because they were shot at. </p>

<p>There is absolutely zero footage of multiple shooters or anything to indicate that there wasn&#39;t a single shooter. There is no evidence that would indicate anyone other than Paddock was firing at the crowd. There are only people who were being shot at from yards away, panicked and failing to understand the situation they were in.</p>

<p>I have yet to personally see more than 10 people come forward to say there were multiple shooters. Let&#39;s be generous and say that 100 people claim to have seen a second shooter that night. That&#39;s 100 of the 22,000 people attending. That&#39;s .04545%. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s go with what you&#39;re saying, that somehow the people who were there are the only ones to be trusted, and <strong>disregard the opinions/conclusions of the experts, who have infinitely more access to the facts and evidence than us</strong> and go with the &quot;100&quot; <strong>surviving eye witnesses</strong> claiming multiple shooters. </p>

<p><strong>There&#39;s literally 99.95% of these uber-witnesses who we can only trust because the experts lie to us that aren&#39;t saying there was multiple shooters</strong></p>

<p>If you&#39;re just randomly believing people on the internet, why not believe me or one of the 21,900 people that were there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m basing my belief there were multiple shooters on the footage from people who were 1.6 miles away down the strip, who were filming the place on lockdown saying they&#39;d been fired upon there. They did not hear gunfire at Mandalay Bay, 1.6 miles away, and then hundreds of epople 1.6 miles away INSIDE another busy casino run for their lives from that gunfire. They film the area with all the people scattered about, they talk to  a member of staff who confirms they were fired upon there.</p>

<p>Other witnesses 1.5-1.6 miles away say the same thing. The scanner audio from the night of the shooting says the same thing, with police officers confirming multiple shooters. An expert did a forensic audio analysis and proved there were two different guns at different positions. That&#39;s not just &#39;believing random people on the internet,&#39; Way more than 100 people claim that. There were reams and reams of different social media posts from people saying that!</p>

<p>This is one I saved that compiled some of them, there are others and longer ones: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/SgerQ">https://imgur.com/a/SgerQ</a>?</p>

<p>The thing that causes me to disbelieve the police and the news media the most about this, is the fact that they won&#39;t even address these other claims and these questions. They don&#39;t offer an explanation, they just don&#39;t talk about it, which is totally disrespectful and is bad journalism - you are supposed to present both sides of a story, and if there are multiple witnesses, the police scanner audio, analysis etc saying there were multiple shooters at many locations, then you address it and explain why that&#39;s not the case if it&#39;s not the case, in such a way that makes logical and scientific sense. They won&#39;t even go near it and that&#39;s because they want people like you to just accept what they say, because people like you give authority to journalists and the media and &#39;officials&#39; over and above the testimony of your fellow human beings, even over and above what your eyes and ears tell you - what with the police confirming two shooters, at multiple locations, some of them THERE, with another shooter, over a mile away from Mandalay Bay.</p>

<p>Yet you say there is NO evidence to indicate anything else, which is a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a crappy news story. It&#39;s the same reason the hurricane fall out is no longer in the news, at least not out here in California. Being clean up and rebuilding is lame news when it comes to ratings. News moves on to the next story rather quickly and right now it&#39;s all about people shifting past the ashes of their homes in Santa Rosa.</p>

<p>In a sad commentary over all but large scale or even small scale shooting don&#39;t really stay in the news much anymore. There was kind of a blip about Vegas in regards to a local outdoor concert in Sacramento and how people showed up by the thousands. Yet is that really news? People move on rather quickly if they are not first hand involved in something. </p>

<p>Odds are we don&#39;t get an offical case report on Vegas for months. Personally the lack of leaks and info makes me think there is less to the story than many seem to think. Being if there was a lot of active focus on other angles to the case still going on we would get more leaks and info from average sort of folks as they got caught up in it. </p>

<p>It is a little strange we don&#39;t have any MGM hotel footage released. I did not think so at first being at that stage of the investigation they needed to keep everything under wraps. Yet now we are 3 weeks after the event. If the case is as the police are saying, rather open and shut one shooter etc then after 3weeks I would think footage of him walking in or moving &quot;stuff&quot; would not carry much investigative worth anymore. Then again if it&#39;s not a big news story anymore there is little pressure to release any info. </p>

Clearly they must have all been under the impression that the bullets were coming from multiple directions, you don&#39;t just imagine that out of hysteria. It&#39;s suspicous that the government is pretty much acting like nothing happened, especially when they completely denied Isis involvement as soon as Isis claimed they did it.

    <div class="md"><p>I imagine loads of people initially willingly gave up their footage to the FBI thinking they were helping. Lots of people told that sharing footage could impede the investigation I imagine. People also might be scared after that news about the 28 year old who shared her story of multiple shooters and then died shortly after - whether there was something sinister to that or not, many alt-media channels speculated that it was foul play, which could definitely make some people scared to share.</p>

<p>People could also be sitting on it, waiting to see what final official story shakes out, not wanting to give law enforcement any help with fabricating a story that matches all the footage.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I use acronyms such as LOL or LMAO I use them not to express humor, but my crippling depression. They are a silent cry for help from this dark void of sadness. I used to use them genuinely, but as time went on I found myself meaning it less every time I used them. How many people actually laugh out loud when they say &quot;LOL,&quot; laugh their ass off when they say &quot;LMAO,&quot; and roll on the floor laughing when they say &quot;ROFL&quot;? No one. This is the result of the pathetic world of lies we live in. As my depression grew stronger over the years I found myself questioning the true meaning of these acronyms when I used them. I decided they represent the mask of anonymous lies we live behind on the internet and since they are lies it makes sense that the user is experiencing the opposite emotion of what they actually express. I used these &quot;humorous&quot; acronyms on a layer of irony for several more years but no one noticed. No one paid attention to my wounded calls for help, my desperate cries for relief from this horrible life. I now seek to solve this problem on my own instead of relying on the cruel, heartless &quot;humans&quot; that dominate society today. Tonight I solve the problem once and for all, by ending my trial on the hell we call &quot;earth.&quot; LMAO 🔪 </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s time for people to realise that these things use a mixture of both fake and real, deliberately. One, to control the narrative using crisis actors and the scene, two to ensure there are enough people who know someone died to make those who cry &#39;it&#39;s fake&#39; look like crazy and disrespectful, and to confuse the hell out of, and divide, the truth community.

It&#39;s messed up when you try to get answers by searching for &#39;Las Vegas shooting why were crowd lights kept on&#39; and all you find are posts about the dimming of the strip lights in remembrance the day after. So they kept the lights on while people were being shot to death but when people were barely holding onto life and random amazing people were trying to help them LONG AFTER the shooting stopped and only THEN the lights turn off?! </p>

<p>Now the people trying to help the ones that are barely holding on can&#39;t even seen the people they are helping let along find others that may be injured. It makes no sense. </p>

<p>To hear that only a small percentage are still covering this story or trying to find answers is heartbreaking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, someone has got to be pulling the strings. Whether its radical Islam, cars and trucks ramming into crowds, or mass shootings, in all of these situations, more often than not there are some ulterior consequences to these events. Political, ideological, or religious. That&#39;s what terrorism is. </p>

<p>And then you have these kinds of events.. the kind where the media goes silent. Nobody asks why or who or what, not CNN, not the New York Times, not even Fox. They focus on other sides of the story. More sensationalist stories.</p>

<p>Where are all the reporters then? Why is nobody doing their jobs and asking questions, following leads, following the money? </p>

<p>I mean, they have the resources to do it, as all the major news networks keep getting more money from all the pharmaceutical companies pushing their drugs on the American people. The newspapers get their ad revenue from all the clicks  on their sensationalist, sob, phony stories following these events. But nobody finds anything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like someone very high up is pulling the strings on how the media handles it. Someone calling the shots, distracting and suggesting false leads, misdirecting the whole investigation until the entire thing devolves into the type of chaos they can milk for more ad revenue.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there is something more than just what the media is reporting. But, I am a firm believer in Occam&#39;s razor. The simplest explanation is almost always correct. And so my belief is that there were others who aided the shooter (I avoid naming murders, fuck making killers into celebrities) and maybe a conspiracy, but most likely it&#39;s not going to be anything as wild as some people fantasize.</p>

<p>I find it extremely odd that the media coverage dropped off a cliff like it did. Following suit with my general simplest is most correct approach that means that the truth is not media friendly or doesn&#39;t Matt their initial narrative. Interested to see how this plays out. Occam&#39;s razor is almost leading to conspiracy theory here</p>

<li><p>Videos show both visual and audio clues that point to multiple shooters and of guns not found in Paddock&#39;s room A: can&#39;t prove on a video and Campos says it was just one shooter down the hall.</p></li>
<li><p>People at Hooters, Belagio, Topicana all post eyewitness video reports of other victims and evidence of shootings there. A: there are no security videos released so it didn&#39;t happened.</p></li>
<li><p>Vegas has 500,000 full time 24/7/365 surveilance cameras, some of which can depict 4k resolution from a mile away with no footage released by any casino of anything that happened that night anywhere. A: It&#39;s an &quot;ongoing investigation&quot;  </p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>Because they think something is wrong with their brains :-)</p>

<p>Seriously man, I didn&#39;t post the link to start an argument. This got off on the wrong foot. Honestly, when I read your comment was the first I had heard about this (in this instance). It reminded me of similar situations I had heard of. I thought perhaps you might not have known, and wanted to share potentially relevant info. Sorry I misunderstood. I really am, you shouldn&#39;t have needed to explain yourself 3 times - fair point. I hear ya. </p>

<p>Here, as a gesture of good faith I&#39;ll start the ball rolling. </p>

<p>&quot;Junior Seau, 43, who was considered one of the best players of his generation, shot himself in the chest with a revolver in the bedroom of his home in San Diego. In February 2011 former Chicago Bears player Dave Duerson also shot himself in the chest, and left a note saying he wanted his brain examined by scientists.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/americanfootball/9244026/Third-NFL-player-in-a-year-Junior-Seau-commits-suicide.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/americanfootball/9244026/Third-NFL-player-in-a-year-Junior-Seau-commits-suicide.html</a></p>

<p>No mystery why these dudes did it. They talked to doctors, reported problems, left a note. </p>

<p>A) Shooter was a hopeless loner who had nobody to talk to about his problems and didn&#39;t care to explain why he did it. Deep down though he wanted someone to examine his brain? Or maybe he just didn&#39;t know shit about anatomy. </p>

<p>B) Some sort of ritualistic shit where he couldn&#39;t get to the mothership without proving he was heartless or some other nonsense paranoid delusion of his. </p>

<p>C) Someone wanted it to look like one of the above. And/or they wanted to be 100% sure he couldn&#39;t be revived?</p>

<p>D) TLA heart/mind control device that had to be destroyed. Can&#39;t let people find out that shit exists. </p>

<p>A seems problematic because of the girlfriend. She would almost certainly have known something was up. Especially given the transfer. Maybe he wanted to &quot;protect&quot; her so didn&#39;t say anything, but then the standard heart shot MO doesn&#39;t hold up very well unless he did want her to know but only after. All this still ignoring the fact that he had money, did he not have any doctors he saw? Whitman reported problems to his doctors.</p>

<p>B seems like the current official narrative but we aren&#39;t here to discuss that. Could be true, very unsatisfying. Would expect a &quot;beautiful mind&quot; style paranoimap, notebooks, etc. Would make more sense with that type of evidence. </p>

<p>C I&#39;ll leave this for other people. </p>

<p>D I think we all have to submit to our lizard overlords if this is true, what the fuck else could we do?</p>

<p>Please poke holes in the theories. </p>

Not sure if there&#39;s anything to that but Lombardo said something about the shooter turning his attention to cops toward the end. Not sure how true that is. Either way, I saw that video today and found it pretty fascinating. </p>

<p>I wholeheartedly agree with you. The one independent guy I&#39;ve been watching (who seems like he&#39;s been paying attention and isn&#39;t milking it for $) from something called The End of Times Report. I&#39;m not a big conspiracy theorist in general (or wasn&#39;t prior to this) and have found most of his investigations and conclusions logical. Especially this one where he explains the difference between evidence and proof: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>nope, we&#39;re on the same page man.  He&#39;s the one youtuber I&#39;ve been following since this happened.  He seems to actually be making an effort to figure things out.  He went to Vegas.  He&#39;s conducted interviews, he seems logical.  He doesn&#39;t believe, and neither do I, in this &quot;this was all crisis actors&quot; type of narrative some people believe.  Some people believe every damn thing that takes place is crisis actors for some reason.</p>

<p>This shit investigation, has made me fully believe in false flags.  Either the government (and when I say government, that doesn&#39;t mean Trump signs off on the shit, government agencies with agenda&#39;s IE the FBI getting funds) is actually doing these acts, or they are able to find nut jobs, and provide them the tools and motivation to pull them off.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get pissed off reading people posting about crisis actors, or some other bullshit about there being no victims.  How on Earth can someone be so naive, because people are burning down buildings and brandishing pitchforks, we jump to the conclusion, no one got hurt?  It takes away the magnitude of what actually happened, it&#39;s as if they believe no bad things happen, that people just plopped down, opened a few ketchup packets, and just laid dead still for hours, until they were hauled off in body bags... Fucking ignorant idiots.  This whole thing makes no sense, and there&#39;s WAY more than meets the eye, but crisis actors is a fool&#39;s way out to actually doing some kind of investigative work on their own.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Las Vegas local here.
I was talking about this with my daughter a few days ago. No one will ever know what happened. It is impossible to explain the machine that is &quot;Vegas&quot;  even if you are part of it. There are a few things I can recall happening (shootings in casinos, suspicious packages left around) that no one knew about outside of those directly involved. </p>

<p>One example, shooting at Planet Hollywood, on casino floor, that most floor supervisors (pit bosses) didn&#39;t even know about. (A few years ago, not 10/1.)</p>

<p>Source: have worked at on Strip properties.</p>

<p>Just like no one ever dies at Disneyland. /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for sharing your perspective on the Vegas event as a local. I won&#39;t lie, this news is extremely disappointing to hear. I hope you&#39;re wrong... but I&#39;m beginning to believe you&#39;re spot on. </p>

<p>BTW... I live in FL and my husband and I recently went to Universal. I&#39;ve never been on guard about something like this happening anywhere I&#39;ve been. But, I began thinking a shooting could happen there or at a Disney property. I felt like it would be an obvious target for such terrorists or the like as they may want to destroy &quot;the happiest place on Earth&quot;. Universal had metal detectors but they weren&#39;t very invasive. Note: I&#39;m NOT encouraging this behavior or letting anyone it would be &quot;easy&quot; to do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re going to dig into the LV false flag remember why you&#39;re doing it. It&#39;s not for me or for you it&#39;s for the normies/asleep people. (WTF else you call them?) The rest of us who might have a clue realize this attack is false flagy from what we&#39;ve gatthered.</p>

<p>If you dig, remember you know nothing. Don&#39;t try to convince yourself of anything. The truth will not have to so many odd questions with no reasonable answers (unless you understand a very powerful, well organized, band of cliques rule the world and will pull shit off like this. See: JFK, OKC, 911)</p>

<p>Remember not to be biased ever. Remember to take a break because seriously, fuck conspiracys (Any motherfucker tell you conspiracy theorists want to believe in that shit because its &quot;its entertaining&quot; you stare them down like they&#39;re a tucking idiot. This shit is grimm ...) so take a break from digging into conspiracys... It can and will drain you of a lot...</p>

<p>The thing is, is Stephen Paddock didn&#39;t know his father was a criminal when he was a child. His mother told the kids that their father was killed/dead. Paddock as a kid/teen didn&#39;t know his dad was wanted by the FBI. They didn&#39;t find this out till their mother told tem when they were well into their adult years</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll preface that I&#39;m not generally a conspiracy theory believer.  I enjoy this sub, but honestly consider maybe half or more of what I read as complete nonsense.  I don&#39;t downvote or anything, respectfully let them have their opinions without jumping in telling them why I think they&#39;re crazy (if not also entertaining at times)</p>

<p>But I am open minded enough to know there is always more to the story.</p>

<p>I cannot understand how in the world the Vegas shooting has disappeared so completely from the news.  Weeks later there are only more questions than answers.  This was one of the worst crimes in US history and it&#39;s already a distant memory.  </p>

<p>And with minimal media coverage and public scrutiny, the accountability for answers is effectively zero.   </p>

<p>It&#39;s truly a shame and I&#39;ll upvote posts like this as my small contribution to wanting answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i agree to an extent.  I certainly think most/all people in front of a camera were actors.  i still havent seen footage or a good picture of someone being shot or a bullet wound.  just lots of footage where this is assumed.  &quot;dead&quot; bodies on the ground with no wounds in all the footage I have seen.  And to the people claiming they had friends die, etc. you do realise this is not an argument you can make as this cannot be verified.</p>
