    <div class="md"><p>Whoa, very interesting point. </p>

<p>Kinda related, I keep asking myself wtf Russia would need with our Uranium? Why did a Russian company even want to bother with all the trouble they would (did) have to go through to get their hands near our uranium? They have plenty of their own, unless I am horribly informed. </p>

<p>So, was this whole uranium deal a Russian/Putin entrapment scheme to destabilize our government? Similar to the trap put together to catch Trump going for that opposition research. </p>

<p>I believe the whole Russian collusion hoax is just that, a hoax. But don&#39;t think for a minute that I think Putin is our buddy. He just wasn&#39;t the bad guy in this very narrow subject.  </p>

<p>Tl;dr: Does anyone know why the Russians wanted/needed our uranium?</p>

<p>A terrible metaphor for sure, but in the end what did Putin have to loose? Nothing. The need for materials doesn&#39;t have to be there for it to benefit the Russians.

<p>Trump didn&#39;t have anything to do with the Uranium One deal. Are you generalizing that he is under investigation for Russia ties? That really brushes over the premise of what I&#39;m theorizing.</p>

<p>Also, indictment is a no partisan decision by both sides of the aisle. It doesn&#39;t matter whether the &quot;repubs&quot; have anything to do with it. If evidence turns up that Trump colluded with Russians he should be prosecuted.</p>

<p>If evidence shows that Hillary or her team, as public servants, knowingly endangered American lives for her own personal profit of 100&#39;s of millions of dollars, she should be prosecuted.</p>

<p>These are non partisan facts and simply how the judicial system<em>should</em> work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I stand corrected. I shouldn&#39;t be pointing out just Hillary. I guess the fault lies on the entire administration.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the kicker: The Uranium One scandal is not only, or even principally, a Clinton scandal. It is an Obama-administration scandal.</p>

<p>The Clintons were just doing what the Clintons do: cashing in on their “public service.” The Obama administration, with Secretary Clinton at the forefront but hardly alone, was knowingly compromising American national-security interests. The administration green-lighted the transfer of control over one-fifth of American uranium-mining capacity to Russia, a hostile regime — and specifically to Russia’s state-controlled nuclear-energy conglomerate, Rosatom. Worse, at the time the administration approved the transfer, it knew that Rosatom’s American subsidiary was engaged in a lucrative racketeering enterprise that had already committed felony extortion, fraud, and money-laundering offenses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/452972/uranium-one-deal-obama-administration-doj-hillary-clinton-racketeering">This article outlines, very well, how HRC played a role and profited tremendously off the transaction.</a></p>

<p>At the end of the day, how can you brush off the matter of the fact that Nuclear assets were sold and HRC immediately became $100+ million richer? The fact that Russia doesn&#39;t need more seems like a fucked up way of disregarding the fact that, because of that transaction, they have.</p>

 &quot;Mr. Christensen, 65, noted that despite assurances by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that uranium could not leave the country without Uranium One or ARMZ obtaining an export license — which they do not have — yellowcake from his property was routinely packed into drums and trucked off to a processing plant in Canada.
Asked about that, the commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada even though it does not have an export license. Instead, the transport company doing the shipping, RSB Logistic Services, has the license. A commission spokesman said that “to the best of our knowledge” most of the uranium sent to Canada for processing was returned for use in the United States. A Uranium One spokeswoman, Donna Wichers, said 25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan. At the moment, with the uranium market in a downturn, nothing is being shipped from the Wyoming mines.&quot;</p>

<p>They were basically meant to hurt Hillary from every angle. </p>

<p>Well he hasn&#39;t spent any money himself to investigate voter fraud. Probably because his outlandish statement about millions of illegals voting would be proven completely false. </p>

<p>What state do you live in? I don&#39;t have a family but I pay 40 bucks a month for my healthcare. There&#39;s a lot that goes into why premiums rise. The CBO projects that the republcian health plan would do nothing to lower premiums. So I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d think you&#39;d be better off with their plan. </p>

<p>Yeah the stock market is doing well. Rich Americans will do quite well under Trump.  Over 50% of these new tax cuts will go to the top 1%. On top of that, 30% will go to the top 0.1%. The middle class is also going to get slammed when they take away certain deductions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2017/09/29/trump-plan-delivers-massive-tax-cuts-to-the-1-and-sharp-kick-to-upper-middle-class/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2017/09/29/trump-plan-delivers-massive-tax-cuts-to-the-1-and-sharp-kick-to-upper-middle-class/</a></p>

<p>So yeah, I&#39;m glad your stocks are doing well. But the majority of people that voted for Trump don&#39;t have thousands invested in the market. I hope he actually gets around to helping those people at some point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the info on the ads, will change the OP. Any Politico article is going to be heavily left biased and The No Agenda show I listen to stated that the ads were specifically anti Trump. In my opinion it doesn&#39;t make sense that there was  honestly, no one thought he would win.</p>

<p>I mean... I am middle class and I have stocks. I&#39;m not coming up by the millions but I&#39;ve certainly never seen such an awesome spike in my gains. Even my 401k climbed from 8% to 20%+. </p>

<p>I have a family and definitely pay $1200 per month as I don&#39;t qualify for Government assistance, so I am responsible for covering healthcare in the family plan which, even though I only have one child, makes me responsible for covering as many children as my wife can handle...She cried when the EO for trading across state lines was passed. The proposed tax cut should also put a few thousand back in my pocket next year as well.</p>

<p>Also, the prosecution of foul play from the previous administration is moving along organically. The judicial system will have their time to prosecute and as with Weiner and Awan, the court will reach a just conclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To expand further on this point, there seems to have been an accident related to the transport of yellowcake from Wyoming to Canada in 2012.<br/>
Uranium one moved these containers of yellowcake too fast and at least one of them exploded and contaminated three workers. This is the uranium that everyone in the administration repeatedly said was never leaving the untied states.<br/>
After trying some internet searches, I find someone on abt who claims that a regulatory agency in Canada scrubbed information from their website about all of this. He was quick enough to grab screenshots.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>That is kinda what I am getting at. The perception is that this is US uranium. But I thought it was a mine in Kazakhastan. So, did the US company just own that mine? The controversy over HRC cupping balls on this deal, I don&#39;t get why it is framed as something that is in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Woah its almost like the Clinton foundation might be a proxy or something! That would be insane though right? Its a fully functioning normal charity! Which is why the donations dropped off by a sizeable percentage because people realized they could no longer buy influence? </p>

<p>its almost like when saudi arabia donated 25 million dollars and got a huge weapons deal approved a couple months later. </p>

<p>Bill also got a 500k speaking fee for a speech in russia before hill signed off on that uranium one deal. But youre right its a nothingburger</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Received the money as bribery for the Uranium One deal? Seems like a strange thing to donate to...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Clinton Foundation builds partnerships of great purpose between businesses, governments, NGOs, and individuals to work faster, better, and leaner; to find solutions that last; and to transform lives and communities from what they are today to what they can be, tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the Clinton Foundation website. Not sure what that had to do with Uranium or why the donation was of such a large amount.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

 &quot;Mr. Christensen, 65, noted that despite assurances by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that uranium could not leave the country without Uranium One or ARMZ obtaining an export license — which they do not have — yellowcake from his property was routinely packed into drums and trucked off to a processing plant in Canada.
Asked about that, the commission confirmed that Uranium One has, in fact, shipped yellowcake to Canada even though it does not have an export license. Instead, the transport company doing the shipping, RSB Logistic Services, has the license. A commission spokesman said that “to the best of our knowledge” most of the uranium sent to Canada for processing was returned for use in the United States. A Uranium One spokeswoman, Donna Wichers, said 25 percent had gone to Western Europe and Japan. At the moment, with the uranium market in a downturn, nothing is being shipped from the Wyoming mines.&quot;</p>
