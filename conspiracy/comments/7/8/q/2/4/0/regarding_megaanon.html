Looking over some of the things she has said, it seems obvious that this person has provided more than enough info for anyone in any kind of investigatory agency to identify her.</p>

<p>She has also said a few things that seem slightly... incriminating.  So I&#39;m just wondering, does anyone actually believe this stuff?  Because, in my opinion, this sounds like managed leaks from someone who has no fear of reprisal, from this administration or any future one.  And that seems... bizarre... considering the content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, my biggest red flag with MegaAnon is the use of the parenthesis, the standard anti-jewish white supremacist tactic to indicate &quot;the jews&quot;.</p>

<p>If they were the real deal, surely they wouldn&#39;t be so stupid as to associate themselves and anyone who takes them seriously with white supremacists. Makes me think it is an intentional psyop so that once this hits the front page of real newspapers it will be easy to dismiss everyone involved as raging anti-semites.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was discussing this elsewhere the other day, and the user I was talking to said that there have been moves to associate the (((this))) thing with NWO related material, which of course involves a great deal of jewish people, but they were trying to make it cover a more general area of conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting. I have definitely seen people using it to mean Jewish, but perhaps they learned that from the disinfo. Still though, you have to pick your battles. I love Jewish people and I was really annoyed when I thought MegaAnon was an actual antisemite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It started as a chrome extension that marked certain names identified as belonging to jewish people. We know without doubt what its original usage meant. But megaanon&#39;s lack of serious discussion of jewish people negatively at the same time using the brackets made me wonder if there was an alternate meaning floating around. I had the same questions you obviously have. Not sure what to make of any of it honestly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>the biggest giveaway that megaanon is not connected to the administration and is larping? the things she talks about - Las Vegas, 9/11, plans to take down Clinton, etc. would be shared only on a need to know basis. if there were some broad strategic plan for Trump to bring so much damaging information to light, the last thing his team could afford is letting a nobody in on the plan so that they could blab it to the public.</p>

<p>i have no doubt that some of what she&#39;s claiming is more or less true, because we&#39;re seeing it play out with the Uranium One and Russia dossier scandals getting new attention on the Hill and in the media. But anyone who is up on the latest news could weave a pretty good story about a broader plan after the news is already out there. </p>

<p>We see that all the time on Twitter, with various pundits explaining their theories on the broader Clinton take down plan we&#39;re watching unfold.</p>

<p>The difference is, the twitter pundits don&#39;t claim to be insiders. They&#39;re offering opinions and being honest about it.</p>

<p>Megaanon does not come across as honest or knowledgeable to me. She&#39;s reading the news and offering her interpretation of where things might be headed.</p>
