       This isn't a doxxing thread, so please don't engage in that.  But I just wanted your opinion regarding MegaAnon.  Looking over some of the things she has said, it seems obvious that this person has provided more than enough info for anyone in any kind of investigatory agency to identify her.
      </p>
      <p>
       She has also said a few things that seem slightly... incriminating.  So I'm just wondering, does anyone actually believe this stuff?  Because, in my opinion, this sounds like managed leaks from someone who has no fear of reprisal, from this administration or any future one.  And that seems... bizarre... considering the content.

       I'm not a big believer in Anons, but this one seems a bit more genuine than most IMO. There are a lot of details that "she" includes that are intriguing.

       So, my biggest red flag with MegaAnon is the use of the parenthesis, the standard anti-jewish white supremacist tactic to indicate "the jews".
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were the real deal, surely they wouldn't be so stupid as to associate themselves and anyone who takes them seriously with white supremacists. Makes me think it is an intentional psyop so that once this hits the front page of real newspapers it will be easy to dismiss everyone involved as raging anti-semites.

       I was discussing this elsewhere the other day, and the user I was talking to said that there have been moves to associate the (((this))) thing with NWO related material, which of course involves a great deal of jewish people, but they were trying to make it cover a more general area of conspiracy.

       Interesting. I have definitely seen people using it to mean Jewish, but perhaps they learned that from the disinfo. Still though, you have to pick your battles. I love Jewish people and I was really annoyed when I thought MegaAnon was an actual antisemite.

       It started as a chrome extension that marked certain names identified as belonging to jewish people. We know without doubt what its original usage meant. But megaanon's lack of serious discussion of jewish people negatively at the same time using the brackets made me wonder if there was an alternate meaning floating around. I had the same questions you obviously have. Not sure what to make of any of it honestly.

       Awesome, that is good to know. So, we are taking it back to its roots here? This punches a little hole in my Loesch theory. I don't think she was a real internet denizen back then. Shoot, I was and I do not recall this. Most modern internet creatures are only going to know of the jewish connotation.

       I have read many of her posts. She does use triple parenthesis extensively and I think by referring to
       <em>
        them
       </em>
       she means those

       I believe this is a real person that thinks they are telling the truth. I kinda have a crazy theory that it is Dana Loesch.

       If she is a never trumper you could never tell from how she defends him today. Literally never heard this. Not saying it isn't true, and I am not super familiar with any of these people. Just I have not heard it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What she is though is a regular on reddit and 4chan, or at least intimately familiar with how they work. She also worked for Bannon (as megaA has said), and is not working in government (as megaA has also said).

       the biggest giveaway that megaanon is not connected to the administration and is larping? the things she talks about - Las Vegas, 9/11, plans to take down Clinton, etc. would be shared only on a need to know basis. if there were some broad strategic plan for Trump to bring so much damaging information to light, the last thing his team could afford is letting a nobody in on the plan so that they could blab it to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       i have no doubt that some of what she's claiming is more or less true, because we're seeing it play out with the Uranium One and Russia dossier scandals getting new attention on the Hill and in the media. But anyone who is up on the latest news could weave a pretty good story about a broader plan after the news is already out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see that all the time on Twitter, with various pundits explaining their theories on the broader Clinton take down plan we're watching unfold.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference is, the twitter pundits don't claim to be insiders. They're offering opinions and being honest about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Megaanon does not come across as honest or knowledgeable to me. She's reading the news and offering her interpretation of where things might be headed.
