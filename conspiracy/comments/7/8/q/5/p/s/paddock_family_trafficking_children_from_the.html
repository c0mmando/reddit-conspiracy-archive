        <h3 class="title">Paddock Family Trafficking Children from the Philippines?</h3>

        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alright, so this guy Stephen Paddock commits the worst mass shooting in the history of the US, and his motivation is completely unknown. We know that he had a &quot;girlfriend&quot; in the Philippines who he sent large sums of money to, and he also had a massive arsenal of weapons. Philippines is a country that has been notorious for pedophilia and child abuse (see: Peter Scully). Stephen Paddock was a very wealthy man who supposedly made his fortune gambling and investing, though many people say that this is a ridiculous explanation for how he became wealthy. A day after the shooting, his brother is interviewed and repeatedly tells reporters that his brother was &quot;comped&quot; this, comped that. He is incredibly flustered and nervous and keeps repeating the word &quot;comped&quot;. In many circles, when somebody is interviewed and uses the word &quot;comped&quot;, it is a codeword for &quot;our operation has been compromised&quot;. And today another one of the Paddock brothers got arrested for child porn.</p>

<p>So the theory is that Stephen Paddock was trafficking children from the Philippines until his operation got compromised. Knowing that he was fucked no matter what, he did his murder-suicide rampage. His brother did an interview the next day and kept saying &quot;comped&quot; to alert everybody else involved in the operation that the operation had been compromised. What do you guys think? I would give this theory a 10-20% chance of being real. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>His brother was referring to Stephen being comped free rooms and food all over Vegas for his high gambling status. I go to vegas a few times a year and have friends who get the same treatment from casinos. Nothing unusual about it. I also tyhimk it&#39;s an absurd stretched based on &quot;a feeling&quot; to conclude that use of the word somehow relates to rhe shut down of a mass pedo ring out of the phillipines for which there is no actual evidence linking the two (yet). Try and be more discerning with your &quot;investigation&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You get comps if you win big $. Why? Because the casinos know the longer you continue to gamble big $ the more likely you are to lose that money. Do some research on it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You also get comps if you&#39;re losing big.  They don&#39;t care which, it&#39;s just based on dollars in.,  You don&#39;t need the house to help much with laundering the money when it&#39;s those amounts.  You might if it was Tony Montana and his crew dropping off laundry sacks of cash at the bank.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do some research on video poker it that&#39;s actually all this guy played. You can have ups and downs but over the long run the machines pay out LESS than what it takes in. The house may only have a 1-3% edge but that&#39;s still a house edge.</p>

<p>It is impossible to play video poker every day and wind up on top. The key being Paddock was a &quot;regular&quot; gambler. He would&#39;ve reached the long run and passed short term variance.</p>

<p>He did not make millions playing video poker. That is impossible. It is likely the house made 10s of thousands, if not more off of his play in the past year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps all that you say is true, but instead of Paddock going of his rocker on his own, he was forced into doing what they told him to do, being where they told him to be, or face the US criminal justice system, unbeknownst to him he would still die in the end.  Maybe he was set up as the &quot;fall guy&quot; to be in the right place at the right time, with the right back story. --insert X-files sound-track here--</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely going with the latter. I’m pretty sure he made his money under the table doing all sorts of shady shit. “5 mil a year in video poker” is bullshit, or you’re gambling double that to launder it. Same with real estate.</p>

<p>And if you’re laundering millions a year, you’re deep into dealing drugs, arms, or sex trade.</p>
