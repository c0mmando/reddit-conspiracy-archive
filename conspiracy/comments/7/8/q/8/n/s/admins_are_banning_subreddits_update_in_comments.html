    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t browse it regularly enough to know but if they&#39;re saying &quot;glorifies death&quot; is enough to get a sub banned, I&#39;d say that sub definitely meets that criteria. &quot;Do Not Post Violence&quot; is a rule too, Ive seen <em>several</em> beheadings and shooting crimes on WPD.</p>

<p>The admins said WPD was reviewed but not in violation, though some posts on the sub are. So what exactly do they ban for?</p>

<p>If they&#39;re banning outright for encouraging or inciting violence, r/fullcommunism should be banned just like r/Nazi is now. Their sticky literally has people complaining in it that they can&#39;t wish death or violence upon people any more.</p>

<p>How is that justification for banning them? The mods are trying to adhere to and reinforce site-wide policy. <a href="/r/Nazi">/r/Nazi</a> represents a fundamentally genocidal philosophy. That is some serious false equivalence, dude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The mods are <em>begrudgingly</em> adhering, the sticky says &quot;for now&quot; lol</p>

<p>There&#39;s literally a post on their front-page that says &quot;Stalin did nothing wrong&quot;, Stalin and Hitler may be politically different but they&#39;re both genocidal maniacs. </p>

<p>Nazi&#39;s saying others should die or suffer violence isnt fundamentally different from Communists saying Nazi&#39;s should die or suffer violence. You dont get to break rules because you&#39;re on the PC side of the moral compass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, again, the mods are reinforcing those rules. The fact that you interpret it as &quot;begrudgingly&quot; is neither here nor there. If they fail miserably, perhaps they&#39;ll be banned too.</p>

<p>But saying they should be banned because people are complaining in the sticky is absurd. If your approach was implemented, what&#39;s to stop trolls from plonking a couple of such comments in every sub they don&#39;t like in order to generate an instaban?</p>

<p>I also checked said sticky, and it seemed to be one person talking about punching Nazis, not wishing death on anyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I never said they should be banned because of the sticky, they should be banned for the content in their subreddit. The users in the sticky exemplify my point, that they do not want to participate.</p>

<p>&quot;Stalin did nothing wrong&quot; is just as bad as saying &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong.&quot; people who praise Hitler despite him killing millions of Jews, gays, blacks, and disabled people is no different than people saying &quot;Stalin did nothing wrong&quot; despite him intentionally starving millions of Ethnic Ukrainians to death.</p>

<p>If the mods were adhering to the rules, why is that post still up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies for misunderstanding and misrepresenting your reasons. Really sorry about that. That was some weak reading comprehension on my part.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I still think there is a significant difference between an extant comment praising Stalin (whose crimes included targeting Ukrainians to quell independence) in a somewhat satirical sub, and whole communities sincerely dedicated to racism and genocidal philosophies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not an issue, I should&#39;ve been more clear. The comment about the sticky was more of a side-bar comment and I didn&#39;t make it clear that I was talking more about the content.</p>

<p>And while you may be right, there shouldn&#39;t be room for satirical calls to violence either in my opinion. If someone made a sub, clearly labeled it as satire in every way possible, and focused it on being a Nazi version of fullcommunism, I&#39;d say the exact same thing I&#39;m saying now. I&#39;m extremely happy that Reddit is taking action on legitimate hate subs with no purpose but to incite violence or otherwise degrade others, satire or not, is dangerous.</p>

<p>I&#39;m using this as an example, and does not necessarily indicate my political leanings:</p>

<p>I think the very first Trump general on /pol/ (as in way before there was an idea he had a chance) was satire, but from /pol/ came this huge wave of alt-right. In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure most of 4chan and /pol/ is satire. That doesn&#39;t make what they do okay in my opinion, because it attracts people who are <em>not</em> being satirical. Have you seen how many legitimate Flat Earthers get fooled by r/flat_earth? </p>

<p>Me using fullcommunism was meant to just be an example, I don&#39;t have a personal vendetta against them or anything and I&#39;m sure there are many worse than they are. That&#39;s just the one I happened to look around at the time I was looking into these rule changes because I saw it mentioned in the r/drama thread. </p>

<p>Why would that mean it&#39;s not conspiracy related at all? Half of the conspiracies we talk about in here are about exactly that. Monsanto, Enron, Google, Apple, Facebook, every cable company, Bayer and the rest of big Pharma, and more</p>

<p>They also only posted this in r/modnews and not r/announcements, meaning only people who moderate subreddits can see it. Why hide it if there&#39;s no agenda behind the rule change.</p>

<p>Saying &quot;they&#39;re just getting the obvious ones now, they&#39;ll get the rest later&quot; has never worked here. Reddit has taken quite a bit of criticism for not enforcing the rules consistently every time they do this.</p>

<p>The conspiracy involves <em>enforcement of their own rules</em>. If you arbitrarily enforce rules when they&#39;re convenient to you, or to silence a narrative, that would qualify as content suitable for here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone have examples of posts on r/DylanRoofInnocent? Was it blatant racism or is calling him innocent what got the sub banned? I guess I&#39;m asking was it purely a racist sub or was it more of a conspiracy sub dedicates to that shooting? I&#39;ve never visited that one </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As long as we keep some kind of semblance of order, and moderate the obvious TOS violations religiously, they are not going to kill this sub. It acts as a catchall and honeypot of conspiracy material. If they ban the sub all these users and all of their energy will spread and cause disruption elsewhere.</p>

<p>They ain&#39;t ever gonna <em>help</em> us, like with TMOR and the like. But we are a necessary evil to contain the darkside.</p>
