    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t understand how probability works.</p>

<p>Someone else in this thread did the math.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The probability of at least one spectator being subbed here (assuming 500,000 subscribers and 11,000 people present at the concert) is 1 - ((7.3 billion - 11,000) choose 500,000)/(7.3 billion choose 500,000) = .53. So there is a 53% chance that someone subbed here was in attendance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That figure goes up significantly if you reduce the 7.3B figure to only include those likely that would 1. have internet access, 2. be on an English website, 3. have reasonable access to attend a Las Vegas concert, 4. etc. etc.</p>

<p>As in, it is highly likely that numerous Americans would be both country music fans at that concert and be conspiracy redditors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The probability of at least one spectator being subbed here (assuming 500,000 subscribers and 11,000 people present at the concert) is 1 - ((7.3 billion - 11,000) choose 500,000)/(7.3 billion choose 500,000) = .53. So there is a 53% chance that someone subbed here was in attendance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi, I was there and I have been lurking on this subreddit (for the first time) in the past couple weeks.  I haven&#39;t posted because I don&#39;t believe I have any significant information to share, but I do read these posts because I am still thinking about it constantly and it is insane to me that nobody else seems to be talking about it anymore. Maybe I am the only one, but we do exist :) :)</p>
