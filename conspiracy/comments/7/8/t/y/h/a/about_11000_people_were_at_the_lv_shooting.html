       the point is this is a niche forum of ideas the vast majority of people see as crazy at best. no one thinks i better speak with fringe conspiracy theorists after surviving a mass shooting. despite claims to the contrary, they spoke to the media. most people don't want to associated with this cesspool - they aren't aware of you, and if they are, they think you are fringe weirdos

       Bullshit. The other day I had a bunch of trolls trying to argue with me about how the main narrative is correct. I keep asking myself am I'm in r/conspiracy. Even though I was, I was being treated like I was crazy because I made a comment about how I don't trust the official investigation. Lol.

       ok. like me, some users come here to see what crazy you are all spinning and comment on it. it doesn't change the fact that the recent posts here are about how paddock was a clone and that the earth is stationary. people calling out some of the denial of reality that this place is built on doesn't change r/conspiracy from being a joke at best to almost anyone who has been here

       So your a troll? You just described yourself as being a troll. You say some users but I see a lot. I didn't say anything about clones or the earth. All I said was I don't trust the official investigation. I had at least 5 trolls with nothing to say hounding me about my opinion. This happens way too much for it to be "some users."

       im not arguing with you about whatever you believe - i am saying anyone outside the little conspiracy circle see this place as a bad joke. this is b/c we are all paid by soros to...oh no ive said to much! your right - we are all part of conspiracy to make it seem like people think conspiracy theorists are crazy. its not just people passing the time - we are organized

       A babey was just born in Uganda, so it's now even less statistically likely that someone from the concert would find Reddit.

       You don't understand how probability works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone else in this thread did the math.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The probability of at least one spectator being subbed here (assuming 500,000 subscribers and 11,000 people present at the concert) is 1 - ((7.3 billion - 11,000) choose 500,000)/(7.3 billion choose 500,000) = .53. So there is a 53% chance that someone subbed here was in attendance.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That figure goes up significantly if you reduce the 7.3B figure to only include those likely that would 1. have internet access, 2. be on an English website, 3. have reasonable access to attend a Las Vegas concert, 4. etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       As in, it is highly likely that numerous Americans would be both country music fans at that concert and be conspiracy redditors.

       I'm sure someone could do the math to get the probability that someone there could be here as far as statistics go but I suck at math and it's 2 AM
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought there were more people there than 11k too, but just going with that, out if 300,000,000 ish people in the US, 11,000 were there. There's 514k subscribers here, a lot of which are abandoned accounts, alts, and throwaways.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say there's a notable chance that someone there subscribes here, but I don't think it's a statistical certainty

       Hi, I was there and I have been lurking on this subreddit (for the first time) in the past couple weeks.  I haven't posted because I don't believe I have any significant information to share, but I do read these posts because I am still thinking about it constantly and it is insane to me that nobody else seems to be talking about it anymore. Maybe I am the only one, but we do exist :) :)
