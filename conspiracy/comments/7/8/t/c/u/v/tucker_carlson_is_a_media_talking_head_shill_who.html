       Tucker Carlson is still a shill in my book. You don't get to be on the fucking mainstream media and have your own segment unless you agree to not "go there" unless instructed to do so...
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is they are doing this to try and get conspiracy theorists to lend your trust to the "right" side of the left/right paradigm;
Nobody else thinks its weird that CNN is always bashed here but Fox news segments make the front page?
      </p>
      <p>
       There has been an anti hillary clinton post every single day since the election, yet very few calling out Trump's bullshit..
      </p>
      <p>
       And Alex Jones, the so called "Alternative Media" leader, has turned into a blatant "pro Conservative-pro Trump-Anti CNN-Trump and Republicans-can-do-no-wrong" lap dog?
TPTB Are trying to merge and push the conspiracy theorists to the conservative side of the paradigm, they are duping you all and sucking you into trusting that side of the spectrum with moves like this Tucker Carlson thing. Trump's goofy ass tweets about "I will release the JFK files"..The dude is an undercover puppet. This is the new "angle" the elites are going with. They want to make you think that the current government is actually on your side this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       And by doing this, they pit the conspiracy theorists against the REST of the people who largely lean "left" on the spectrum. And we are ripe for a civil war. Please, don't fall intro the trap, and don't make yourself look dumb. We should be calling this out everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       This seems kind of biased..

       You clearly don't have an agenda /s
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you post is anti trump on your stupid account and tucker Carlson literally asked key questions that we have on national television, how does that make him a shill, he has his views and you have your own.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why don't you call out Rachel Maddow for doing fuck all investigative journalism.

       That's not a rule, that's some stupid crap you made up.

       Here's an analogy...

      <p>
       There's a war between you and some other guys..
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the other guys comes over and talks about how bad and mean his side is and how he wants to join yours. However, his buddies are using him as bait for some sort of trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what tucker Carlson is. He's a fucking tv shill. We will see if this guys career goes downhill after this, like what happened to REAL journalists like Ben Swann after he exposed pedogate last year. Carlson is a fake patriot/journalist just like Alex jones...wake up

       In context of that particular statement I used 'right leaning' as a general term to mean Republican leaning. The posts/comments I've encountered so far have been skewed toward a pretty pro-Trump stance. Just an observation, like I said, I'm new to this sub.

       So, no one should trust MSM right? Yet, here you are buying every word this guy is selling because it fits your idea. Just because he SAYS Campos went to Mexico doesn't mean it is true. You don't even know if the document he has is real. Sheep.

       Can I ask what the purpose of repeating your question is? Specifically in response to the answer I gave? I don't mean to be rude but, you clearly understand my answer &amp; it's worded so as to imply that you're expecting/hoping for a 'parroted' response with which to argue. I was really just noting an observation, not judging. I subbed because I have an interest in the subject matter.

       You're talking about MSM pundits as if there is a difference between them. They were "selected" for those roles for a reason. Their ability to verbally manipulate the masses in a coherent manner. That's all there is to it. They own ALL of the media and they make sure there are no loose ends. Especially on a major network like Fox News...

       Yes I understand that, I was only saying that he's more of less one of the most rational sounding pundits. I find that some of the more liberal media outlets are more prone to histrionics. I know they are all part and parcel of the very same fabric.

       I was thinking the same thing... I think they want people debating about this and arguing about it as much as they can-  I think they themselves are driving the whole 1 vs multiple shooter narrative as well.  what do they gain from this? I dont know... does it make it more effective a psy op the longer it stays relevant?
