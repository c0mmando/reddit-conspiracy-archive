        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Tucker Carlson is still a shill in my book. You don&#39;t get to be on the fucking mainstream media and have your own segment unless you agree to not &quot;go there&quot; unless instructed to do so...</p>

<p>My guess is they are doing this to try and get conspiracy theorists to lend your trust to the &quot;right&quot; side of the left/right paradigm;
Nobody else thinks its weird that CNN is always bashed here but Fox news segments make the front page?</p>

<p>There has been an anti hillary clinton post every single day since the election, yet very few calling out Trump&#39;s bullshit..</p>

<p>And Alex Jones, the so called &quot;Alternative Media&quot; leader, has turned into a blatant &quot;pro Conservative-pro Trump-Anti CNN-Trump and Republicans-can-do-no-wrong&quot; lap dog?
TPTB Are trying to merge and push the conspiracy theorists to the conservative side of the paradigm, they are duping you all and sucking you into trusting that side of the spectrum with moves like this Tucker Carlson thing. Trump&#39;s goofy ass tweets about &quot;I will release the JFK files&quot;..The dude is an undercover puppet. This is the new &quot;angle&quot; the elites are going with. They want to make you think that the current government is actually on your side this time.</p>

<p>And by doing this, they pit the conspiracy theorists against the REST of the people who largely lean &quot;left&quot; on the spectrum. And we are ripe for a civil war. Please, don&#39;t fall intro the trap, and don&#39;t make yourself look dumb. We should be calling this out everywhere.</p>

<p>This seems kind of biased..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly don&#39;t have an agenda /s</p>

<p>Everything you post is anti trump on your stupid account and tucker Carlson literally asked key questions that we have on national television, how does that make him a shill, he has his views and you have your own.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you call out Rachel Maddow for doing fuck all investigative journalism.</p>

<p>Your bias is obvious, he literally cracked open questions on a. Crucial conspiracy</p>

<p>and if we were to go off that methodology then you break that rule for regurgitating the same Babur the media spews...</p>

<p>Also he asked the same questions I was asking, so I have to change my viewpoint because the medias asking it.</p>

<p>To add to that hes literally the only one on the big companies asking questions so far, so if anything he&#39;s going against the MSM.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a war between you and some other guys..</p>

<p>One of the other guys comes over and talks about how bad and mean his side is and how he wants to join yours. However, his buddies are using him as bait for some sort of trap. </p>

<p>That&#39;s what tucker Carlson is. He&#39;s a fucking tv shill. We will see if this guys career goes downhill after this, like what happened to REAL journalists like Ben Swann after he exposed pedogate last year. Carlson is a fake patriot/journalist just like Alex jones...wake up </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re talking about MSM pundits as if there is a difference between them. They were &quot;selected&quot; for those roles for a reason. Their ability to verbally manipulate the masses in a coherent manner. That&#39;s all there is to it. They own ALL of the media and they make sure there are no loose ends. Especially on a major network like Fox News...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes I understand that, I was only saying that he&#39;s more of less one of the most rational sounding pundits. I find that some of the more liberal media outlets are more prone to histrionics. I know they are all part and parcel of the very same fabric.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking the same thing... I think they want people debating about this and arguing about it as much as they can-  I think they themselves are driving the whole 1 vs multiple shooter narrative as well.  what do they gain from this? I dont know... does it make it more effective a psy op the longer it stays relevant?  </p>

<p>Pretty sure crisis actors (like the dr phill chick) were hired to say there were multiple shooters </p>

<p>Still, taking into account that MAYBE there&#39;s been a counter-coup, Carlson could be a puppet but for a slightly less evil group. </p>
