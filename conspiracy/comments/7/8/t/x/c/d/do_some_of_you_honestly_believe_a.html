    <div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t know about that. But if true that speaks in favor of right wingers.  Seems like there&#39;s a little bit of everyone here, and I fear you may be confusing DNC corruption news with everyone being right wing. I don&#39;t know about that either, but just a hunch.</p>

<p>So you want to kill democracy and you think that perhaps right wingers opinions and interests shouldn&#39;t be recognized or included. Yet, you&#39;re here, are you a right winger?</p>

<p>I despise leftists more than anything, but I&#39;d never suggest something so asinine that they shouldn&#39;t be included or represented. </p>

<p>And, lastly, I don&#39;t see what &quot;a lot of right wingers&quot; in &quot;conspiracy communities&quot; has to do with right wingers being ostracized or the subject of your post title.</p>

Is America to be gutted and decimated like Europe, or is the American infrastructure to be rebuilt?  The Cabal does not agree on what should happen here.  </p>

<p>Trump is not a member of the Bilderberg Group or the Council on Foreign Relations.  Trump is not a New World Order globalist.  Instead, Trump is a Nationalist like Putin.  It is why the NWO globalists do not want Trump and Putin to get along.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I figured that&#39;s probably what it was.  Which means your comment is pretty fundamentally confused.  The major reason to &quot;rebuild American infrastructure&quot; in the short term is to support masses of third-world immigration.  I know that Donald Trump told you otherwise, but he was pandering.  There are two broad economic strategy options, given the current system:  growth and de-growth.  The &quot;growth&quot; strategy is entirely designed around mass immigration.  That dynamic will be impossible to alter in the short term.</p>

<p>Furthermore, with regards to Europe, it was re-built using Arab oil, laundered through the Federal Reserve and US military.  That&#39;s the reason Europe is now getting Muslim immigration, and most of the reason they are so salty about it.  The point is, <em>you can&#39;t have it both ways</em>.  Europe has deliberately chosen a strategy of growth.  They really have no option.  It is overpopulated.  It is energy-dependent.  Their system is inherently socialist, fractured and reliant upon some level of money-printing.  They have porous, indefensible borders.  It is natural for them to expand and it is natural for them to expand southwards.</p>

<p>The US, on the other hand, <em>has</em> an option.  We can choose de-growth, in the short term, and growth in the long term.  We just haven&#39;t, so far.  Because doing so is <em>extremely</em> difficult and doesn&#39;t involve any politically expedient major infrastructure building (aside from walls, perhaps) in the short term.</p>

<p>Furthermore, &quot;the cabal&quot; are not trillionaires.  They are not the elite. 
 They are a collection of bankers, fake billionaires and court Jews who manage the wealth of the elite.  The cabal are natural democrats and egalitarians.  They are the illuminate and the black nobility.  They are in the business of human resource management and reality manipulation.  And they use (mostly) manufactured pedophilia scandals as a tool of blackmail to threaten and to extort the elite.  Whether he is into it or not, Donald Trump is a product of the cabal.</p>

<p>Like I said, your understanding seems pretty fundamentally confused, even though you are close to the truth.  It is a bit more complicated than you assume.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Cabal has access to over a trillion dollars in 1946 because of the Japanese gold that was captured in the Philippines.  I cannot imagine how much it is worth now.  Also, the Federal Reserve has been in place for other 100 years now.  It is staggering to think about all that money they have stolen from Americans since then.  I have read that the Federal Income tax goes to the Bank of England and the Vatican.  Of course, the Bank of England is Rothschild controlled.  Also, there are only three central banks (NK, Iran, Cuba) in the world that are not Rothschild controlled.  Maybe four, if you count Bolivia.  They are collecting taxes from citizens in all of those countries, and you believe they are not trillionaires?  It would not surprise me if they are quadrillionaires at this point.  </p>

<p>&quot;The major reason to &quot;rebuild American infrastructure&quot; in the short term is to support masses of third-world immigration. I know that Donald Trump told you otherwise, but he was pandering. There are two broad economic strategy options, given the current system: growth and de-growth. The &quot;growth&quot; strategy is entirely designed around mass immigration. That dynamic will be impossible to alter in the short term.&quot;  The problem with this plan is that Americans are very, very well armed.  You cannot say the same for Europeans.  </p>

<p>Did you watch Michael Moore&#39;s movie Where To Invade Next?  Europe was doing very well on socialism.  They were spending money on healthcare, education, infrastructure, etc. instead of military.  I am thinking that the Cabal will not let this continue because then everyone will want the same thing.  The problem is that there is less money for the Cabal to steal if the money is spent for the benefit of the citizenry.  </p>

<p>&quot;The US, on the other hand, has an option. We can choose de-growth, in the short term, and growth in the long term. We just haven&#39;t, so far. Because doing so is extremely difficult and doesn&#39;t involve any politically expedient major infrastructure building (aside from walls, perhaps) in the short term.&quot;  We can also bring back manufacturing.  It is what made America so great to begin with.  We could ramp up production to produce whatever we wanted in quantities that were unmatched by any other country.  This ability has been destroyed.  It used to be that an American family of four could have a nice life on a single income.  Now, people struggle with double incomes.  A lot of people have it even worse because there is only one parent in the home.  The middle class has been destroyed so that there is a huge gap between the rich and poor.  A small group of people own over half the world&#39;s wealth now, and this cannot continue if we are to survive.  </p>

<p>Are you a NWO globalist?  </p>
