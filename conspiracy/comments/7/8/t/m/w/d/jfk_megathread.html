       If you're that powerful, why would harmful documents be beyond you?

       My guess is these events are immortalized in writing and passed on through the generations. Sure, they could destroy all the evidence but then they lose the red pill capabilities of all this information.  It's more valuable for the copies to exist and remain hidden then for them to erase all trace.

       Great question.
If they shredded any damaging stuff. Nobody would actually know about it unless insider leak, which is highly uncommon and dangerous. Exactly, little faith. I'm learning about FOIA in my intro to criminal justice class. They don't have the classifications on the text book but the foia.gov has the 10 confidential guidelines that literally conflict with each other so you could easily find a damaging document, referred against the guidelines you can find 9/10 reasons for the 1 sentence.

        The Team is conducting archival processing on the documents to prepare the records for scanning. Agencies with equities in the withheld materials have been notified that previously withheld documents will be released in 2017 absent a successful appeal to the President. The staff is working with NARA’s Office of Innovation to determine the best way to present the documents through archives.gov when released in 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the digital release is completed the hard copy documents will be interfiled into the five million pages of the paper Collection.

       I could see some of those jobs where if you're lucky you wouldn't have to touch a phone for a day. Although I'm pretty sure if you have customers and you decide to not answer your phone all day without any notice, you might lose some business.

       They killed our President. They killed Jack, and then Bobby. Two bright lights of hope, cut down. The world was never darker than that day, I tell you. Because it wasn't like the light had gone out of the sky - it was like the light fell out of sky for all time, forever. They killed, in biblical terms, a Just Man. They don't teach kids about Kennedy anymore. No one cares. But we do.

       Holocaust wasn't one day.
      </p>
      <p>
       9/11 was most likely pulled off by the same people.
      </p>
      <p>
       The assassination of JFK led to the escalation of the Vietnam War, doubling-down on the Cold War, a monster of a President (LBJ), the revamping of the military industrial complex, unchecked power for three-letter agencies, a nuclear Middle East, and the breakdown of trust between the government and the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a very good contender for "darkest day".

       JFK Jr's plane crash is presumed to be caused by the Clinton's so Hillary could be the NY senator instead of JFK Jr.

       There have been a number of clinton enemies who have died in plane crashes except Jr'd crash occured during good flying conditions and he had a wealth of experience.

       There's different theories as to who and why JFK was assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me be clear: The "magic bullet" theory is absurd--along with the subsequent official investigations. I suggest everyone read the leaked CIA memo
       <strong>
        1035-960
       </strong>
       where the CIA weaponized the term Conspiracy Theorist. The document has literal bullet points on how operatives should dilute, disrupt, and obfuscate theories around his death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, please research JFK's discussions with the found of Israel, Ben Gurion, in relation to Israeli nuclear testing.
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK was disliked by numerous nefarious groups, but he really pissed off the military industrial complex, intelligence agencies, and radicals like the Irgun.  The Dimona conflict isn't mentioned as much, but in my opinion it was one of the top reasons he was taken out.
      </p>
      <p>
       RIP John

       Also, when people bring up how, if the entire military industrial complex was in on killing JFK, why hasn't anyone leaked any info.  Well, with a mob hit, you don't have a 100 people in on it, its a handful of loyal men, and they are very good at keeping quite.

       I honestly believe it was a small vendetta agaisnt the President. That a small group of men within the FBI planned it and made it happen
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       that the whole entire FBI was in on it.

       The mob theory definitely pans out, but then it bears the questions, why did a mobster kill the assassin? If the assassin (Oswald) was part of the mob, then why did Ruby (Oswalds assassin) kill him?

       Yes, good questions.  Ruby is another point in favor of the mob hit theory.

       But, as you've correctly pointed out, the problem with the mob hit theory is Oswald, he's just such a weird character.

       Dimona was (is) Israel's nuclear facility.

       Israel was determined to get nuclear weapons, and JFK was not going to allow that to happen, as he plainly told Israel's Prime Minister, David Ben-Gurion, in this letter, of May, 1963.

       He followed up with another letter to newly elected Israeli Prime Minister Eshkol in July, 1963, demanding that the US be allowed to inspect the facility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quoting the JFK letter:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "You are aware, I am sure, of the exchanges which I had with Prime Minister Ben-Gurion concerning American visits to Israel's nuclear facility at Dimona. Most recently, the Prime Minister wrote to me on May 27. His words reflected a most intense personal consideration of a problem that I know is not easy for your Government, as it is not for mine. We welcomed the former Prime Minister's strong reaffirmation that Dimona will be devoted exclusively to peaceful purposes and the reaffirmation also of Israel's willingness to permit periodic visits to Dimona....
       </p>
       <p>
        "Therefore, I asked our scientists to review the alternative schedules of visits we and you had proposed. If Israel's purposes are to be clear beyond reasonable doubt, I believe that the schedule which would best serve our common purposes would be a visit early this summer, another visit in June 1964, and thereafter at intervals of six months."

       In November, Kennedy was dead, and Johnson was President, and Israel got their nuclear weapons.

       Never forget:
       <strong>
        The JFK assassination was staged.
       </strong>
       It was a
       <em>
        hoax.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       All conspiracy theories about him being actually killed are planted misdirection. And this release of files is also misdirection. JFK was never a black sheep, never had any intention of dissolving the CIA, challenging the FED or anything like that. It was all just a pose. At bottom, he was an actor playing a role in the demented script that TPTB wrote for the twisted lie we call the 20th century. He was very good at acting the part, but make no mistake: he
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       pretending.

       Yes, of course more mainstream websites are certainly more credible. LOL. Just because you haven't heard of them doesn't mean their content is invalid. It's just evidence of your ignorance. How about trying to actually deal with the piles and piles of evidence they deal with rather than dismiss them because you have your head up your ass?

       Actually, that's not true. He does cite a few sources, but there is no citation list. Instead he either gives you hyperlinks or the name of the source when he mentions it.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, it is true that there are very few sources. The reason is that he is making a highly original argument here based on reason, logic and lots and, most importantly, lots of photographic evidence. He doesn't need to cite the photographs, because he shows them to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason why he cites few sources: part of his argument is that "mainstream" conspiracy theories about JFK's assassination are purposeful or planted misdirection. So why would he cite sources that he thinks are purposefully misleading?
      </p>
      <p>
       But above all, it's clear that you didn't bother to actually read the paper or digest the evidence. You are dismissing it because you jumped to the end and didn't see any references. How incredibly
       <em>
        lazy

       I did jump to the end because I'm not going to waste my time reading nearly a hundred pages of conjecture. It's one thing to question the truth of the official narrative, it's another thing to cook up a theory without basing it on real world evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Photos do need to be cited. Firstly so the photographer can get their due credit, and secondly because without a source there's no way to compare the published photo to other versions of it. How then do we know the image hasn't been manipulated?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only citation I found was copy pasted from wikipedia, the others were hyperlinks. Overall, that's lazy and reflects poorly on a piece of writing that clearly took a long time to research and type up. We learn in grade school how important it is to cite our sources so others can reference the same source material as us. This helps reinfornce the validity of a point and can reveal issues with the data being presented.

       Wow, you're really, really good at lying. Remember: if you're really good at something, never do it for free. The paper is drowning in real world evidence, as I told you. That you don't wish to look at any of it says a lot more about you than it does about the evidence.
      </p>

       No, the photos do not need to be cited. They can all easily be found on-line and easily checked. You will see that none have been altered.

      <p>
       Again, why would you cite sources that are chalk full of lies and misdirection? There is no source he can cite because his argument (at the time) was very novel. But, hey, glad to see you're still thinking at the level of an elementary school student. Nothing like school to set our minds free. Don't ever give up: you might graduate 6th grade some day.

       you know something about history, but in fact all you know about is the kabuki theater our governors have passed off as history.

Let me guess, you probably think that JFK wanted to challenge the Fed with silver certificates and that Smedley Butler was some kind of hero, right?

       Look man he wasnt perfect. I didnt say he wasn't rich or that his family wasnt involved in crime. But he wanted to chop up the CIA, he wanted to get rid of fractional reserves. He was the most progressive president since FDR, and thats a fact. He tried to move us away from doing coups and forcing our economic system on ither countries. He paid the price for this... now if you want to pretend that he was a complete scumbag then you tell me who you think is better. Carter? Bush? Clinton? Obama? All a bunch of scumbags in comparison.

       And yes, they are all scumbags. Some of them are simply assigned to play the role of the "good guy." Just like FDR. If you think FDR was so progressive, you should read part 1 of my paper on Smedley Butler. It can be accessed through the link I gave you above,

       Oh, right, now the coin dropped: you believe the fairy tale that Presidents are the real decision makers who actually have power. Well sorry to be the one who has to tell you this, but they are just fronts for ultra-wealthy families who really run and control this world. Oh, and another thing, Santa Claus isn't real, either. I know the truth hurts, but there comes a time in everyone's life when they have to abandon the comfort of fairy tales and grow up. I think your time has come.

       Jesus christ are you presumtuous. No. Wrong again. They dont have power in the areas that really matter, but they can influence people very easily. Promoting those ideas is progressive. Deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       But what they do have is virtually unlimited military power at their disposal, and they choose to use it or not. Those that try their best not to use it even with all the internal pressures are progressive, fucking deal with it.

       But earlier you said that FDR was progressive. And then you admit he was a war monger. And then you said those who choose not to use the military power at their disposal are progressive. So that means FDR was not progressive. You are tying yourself up in logical knots of inconsistency due to your unwillingness to face facts. Oh well, you can keep living in your fantasy land of make believe fairy tales. Have a nice life. Good bye.

       If you read my research I linked to on FDR's fealty to Wall Street and the Banksters, you'd begin to have an inkling of just how wrong you are. You've swallowed their propaganda just as they intended. Amazing how it has eaten away at your brain.

       Great, I get it, rich democrats aren't ideal... I'm saying he rebuilt capitalism from the ground up, and helped people. Socialism was infused into the system... and it helped. Are you denying these facts?

       So would you literally disagree with the statement "The new-deal was good"?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also what would you suggest as a solution to fascism? What are you about man? Historical opinions aside, can we agree that a third party is not feasible under this system, and that both parties are dangerous as fuck? I just don't know where else you'd look for a solution, other than people like FDR and others like Henry Wallace.

       Yes, there are forms of fascism that make life easier for people and forms that make life harder. If forced to choose, prefer the form of fascism that includes most New Deal reforms. I would rather live under welfare capitalisms than under neo-liberal capitalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we differ fundamentally on our understanding of the role that politicians like FDR played in bringing about those reforms. I say he was acting on orders; you say he was his own man. On this issue and many others about how politics work, we fundamentally disagree. And so I don't see any reason to continue this back-and-forth. It's a waste of my time and yours.

       No I never said that... I think he happened to be the guy that did some good things. I personally dont much care for him as a person.
      </p>
      <p>
       And let me say this- I don't vote for neo-liberals because of the lesser of two evils bullshit. I dont believe that. But I know for a fact the new deal helped the middle class, and ended the dust bowl. So yes, I happen to respect FDR's presidency. I don't respect Truman or mostly any of the others. But yes JFK.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if someone is currupt and is a liar, to even come out and say that there is a shadow government, that's a highly respectable thing for a president. Would he have gotten the things he said he wanted? Probably not. But he provided people with critically important information.

       And another thing- those that try to minimize the number of false flags- they are progressive on that.

       Maybe simply doing damage control isn't good enough in the long run, but its a hell of alot more progressive than what we're looking at now... wouldn't you agree?

       I remember listening to the scanner the day of the Boston Bombings. There was a call for some sort of small explosion and subsequent fire at the JFK Library.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since then I’ve always wondered what files, or information on the assassination may have been stowed away there. Personally, I think anything relevant to the truth of the JFK assassination is long since gone. George HW Bush “reviewed” the files within his first few days in office, as well as the aforementioned JFK Library shenanigans, I just think
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       resembling the truth has been redacted, lost, or burnt,
      </p>
      <p>
       That said; One thing is for sure (at least to me), ever since it was announced that these files would be released, there has been an absolute
       <strong>
        shitstorm
       </strong>
       of shilling here, on 4chan, and on Voat. Usually when the shills show up en masse, it’s for a reason. And most of these newcomers are not your regular run of the mill shill. These fuckers are smart, well spoken, and real good about dodging rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look, I realize there is a
       <em>
        lot
       </em>
       of shit going down right now, so the shills are not just for the JFK file release, but I also firmly believe the deep state is shitting bricks like never before. The file release, Uranium One, Hollywood pedos, Vegas narrative BTFO, Poppy Bush being accused ... it certainly feels like an orchestrated attack on the deep state. At least I’m hoping and praying that is the case anyway.

       Either that, or we are all being played like a fucking fiddle....

       They have lost the volume containing the info on Oswald. This is a farce. They have lost what was probably the most vital part of the documentation.

      <p>
       The remaining volumes will be redacted to oblivion so that nobody alive will be implicated.

       Even worse, they could potentially fabricate evidence that a foreign government was involved like Russia,  feeding into the current Russiaphobia climate that the CIA are currently pushing.

       At this point, I’m convinced that there’s an inter-agency vault somewhere that’s highly guarded, where things go to be “lost”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either that or a giant incinerator.
      </p>
      <p>
       What did it for me was the interview with the guy from NASA being interviewed about going to mars. The interviewer says something to the effect of “why not go back to the moon and establish a refueling base?”
      </p>
      <p>
       “We had that technology [to get to the moon] in the
       <em>
        1960s
       </em>
       , but we, uh, destroyed that technology, and rebuilding it would be a painful process.”
      </p>
      <p>
       K.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then NASA
       <em>
        records over
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        loses
       </em>
       Apollo tapes and data?
      </p>

       K.

       The government really does think Americans are completely brainless. In many cases, they’re right unfortunately.

       To be fair, the only way that technology would work now is if the parts were manufactured in the exact same way they were then, which they aren't. You can view the source code on stackoverflow I believe (it's available somewhere, can't remember if that's the correct place though).

       I see what you’re saying, but there are a lot of things about the Apollo missions that stink. You can see wires in certain clips, there’s footage of Aldrin and crew using clever camera trickery with a round window in low-earth-orbit to achieve a disingenuous shot of the earth from “120,000 miles out”. It’s pretty damning footage. I’ll track it down for you if you haven’t seen it. It was included in Bart Sibrel’s “Something Funny Happened On the Way to the Moon” documentary.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can’t stand the guy personally, but the footage stands.

       You’re right that there’s no reason to lie about space. However, if we were unable to fulfill JFK’s promise to land a man on the moon before the end of the decade and return him safely to earth, there is very good reason to lie about that. I can see both sides of the argument when it comes to the Apollo debate.

       The decisions of the 1960's Russian regime to congratulate the USA for the accomplishment of Apollo has nothing to do with
       <em>
        confirming
       </em>
       space travel beyond the Van Allen belts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sentiment at the time, IF Russia had complained, it would be seen all around the world as "sour grapes", "poor losers".
      </p>
      <p>
       A quick check of human space altitude records will show that the Russians, in 1965, achieved ~500km (300 miles) altitude and for the past 52 years have stayed
       <strong>
        well below
       </strong>
       the VAB.
      </p>
      <p>
       The space altitude record speaks louder than words, for if, travel beyond the VAB was possible,  the Russians would have sent a
       <em>
        female
       </em>
       cosmonaut to the moon so that Russia could enjoy the world wide prestige.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Russia has stayed below the VAB for so long is prima facie evidence that can not be disputed - and it speaks VOLUMES about their attitude toward human space travel.

       Yeah nah, the USSR wouldn't avoid the biggest propaganda victory of the century just to avoid being called Butthurt. If it was fake they would have proved it with their own Astronomists, Physicists and Cosmonauts who'd provide the scientific explanation as to why it would have been impossible. Even if the western world didn't believe them, sowing the distrust and suspicion would have been good enough.

       You:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The fact that the Soviet union never denied it pretty much confirms it happened
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Me:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The fact that Russia has stayed below the VAB for so long is prima facie evidence that can not be disputed
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       We may agree to disagree on this. But I guess this is a JFK thread and not the appropriate venue to go into depth on Russia's motives.

       He had Atkinson's disease that's why his skin is darker. It will come out in the files that's why CIA killed him. He had psychotic episodes and freaked out while dealing with Gorbachev and ruined a deal because he started acting crazy. Also didn't send in air support to Cuba (to push the Cubans to war for our provocation) [Cuban Missle Crisis] Along with the disbanding CIA, ending/auditing the FED. This will be the revelation to appease people and leave it at that by saying oh well I know the government did it. But will not implicate anyone.

       Look we all know what's going to happen. They will spin a story to where it was incompetence and not conspiracy. They will admit the government covered up evidence but they will give a boring false reason for this: to hide that they already had early knowledge of the attack. It's their default line. I 100% guarantee this is how it will go down. It's boring but still sinister enough to satisfy the average Joe.

        NARA is trusted with preserving our archival holdings permanently and holds that all records in our legal custody will eventually be available for research. That said, there are categories of records in the collection that, in accordance with the Act, will not be released in 2017. Sections 10 and 11 of the act discuss grand jury information and records held under section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code (tax return information) as well as records covered by a specific deed of gift. We have identified a small number of records, or portions of records, that fit into these categories. For all other records, how long records stay withheld after 2017 will be determined by the President, who has final appeal authority.

       Things to look for today:
      </p>
      <p>
       At the CAPA Press Conference at the National Press Club in March former ARRB chairman Judge John Tunheim    discussed these possible items as not being turned over to the ARRB or possibly hidden for this release:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Oswald CIA Office of Security File Volume 5, last seen by the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA), which recently garnered some publicity.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Files of the first chief council to HSCA Richard Sprague, who took  his files home with him when he was fired for conducting a real investigation. The Assassinations Records Review Board (ARRB),  responsible for identifying and obtaining records, missed them because they confused the attorney Richard Sprague with the computer programmer of the same name whose extensive files on the    assassination are part of the JFK Collection. Sprague's HSCA files, paid for by taxpayers that rightfully belong at the Archives, are currently in Sprague's Philadelphia law office.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Soviet   KGB records of Oswald's time in Moscow and Minsk that were obtained by Norman Mailer are now in the possession of Mailer's former associate Lawrence Schiller, who refused to turn them over to the ARRB.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Unedited AF1 Radio Transmission tapes from   November 22, 1963. Two different edited versions of these tapes are available, one on cassette tapes released by the LBJ Library and a  reel to reel version discovered among the personnel effects of  General Clifton. The White House Communications Agency (WHCA) is responsible for these tapes.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Church Committee interviews with Gerry Patrick Hemming, Orest Pena, Immigration and Naturalization Service and Customs officials, and other Church Committee testimony are missing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         U.S. Customs records on Cubans requested by the HSCA were so voluminous they couldn't begiven to the HSCA, but now consist of only a few records at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The audio tape recording of Gaeton Fonzi's interview with Mitch Werbell was erased and the transcript is missing, only Fonzi's notes remain.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         John Newman says that Eisenhower era reports on assassinations of foreign leaders that he copied years ago are   now missing from the NARA, and he believes such records are being deliberately stolen.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Bill Simpich notes that CIA Mexico City Station (MCS) cable to Headquarters from September 26-30, 1963   are missing as well as cables from CIA HQ to MCS, JMWAVE to HQ and HQ to JMWAVE cable traffic on the same dates, and all cable traffic between MCS and JMWAVE between September 26 and October 20 and   November 22 to December 30, 1963 are missing.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The CIA's study of the July 20, 1944 attempt to kill Hitler to be   adapted for use against Castro, as mentioned by Desmond FitzGerald  in his September 23, 1963 briefing of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is the subject of a FOIA lawsuit by the Assassination Archives and Research Center (AARC).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Office of Naval Intelligence - ONI Defector File, as identified as an assassination record by   Navy Lt. Com. T. Pike, but never turned over to the Archives.
        </p>

       Excellent comment. It's important to note though that there were many imposters pretending to be Oswald before the assassination for sheep-dipping purposes. Not all documents on where Oswald was should be believed immediately.

       <em>
        On the Trail of the Assassins
       </em>
       he details how Oswald was reportedly (according to the Warren commission and backed up by flight documents) in Russia while at the same time his name was being used at the Cuban embassy in Mexico as well as different places in New Orleans showing that someone was trying to make it look like a "Lee Oswald" (sometimes Leon Oswald) was someplace he wasn't at the time.

       I just wanted to commend you for organizing all of these Points of Interest. It's crazy to think that it's been over fifty years and there are still people keeping up the good fight for truth. That is how you honor the memory of someone like JFK, a relentless drive for truth. I just want everyone in this thread to take a single moment to appreciate themselves for what they're doing here. A lot of researchers that have passed with time are being honored with posts like this across the internet today; it's pretty phenomenal to see this all playing out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what I'm trying to say is that when they killed JFK, they killed themselves! From that giant rose the common "conspiracy theorist" as the CIA would later seem them. These truthseekers carried the torch and illuminated the lies that dark elements sought to conceal. These individuals that used everything in their power to cover up their crimes thought that with time the story and the "theorists" would die out. Yet, here we are!! A testament to their miscalculations, to their misdeeds. The American spirit and the human drive for TRUTH has been strong enough to withstand a half century of coverups and silence; of dissent and division. Even if the files are faked, or the important bits are left out; the fact that we have all assembled here today is a beautiful thing. (And another nail in the coffin of those who would choose to see us fighting each other instead of fighting tyranny.)
      </p>
      <p>
       So thanks everybody, it's good to see you out here today!

       The man himself said it best:
      </p>
      <p>
       "We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution. Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.
      </p>
      <p>
       This much we pledge--and more."

       Amazing how so many documents and physical evidence surrounding the most defining event of our modern age has been so "mishandled"  if not blatantly covered up.  Anyone not familiar with the controversy only needs to look at this list, whether they understand it or not, and would come to realize that something fucky is going on.

       In the video of the shooting, why was Jackie's first reaction to reach back over the trunk and grab, what is assumed to be, brain matter or skull fragments? I always thought that was a weird action.

       Probably shock. One time I saw a video of a girl who got half her face cut off. She was in shock and was just grabbing at the flap or her face that was just hanging off, not comprehending what was happening.

       She was trying to grab the chunks of his brain, I took a conspiracy theory class in college and we had a guest speaker come in to talk about the JFK assassination. He was the guy in the film who jumps on the back of the car and pulls her back in. He said she was just grabbing at the chunks of brain screaming

       I think people are afraid to say "she was trying to escape." While this particular instance has no effect on what actually happened, it is totally plausible that she was just trying to get out of the line of fire. The woman just saw her husband get his head blown off and wanted to get out of there. When you see her reach for the agent it looks like he is telling her to remain calm and sit back down while they speed out of there. I think she later collects the pieces because it is proven that she did have some of it cuffed in her hands.

       <strong>
        Judyth Vary Baker, Oswald, Cancer-causing bioweapons, and the assassination of JFK:
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The story of
       <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKbakerJ.htm">
        Judyth Vary Baker
       </a>
       is about as extraordinary as they come. It starts with a book by
       <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/JFKhaslamE.htm">
        Edward Haslam
       </a>
       called
       <em>
        Dr. Mary's Monkey: How the Unsolved Murder of a Doctor, a Secret Laboratory in New Orleans and Cancer-Causing Monkey Viruses are Linked to Lee Harvey Oswald, the JFK Assassination and Emerging Global Epidemics.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Haslam tells a riveting detective-like tale that spans numerous decades, resulting in the publishing of his first book on the subject,
       <em>
        Mary, Ferrie and the Monkey Virus
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       After Judyth went public in 1999, Haslam rewrote the book (as he finally had the witness for his theories that he had been lacking) and released it as
       <em>
        Dr. Mary's Monkey
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Haslam focuses on the macabre and unsolved murder of prominent orthopedic surgeon and cancer researcher
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_S._Sherman">
        Dr. Mary Stults Sherman
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Sherman's body was discovered in 1964 in her apartment in New Orleans. However, the precise nature of her death wasn't released to the public for over 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was prematurely concluded that the killing was the work of a "sex-crazed lesbian" who conveniently was never found. Not surprisingly, it was never released to the public that Dr. Sherman's entire arm and right side were missing, exposing her insides.
      </p>
      <p>
       A superficial mattress fire in the apartment was blamed for her severe injuries, even though temperatures of thousands of degrees would be necessary to locally disintegrate flesh and bone while leaving the rest of her body intact.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, Dr. Sherman's heart and liver were stabbed, and the heart wound was inflicted while she was still alive. Curiously, her death occurred on the same morning that the Warren Commission first began taking witness testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Haslam argues that Dr. Sherman was engaged in a top secret project, ostensibly run by the well-known researcher and surgeon
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alton_Ochsner">
        Alton Ochsner
       </a>
       , and included the young Judyth Baker, David Ferrie, and Lee Harvey Oswald.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Ochsner, who was fiercely anti-Communist, had ties to the CIA, FBI, and even the Mafia, and was part of the very real effort at the time to remove Castro from power, by any means necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's well known that elements of the CIA and Mafia were actively engaged in trying to kill Castro. Their main concern was that a violent death could ultimately be traced to US intelligent agencies, potentially resulting in World War III.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually, a more stealthy approach was attempted: perfect a cancer-causing bio-weapon to take out Castro. Although cancer-causing viruses had been discovered a decade earlier, the idea of "inducing" cancer in an individual was still considered by most to be in the realm of science fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Sherman was actively involved with this project, as well as the one of the most enigmatic figures in JFK assassination lore,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ferrie">
        David Ferrie
       </a>
       . Ferrie is perhaps most known today as being the first suspect of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Garrison">
        Jim Garrison's
       </a>
       infamous investigation into Kennedy's death.
      </p>
      <p>
       Amazingly, Garrison revealed in an interview with Playboy that he suspected David Ferrie and Dr. Sherman were somehow involved in a secret cancer project, however that little tidbit has largely been forgotten, and it seems even Garrison himself never realized the implications of this connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to being a defrocked priest and a pilot for the CIA and Carlos Marcello (the Mafia king of New Orleans), Ferrie just happened to be involved with Dr. Mary Sherman, one of the most prestigious female scientists in the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ferrie had allegedly developed an interest in cancer research. He filled his apartment with white mice--at one point he had almost 2000, and neighbors complained--and he wrote a medical treatise on the subject and worked with a number of New Orleans doctors on different means of inducing cancer in mice.
      </p>
      <p>
       He also lost all of his hair, and in light of his curious hobbies, this may have been the result of his dabbling with toxic chemicals. He was found dead only days after Garrison first accused him of being connected to the JFK assassination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually the bio-weapon was more or less perfected, and it was subsequently successfully tested on (at least) one inmate at a nearby facility. The subject died in 28 days. However, it seems that their efforts were too little and too late, for the coalescence of interests that wanted to remove Castro from power had completely changed their directive and focused their sights on Kennedy instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Baker, David Ferrie and Dr. Sherman were under the impression that they needed to hurry and created the weapon
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       their superiors got impatient and killed Kennedy instead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lee Harvey Oswald was supposedly involved with this project, but more in the capacity of running errands and doing some of the dirty work, as he killed and dissected the cancerous tumors on the experimental mice on several occasions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baker, although very young, had already established herself in the field of cancer research. While still in high school, she had induced cancer in mice faster than any public research being done at the time (one week). She attracted the attention of numerous prominent people, including Dr. Oschner, and she soon found herself being trained at the prestigious Roswell Park Memorial Institute in 1961.
      </p>
      <p>
       Baker and Oswald were hired on the same day at Standard Coffee, and then one week later they both were moved to Reilly. Their jobs at Reilly Coffee were covers for their actual activities. Baker, as the secretary, was responsible for clocking Oswald out to cover up his extended absences, and she still has numerous time cards for Lee with her initial "J" on the front.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anna Lewis, who was married to David Lewis, another well-known figure in JFK assassination lore, is perhaps the last living person who has gone on record saying she saw Judyth and Lee together and that they were lovers. Here is a video of
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyN37x3OfHs">
        Anna Lewis
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       As for when things went wrong, Baker claims that a letter she passionately wrote to Dr. Ochsner doomed her future career in the medical world.
      </p>
      <p>
       She had been extremely upset when she discovered that the "volunteer" the weapon was tested on wasn't a terminally ill inmate as she had been told, but a perfectly healthy young man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately for Baker, the letter she wrote to Ochsner ended up in the hands of his secretary, violating the secrecy of the "Project". This infuriated Ochsner and he abruptly terminated his relationship with her.
      </p>
      <p>
       After the project unraveled, Oswald (an intelligence asset) began to suspect he was being set up as a patsy for Kennedy's death, but that he believed himself to be part of a team that was going to try and "prevent" the assassination in Dallas.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Baker, Oswald stated that his presence in Dallas meant that one less bullet would be fired at Kennedy. She also claims to have met Jack Ruby, who was introduced to her as "Sparky Rubinstein" and she was unaware until decades later that Sparky was the one who killed Oswald.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ruby and Oswald had apparently been friends for years. Oswald's mother had dated numerous Mafia men, including Carlos Marcello's personal driver, so Oswald had ties to the Mafia from a young age. She was also adamant that her son was a government agent and was framed for Kennedy's death.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's even been alleged that Ruby himself called the police station where Oswald would be killed and warned them that an attempt would be made on his life.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ruby's fate, however, was anything but merciful, as he died of cancer shortly after his incarceration. To make matters even more bizarre, Ruby actually claimed to have been injected with cancer while in prison!
      </p>
      <p>
       This was during a time when such a notion was considered ludicrous by the general population, but it fits rather ominously into the narrative of Haslam and Baker.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's possible that Ruby knew of Dr. Sherman's project, and he may have been aware of exactly
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       they induced the cancer: the subject would be submitted to high doses of radiation with an X-ray machine to compromise the immune system, followed by a series of painful shots.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ruby received this X-ray treatment in jail and then was given several shots from a mysterious doctor. When Ruby's cancer was examined after his death, it was observed to be an extremely aggressive form of lung cancer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Sherman herself likely fell victim to this conspiracy, as Haslam suggests that the secret linear particle accelerator in New Orleans that they were using to irradiate cancer cells was responsible for her extreme injuries. Something clearly went wrong while operating the machine, and she was hastily stabbed, while still alive, and her body moved to her apartment in a sloppy attempt to create a "murder" scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       For more information on Judyth Baker and her story, she is featured in part 8 of the excellent series
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Men_Who_Killed_Kennedy">

       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       60 Minutes was once set to release a special on Baker, but an order was given to immediately stop production on the segment and it was never completed.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Haslam, the frustrated 60 Minutes team told him that they had spent more time and money on the story than any in the history of the program.

       This explanation does not make sense. Maybe they removed the evidence of induced cancer she might have had by removing half of her body.

       I spent a long time researching this. I'm probably older than most redditors and my thinking was this: "I have lived through many different presidents, congresses, and senates and yet we seem to keep marching in the same direction no matter who is in power. So why is this?" So I started thinking back through each president. I thought Jimmy Carter was a little strange, but as I thought back, I realized that Kennedy was the strangest of all. So I decided to look into it. What I realized is that I had no idea what was actually going on and there are facts that we simply can not ignore about the situation. I believe that most people could understand what actually happened and how it has shaped our world today with about 10 hours of reading. The hard part is communicating what happened in a credible manner since there are so many details, but here is my best shot at it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Forgive me if I get a few details wrong, but this should be pretty accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Essentially JFK and his administration began pursuing peace through diplomacy rather than through overt force and using covert operations to stage coup's.
      </p>
      <p>
       To really understand this, you have to go back to the Dulles brothers, John Foster and Allen. They were partners at the big lawfirm, Sullivan and Cromwell. Through their positions in this law firm, they came into contact with very powerful people and represented very powerful companies. Sometimes, they found that their use of international law was not enough to meet the demands of their customers and "friends".
      </p>
      <p>
       Around 1951, Iran nationalized the oil industry there (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Persian_Oil_Company">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Persian_Oil_Company
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ) and many large firms lost access to that natural resource which made them loads of money. So, in order to regain control of those resources, an operation coming from within the CIA (Dulles was not yet director, but had been involved in the CIA for a long time recruiting German officers and others during WW2) was launched and named Operation Ajax. Kermit Roosevelt was sent into the country and provided money and other resources to people there who wished to overthrow Mossadegh (current leader). Once the situation became unstable enough, the US helped to install the Shah of Iran as their vassal dictator. This scenario has been carried out numerous times (well over 30, but the list in wikipedia that used to exist has been scrubbed) and should seem familiar to you as it is basically what happened in Ukraine by funneling resources through NGOs.
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the beginning of the CIA covert regime change operations to seize control of strategic countries to exploit for reasons of power and resources. So let's fast forward to Cuba and the Bay of Pigs. Dulles was in charge of the CIA by this point and they, along with the Joint Chiefs, were determined to take control of Cuba and not back down from Russia because there was this perception that there was a great "communist threat". Whether they actually believed that communism was an existential threat to everyone or used it as a convenient excuse to do what they wanted to (similar to the "war on terrorism" now) is up for debate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, in 1961, a group of rebels, trained and supplied by the US (hi ISIS) were to go into Cuba and overthrow Castro, bringing control of the island state to the US. Apparently there were notes in Dulles' archives saying essentially that once they were on the beach, this would force Kennedy to use the might of the military, especially planes, to support the rebels in Cuba. Kennedy, in fact, did not do this when he found out what was going on (the CIA did not inform him this was going to happen) and left Dulles' operation to fail and bring about his humiliation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another little known fact, is that we also sponsored a coup in France just a few days later which also failed, but the evidence linking it to the CIA was not as strong.
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algiers_putsch_of_1961">

       </a>
       Kennedy, who spoke with de Gaulle during this, was to have offered his military support to help him but "could not account for his own CIA" or something very similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we had the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, which was resolved by John and Bobby Kennedy using diplomatic channels and agreeing to disarm missiles in Europe if Khrushchev withdrew his missiles from Cuba. This opened up a dialog between the Kennedy administration and Russia where they began working toward peaceful solutions to their differences. You can hear this in his "Peace" speech at American University shortly before his death.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people who follow the conspiracy believe it was his "secret society" speech that got him killed. In fact, it was his pursuit of peace through diplomacy in the face of a policy of imperialism and direct conflict.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all heard the quote from JFK about shattering the CIA. He actually had begun this process by aiming at a 20% reduction by 1966.
       <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=KS-6XrdalGkC&amp;amp;pg=PA16&amp;amp;lpg=PA16&amp;amp;dq=JFK+CIA+staff+reduction&amp;amp;source=bl&amp;amp;ots=1iU6fXuREA&amp;amp;sig=94Y1SBSPaDI3-d6rJJcxgVpPLig&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcvc--7LTOAhWDKGMKHYsaCF4Q6AEIUzAH#v=onepage&amp;amp;q=JFK%20CIA%20staff%20reduction&amp;amp;f=false">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So he had already managed to destroy the career of one of the most powerful people in the world (Dulles), was getting rid of the jobs of many CIA staff who had no qualms with violence and covert operations, and was in the process of de-escalating conflicts throughout the world, thus threatening the careers and livelihoods of many people within the military industrial complex.

       Ray McGovern, former CIA analyst had this to say:
       <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/02/07/intelligent_people_know_that_the_empire_is_on_the_downhill_a_veteran_cia_agent_spills_the_goods_on_the_deep_state_and_our_foreign_policy_nightmares/">

       </a>
      </p>
      <pre><code>Well, John Kennedy had problems of the same kind, and he fired Dulles. And that was a no-no. You don’t fire people like Dulles. Kennedy embarked on a new course. He talked with Khrushchev, he had people, interlocutors, who talked with Castro, and, worst of all, he issued two executive orders, saying that 1,000 U.S troops would be pulled out of Vietnam by the end of 1963 and the bulk of the rest by 1965. He was going to give up Southeast Asia to the Commies, and God knows what would happen next with the dominoes falling and Indonesia, and my God… So he was killed by the “deep state.”
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Ray McGovern has also said that James Douglass' book "JFK and the Unspeakable" basically got it right.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://consortiumnews.com/2013/12/22/trumans-true-warning-on-the-cia/">
        https://consortiumnews.com/2013/12/22/trumans-true-warning-on-the-cia/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        And so, the question: Did Allen Dulles and other “cloak-and-dagger” CIA operatives have a hand in John Kennedy’s assassination and in then covering it up? In my view, the best dissection of the evidence pertaining to the murder appeared in James Douglass’s 2008 book, JFK and the Unspeakable. After updating and arraying the abundant evidence, and conducting still more interviews, Douglass concludes that the answer is Yes.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So that's the story, sorry it is long, but there is so much to understand and if you read the books I listed above, then you will have a much better picture of our past and present.

       It should be noted that in addition to working with Khrushchev, it's rumored that Kennedy and the Soviet leader were discussing embarking on a
       <em>
        joint
       </em>
       moon mission...something that flew directly in the face of the extremely lucrative "Cold War" narrative.

       *Joe Rogan had Peter Schiff on the podcast a few weeks ago. Schiff isn't afraid to criticize everybody from the fed to Bush, Obama, Clinton and Trump, etc etc, and it all sounds pretty objective and based on real world experience. He's one of the guys who predicted the 2008 crash. He does a good job of explaining how people who follow guys like Bernie probably have good intentions but just don't really get how his plans would effect America.  I'm not even close to an economist and I don't agree with him on everything, I do wish health care and education were funded as well as war is in this country and I don't understand why that is so impossible, but a lot of what he says hits the common sense portion of my brain pretty good.

       I think of this type of thing as "levels of abstraction".
      </p>
      <p>
       The first level of abstraction is money helps, so give people money and it will help people!  This is where, unfortunately, most people stop thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second level of abstraction is money helps, but it disincentivizes people from being able to provide for themselves and making good decisions based on the resources available to them.  This, unfortunately, is where many people stop thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       A third level of abstraction to this could be that giving people money helps, but it incentivizes bad decisions and allows the proliferation of people who make bad decisions or are incapable of coping with the world as it exists creating a government sponsored dysgenics program where the most fit among us are taken from in order for the least fit to procreate.
      </p>
      <p>
       An even further level of abstraction would be to question whether it is more cruel to deny those who make bad decisions the resources that governments collect through force or to allow their destiny to serve as an example to others, thus serving as a lesson and preventing others from suffering the same fate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can go on and on.  There are no "easy" answers to these things.

       Bernie is marginally less corrupt than HRC. You’re living in a fantasy. Maybe those opioids are making you believe something special about that wretched man.

       Bernie was 100% in it as a spoiler to keep real moderate democratic candidates at bay. The sad truth is that there are some governors that actually believe that their party isn’t just a machine and could present a real challenge to a woman who has more strokes than Woodrow Wilson.

       Well done. I made a timeline from 1947 when the CIA was created by president Truman until 1968 when his brother Robert was assassinated:

       Great comment. Not sure if you read the Dulles Biography yet: the devil's chessboard. But it covers a lot of what you mentioned here. One of the most insightful and eye-opening books I've read.

       I feel like a lot of the current small "conspiracies" (including some relating to Trump/Clinton) can really be traced back to the military-industrial complex. It's practically hiding in plain sight--we've been in Afghanistan for how long now? And stocks of Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed, etc keep going up and up. Not to mention the existence of private mercenary contractors.

       Sure.  Look at the last several presidencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Start with Reagan and you find GHW Bush who "Couldn't recall" anything about Iran Contra.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have the dickhead in chief himself, GHW Bush for 4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have Bill Clinton, who helped GHW Bush run drugs through Mena, Arkansas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have GW Bush who said "Don't believe those stupid conspiracies!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have Obama, who certainly appears to have strong CIA ties, some of which can be seen in his trips to Pakistan and employment at (no joke, this is the real name) Business International Corporation.

       Allen Dulles and Prescott Bush (who was named as a conspirator in The Business Plot, which was a plan to stage a coup in the US) were friends.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has come out that Prescott Bush's son, GHW Bush was a CIA agent well before he was named director in 1970 despite his claims that he was not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Clinton conspired with the Bushes via the CIA to run drugs through Mena, Arkansas when he was governor during Iran Contra.

      <p>
       GW Bush, obviously, is GHW Bush's son.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an article about Obama working at Business International Corporation.

       It certainly appears he was groomed by the CIA.

       Why start with Reagan (ie. Bush)?
      </p>
      <p>
       It started with Dulles already, full scale. The most prominent CIA/deep state illegalities came under him. From Iran, Indonesia, Central- and South America up to JFK.
Roosevelt was apparently a problem, hence the business plot, but the late Roosevelt in exile was not a problem anymore. And subsequently they had full control over everything.

       You can't look at Afghanistan without looking at opium and the Heroin trade. Opium production is at an all time high under the NATO occupation at the same time the US is having a heroin addiction crisis. It's not a coincidence and the CIA is deeply involved.

       Add any country with the coca plant like Cuba, or Venezuela. This was the starting era where crack/cocaine dramatically rose in popularity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is also the era {late 1970's} where the War on Drugs became public enemy #1. While crack/cocaine was panning out, heroin was making it's debut throughout the party scene, everywhere {1980's to now}. Its strongest appearance was in the 1990's and has grown in strength due to genetically produced opium that's being laced with heroin.

       Well, what demographics are most likely to abuse drugs? The poor, the disabled, the gay people, and ESPECIALLY the non-white people - who are then incarcerated at inequal rates for drug use, and forced into slavery in the cradle-to-prison pipeline. It especially fits in if you look at the Russian theory about the assassination being an attempted coup by the "ultraright" - these are groups that a far-right society doesn't want. And to tie it back into the military industrial complex, it's worth mentioning that many of those groups can't or couldn't serve in a military until recently.

       I think the problem will receive in intensity on it's own like all drug fads do. But heroin or some form of injectable opiod will always be available on the street. I think they will use this as an excuse to further link medical records together. It's also a good way to reenergize the war on drugs which has been losing popularity  for a decade. Most of that is just coincidence to the goal which was untraceable money to fund black CIA operations around the globe.

       I, unfortunately, agree with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may be hard for you to believe, but there are certain forces in the world that may kill people to make it seem like the leader of a country is harming his own people in order to have an excuse to depose that leader and take over the country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, it boils down to this:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Identify a country you would like to take over.
       </li>
       <li>
        Destabilize that country via support of activism (like Ukraine) or direct violence (anti-castro cubans, Contras, al qaeda, isis).
       </li>
       <li>
        Point to the unrest that you have directly caused and claim that you need to send your forces in to "stabilize the situation".
       </li>
       <li>
        Lie to the public to find a "humanitarian" reason that you are going to war so they will support you. (Gulf of Tonkin, Nayirah Testimony, WMDs etc...)
       </li>
       <li>
        Invade and install the vassal dictator of your choice.
       </li>
       <li>
        Have said vassal dictator give you and your friends the contracts to extract natural resources.
       </li>
       <li>
        Make the country you invaded pay for the infrastructure needed to take the resources from them via loans from the IMF/World Bank by claiming it will be economically beneficial.  (Confessions of an Economic Hitman)
       </li>
       <li>
        Now you control the countries resources and the people of the country are debt slaves to loans they can never pay back and never agreed to.
       </li>
       <li>
        Repeat
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       The "War on Terror" was a master-stroke.  Who are "terrorists"?  Anyone who we say they are.

       If people think that anything will actually be found in this file, they are fooling themselves. The point of covert actions is to keep them secret. They aren't going to release Allen Dulles' dayplanner and on November 22, 1963 it says "Assassinate the president."

       To add to the Executive Orders, look for the EO's on the subject of cooperation in space with other countries, i.e., Russia. The hard core anti-commies were very perturbed that JFK would share space research/ideas/plans/technology with any commies.

       You mentioned "we seem to keep marching in the same direction no matter who is in power." In your opinion, would you say this trend began around the Kennedy era? Or was Kennedy simply an outlier?

       I think that this whole thing kind of started around WW1, but the complete corruption was not there yet.  I take the sinking of the Lusitania as a pivotal event in history that is often glossed over and not examined closely and honestly in the textbooks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say that this trend began before Kennedy, probably centering around the Dulles brothers.  Allen Dulles is famous for having said that "Democracy should be left to the intelligent people."
      </p>
      <p>
       So if I take that into account, then you have to go back to Truman, who founded the CIA (and subsequently regretted it) based on the usefulness of the OSS during WW2.

       So, in summary, this trend began the ramp up of those in power who control the direction of the country before Kennedy.  Kennedy was simply the complete takeover via a coup.  There is literally no distinction (except for it being domestic) between what happened to JFK and all of the other leaders this group of people, most often involving the CIA, have staged coups against across the world.

       Oh I see. I was reading your first statement wrong. :)

       I don't really have an answer, but to me it seems like there are many levels to all the games being played. Many areas of influence that are way beyond the "common man".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like being in the stands during a football game. You know who you want to win, and you can even shout out suggestions about what plays they can do. But unless you're on the team there isn't much more you can do than watch and jeer or cheer.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I think a virtuous person can do is to make sure that their own choices and actions are based on rational, just, and moral principles. The masses are like cattle being told to swerve this way and that by a rancher. But if the cattle simply refuse to move in one direction, there's not much a lone rancher can do. And it's the "herd instinct" - action without thought - that actually makes them controllable at all.

       This is also supported by the so-called Iron Mountain Report, allegedly commissioned by Kennedy to explore the possibility of moving to a peacetime government for good.
      </p>
      <p>
       To summarize, the panel went way beyond its mission and did a thorough examination of why governments are so bloodthirsty and how they came to be this way, ultimately coming to the conclusion that governments and war are inextricably linked so that to stop making war would begin to render government unnecessary.

       *They keep telling us we are the best, most advanced military the world has ever seen and I believe it. But I don't see our military making much of the progress overseas that has been promised. So maybe being best isn't enough. Especially in this new era of mass communication, it's harder to maintain the narrative the U.S. is the hero. The War on Terror has already spilled out of the Middle Easy and into Europe. Been there for decades now in reality. Obviously we in the U.S. are looking at some grave concerns in this regard as well.  So if Big Government is inextricably linked to War and we aren't winning overseas any more and the war has been coming to our shores in one way or another since 2001, kinda seems like if we want to reduce war, we need to reduce big government.

       Here is a post I made previously about how this will all play out:
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most people who post here would agree that we have a government whose goals is to use the populace as a cash crop and exploit them for their own personal gains. We have domestic spying, a federal reserve system of monetary slavery, and increasingly tyrannical behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that in mind, I propose that this will all end one way... with massive amounts of violence. This is the way it has always been and always will be as long as there are individuals willing to use violence to get their way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take for instance, this idea: Two men, Bill and Tom, have a disagreement about who owns a pencil. Bill says it is his. Tom says it is his. Tom is not willing to kill Bill over his claim to the pencil. Bill, on the other hand, is willing to kill Tom over his claim to the pencil.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Bill is willing to kill and Tom is not, then simple logic dictates that since Tom is not willing to reciprocate the level of aggression that Bill is, then Tom will cede ownership to Bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is how government treats its citizens in all instances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try not paying your taxes because you are against making military contractors rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you claim that you are the sole owner of the fruits of your labor, then you will be killed if you resist. The same goes for every injustice that those in power force on the citizenry.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are seeing this play out right now. Democracy is being subverted and those in power are more than happy to let people stomp their feet and protest because it will not actually change anything. They know that they have the force of violence on their side that the populace has been told on a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why should the government have a monopoly on violence?
      </p>
      <p>
       No amount of hand-waving, feet stomping, and protesting will change anything. Only when enough people get angry enough to take direct action against those who use violence to control them will we ever see anything change.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are willing to kill you to get their way. What are you willing to do?
      </p>
      <p>
       [disclaimer] I'm not a violent guy and am only giving my opinion on how this will play out based on what has happened over and over again throughout history.

       This is partially right. You fail to link his speech on secret societies and the CIA. No one defines communism either... rather people just presume communism is Russian. It isn't. Communism was started by the Bolsheviks who were actually primarily Khazarians who converted to Judaism back in the 1400s - see Arthur Koesteler's The Thirtenth tribe. They hated Russia and their strategy is simple - take the identities of the host country and move into positions of power in the host country, take control of the media to control the narrative, and  extract all of the coutnries resources through central banking and lending at high interest rates to waring governments. That's why Kennedy's dad hated the Jews. That's also why Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110. Without the silver or gold standard there is no such thing as freedom. Howard Buffett talked about this as well. 
Here is his article on Gold as redeemable Money
       <a href="https://freedom-school.com/money/human-freedom-rests-on-gold-redeemable-money.pdf">
        https://freedom-school.com/money/human-freedom-rests-on-gold-redeemable-money.pdf
       </a>
       Alan Greenspan also wrote about this here in his famous article Gold and Economic Freedom
       <a href="http://www.constitution.org/mon/greenspan_gold.htm">
        http://www.constitution.org/mon/greenspan_gold.htm
       </a>
      </p>

       Really 90% of Communism comes down to implementing a Central bank -something the US has today- in order to control the money supply and thus giving the government a platform to endlessly go into debt. By doing so, it forces the Central bank to continuously print money, stealing the productive capacity of the host nation. In other words, it steals from you bank account by diluting the value of your dollars by putting more into circulation.  Kennedy knew this and wanted to put a stop to it. He also knew who was behind it. How? His obsession with Hitler and World War II.  Knowing what he knew, he wanted to prevent Israel...... which by the way is such an obvious genocide and was used by the Jews after World War II as their homeland ... a place they aren't actually from... to put them somewhere and to carry out their plans of a "new world order" for complete and total domination of people every where. The United States just decided, after Kennedy, they were too big of a pain in the ass to deal with and decided if you can't beat them join them.

       I was livid when they deleted that. I thought about writing a post about it here, but it's just been all Trump cheerleading all the time, so what's the point? Someone archived the original article, though.

       The CIA went rouge. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Were they acting on behalf of Wall Street investors? What would their motive be?
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO it was Wall Street ultimately, or elements within the investment community who wanted to make a few bucks off their directed chaos along with international actors who had hands in the pot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way this plays out like treason.

       Beautifully done I thought.
I was in my second grade class when the nun came in and told us. They sent us home and everyone was watching 
the TV. We watched nonstop through Monday night. I
was in church when Oswald was shot. Still mad about that.
Our world really changed that weekend. By 1968, when they killed Bobby and MLK, it was different place.

       You have great grasp of the subject. I agree with you completely. So annoying to see the disinformation 
theory’s taking up space.

       Even shorter?  He figured out who ran the world, ("hidden hand" during ww1 &amp;2) spoke of them directly (secret societies) and decided that he didn't like who they were how they did it.  CIA drug running ruining American lives, Northwoods, Paperclip, MKULTRA, etc.  he knew exactly how it worked his family were insiders during the war.  He decided to take them on and get rid of the secrecy and smash them into a thousand pieces.  So they took him out, and the same still run the world.

       It's so obvious that the US funded the maidan revolt and put anti-russian fascists in the parliament and now the US is selling weapons to Ukraine and sending NATO troops. How is this not obvious to everyone amazes me.

       I agree.  People want to act like this was a "peoples' revolution" in Ukraine, but it is very clearly a western coup.  Especially considering Victoria Nuland's comments about who they wanted to install as the new leader that would serve their interests.

       Hey there, I found what I think is an interesting Cable, sent to the CIA Mexican Station Chief, in this latest release of documents, dated 6 November 1963.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, being only in my 30's, and not knowing much of the intricacies of the documents that a researcher such as yourself would know, I'm wondering if this cable raises the same flags for you? Do you recognise the cryptonyms used, the author of the Cable? Does it have any links to other documents you may have uncovered in your research, or read about from the research of others?
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll find the cable
       <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32355739.pdf">
        here
       </a>
       , it being found in
       <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/2017-release?page=111">
        Row 5552
       </a>
       of the released documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this cable, a CIA man called Oliver Galbond — who, in a separate matter, apparently was the CIA man who received by mail photos of an unidentified man, allegedly Oswald, taking in Mexico City — writes to the Chief of Station in Mexico City about an unidentified 'Subject'
      </p>
      <p>
       This subject had undertaken a two week training school called ENDOMORPH, which was a prerequisite for attending an ODENVY National Academy training course. (ODENVY being the CIA's cryptonym for the FBI).
      </p>
      <p>
       The cable goes on to give a brief description of the Subject's character, and then suggests that a more thorough character assessment might be obtained from the FBI, that KUBARK (the CIA's cryptonym for itself) requests for such assessments from the FBI "are rare and would exhibit undue interest in Subject. Therefore, FBI comments are not being requested'
      </p>
      <p>
       The cable ends with a paragraph suggesting that should Mexico Station like to be introduced to the Subject, then CIA Headquarters would be glad to approach the trainers at the ENDOMORPH training school for 'letters of entree to the subject'
      </p>
      <p>
       • The cable is dated about 2 weeks prior to the assassination
• Who could the Subject be?
• There are no references to ENDOMORPH (that I could find, though I will keep looking) in the CIA files on the CIA website, National Archives, Mary Ferrell Foundation etc
• The cable was previously released in part / released with deletions. I'll continue looking to find the originally released redacted version.
• Given the cryptic references to a Subject, with no intimation this might be Oswald, how is this cable related to the JFK assassination?
• Could it be inferred, from its release as part of documents relating to the assassination, and that Galbond had allegedly received photos of Oswald in Mexico City, that the Subject referred to in the cable is (or was) a person of interest in the investigation into the assassination?
• Could it then be inferred that the Subject is Oswald?

       I think that is a very fair guess.  I remember reading in JFK and the Unspeakable, that Oswald had a lot of activity in Mexico City.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess new documents are coming out with this release of what he was doing there:

       No.  All of this has been available for years.  It's the old saying that if a lie is repeated enough, then it becomes the truth.  Nobody ever bothers to investigate.

       A few things to add, the Israeli Intelligence and Israeli international crime syndicate were the driving force behind the pulling of the trigger, they did so without opposition because of the elements which you describe in detail.   Kennedy blocked kissenger’s petrodollar, preferring a gdp or gold based currency, Kennedy denied Israelis attempt to build nuclear weapons.     Kennedy was pro-hitler and anti-zionist, he did not curb to the israeli lobby and he was a threat to their globalization agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not months after jfk was slain did lbj permit nuclear arms for israel, and less than a decade later did nixon approve the petrodollar, two major political efforts of the zionist federation.

       Don't forget that we have two filmed presidential speeches one from Eisenhower &amp; one from JFK where they actually tell the public that the government has been corrupted by unelected power.

       It still drives me nuts that every American/global citizen is not aware of these speeches freely available on Youtube.

       That's kind of the point here.  The people that manipulate things in order to make President's complicit in these actions are who he had a problem with.
      </p>
      <p>
       He began his presidency listening to his advisors and then figured out they set him up and were self-serving.  Just like they advised that the best course of action would be a coup in Cuba, which he agreed to go along with provisionally, but then they set him up so that he would be "forced" to bring in military support, thus escalating conflict with Russia.

       Are you the original author of this post?  The reason I ask is because I have encountered this exact text before.  On 9/24/2016 to be precise.  The reason I know the exact date is because I had saved it.  I have spent a long time researching the JFK assassination and I believe you are spot on.  I believe you have articulated the broad strokes really eloquently.  I am curious how what you perspective is on some of the more finer points.  Are you familiar with people such David Atlee Phillips, Antonio Veciana, Tosh Plumlee, David Ferrie, etc?  I would be interested to get your perspective on certain things sometime.

       The JFK 2017 Processing Team

      <p>
       In October of 2014, after conducting an initial pre-processing evaluation of the withheld materials, the National Archives constituted a dedicated team of four (4) archivists to process withheld JFK Assassination-related records in preparation for the 2017 release of additional materials. NARA has hired three (3) additional technicians to assist with digitizing the withheld materials.

      <p>
       The Team is conducting archival processing on the documents to prepare the records for scanning. Agencies with equities in the withheld materials have been notified that previously withheld documents will be released in 2017 absent a successful appeal to the President. The staff is working with NARA’s Office of Innovation to determine the best way to present the documents through archives.gov when released in 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once the digital release is completed the hard copy documents will be interfiled into the five million pages of the paper Collection.

       Everything I have heard over the last 20+ years has given me enough evidence that I have a theory I believe, but can not prove. (Bit long, sorry about that.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Oswald got back from Russia after infiltrating it. I believe he gave information about the U2 spy plane program, which led to Francis Gary Powers's plane being shot down. This makes Oswald look like a double agent, but there may have been a reason for that. (Maybe the CIA had spy satellites by this time?)
      </p>
      <p>
       When he got back, he seems to have been contacted by the FBI and hired to infiltrate a CIA-Mafia program to kill Castro and report back to them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once he joined them there were strange goings on. Besides the whole Fair Play for Cuba Committee thing, there was cancer research being done. Dr. Mary (Sherman), Dr. Vary (Judyth Vary Baker) and Dr. (David) Ferrie (as they called themselves) were at work trying to find a way to inject cancer cells into Castro. When that research proved rather slow, they tried to find a virus that could attack the immune system.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has to be pointed out that Dr. Ferrie was gay, and the first cases of AIDS were alleged to have started in similar lab conditions where gay men had sex with monkeys infected with the virus. Ferrie also worked with monkeys and was part of the gay underground. One can speculate about the origin of AIDS, but I don't believe it happened here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually they isolated a powerful virus, and could store it in a thermos safely for something like 48 hours before it became ineffective. The idea was for Oswald (who became Dr. Baker's boyfriend) to go to the Cuban Embassy in Mexico and meet with one of Castro's doctors, hand over the thermos and they would get it back to Cuba and into Castro somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, a hurricane struck Cuba and Oswald was left standing around the embassy while all doctors were forced to stay in Cuba and help out. He left the thermos behind and reported the mission failed.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that, the deadline the mob gave for killing Castro came and went, and they turned their efforts to killing JFK, seen as lenient after making promises following the Bay of Pigs. Though the CIA, mob and ex-Cubans had different reasons to hate Castro, they were also in collusion on JFK so the project continued.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oswald reported to the FBI and was told to try to prevent the assassination where possible. Once it became obvious where the assassination was going to take place (there was an aborted attempt in Florida), he moved to Dallas.
      </p>
      <p>
       An unknown number of hit teams went there to carry it out. One team seems to have included Lucien Sarti, who worked in the Sicilian Connection. Another team was Charles Nicoletti, Johnny Roselli and James Files who worked for Sam Giancana of Chicago. A third team worked for Santos Trafficante.
      </p>
      <p>
       I forgot which FBI or CIA agent(s) arrived on the morning of November 22nd to call off the assassination, but he/they only seem to have succeeded in turning away the team with Sarti. At least two teams fired at JFK, one from the Dal-Tex building, and Files was behind the grassy knoll and fired the final headshot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oswald seems to have been the closest available patsy, as right after the assassination the hit teams left town and there were few people left who were local. The FBI (and specifically Hoover) must have thought it too embarrassing to reveal they had hired Oswald, so Hoover simply had a dossier made up (possibly even before the event) which showed Oswald's connections with Russia. They lost the other records, which won't be found in any new document releases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Later on Jack Ruby (who was in the program somewhere) killed Oswald because Oswald was not being cooperative and was threatening to blow the whistle on the whole program. As he simmered in a jail cell, Ruby claimed he was injected with cancer cells which were killing him, because HE was almost about to talk.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is what I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also the involvement of the oil men and the military-industrial complex, deMohrenschildt, and Operation Mongoose and many other things, but these aren't as directly connected to the assassination.

       Well, I may as well place this here since this is the JFK megathread and we're waiting.  The three tramps in the well-known photo were never booked and released after an hour.  The identities of 3 other hobos that have been stuffed down our throats for 25 years were booked, fingerprinted, and held in the jail for a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the day when City of Dallas released their documents of the event, I remember reading a long transcript of an interview with arresting officer Marvin Wise, who described in detail the arrest.  He found these three guys, then later was instructed to drive them to another location, then back again to the sheriff office.  He was very intent on getting credit for the arrests, and found out after an hour or two they were released and never arrested or booked -- he was irate at not getting the credit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember the long transcript interview with the FBI agent ended with him asking the assistant if he would get credit for the arrest and he was told no, they were already released.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now all that exists is a summary or articles about his interview, without the dialog transcript.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, not sure why the official narrative is pushing so hard that the three guys spotted running to the freight train after the shooting were the three other homeless guys.

       The National Archives website has the list of docs in parts. Under those are excel spread sheets that you can download and use to see what is in each part. Could be useful for anyone who wants to know what date and description of what they viewing/ listening to.

       I think they did this on purpose to confuse people. They as in whoever dropped these. It is misleading as they ALL say July but if you look at description it either says, "July 2017 Release - Formerly Released in Part - Part 4 of 4" or "July 2017 Release -
       <strong>
        Formerly Withheld in Full
       </strong>
       - Part 1 of 18".
      </p>
      <p>
       So for whatever reason they labeled them July but they are indeed unseen docs.

       Sorry, I've looked through the comments on here, I'm getting that, I was just following a link from a guardian article I read shortly before, bascially saying, " We’d like your help. The JFK files will be published online on Thursday here. If you’re reading through the documents and you spot an interesting fact or snippet you think we’ve missed, it would be great if you could let us know. We’ve set up a form here for contributions."  ..... So I had a look. Don't mind me then,.

I’ve got the best people working on it but it will take some time. These documents are not easy to read, so I will get it ready for you but it will take a little time, it’s a lot to process.

       Isn't the point of a megathread to have people post here, to keep the sub from being spammed to oblivion with hundreds of posts about this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe people would be more willing to post in the megathread if a new one was made daily, with links to previous megathreads?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think having people comment in the megathread is more likely to get their views seen, rather than the entire sub having to sift through posts about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not against high effort posts, but most really could (and in my opinion should) have been posted here instead.

       They aren't. You will note all three rules have something the govrnment of Nepal wants. Also, this document comes from the embassy in Nepal,
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       the State Dept.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were to try and go hunt the Yeti in 1960, Nepal would have made you follow these rules as well.

       The problem there is we can't say the natives and Tibetans didn't share a similar culture before the crossing. So if they did it wouldn't be surprising to see similar story's from both sides

       I wouldn't say "unfortunately", because I think this opens up even more interesting questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The same genetic markers are found in these groups, sure. And some burial rites were definitely carried over through East Asia and into the Americas. It's basically a given that people migrated that direction, by land (at least, and also possibly by boat at a later date.)
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Americas don't have any native apes. But they didn't always have native humans, either. Who's to say that humans are the only hominid that could have crossed the strait? Neanderthals were around much more recently than people think, and other species of human were all over Asia. In fact, we only know about a few other human species due to their DNA surviving in modern humans - in this conversation, the most relevant example being people of far east Asian heritage. There are two entire species that we only know about because of their genetic remnant, and there are probably more that weren't quite so early-modern-human-like. Other hominids were far more prevalent than most people realize, probably because it's uncomfortable to think about the fact that we f$%
       <sup>
        &amp;*
       </sup>
       and murdered other human species to death.

       Sorry for the rant, I'm very passionate about biological anthropology. There's so much left to be discovered!

       My theory on Bigfoot, Yeti and the like, is that sometimes creatures from parallel realities are seen briefly as their dimension “bleeds” into ours. Hence why there are never any remains found.

       Honestly, the more I learn about the CIA, the more I doubt they'd be able to pull this off and suppress its involvement all this time. They probably would have botched the operation to begin with. The agency was a mess of under Ike and JFK.

       But they haven’t suppressed their involvement. Just because the general population may not believe that a government agency was involved doesn’t mean its concealed.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s like saying because there hasn’t been an official declaration that the government was involved in 9/11 they have suppressed their involvement.

       No where does any report state it was delayed until tomorrow. Ive seen delayed but no one is saying any specific time table. Notice how much attention this is getting Nationally? They don't want that. They'll wait till the brain dead find the next big story and release them when no one gives a shit anymore. That way if something is found, no one will even care anymore. It's so obvious they are hiding something.

       This is the most relevant info I saw -- of course it could all be a LARP:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Israel killed JFK. Oswald thought he was there to protect JFK. He realized when JFK got shot he was a fall guy and tried to run.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is the classified JFK files yes, but it is not so much about JFK because it is deeper than that as you probably know. They are being released for other reasons than just wanting to know the truth about JFK. This is just another domino. Another thing, I saw someone say only a bunch of redacted files are being released. That is untrue, not much will be redacted other than names, but not many. Many are already deceased, their anonymity does not matter at this point. You will be surprised. They will not be your typical blacked out pages.

       I'm actually starting to believe the israel thing (and I'm a pretty lukewarm supporter of israel, not an antisemite.)
      </p>
      <p>
       JFK said no to their nuclear program. We've all seen how israel deals with being told no (they do it anyways)
      </p>
      <p>
       There are socalists all over this shooting, from one end to the other, and Israel is one of our only longtime socalist allies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They were the only ones I can find who stood to benefit from JFK's death, getting LBJ into office who wouldn't care if Israel had nukes.
      </p>
      <p>
       And who else would the CIA be covering for 54 years later if not our biggest Ally in the middle East?

"White House just gave a background briefing to say it is releasing 2,800 documents tonight. The remainder are being withheld at the request of the various departments and agencies - most importantly the CIA and FBI."

       Edit, now I see some will be held back. In other words, the 2,800 released today are going to be useless drivel.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nice, right? Deep State back at it again with the shadiness. We get it, Oswald was a CIA agent and the FBI/CIA were involved with the hit. Nobody will be surprised. I don't think we will ever see the "other records." If they do ever release them, they will be redacted all to hell and useless.

       Man those Democrats are sneaky. Able to run a shadow government, trick people into terrorist attacks, have child orgies in pizza parlors, fund ISIS, and hire armies of protestors . Yet unable to win elections, that they're undermining, resulting them in being the minority party in all three branches and most state governments.

       The fact that the CIA has, and probably still has, several assets in foreign states both enemy and ally in elected or appointed positions of government? The U.S. was probably involved in a vicious campaign of espionage against even ally nations during the investigation, tapping all possible assets. This is the assassination of the U.S. president after all, not just some smuck gunned down in Chicago.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you know who the CIA had controlled in your country's government decades ago you could potentially narrow down and find out someone who may be there today, as a result of that previous person's help.

       FBI CIA had 25 fucking years to prepare for this and they bleated and Trump folded. Bet he got them to do him a favour in exchange for giving them 6 months more to redact/shred/lose the important papers. Remember these are the PEOPLE'S papers and the people seeking a delay are trying to evade justice. I expected more of Trump.

       It should be a FOIA request.  If so, then it will take the time I stated earlier.  If they are releasing another way then I’m not familiar with those procedures.  I hope they are available ASAP for real tho..

       I think to them national security is the panic that could raise if they admitted that they were involved with an assassination or that they don’t work all that well. It underlines a great weakness that’s already known to some extent. 
You also have the security of Trump concerned in some cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a shitty thing to do at the end of the day, and I was hoping Trump would be the person to just say “fuck it” and do some dumb shit afterwards and make the news again. Sadly that wasn’t the case and as someone has said, it’s unlikely we will get anything good or relevant.

       Apparently 2800 files are being released but some are being delayed for 180 days by the white house for national security reasons. What national security reasons could honestly be the reason for the delay, any guesses?

       I’m trying to give them the benefit of the doubt, but the fact that they waited until the last day to file concerns makes me think it’s mostly just embarrassing shit and the spruced it up to Trump to put him in a bind. If they are legit a problem (somehow) then they’d have done this sooner.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being the case they’ll probably come out in 6 months, and trump’ll be pissed because they were delayed for shit reasons.

       The thing happened 30 years in the past. the only national security reason would be that the public find out the truth and an anarchistic shitstorm occurs where the american public take out all of congress.

       After reading into some of the files, I think it's because it might hurt relations with Israel or something. Who knows. Can't wait for them to be released though. Hopefully they don't block anything.

       Looks more like lazy scanning/contrast adjustment. Convenient if it's explosive info that we should really be able to read. I can understand mistakes but this is kind of too important for that to happen. Fishy :-(

       I'd like to think these are the 200 that they haven't released yet, but the cynical part of me thinks that they count these redacted images as part of the 2800 fully released docs.

       Does anyone else feel like the press release on the JFK archives is pretty heavy handed? 'The President orders the release...'
      </p>
      <p>
       National Archives Releases JFK Assassination Records 
Press Release ·
Thursday, October 26, 2017
      </p>
      <p>
       Washington, DC
      </p>
      <p>
       President Orders Release of All Remaining Section 5 Records and
More Precise Review for Remaining Redactions within Six Months
      </p>
      <p>
       The National Archives today released 2,891 records related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy that are subject to the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 (JFK Act). These records are available for download online.
      </p>
      <p>
       The President has also ordered that all remaining records governed by section 5 of the JFK Act be released, and thus additional records will be released subject to redactions recommended by the executive offices and agencies.  NARA will process these records for release as soon as possible on a rolling basis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on requests from executive offices and agencies the President has allowed the temporary withholding of certain information that would harm national security, law enforcement, or foreign affairs.  The President also ordered agencies to re-review their proposed redactions and  only redact information in the rarest of circumstances where its withholding “is made necessary by an identifiable harm to military defense, intelligence operations, law enforcement, or conduct of foreign relations; and the identifiable harm is of such gravity that it outweighs the public interest in disclosure.”  These instructions will allow the National Archives to release as much information as possible by the end of the temporary certification period on April 26, 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
       The National Archives previously released 3,810 related records on July 24, 2017, including 441 records previously withheld in their entirety and 3,369 records previously withheld in part. More information about this release is available online.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, the National Archives is also releasing to the public the unclassified electronic records of the Assassination Records Review Board (ARRB), including 52,387 emails and 16,627 files from the ARRB drives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The National Archives established the John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection in November 1992, and it consists of approximately five million pages of records. The vast majority of the collection has been publicly available without any restrictions since the late 1990s.

       look for the files that were previously withheld "in full" first.

       TLDR: Secret club member thinks he saw someone that looked like Oswald the day before asking for ammo, ends up seeing the actual guy he saw a few days later.

       A huge chunk of these were reviewed just two days ago. Trump definitely took the agencies by surprise by not withholding these.

       Is this anything? Says $10,000 used for propaganda. Then further down another $200 for radio propaganda etc. Just thought I'd post, having fun reading through some of these.

       There is a LOT of parallel to the Russia! Russia! Russia! alt-right and alt-left in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Soviets were convinced it was an ultraright conspiracy to kill the president as a catylist to war with Russia. They thought it senseless if it came from the ultraleft as they agreed with Kennedy's peaceful coexistence and disarmament.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the question is what group(s) would stand to profit off a war with Russia, and maybe we should look there.
      </p>
      <p>
       A LOT of parallel with today's political rhetoric.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything confirmation that we can't let this left-right divide consume us and especially this over consuming "blame Russia" as to some manufactured consent to war with them.

       It's called decades of demonstrated historical precedence  that investors and Wall street will create lies and manufactured consent for war.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your "Trump is a Russia stooge" is falling into and spreading that manufactured consent to enrich military contractors and Saudi oil investors who want Saudi Arabia (also a prime military defense buyer)  to supply Europe with oil over Russia.

       I served in OEF and the GWOT and saw first hand the verification of all the above. It's not to liberate people from terrorists that we fund and supply. It is perpetual war for perpetual profits and man does it really help the Saudis.

       The point is that Trump is trying to act diplomatically with the Russians and anything that he says that is even slightly positive is spun so that someone like you thinks "man, Trump really has Putin's dick in his mouth, he must be trying to help Russia become a superpower. Maybe we should revolt our own gov't and attack the Russians."

       Ooooooooor the reason Trump still hasn't re-engaged sanctions against Russia like he was told to by Congress, the reason he's gushed and complimented Putin publicly over the years, the reason he built his campaign and surrounded himself with people who have millionaire business ties to Russian oligarchs...is because the guy cares about the Trump brand and the Trump brand making money, more than he cares about the American people, and Putin's his ticket to ride.
      </p>
      <p>
       But no, really Trump is playing 5D chess and he's a master at international diplomacy. So much of a master that he got himself disinvited to see the Queen.

       The problem is you're basing all your views on 2015 . . . Try going back to at least pre ww1 to develop some real perspective on anything that goes on in this world politically,  especially internationally.. 
We're still dealing with the effects of the fall of the ottoman empire and you're basing your views off interviews from 2015. 
Unless you were speaking specifically about trump and not actually all your views... then I am sorry for my pretentious rant.....

       If anyone doesn't believe that public opinion can be manipulated I welcome them to sit through the BBC Documentary "The Century of the Self". They'll learn about Edward Bernays who, as the father of propaganda, had a hand in making sure the public was pro-war to the Billionaire's liking. They'll also learn that Gallup polls, and Ramussen, are nothing more than shams used to get the masses under control.
      </p>
      <p>
       After that they can watch "JFK to 911 Everything is a Rich Man's trick" and get their brains thinking about things. Some tidbits about this doc are things like Henry Ford being a massive anti-semetic who got
       <strong>
        an award
       </strong>
       from the Nazi's for his contributions towards them. Alot of ridiculous crazy shit in that doc that are eye opening, and yes Smedley Butler makes a cameo in there with the Business Plot video.

       Hitler was a savior of christianity, he opposed and foiled the jewish Bolshevik massacre of Christians, and eventually the truth will be well known, besides that you are correct, this document is simply an interview not even close to a smoking gun.

       Please tell me you forgot to include the /s after that comment. Stating that Hitler was a savior of Christianity is absurd. I’m all for discussion over actual conspiracies, however ignorant statements like that degrade this sub.

       Well hitler was not alone, but had it not been for the nationalist movement of the 30’s, the communists would have been unstoppable.  They did systematically attempt to dismantle christianity and and likely would have had done alot of damage.  My statement was a bit over the top, but I dont think mussolini and hitler get enough credit.

      <blockquote>

        This document was previously released in part. The red highlighted portions were deleted.

      <p>
       i.e. the first time around, they severed portions of it. Now they are releasing the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also possible that the only copy they have is that old working copy where someone noted the intended redactions many years ago.

       Based on the research I've done, Potito was pretty far right and was basically a part of the precursor to the American Nazi Party, the National States Rights Party, and he glorified the shit out of Hitler. Although, it makes you ask yourself why he would include in a speech information he knows about the assassination of a president who he probably hated just as much. I mean, he wouldn't have said anything if he didn't know that something was up with the entire investigation and the misinformation.

        In that memo, Donald Trump blocked the release of an unknown number of files, saying he had “no choice” but to accept the concerns of agencies such as the FBI and CIA. For days, he had hyped the release of the documents as a victory for the public that would be “so interesting!”

       It's frustrating but I also somewhat understand because
       <em>

       the CIA just murders people that don't fall in line. He's sort of playing with fire here.

       You know in Dumb and Dumber where the cops had Harry in a bullet proof vest, then after he realizes that he could have been shot in the face and asks the cop about it and she says, "That's a risk we were willing to take."?

       That's kind of how I feel about Trump crossing the CIA. If that begins a secret plot to assassinate him, that's a risk I'm willing to take.

       It's likely the "foreign affairs" bit is the key there. I would bet there is mention of a high profile assassination/attempt/ or some other black ops that is not yet known and would seriously destabilize relationships with another country.

       This one is interesting, it's all the potential threats to JFK's safety. 400+ reports from people ranging from "I heard a guy said he was glad he died" to "an Ouija board told me LBJ was next" My favorite is # 405 the lady claimed she had a vision of the assassination 2 months before it happened and that his children would be kidnapped, and that RFK would be killed if he ran for Pres. The interview was supposedly conducted 12/3/63

       Question because I am only marginally versed in the matters of JFK:
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's presume best case scenario and find out that JFK was indeed assassinated by the US government. That multiple business and governmental entities were involved. That was is presented in these files made public are an admission of guilt to a conspiracy going back decades.
      </p>

       Is any of this actionable information; could prosecution of any crimes revealed go forward?

       But I truly believe for us to heal and for people to realize the capability of when government goes out of control, we can only hope the public latches on to this and we can all be woke enough that things like this can't get out of control again.

       That's my thought as well; that the public becomes at the very least more aware of what people with power can do when that power is threatened by even the President himself.

       I think the documents have revealed how unstable agencies that are in charge of protection are. This isn’t the first case where something could have been done if they weren’t directly involved in the plans.

       Agreed, but even a cursory look of any average agency shows just how corrupt and inept most of them are handled. It's plainly obvious how badly the system is in need of change, but until that change begins to interfere with the daily lives of people in a way that prevents them from doing even the basic things, we're not likely to see that change happen.

       Most people who may have been involved are dead, the most notable exception being George H.W. Bush. I don't know if there's a statute of limitations on treason or conspiracy to commit murder, maybe a lawyer here would know.

       Literally me right now. I'm a common sheeple. Questioning the government I strongly believe in pretty much means I don't know what's real anymore. Where do we draw the line? The entire Cold War and War on Terrorism were encited by the US government? If such an enormous part of the government is staged, how much else is fake? I don't understand how conspiracy theorists function knowing that everything around them could be completely fake but you'll never actually find out the truth. I'm scared?

       It takes no stretch of the imagination to believe that the US government incited the Cold War and the War on Terrorism.  War requires provocation on
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not questioning your government, you're not being patriotic.  Look at our founding fathers -- every one of them questioned government, starting with the King and proceeding right on to their peers.  How much did Jefferson and Franklin write about the Constitution
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       it was signed?
      </p>
      <p>
       Questioning government is what responsible people do.  Post-war America was very much a blind state, and as a result, the 50's are an idealized decade.  Conflict in the 60's started opening eyes, and Watergate proved definitively that we could not trust anyone.  But that lack of trust is part of the inherit system of checks and balances of democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't worry about losing your handle on what's real.  Reality is for physicists to ponder, truth is for philosophers, and meaning is for theologians.  It's far better to just sit back and watch.

       Lurking can give you a perspective, but it is not good to remain a pure lurker. Some self fulfilling actions/deeds are the way to go. They don't need to be directed towards the outside, the current society. Kant's writing took another ~100 years after his death to impact reality - and it still hits like a truck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aristotle slowed us down for ~2000 years. Freud currently
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       slowing us down. Those had impact in their lifetime and people fail(ed) to realize how wrong they were. (sure, both had some interesting findings... but they got glorified for no reason, we failed to question the claims)

       you never knew, most people never even know that they dont know

      <p>
       the first official govt investigation in to the shooting said 'one shooter' and he was caught (mind you he was caught because he was arrested for going in to a movie theater without a ticket, and multiple cop cars responded to that threat), the later investigation by the govt concluded that there were actually 2 shooters. so thats conflict of findings just from within the govt
      </p>
      <p>
       then when you look more in to it, you see links between the fbi, kkk leaders for some reason, unsolved sightings of someone leaving the scene (iirc it was someone spotted walking out of a storm pipe)
      </p>
      <p>
       eventually though, you realize you'll never know and that even if you did, even if the information that the CIA "did" 9/11, nothing would change anyways, so then you just ignore it all and focus on yourself

       It's hard when you first go down that ol rabbit hole. Hard to know when to stop to come back for air. Watching the news and watching how people react to it is a trip. But generally it's pretty fucking depressing with every new thing you find out.

       I know where I am but the Cold War thing is horseshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       While we were the dominant military power and the only nuclear nation we stood by while the Soviets took control of all of Eastern Europe. It’s was only after years of hindsight and recognition of a lesser military advantage did the US do anything to provoke the Cold War situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Until Vietnam the Cold War was basically: Damn things are good here but too many people are seeing the communist ideology fuck up parts of the world. I guess we should do something about this.

       The only issue I have with that report, is the same Soviet source claims that the Soviets had no contact with Lee Harvey Oswald, yet one of the newly released documents show that he had been speaking broken Russian to a KGB agent weeks prior to the assassination.

       Curious, even as a Trump guy, what if he released everything and refused their redaction recommendations? The whole thing happened 50 years ago, what national security concerns could even be in there? Even if there were plans in place for leaders/countries at the time.....who the fuck is still running the country or even alive? I only think it all points back to our own government. It isn't like Trump is going to read all documents....but then again....maybe he trolled into seeing what they would redact and such....and has the authority to read them.....he does doesn't he? Regardless of agency holding?

       Yeah i think the only national security concerns are related to our view of the US. Even if it was proven some other government was conclusively behind the assassination.. I don't think even the most diehard of Americans would support or expect action to be taken against that country now. If it was the CIA or an inside job linked to more than a lone gunman with crazy as a motivation? Yeah we'd be pissed.

       It makes sense why the story of him being shot by Oswald before he was apprehended, was pushed. We know there is a connection with Tippet already. Before he was just a normal officer. Now it really makes you wonder why he and Lee were shot and killed when this type of info comes out. Can't just be a coincidence. Question is, why hide the info?

       The letter he wrote to the Russian embassy that was later turned over by the Russians in the 90's was intercepted by the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       "He also wrote a letter to the Soviet Embassy here in Washington, which we intercepted, read, and resealed."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's interesting who the letter was addressed to.
      </p>
      <p>
       "That letter from Oswald was addressed to the man in the Soviet embassy who is in charge of assassinations and similar activities on the part of the Soviet government. To have that drawn into a public hearing would muddy the waters internationally. To use all that would reveal our failure to carry out international courtesy laws."

       I understand not everyone knows about Steemit, but you could have google searched "what is steemit", instead of replying you don't want to click it ;)

       Steemit is a social media platform based on the STEEM blockchain, it is uncensorable and completely permanently stored in the blockchain. You should make accounts there and post there, reddit sucks for censorship, + you earn cryptocurrency for posting.

       Wow, "the civil rights people will holler hell saying his civil rights were violated- which they were." Then the admission that they will blame it all on Oswald for the sake of international policy. I don't even know what to say... a mentor of mine who was involved in politics at the time said exactly that... now I'm wondering what else he knew...

       Feels so good to see this sub directed back to down to earth speculation. Always browse but never take it seriously lately. Seeing the old school conspirators dissect this to it's full potential is uplifting. Of course we will not get full disclosure, but damn, 10-15 years ago you had to really convince people on these connections, these days its out there for us to look over. Old breadcrumbs but boy are they delicious when proven real.

       This document is already posted on here, but i found some more gold further down on the page.

       The KGB claimed to have evidence that implicated LBJ as being responsible for the assassination, and according to this document they were looking into LBJ's connection with Teddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very interesting. I would love to see the KGB's documents pertaining to LBJ's involvement.

       I have always been suspect of him. Wasn't it alleged that Jackie O stated she suspected LBJ was involved on the tapes she recorded for her biographer?

       It's not alleged, she actually did believe he was behind it. Caroline released her interview tapes about it early in a deal witb NBC not to air a Kennedy miniseries that was upsetting to the family (Jackie asked in her will that the tapes remain under lock and key until 50 years after her death.

       There were many attempts to kill him over the years. I grew up with the son of one of the men responsible for the exploding cigar that nearly worked. After the Bay of Pigs, he came to the us and became a nuclear engineer. Honestly, he should sue Dos Equis for stealing his identity, as he is really the most interesting man in the world.

       What's funny about How Chi Mihn is that we nearly sided with him. I believe it was General Pershing we sent to speak with him in the 50's and he came back saying we would either support him, or we would lose a war to him. Yet again, Pershing was shown by history to be correct.

       If true, the moment that got out, Israel would likely conduct a preemptive strike against us, because our response WILL be to destroy anyone responsible for murdering one of our most beloved presidents.

       if I had to put money on it, I'd bet it's things that could damage relations with current allies. like "we'll support Isreal just enough to keep the middle-east unstable, which to keep a lid on communism. Isreal will believe we're allies, but they're really just a pawn" or some such. they need 180 days to figure out how to put out the PR fires this will cause with allies, and to reassure those allies that this is not how we currently view the relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
       my second bet would be "dear mr. president, we're a really inefficient government organization, and we failed to do our job [to get everything ready for the release] so could you please make it so our mismanagement doesn't get anyone fired or in legal trouble"

       . Seems there is a lot of evidence for a second shooter and that LBJ may have killed Kennedy in order to attain the presidency from what I've garnered so far.

       Jackie stated months after the assassination that she believed LBJ was behind it. The picture of her on the plane, standing next to him with her outfit still covered in blood as he takes the oath of office breaks my heart even more knowing that this is how she felt.

       There were railroad workers on that bridge who heard a shot from the grassy knoll and saw a puff of smoke. They ran over there and found muddy footprints and cigarette butts but nothing else.

       I believe it says "I am sorry to not to have the opportunity to see you during my visit to Washington. I would like to have paid my respects and to have offered to assist you in any way that I might during your service in the commission of investigation in the presidents assassination." that's what the first 8 lines says and its dated 18 days before his death

       Let me help a bit. Continuing from where you left off: (I'm no professional at this, just up late and bored)
      </p>
      <p>
       "The labors of this Commision will (b)e most vital and can contribute - must contribute to - the preservation ... the political and social ...(illiegible)... nation.
It was my feeling that perhaps i (co)uld help you again as i used to in CB and Special Group ...(illegible)... as an intellegent and informed leg man, a ...(illegable), a gatherer of information - ... "
      </p>
      <p>
       From here he quotes something, looks like a turn of phrase of sorts.. the subsequent writing in that paragraph i cannot read on this first gloss over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting at the next paragraph, this part has an interesting tidbit:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Of most importance, i have a (illegible) angle. Mr. Kennedy was (missing word?) friend and classmate. i would (illegible) to contribute to a ...(illegible)... of the whys and the (illegible) conclusions which would ...(illegible)... for a favorable socio-politcal (illegible):"
      </p>
      <p>
       Nex paragraph i cant read enough to really bother writing it out, but it seems to go over what he presumes the Commission would do or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting again from second to last paragraph:
      </p>
      <p>
       "At present i am awaiting the (illegible) of the next school year when i shall resume my pre CIA ...(illegible)... a Degree(?) of Economics... I am available if you should need my services. 
whether you do need my services or (n)ot I know that the investigation (of?) this tragic event is in good hands. It is a most important responsibility. Its results will have manifold(?) implications for the future. Wish you well. Sincerely, Sherman Hoar

       The person who wrote the letter could well have wrote the wrong date by accident. I imagine most of us have made similar mistakes before. If they were planning a conspiracy, don't you think they would have been more thorough and less blatant?

       Pretty sure hijacking a .gov domain is ALOT harder than hijacking the website + the ways in which the government hosts the files.

       This document has probably been posted by now but I wanted to bring special attention to the amount of people who were interviewed by the Secret Service.
      </p>
      <p>
       This document is 400+ pages, but when you start getting to the interview reports, a large number of these folks were declared Schitzophrenic and were committed by the Secret Service.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many of these people also claim, per the reports, situations involving mind control, brainwashing, and "voices of God".
      </p>
      <p>
       We all know what this implication could mean. MKUltra?

       I love the cookie cutter methodology of this. "It was LBJ, in the CIA, with the second gunman." It's like they're playing clue with the public. Honestly, I can't fault them, I'd probably do something backhanded like that too.

       considering the immoral and illegal things governments routinely do, it seems shredding historical documents, or altering them to fit a narrative, would be low on the list of crimes. Hence, what we are reading is what they want us to read.

       To me the truth about the JFK assassination is simple. The CIA created hit teams to kill Castro made up of mainly anti Castro Cubans who fled  to the US after Castro came to power, Initially Kennedy supported this effort but after the Cuban Missile Crisis wanted these efforts stopped from fear of nuclear war with the Russians. The CIA and anti Castro Cuban where pissed. Either rouge elements of these teams or higher ups in he CIA were involved. Everything else is to confuse us.
Here’s how I know. Kennedy had canceled a planned visit to Chicago two weeks before Dallas because the Chicago PD found that there was a plot to kill the president there.
In the 54 years since not one MSM outlet has mentioned this. I wonder why?

       I actually know Abraham Bolden personally. He wrote a book about what happened to him. He gave me a copy and talked to me about the assassination. He believed in a government cover up. He says the government knew about the Chicago plot and still didn't guard Kennedy as they should have without the known threat. He says he was falsely accused and jailed for some fake bribery charges when he started asking to many questions. He is abery intellegent and interesting man.

       I don't know about you all, but I feel so let down by these documents! I am 69 years old and have been waiting for this ever since the 1960's. I have been deeply interested in JFK assassination and who did it, all of my life. Way back then, Jackie told the country that we would definitely find out who did it, when the documents were released (but that could not be immediate for national security reasons). I thought she said we would find out around 2027, but I was so young that dates as far away as 2017 or 2027 sounded like forever and about the same to me. I was young and not so cynical yet, and I believed her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems like they talk about every conspiracy theory any of us have had all of these years, but in vague terms and don't corroborate any one theory very well. I am beginning to think that government investigations were completely incompetent and useless, and that they USED conspiracy theorists to do their investigations for them. Grrrr. What new (to me?) material I am seeing, has more to do with interference with foreign countries and assassinations over there, not with JFK. Hopefully as more comes out, and as all the documents are read and studied by everyone, we'll find more about those responsible for the JFK assassination. Right now, for me, this has been frustrating beyond belief. I feel like we have been played.

       I put together some of the stuff found so far in this short video if you want to watch/listen. I show the documents as I read them.

      <p>
       2 shooters

      <p>
       Oswald was US Agent according to other US Agents who went on record.

       Oh, I will. What else can we do? As for the 2 shooters stuff, all I have seen on these threads was just that the documents report that somebody said in a speech in Florida a long time ago that there was a hole in the windshield, and two shooters; but no confirmation of any of this and no indication that this was their conclusion. But maybe there is more in your youtube, so I'll go listen to it, and thanks.

       yes. Agent Pena also says Oswald was a US Agent. Pena did the whole take down of Pablo Escobar and the Cali cartel. On netflix the show called Narcos shows all of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       also the new tom cruise movie, that person cruise plays is conntected to Pena and Oswald

       I hope you are right! I am still looking through the present documents in the hopes of coming across something. I guess deep in my heart I knew that the first document wouldn't specify who (or what group) did it and why, in text two inches high.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is discouraging to wade through so much useless slop looking for what we all want to know, after waiting for so many years. But I will go back to it now that I have had my little pity party. (sigh). I deserve to know what really happened; we all do.

       Lol so understandable. I feel like it was intentionally convoluted from the beginning. Have you seen this documentary? I watched it for the first time last night. It's a much watch even if a long one. Give it 30 minutes and you will be hooked

       Someone should create a site where all the files are hosted and people can register and will be prompted with random files that they will need to read through and if anything interesting is in the text, they can flag it and it will be put to a lower priority for the next user if it doesn't have anything interesting. With the sheer volume of the release, I think there needs to be an organized effort to search through every file.

       Not necessarily, government agencies are known for being overly cautious about those kinds of things. If you look at the recently released JFK docs, the secret service had documents on a twelve year old kid who wrote in her Christmas list “I want a gun to kill the president”. If that doesn’t reek of overly cautious then I don’t know what does.

       I'm having trouble reading this one, but from what i've made out there's one part that says "they discusses the assasination of president kennedy and the murder of accused assassin Leo Harvey Oswald. vtorygin(?) commented he considered it virtually impossible to have protested* the assassination, but considered the subsequent slaying of Oswald to be inexcusable. He commented "we should never have let this happen."
This is on the first page of the report.
*this word is admittedly difficult to discern but looking at the "test" that is apparent makes it difficult to think of it as anything else... maybe prevented?

       It's not that I don't believe him, it's more that I know he is a fucking scam artist. I'll make the story as short as I can, and know that is comes from me knowing the person this happened to.
      </p>
      <p>
       So this kid who worked on the crew I oversaw in a rural town in Colorado was into UFOs, one of those people who "just couldn't explain it but they see them all the time" kind of people - the ones who have apparently had them float right over their car. OK. I can go along with it, sure. So this kid gets in to one of Greer's "retreats" to a local-ish desert area to "channel" aliens, and summon crafts - because he at least used to very much promote this ability. As they are out in the desert, concentrating on "channeling" or "summoning," well golly, hour number 8 rolls around and this kid gets a "flash in his brain" of a typical grey.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that was the highlight of their day. The entire group's day. And I'm being told this and how it's obvious that Greer is the real deal because of it.

       Well shit. It only took a few hundred bucks and 8 hours of begging your superego to show you something you want, and bam! VISIONS OF ALIENS!

       The guy is a charlatan either way, but is either being hung out and doesn't know it by being slipped tidbits in a psyop, or is in on the scam and knows exactly what bullshit he lucked out on spreading.

       People around him might not be full of shit. He most certainly is.

       I've just had a brief look through some of the files. What I don't get from what I've seen so far is why any of it was top secret. A few peoples bank statements and some totally illegible stuff in there. Loads of stuff about Cuba and Mexico. What does that have to do with JFK being assassinated....? I'm hoping there's someone sifting through all this stuff to try and put together what the big secrets are because from what I just looked at it's a lot of boring stuff.

       I agree. If there are interesting JFK files, they are hidden by so many other files. I laughingly told my friend, that it looks like they included the entire contents of the bottom drawer of somebody's file cabinet.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, a lot of it is interesting but for other reasons. It does confirm the suspicions that many of us had, that the CIA was not above trying to assassinate leaders of other countries including Fidel Castro. So, now that is admitted.

       There had been a precedent for the extreme right in the US to attempt a coup,   documented by General Smedley Darlington Butler,  the attempted coup of Roosevelt,  in which George Bush's (the first) father and George Bush Jr grandfather played a role.

       I too thought of MK Ultra when that document referenced the ultra left and ultra right. I cannot for the life of me think of why they would use the word Ultra to describe what we think of as radical, hard, extremist left or right. Maybe it was a more colloquially used term for the CIA back then.

       I think it was used colloquially back then by the general public, to mean extreme. Instead of extremely light, we would say ultra light. Instead of extremely fantastic or very cool, we'd say ultra cool. Now that you mention it, I don't think "ultra" is used much any more in that way, for some reason.

       One thing to keep in mind is that there were some very "hip" people cooperating with the CIA,  artists,  philosophers,  etc.  and from the end of WWII to the time JFK was killed,  or maybe it was the Cuban Missle Crisis,  when times were pretty good,  and when the CIA showed up at the party,  it wasn't necessarily a downer at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,  "ultra" was hip,  and the feeling in general was the US were the white hats and things were going pretty well,  fun was being had,  the crazies had been held in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       From 62 to 64 all that changed.   The crazies were now in charge,  and none of the cool people were willing to help the CIA anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was as if McCarthyism had raised its ugly head again,  and at the fun times and freewheeling parties the CIA types were no longer welcome or trusted.   The stains of blood for JFK had turned DC into a monstrous place.    Ultra had been hip,  but now it was grisly.

       What happened in the 60’s wasn’t simply hippies. I respectfully disagree that left or right, as of today, has any real substance with respect to the JFK assasination. I don’t disagree that a coup d'etat took place in 1963.

       One thing to keep in mind is that there were some very "hip" people cooperating with the CIA before LBJ became president, artists, philosophers, etc. and from the end of WWII to the time JFK was killed, or maybe it was the Cuban Missile Crisis, when times were pretty good, and when the CIA showed up at the party, it wasn't necessarily a downer at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, "ultra" was hip, and the feeling in general was the US were the white hats and things were going pretty well, fun was being had, the crazies had been held in check.
      </p>
      <p>
       From 62 to 64 all that changed. The crazies were now in charge, and none of the cool people were willing to help the CIA anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was as if McCarthyism had raised its ugly head again. CIA types were no longer welcome or trusted. The stains of blood for JFK had turned DC into a monstrous place. Ultra had been hip, but now it was grisly. Reading the life of Mary Pinchot Meyer might help give you a sense of the flavor of the time, and how it changed after JFK.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the CIA had been up to dirty tricks in Central America, Iran, even the US, and the US was no white hat country before November 1963, but I am telling you, the hope ended. As bad as it had been before November 1963, the hope was still alive. That hope ended. Whatever "good" came out of the "Great Society" was far outweighed by bad vibes and horrendous genocide of millions in Vietnam of which most happened after November 1963.

       I think we’re mostly in agreement. I’m familiar with Mary. And I agree the hope ended. I think I was just trying to say it was a time when the American people, although ultimately futile, actually stood up and protested. People such as Mario Savio, Allen Ginsberg, the lyrics of Bob Dylan.

       Was there any specific point you are trying to make? Bob was never one to be outspoken. He wrote songs. You would know this if you know Dylan. He never wanted to be the voice of the generation or a voice for anyone else. He discovered quickly he couldn’t speak to people through interviews or at ceremonies. Especially after the acceptance speech at the Tom Paine Award,
       <strong>
        3 weeks after JFK was murdered.
       </strong>
       The comments on Cuba, about seeing some of himself in Oswald got himself booed off stage. Then read his ‘Not an apology letter’ he wrote about the ceremon. Everything that needed to be said was in one song in 1964.
It’s Alright Ma (I’m Only Bleeding).

       Can anyone tell me how to find just the NEW JFK files that were supposedly released yesterday (not the broader ones from 3-4 days ago)? I want the ones that the U.S. intelligence community didn't want released, but Trump supposedly finally released.

       We know now the Soviets thought that jfks murder was a coup. I hear somewhere that France and British intelligence thought the same but since the coup worked they didn't do anything about it. Does anyone have a link for proof of this ? I want to make sure they really thought so and not just some random internet rumor. Also did any other foreign nations think the same think about jfk being shot ?

       The letter I cited was dated November 22, 1963.  The one you found was from 1964.  If the KGB was right, then the FBI would have been in full cover up mode by '64.  Of course, it's not like the letter I found was the head of the KGB swearing on a communist manifesto that LHO was known FBI, but it's interesting all the same.

       It wasn't the surgeon general's actual report. Apparently Alex Jones (unintentionally?) misrepresented it. Actually it was one of the released documents and has no evidence beyond a third hand report of what somebody said in a speech. The youtube tells you about it.

       He held the report close enough to the camera, that with my copy of the document here, I could see that it was identical. I think don't think he misrepresented it intentionally, but was just mistaken. Also he has been very busy and I am nearly positive that some intern or somebody else prepared his segment for him, if he was busy on the Mueller stuff or something else. I've got to say I was appalled, but the guy who did that youtube (above) saw the same things I did, so at least I know I'm not nuts. Well, not VERY nuts. LOL

       it was an interview with POTITO most likely I have posted the document and the link along with a bunch of other interesting shit. There are many more docs about this. Including testimony of some guys at a shop talking about replacing the windshield on the presidential limo and then doctoring it to look damaged but not have a bullet hole in the front

       How many times can you fire a bolt action rifle in a few seconds? THe highest quality film of the kennedy assasination is 26.6 seconds, exposing 486 frames of standard 8 mm Kodachrome II safety film, running at 18.3 frames/second the original copy was owned by life magazine shot by zapruder. When the film was sent to the Warren commision frames were set into slides for a projector for each of the 486 frames and dozens were duplicated and doctored...why?

       This makes no sense. Why would the allies organise a mass cover up? Why would they fabricate his death?

       But most of all, why would said Hitler, having escaped torture and  death, and gone into hiding in south America, keep his most recognisable haircut, moustache and attire and pose like this for a photo?

       What if there were multiple plots in action at once? If one group knew that Oswald would try to assassinate the president and they also wanted to, it'd make the most sense to let him do his thing and have a backup shooter around just in case he didn't carry through or didn't finish the job so that he could be used as a patsy. This would explain why he was killed soon after, he might've not known about the plot, but he might've known that there were shots that he never fired.

       I just went to the JFK museum at the Texas School Book Repository and thought it was kinda strange that the corner of the floor of where Oswald took the shots was completely glassed off, the set of windows to the right are accessible however.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also found it interesting that towards the end of the tour they also talk about the conspiracies and even point out some of the strange inconsistencies in the warren commission but just chalk them up as simple mistakes. I also didn't know that there was two X's in the road where Kennedy was shot.
      </p>

       The place is pretty cool though, id recommend going there if you're ever in Dallas.

       There are a ton of JFK conspiracy theory videos that came to that conclusion. I saw one on Netflix, as well as several on YouTube. 
Perhaps "JFK - The Smoking Gun"?

       He threatened the military industrial complex which is controlled by the same groups. He was the black sheep of the family and got the hole in his head because of it. His family knew and threw him to the wolves. He was the first Roman Catholic of nobility bloodline talking about ending the CIA and screwed with the MIC. There will never ever be another one. He wasn't a saint but, knew some things. This is why his head was blown off.

       It should be noted that in addition to working with Khrushchev, it's rumored that Kennedy and the Soviet leader were discussing embarking on a
       <em>
        joint
       </em>
       moon mission...something that flew directly in the face of the extremely lucrative "Cold War" narrative.

       I feel like a lot of the current small "conspiracies" (including some relating to Trump/Clinton) can really be traced back to the military-industrial complex. It's practically hiding in plain sight--we've been in Afghanistan for how long now? And stocks of Boeing, Raytheon, Lockheed, etc keep going up and up. Not to mention the existence of private mercenary contractors.

       To add to the Executive Orders, look for the EO's on the subject of cooperation in space with other countries, i.e., Russia. The hard core anti-commies were very perturbed that JFK would share space research/ideas/plans/technology with any commies.

       This is also supported by the so-called Iron Mountain Report, allegedly commissioned by Kennedy to explore the possibility of moving to a peacetime government for good.
      </p>
      <p>
       To summarize, the panel went way beyond its mission and did a thorough examination of why governments are so bloodthirsty and how they came to be this way, ultimately coming to the conclusion that governments and war are inextricably linked so that to stop making war would begin to render government unnecessary.

       This is partially right. You fail to link his speech on secret societies and the CIA. No one defines communism either... rather people just presume communism is Russian. It isn't. Communism was started by the Bolsheviks who were actually primarily Khazarians who converted to Judaism back in the 1400s - see Arthur Koesteler's The Thirtenth tribe. They hated Russia and their strategy is simple - take the identities of the host country and move into positions of power in the host country, take control of the media to control the narrative, and  extract all of the coutnries resources through central banking and lending at high interest rates to waring governments. That's why Kennedy's dad hated the Jews. That's also why Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110. Without the silver or gold standard there is no such thing as freedom. Howard Buffett talked about this as well.

       Really 90% of Communism comes down to implementing a Central bank -something the US has today- in order to control the money supply and thus giving the government a platform to endlessly go into debt. By doing so, it forces the Central bank to continuously print money, stealing the productive capacity of the host nation. In other words, it steals from you bank account by diluting the value of your dollars by putting more into circulation.  Kennedy knew this and wanted to put a stop to it. He also knew who was behind it. How? His obsession with Hitler and World War II.  Knowing what he knew, he wanted to prevent Israel...... which by the way is such an obvious genocide and was used by the Jews after World War II as their homeland ... a place they aren't actually from... to put them somewhere and to carry out their plans of a "new world order" for complete and total domination of people every where. The United States just decided, after Kennedy, they were too big of a pain in the ass to deal with and decided if you can't beat them join them.

       The CIA went rouge. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Were they acting on behalf of Wall Street investors? What would their motive be?
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO it was Wall Street ultimately, or elements within the investment community who wanted to make a few bucks off their directed chaos along with international actors who had hands in the pot.

      <p>
       Either way this plays out like treason.

       Beautifully done I thought.
I was in my second grade class when the nun came in and told us. They sent us home and everyone was watching 
the TV. We watched nonstop through Monday night. I
was in church when Oswald was shot. Still mad about that.
Our world really changed that weekend. By 1968, when they killed Bobby and MLK, it was different place.

       Even shorter?  He figured out who ran the world, ("hidden hand" during ww1 &amp;2) spoke of them directly (secret societies) and decided that he didn't like who they were how they did it.  CIA drug running ruining American lives, Northwoods, Paperclip, MKULTRA, etc.  he knew exactly how it worked his family were insiders during the war.  He decided to take them on and get rid of the secrecy and smash them into a thousand pieces.  So they took him out, and the same still run the world.

       I believe it says "I am sorry to not to have the opportunity to see you during my visit to Washington. I would like to have paid my respects and to have offered to assist you in any way that I might during your service in the commission of investigation in the presidents assassination." that's what the first 8 lines says and its dated 18 days before his death

       It's so obvious that the US funded the maidan revolt and put anti-russian fascists in the parliament and now the US is selling weapons to Ukraine and sending NATO troops. How is this not obvious to everyone amazes me.

       Hey there, I found what I think is an interesting Cable, sent to the CIA Mexican Station Chief, in this latest release of documents, dated 6 November 1963.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, being only in my 30's, and not knowing much of the intricacies of the documents that a researcher such as yourself would know, I'm wondering if this cable raises the same flags for you? Do you recognise the cryptonyms used, the author of the Cable? Does it have any links to other documents you may have uncovered in your research, or read about from the research of others?
      </p>
      <p>
       You'll find the cable
       <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/docid-32355739.pdf">
        here
       </a>
       , it being found in
       <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/2017-release?page=111">
        Row 5552
       </a>
       of the released documents.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this cable, a CIA man called Oliver Galbond — who, in a separate matter, apparently was the CIA man who received by mail photos of an unidentified man, allegedly Oswald, taking in Mexico City — writes to the Chief of Station in Mexico City about an unidentified 'Subject'
      </p>
      <p>
       This subject had undertaken a two week training school called ENDOMORPH, which was a prerequisite for attending an ODENVY National Academy training course. (ODENVY being the CIA's cryptonym for the FBI).
      </p>
      <p>
       The cable goes on to give a brief description of the Subject's character, and then suggests that a more thorough character assessment might be obtained from the FBI, that KUBARK (the CIA's cryptonym for itself) requests for such assessments from the FBI "are rare and would exhibit undue interest in Subject. Therefore, FBI comments are not being requested'
      </p>
      <p>
       The cable ends with a paragraph suggesting that should Mexico Station like to be introduced to the Subject, then CIA Headquarters would be glad to approach the trainers at the ENDOMORPH training school for 'letters of entree to the subject'
      </p>
      <p>
       • The cable is dated about 2 weeks prior to the assassination
• Who could the Subject be?
• There are no references to ENDOMORPH (that I could find, though I will keep looking) in the CIA files on the CIA website, National Archives, Mary Ferrell Foundation etc
• The cable was previously released in part / released with deletions. I'll continue looking to find the originally released redacted version.
• Given the cryptic references to a Subject, with no intimation this might be Oswald, how is this cable related to the JFK assassination?
• Could it be inferred, from its release as part of documents relating to the assassination, and that Galbond had allegedly received photos of Oswald in Mexico City, that the Subject referred to in the cable is (or was) a person of interest in the investigation into the assassination?
• Could it then be inferred that the Subject is Oswald?

       A few things to add, the Israeli Intelligence and Israeli international crime syndicate were the driving force behind the pulling of the trigger, they did so without opposition because of the elements which you describe in detail.   Kennedy blocked kissenger’s petrodollar, preferring a gdp or gold based currency, Kennedy denied Israelis attempt to build nuclear weapons.     Kennedy was pro-hitler and anti-zionist, he did not curb to the israeli lobby and he was a threat to their globalization agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not months after jfk was slain did lbj permit nuclear arms for israel, and less than a decade later did nixon approve the petrodollar, two major political efforts of the zionist federation.

       Don't forget that we have two filmed presidential speeches one from Eisenhower &amp; one from JFK where they actually tell the public that the government has been corrupted by unelected power.

       It still drives me nuts that every American/global citizen is not aware of these speeches freely available on Youtube.

       FDR was a war monger in the end. He was involved in highlevel financial shit too... every president is. But they both wanted banking reform, health care, and overall less war.

       Are you the original author of this post?  The reason I ask is because I have encountered this exact text before.  On 9/24/2016 to be precise.  The reason I know the exact date is because I had saved it.  I have spent a long time researching the JFK assassination and I believe you are spot on.  I believe you have articulated the broad strokes really eloquently.  I am curious how what you perspective is on some of the more finer points.  Are you familiar with people such David Atlee Phillips, Antonio Veciana, Tosh Plumlee, David Ferrie, etc?  I would be interested to get your perspective on certain things sometime.
