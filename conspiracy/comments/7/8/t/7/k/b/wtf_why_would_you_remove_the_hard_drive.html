    <div class="md"><p>It was probably never in the computer at the hotel. The fact that the computer has no hard drive is not evidence that someone took it. He could have removed it long prior to the shooting and used the laptop only with a bootable OS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bro, you&#39;re thinking about this in the wrong way. You are assuming that Paddock was still the Killer. Just for a second, imagine a scenario where he wasn&#39;t. Imagine a scenario where he was working with United States government in a sting operation to sell firearms to a third party. That third-party found out about the sting beforehand and showed up to his hotel room before the sting was to occur. They killed Paddock and, after realizing the room was bugged with cameras, took the hard drive and use the guns on people as a general &quot;fuck you&quot; to those that we&#39;re trying to set up the sting in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s a lot of speculation that isn&#39;t based on much evidence in my opinion. Aside from the fact there were lots of guns in his room, there&#39;s no evidence it was an arms deal gone wrong. And even that idea isn&#39;t without major logical fallacies.</p>

<p>I&#39;m supposed to believe that they were carrying out an arms deal, on the 32nd floor of a vegas casino, when they are literally surrounded by empty fucking desert in every direction? Come on man. Arms deal gone wrong, in this scenario, is less believable than the fucking easter bunny. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please tell me why a location would have anything to do with whether an arms deal is an inappropriately logical place to Stage an arms deal. You need to start thinking like an actual Criminal. Criminals, especially on a large scale, rely on hiding in plain sight. Seriously, have you never looked into high scale crimes?</p>

<p>We have to completely abandon the media narrative and try to piece together what happened from scratch, because nothing they&#39;re telling us narrative-wise is true.</p>

Seems odd for data protection purposes to go this far; against a simple solution to accomplish this goal.
