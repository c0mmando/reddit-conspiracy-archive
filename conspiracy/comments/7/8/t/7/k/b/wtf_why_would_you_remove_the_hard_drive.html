       Wouldn't a rational person just ditch the entire laptop, essentially erasing all indications a laptop ever existed? Sure, part it out and dispose of it in pieces all over the place, but get rid of the whole thing entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I know the dude was fucking crazy to go killing people the way he did, but even a crazy paranoid person would dispose of more than just the hard drive.
      </p>
      <p>
       That shit makes no sense. Something tells me that hard drive was removed after the fact.

       Because you can make a bootable usb drive with an OS on it. If you leave the laptop it wont have any evidence on it.

       Agreed. Removing hard drives from modern laptops ranges from impracticable(special screw drivers) or literally "impossible"(Macs) in such situations. Taking the machine with you makes the most sense.

       It was probably never in the computer at the hotel. The fact that the computer has no hard drive is not evidence that someone took it. He could have removed it long prior to the shooting and used the laptop only with a bootable OS.

       Bro, you're thinking about this in the wrong way. You are assuming that Paddock was still the Killer. Just for a second, imagine a scenario where he wasn't. Imagine a scenario where he was working with United States government in a sting operation to sell firearms to a third party. That third-party found out about the sting beforehand and showed up to his hotel room before the sting was to occur. They killed Paddock and, after realizing the room was bugged with cameras, took the hard drive and use the guns on people as a general "fuck you" to those that we're trying to set up the sting in the first place.

       Well that's a lot of speculation that isn't based on much evidence in my opinion. Aside from the fact there were lots of guns in his room, there's no evidence it was an arms deal gone wrong. And even that idea isn't without major logical fallacies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm supposed to believe that they were carrying out an arms deal, on the 32nd floor of a vegas casino, when they are literally surrounded by empty fucking desert in every direction? Come on man. Arms deal gone wrong, in this scenario, is less believable than the fucking easter bunny.

       Please tell me why a location would have anything to do with whether an arms deal is an inappropriately logical place to Stage an arms deal. You need to start thinking like an actual Criminal. Criminals, especially on a large scale, rely on hiding in plain sight. Seriously, have you never looked into high scale crimes?

       Judging from the photos leaked of Paddock's headshot (no pun intended) rigor mortis had already set in. So I believe he was placed there. Although, it's only speculation, as we do not know how long after LVMPD/FBI cordoned off the hotel room as a crime scene the photos were taken.

       Nothing about this story makes sense. I haven't been able to find a single picture of an actual bullet wound. I'm not even sure anyone was actually shot.

       We have to completely abandon the media narrative and try to piece together what happened from scratch, because nothing they're telling us narrative-wise is true.
