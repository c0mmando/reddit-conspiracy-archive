    <div class="md"><p>Well, playing devils advocate.  Because we know Oswalds history is very sketchy.  The CIA was watching him since he went to Russia, Cuba, and Mexico.  It could be they don&#39;t know exactly what happened in those places but it looks suspicious which would have made the American Public call for war.   </p>

<p>Option 2 is all the sketchy things the Kennedys and the CIA and FBI  were up to are revealed in the documents.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha, the DDR video.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an information game. They &quot;investigate&quot; what information has or will reach the public, and what information hasn&#39;t or will never reach the public. If they are in full possession of some evidence, they can redact all they want. Goal is to shape a narrative and control the outcome of an event. And when more information surfaces, oh would you look at that? They&#39;re &quot;reopening&quot; the investigation (to plug a hole). Just like that Hillary scandal which got intentionally botched by James Comey.</p>

<p>Obvious pattern is obvious.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, okay. I didn&#39;t know him personally, I was 17 when the shooting happened and he was a few years older than me. I know plenty of people that did though, and I had seen him playing DDR at the movie theater. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this was a false flag. I can see the reasoning, why people think there was a second shooter why they think it was a cover up, but I just don&#39;t see it. There are no actors (I know some of the affected families personally). Lanza was a perfect shit storm of negligence, concessions by his mother, a lack of security at Sandy Hook School, and access to firearms.</p>

<p>But fuck, I wish he wasn&#39;t smart enough to encrypt all his hard drives. I read the FBI report the day it came out, and my heart sunk with every page. No explicit motive and no written plan. I think it was all on those drives. There was no closure in the aftermath, which is the worst part of it for me, being someone who was not <em>directly</em> affected. What do you think? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see it as being a false flag.  I think it is a very tragic and sad event.  There are a lot of people that think the bodies are not real, but I do.  This goes for Vegas, Sandy Hook and others.  </p>

<p>That must be very strange to have seen him playing DDR at a movie theater.  I was not expecting to get a response from someone like you.  It makes it more real, especially since you know some of the affected families.  I would not even know what to say to them.   </p>

<p>Thanks for responding.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;You could argue the CIA didn&#39;t want specific means of how they followed Oswald to be public.&quot;</p>

<p>Maybe they were somehow using a remote control version of a technique called &quot;Psychic Driving,&quot; to influence how Oswald made his decisions and where he traveled. Psychic Driving is not as good as the name makes it sound. From Wikipedia: </p>

<p>&quot;Psychic driving was a psychiatric procedure of the 1950s and 1960s in which patients were subjected to a continuously repeated audio message on a looped tape to alter their behaviour.&quot;</p>

<p>This technique is one of the cornerstones of the MK Ultra type behavioral modification programming that is a known, declassified conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While you bring up a good point, I actually didn&#39;t specifically say the cia was directly involved in his death, although I could have made that point more clear as I see how you could think I was alluding to that. Maybe it was zee Russians. Maybe there were multiple shooters and the CIA doesn&#39;t want to admit there I, er, I mean was, a foreign cell in this country with that kind of penetration power. Maybe it was Castro or the mob. Maybe there he was an mk ultra that went off the rails. Maybe he was mk ultra and got intercepted by zee Russians and turned on his own. Maybe there is some bone simple evidence that there is no way that he made that shot or was working with a team and the CIA don&#39;t care because he was actively taking missions from them in Vietnam and turning them over to Special Forces and S.O.G. units. No more Opium for you dirty spook. Honestly, there are a ton of reasons I can think of, but I&#39;m just havin a conversation.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Lee Harvey Oswald and his Russian-born wife Marina Oswald were introduced to Mohrenschildt in the summer of 1962 in Fort Worth, Texas. Mohrenschildt testified to the Warren Commission in 1964 that he had met the Oswalds through George Bouhe. When he asked “Do you think it is safe for us to help Oswald”, Bouhe said he had checked with the FBI. Mohrenschildt also stated that he believed he had discussed Oswald with Max Clark, whom he believed was connected with the FBI, and with J. Walton Moore, whom Mohrenschildt described as &quot;a Government man — either FBI or Central Intelligence&quot;,[37][38] and who had debriefed Mohrenschildt several times following his travels abroad, starting in 1957.[38][39] (According to a CIA classified document, obtained by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, J. Walton Moore was an agent of the CIA&#39;s Domestic Contacts Division in Dallas.)[38] Mohrenschildt asserted that shortly after meeting Oswald, he asked Moore and Fort Worth attorney Max E. Clark about Oswald to reassure himself that it was &quot;safe&quot; for the Mohrenschildts to assist Oswald. Mohrenschildt testified that one of the persons he talked to about Oswald told him that Oswald &quot;seems to be OK,&quot; and that &quot;he is a harmless lunatic.&quot; However, Mohrenschildt was not exactly sure who it was who told him this.[40] (When interviewed in 1978 by the House Select Committee on Assassinations, J. Walton Moore said that he had no recollection of any conversation with Mohrenschildt concerning Oswald.[38] During this period, tens of thousands of American citizens were routinely debriefed by the CIA after traveling to communist countries such as Yugoslavia, as Mohrenschildt was.)[39] After returning home from a weekend trip to Houston, Mohrenschildt became aware that someone had broken into his home and copied his personal papers and other documents. At the time, he also had a manuscript that Lee Harvey Oswald had given him to read and realized this document might also have been photocopied in the search. His primary concern was that the CIA was behind the break-in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, I highly doubt it. Just look at the files they already released:

<p>On the first page in the lower left corner, the document was already marked for release years ago... We will never see any documents marked &quot;TOTAL DENIAL&quot;</p>

<p>Think of it this way. If it truly was a lone wolf shooter then why hide the files in the first place? Why is the CIA Director Mike Pompeo lobbying the president furiously not to release these documents and claiming its a threat to national security?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read the speech he is clearly talking about the Soviet Union as a secret society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>It requires a change in outlook, a change in tactics, a change in missions--by the government, by the people, by every businessman or labor leader, and by every newspaper. For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence--on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.</em></p>

<p><em>Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed. It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was addressing the American Newspaper Publishers Association because he wanted them to pipe down on American secrets;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>For the facts of the matter are that this nation&#39;s foes have openly boasted of acquiring through our newspapers information they would otherwise hire agents to acquire through theft, bribery or espionage; that details of this nation&#39;s covert preparations to counter the enemy&#39;s covert operations have been available to every newspaper reader, friend and foe alike; that the size, the strength, the location and the nature of our forces and weapons, and our plans and strategy for their use, have all been pinpointed in the press and other news media to a degree sufficient to satisfy any foreign power; and that, in at least in one case, the publication of details concerning a secret mechanism whereby satellites were followed required its alteration at the expense of considerable time and money.</em></p>

<p><em>The newspapers which printed these stories were loyal, patriotic, responsible and well-meaning. Had we been engaged in open warfare, they undoubtedly would not have published such items. But in the absence of open warfare, they recognized only the tests of journalism and not the tests of national security. And my question tonight is whether additional tests should not now be adopted.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you a simplified take: The official story is that Oswald was a communist assassin acting alone, but there are some problems with that story. He was in contact with the Soviets, and as a result he was at least on the CIA&#39;s radar before the assassination...but we the public don&#39;t know the extent of Oswald&#39;s relationship with the USSR, and CIA isn&#39;t telling. Meanwhile, politically-motivated deranged assassins aren&#39;t expected to describe themselves as a patsy, but he did. Plus, a bunch of stuff about bullet trajectories.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no unified theory of JFK that everyone agrees on...you just have to take the facts as you understand them and work out a hypothesis. Some people think the Mafia and the FBI were involved, or that it was orchestrated by Johnson, or that it was all about Vietnam, or that it had something to do with Marilyn Monroe. I have my own crazy theory, but it&#39;s not worth any more than the others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh if you insist!</p>

<p>Mine&#39;s really mundane: I think Oswald really was a Soviet asset, and that the CIA tried to cover that up to avoid nuclear war. My guess is Oswald either misunderstood a communication or else was ordered to assassinate JFK by an overzealous Russian official, and that the Kremlin asked the CIA for help cleaning the mess up.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t account for multiple shooters. I don&#39;t know enough about bullet physics to judge whether there needs to be a second shooter. But I like my theory because getting super close to, and then ultimately avoiding nuclear armageddon is very in-character for the USSR and CIA. Most of the other motivations I&#39;ve read about seem far-fetched to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The answer is pretty simple, and really goes to the heart of the entire JFK subject.</p>

<p>I think most here can agree that Oswald didn&#39;t act alone and that the CIA played <em>some</em> role (depending on your narrative) but let&#39;s for the sake of argument say that LHO <em>was</em> a Lone Gunman who decided to kill Kennedy just because he was a crazy person. That doesn&#39;t change the fact that Oswald was still a former Marine who defected to the Soviet Union <em>and back again</em> only a few years after the execution of the Rosenbergs. Even if <em>all</em> the conspiracy theories around Kennedy are untrue, <em>Oswald was still a defector that re-defected with a Soviet bride</em>.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a paradoxical red flag here. The theory that Oswald was a Soviet agent is probably the <em>least</em> believed one out there. Now, you&#39;re probably saying &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s because there&#39;s no evidence&quot; but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m talking about here. In the context of a time when the Red Scare was so recent that Kennedy&#39;s opponent in the election had been a member of the HUAC, a Soviet assassin should have been <em>the</em> conspiracy on everyone&#39;s lips. It <em>should be</em> the story the CIA wants the American public to believe <em>but it isn&#39;t</em>. Despite all the decades of Reds under the Bed, the idea that JFK was killed by a Soviet assassin is <em>always</em> dismissed in favour of &quot;young crazyman influenced by dirty commies&quot;. Why is that? If Oswald was a Lone Gunman, why would the CIA <em>not</em> push the Soviet assassin theory even as a second or third tier narrative to induce fear while avoiding all-out war? Why is there no popular theory about Oswald being The Soviet Candidate?<sup><sup>1</sup></sup></p>

<p>What was Oswald doing in the Soviet Union? If the CIA was innocent in all of this, we would have had the answer to that question 40 years ago. The CIA doesn&#39;t want us to know what Oswald was doing in the USSR <em>even if it has nothing to do with Kennedy</em>. Surprise, surprise, the documents relating to LHO&#39;s time in the USSR have mysteriously disappeared and won&#39;t be in this upcoming release as they&#39;re supposed to be.  While seemingly improbable, it is quite possible that the CIA is <em>entirely</em> innocent in JFK&#39;s assassination but <em>guilty of something else</em>. In fact, the CIA may be innocent but prefer the public to think they are guilty, or at least complicit, in the assassination because the truth about what Oswald did in Russia is somehow worse.</p>

<p><sup><sup>1</sup></sup> Damn, that&#39;s a good question actually. These were the MKUltra days. I&#39;ve seen serious discussion about RFK but in relation to JFK I&#39;ve only seen it mentioned a handful of times. I wonder if that&#39;s what they&#39;re hiding? Not just the timing of the &#39;events&#39; make sense but the sequence of Senate Hearings do as well. If there was an MKUltra connection with Oswald, <em>even if not with Oswald and Kennedy</em>, then the path opened by the Rockefeller Commission would have led straight to the HCOA... which didn&#39;t get full access to documents under question.</p>

Maybe the files that get released will be fake.  There is no end to the possibilities that could derail this.</p>

<p>The government assassinated its leader, documents proving that will never see daylight.  LBJ, Bush Sr. could have been in on it.</p>
