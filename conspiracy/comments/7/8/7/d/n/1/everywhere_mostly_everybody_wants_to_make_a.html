       Just read this comment by "otherulrich" on Benjamin Fulford's site, and I think it's well worth sharing. It's in response to a person asking the general public to discern between Jews and the Jewish Mafia (or Zionists).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This “generalization” approach in language obviously is part of the general scheme for brainwashing the entire world population.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have visited many countries on this planet, and I can say that everywhere, mostly everybody wants to make a living and live in peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        It’s the media that tells us otherwise:
       </p>
       <p>
        Mind you, it’s not “the Americans” that start one war after another, but a small, criminal group of people that have manipulated enough others into thinking that’s the right thing to do. Most Americans want peace. But that doesn’t make for a great headline.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mind you, it wasn’t “the British”, “the Germans”, “the French” etc. etc. who committed countless atrocities, but always a small mafia that had hijacked the power structures of those unlucky countries and then lied, bribed, threatened and murdered at will to stay in power.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current mass media are part of the system, and they try to make everybody party to the crimes of a few. Much of the world’s population is caught within a kind of “Stockholm syndrome” situation, as they still trust, or at least not contradict or counteract their corrupted, often “democratic” governments.
       </p>
       <p>
        The manipulation of language goes even further. If you look up the actual meaning of words like “semitism”, “fascism” etc., you will find they have little to do with what most people believe they mean. This is likely by intentional manipulation. Just like the “war criminal / freedom fighter” paradox – one’s “war criminal” is another man’s “freedom fighter”.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact is: As long as we are dumb enough to chose one of those two sides, we engage in the struggle, and the real culprits laugh in the shadows, as again, they have turned two people against each other to do their dirty work for them. The same goes for voting. What was ever achieved by that? We don’t need to vote for one party or another within the same crooked system, but take apart and re-build the system, as it is flawed and allows for unlimited corruption.

       So true. Personally, I work with Democrats and very few Republicans. I may be the only one. But that doesn't mean they hate me and that doesn't mean I hate them. We are friends and while we might not see eye to eye, that is fine because mutual respect trumps meaningless political alliance. They try to over hyped politics because that is literally their only way of controlling the people en masse.

       As Shapiro succinctly stated, culture wars matter, political wars do not. The politics of the left, more than any other single cause, is creating the culture war.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can say divide and conquer, two sides of the same coin, blah blah blah all you want, but most people can't think in such a nuanced way. Ergo, politics have brought us the idiocracy.

       Well, a republican was in office when it landed, but it was conceived long before that, so I think that's a pretty superficial argument, especially when you consider that Obama directly extended it.

       I wave away the "fact" that the "right passed" the Patriot Act because it was designed to be implemented regardless of who was in. It wasn't a bipartisan piece of ... whatever constitution-violating-piece-of-shit-document-law-legislation-thing.

       You talk about being obtuse to left/right but you are only pushing the point that only the left takes away rights when that’s clearly not the case, otherwise the right would’ve voted against the Patriot Act. Both sides are complicit.

       Oh so this is just a culture bashing argument. Got it. Makes sense as to why you won’t hold the right accountable for any of the things they’ve done, but want to bash the left for things that haven’t been done (since legislation and politics are not at play here). 
Sorry for my reading comprehension but you didn’t exactly make your ‘culture’ argument clear. (And I’m not sure how you entirely separate the culture from the actions, but whatever)

       I'm really not sure about a constitutional convention right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The way I see it, there are, in our time, a few very powerful hands on a few very important "levers" in government, the economy, and the media. If "the people rise up", enough to instigate a constitutional convention, then there is a giant risk of the usual political judo whereby grass-roots enthusiasm is channeled into doing the bidding of a corrupt but well-placed few.
      </p>
      <p>
       ALEC is a prime example of what I'm thinking of. But in the case of a constitutional convention, those efforts would get ten times worse. (Lordy, the amount of resources/money/influence that could be thrown at "our" reps, at such a convention, by regular old corporate lobbying, rogue deep-state cabals, and foreign powers... It boggles the mind).
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO, I see our job right now as "holding the line". I think we need a couple of generations of slow change in the right direction (money out of govt, remove gerrymandering, reverse voter suppression... all of which will eventually create a positive feedback loop with elected officials, less lobbying, better Supreme Court appointments, which will further improve the situation with lobbying, voter suppression, gerrymandering, and on and on).

       That is a valid position and I see the wisdom of it. I just don't think we have the time to play a long game like that. And not to say that a constitutional convention or move towards some other form of independence would be perfect or utopian. Far from it if history is any indicator. But I do think it is worth trying or at the very least exploring the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider: How would you update a constitution to adjust for modern times? The founders of the US had the Magna Carta and other such documents for inspiration but had to devise something new to adapt to their times. Now, with the advent of mass transit and world connectivity through the internet (as well as the rise of the corporate leviathans), I think it is time for us to again form something that can adjust to our times.
      </p>
      <p>
       In a slow climb out we would have to battle a well entrenched, well oiled, super well funded machine whose only desire seems to be self perpetuation. I would rather we break that machine and build something better than attempt to turn it around. But that is just my opinion.

       True, but one should not go into it expecting that to happen. Anyone can be blindsided. If they are too good an expert to chop then maybe we should consider a different tactic or three.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that this could be corrupted and I get that it could turn out worse than it was before, but I also don't see the long route going where we need it to. The long route can be usurped just as easily and people could also loose sight of the goals over time. How many generations in before people forget what the point was?

       There is only one way to find out and we shouldn't adopt the mindset that it won't due to corruption. What if those gates were opened and the best case scenario happened? Many believed legalizing marijuana would lead to social upheaval and collapse, yet Colorado seems to be doing fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       One good way to combat (though not eliminate) corruption in a constitutional convention would be
       <strong>
        full
       </strong>
       transparency. The money trail could be easily followed by any and all contacts and relationships (business wise) could be traced and followed. Curious which people and organizations a person represents? The info would be provided without request or fee.  Of course my idea would really work best if we educated and not indoctrinated our citizens. That is a hurdle for another conversation.

       I absolutely believe that could happen because I
       <em>
        have

       been paying attention. It is because of this that I don't think your tactic is entirely viable. Some change perhaps on a small scale and/or in the short term, but not the kind of change that seems to be needed. I could well be wrong though. Time and pressure will tell far more accurately than my speculation.

       I think there will be 2 main changes that will happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think what will happen is that it will become increasingly difficult to do evil things without it being leaked to the masses, such that one by one people who do evil things will be exposed or resign so that they don’t get exposed.  People are becoming more aware and more sensitive to these things.  They can’t sweep them under the rug.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, we will replace our government with other technologies.  So much of our government is a poor attempt to do things which shouldn’t be undertaken by a top down centralized government.  As they provide increasingly unsatisfactory results, we will build our own organizations that obsolete the centralized ones.  Looking at something like organic foods, you see the centralized government watering down the rules such that undesirable stuff is still in the food, so people will create an organization or several organizations which can provide them more confidence in the food they are eating.  You could also look at something like Social Security/ObamaCare/etc., where we pay an organization (currently our government) some amount of money per year to provide us the service of having a safety net.  These are things that you primarily need a reasonable sized pool of people to even out the risks.  We don’t need the federal government to provide us these services, and once we (en mass) figure out that we’ve gotten an incredibly poor return on our investment, it will likely spur us towards alternative options that are smaller and more responsive to our criticisms.

       While I believe this system has been corrupted, I still think it would be easier to rebuild it than to try and start over. Its not the system that is the problem its the humans that want to find a way to game the system. No matter the system you put in place if you don't take that in to account and stay vigilant in the fight against corruption you will always end up in a cycle

       I'm not sure I see a difference unless you meant "reform" instead of "rebuild". Yes, corruption is always going to be a factor and I don't propose we eliminate it entirely (I don't believe that can be done). But we should should certainly explore methods, tactics, and/or avenues by which we can establish more effective obstacles to corruption. Kind of difficult in a self perpetuating system already hi-jacked by corruption. Sometimes foundation up builds are easier than renovations. ;)

       I've said this for years and I'm sure I'm not the first. We need to get money out of politics. We may never achieve any semblance of altruism from our public officials but as long as people can profit from their public service special interests will continue to Trump public good.

       The solution is not that radical, and wouldn't cause much pain to enact, which is local government run by local citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could leave everything the same (which I don't necessarily suggest) but you could, and basically all your taxes and regulations would be in your own city with you and all your neighbors making sure things are on track.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this doesn't eliminate disagreements, political parties, etc, just trillions of dollars in fraud and corruption and waste and death.
      </p>
      <p>
       All your taxes besides a small percentage for national defense would go to your local community, the laws would be written by the majority, don't like it? no problem, there's a thousand cities that will have a majority that believe largely as you do, so go move there and be happy.

       Oh God not that quack. Please go look at some criticism of Kevin MacDonald. His work is not scientifically sound by any measure, and he misrepresents others research for his narrative. The Culture of Critique series is a classic case of propaganda.

       Its GLOBAL control of all media, finances and military industries. Its no easy feat. Even the ~8000 have thousands and thousands of minions who work for them, usually being fully aware of what they're doing but then doing it anyway because of money.

       Your interpretation of making a living and live in peace is entirely too much on the rosy side, when in fact the social interaction amongst species of this world consists of a full spectrum of drives, urges, predispositions, needs, cravings ... of which emotions are a secondary expression to satisfy the former. The truth is that when animals get frustrated or are in need of something, they are capable and liable to commit heinous things. It all depends on the moral compass, conditioning and values of the observer too.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd say that in a world where 8 billion walking shit factories are competing for limited resources (jobs, friends, partners, offspring, distractions etc etc. too!) you get a color spectrum that's every shade between dark burgundy red and pitch-black darkness. All the rest is just naive at the very least, but likely just way more like charades and strategy fore the organism to get what it wants, which becomes ever more and is needed with as little effort exerted as possible.

       They can be killed. We are being fooled by them into believing it is wrong to kill parasitic organisms. If that was true, there wouldn't be human bodies at all, or even small animals.

       Identity politics.... We have to rise above this. Refuse to be anything other than a loving individual and nationalism will die... so will religion, racism... make all the isms mean less to you than love and they will lose the power to divide.

       nope. it obvious that different populations of people have different genetic and cultural influences.... I'd say that in the real world, no two people are equal. 
BUT we are going pretend like 9/11 was a Muslim attack on America, Israel is our friend and that we're all the same..... in the name of social justice. It will kind of be like we all got lobotomies, except we'll all know that we are lying to each other and only going along with everyone else to avoid public shaming, imprisonment and or massive fines.

       This is why I don't like to have any political affiliation, pigeon holing myself into a particular way of thinking feels so limited to me. I try to vote for the lesser of two evils in most cases and I'll just say that it usually doesn't matter, it's the illusion of choice and no matter who we vote for things will not change with the current two party system. I agree we need to tear things down and build them from the ground up, right now it's all about power over the people instead of power for the people and there's so much divisiveness that you can't go into a single reddit thread without mention of somebodies political affiliation usually followed by some ridiculous argument that devolves into name calling and further divisiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally hate it because I know there are good people on either side and sometimes those good people because rabid towards each other because of the current political climate. I wish we could all agree that our current system is shit and unite as a people to push for change but honestly I don't see that happening, it's sad but I just don't see it because most people think that they have no power to change anything, myself included. It's a true statement as well, us as individuals cannot change anything, we have to do it together and it's just hard for me to envision that happening right now. I just hope something happens in the next 10 or 20 years before my son becomes an adult so he doesn't have to deal with the same shit.

       They say it's a semantic shift, when a word comes to mean something else through popular usage, but there is something else, like when the definition of the word
       <em>
        fascist
       </em>
       was altered on all online dictionaries last year so as to avoid pesky political ramifications for HRC and pals.  I like to call that "something else" a "semitic shift", personally, and not because "yer a Nazi!!", but because, when you trace those suspect shifts, they seem to all stem from one single group of people, namely, Jews.

       Peace is an illusion.  We will never be at peace until humans change their very nature.  There currently exists no system of society and government that does not place one man above another, and until then we will always face strife between the haves, the have nots, and those that want more.  We must rid ourselves of kings and nobles and bankers and politicians and investors.

       So you just hand wave away the fact that the right passed the Patriot Act? They have no responsibility for their own actions because a Democrat extended it?

        How would you update a constitution to adjust for modern times?

      <p>
       Agreed that there are myriad ways to update the Constitution to the benefit of regular folks.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        But would they win, if we opened those gates?

       We got "healthcare reform" under Obama (ACA) that ends up as a giant gift to the health insurance industry...
      </p>
      <p>
       We got "anti-terrorism" under Bush (PATRIOT act) and Obama (NDAA) that gives government more power to spy on you, and a giant business boom to thee military industrial complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ways that "The People's" needs get turned around, upside down and reversed, on the road from the original idea to the final result, has many causes and factors, band I am not confident a Constitutional Convention is safe from similar machinations.

        I would rather we break that machine and build something better than attempt to turn it around.

       It's a great idea. But an expert can take your karate chop and bend your force into punching
       <em>
        yourself
       </em>
       in the balls in the blink of an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a constitutional amendment that
       <em>
        reinforces
       </em>
       lobbying. If you don't think that could happen, I'm not sure you've been paying attention to the last 30 years.
