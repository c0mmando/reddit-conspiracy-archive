        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">30</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-10-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/murderalaska.html">murderalaska</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="http://johncostella.com/jfk/intro/">Here</a> is the quick low down on John Costella&#39;s findings about the Zapruder film. Costella has found anomalies with the Stemmons sign, a fast forward anomaly, issues with the blur in the film, a lamppost in the z-film that also doesn&#39;t obey <a href="https://photographylife.com/what-is-distortion#pincushion-distortion">pincushion distortion</a>, as well as issues with JFK&#39;s wound not being depicted consistently and the blood in the film being too quick to disappear.  </p>

<p>Costella also has a really great long presentation that&#39;s available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgWmGDBgmGA&amp;amp;list=PLDvVF_GmIaPrRat7yS9WQfvjZL4tdYGy9">youtube</a> that I highly recommend if you are interested in the Zapruder film. It&#39;s from a conference that was held in Duluth in 2003 that also featured <a href="https://youtu.be/17tIST8HWRM">David Lifton</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9b7vPiRGw0&amp;amp;list=PLDvVF_GmIaPon46ctXk69EZK_LBGPhX3m">David Mantik</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_xjLwacXdI&amp;amp;list=PLDvVF_GmIaPpSGgVNyf1wWM34TQjzcEwT">Jack White</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/VJ0s9kspL4g">Jim Fetzer</a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/nOvxcgIjZ4w">David Healey</a>.</p>

<p>Also of interest on this score is <a href="https://youtu.be/J_QIuu6hsAc">this</a> video which features Doug Horne, who was the chief analyst for military records for the Assassination Records Review Board, and his interview with Dino Brugioni who was a photo interpreter at the CIA&#39;s National Photographic Interpretation Center. Brugioni was working at NPIC two days after JFK&#39;s assassination when CIA men brought in the Zapruder film and had Brugioni make copies of the film. The z-film Brugioni saw then was much different than the extant version. Together with the information presented at the Duluth conference about how the CIA whisked the z-film out of Dallas after Life purchased the rights. <a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/USAjacksonCD.htm">C.D. Jackson</a>, the publisher of Life at the time, was behind the purchase of the z-film, had deep ties to CIA including being an active participant in <a href="http://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/operation-mockingbird/">Operation Mockingbird</a>. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks much. I think the alteration of the z-film has obvious implications on more recent deep state events like 9/11 to cite but one example. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was just watching the zapruder clip that was posted here yesterday and was thinking that it looked different from the version I saw decades ago.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna scour the internet and see if I can&#39;t find an old source.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Would love to hear obviously if you find anything. JFK reseachers <a href="https://youtu.be/wRhcQI4tFTI">Rich Dellarosa</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/1WMOvsPm0Hk">Greg Burnham</a> have also claimed to see an earlier version of the Z-film that included a limo stop and much more gore after the fatal headshot on JFK.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Zapruder film is obviously manipulated in a number of ways, but this is the big one ...</p>

<p>There were multiple shooters. There was the neck shot, and then there were the head shots ... yes shots ... he got hit in the head by two different snipers at almost the same time. That&#39;s what&#39;s being covered up.</p>

<p>Everything else can be explained away, but getting him twice in the head within a second? No sniper can do that, it&#39;s gotta be multiple gun men. That&#39;s why the weird head movement, weird spray, and the weird look of that frame.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you listen to the z-film symposium videos there&#39;s a lot of info about how they could&#39;ve altered the film with optical printers and other technology of the day. David Healey goes into this as he has expertise in that area and Costella&#39;s talk, while it doesn&#39;t focus on this aspect, also touches on how he thinks it was accomplished.</p>
