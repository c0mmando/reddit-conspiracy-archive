        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Everything in the US public school system(personal experience) seems to purposely make math and science super boring and harder than it has to be for the smarter students. Many group projects are assigned, and generally groups are chosen by the teacher, who puts 1 smart kid in a group of dumb kids. The smart kid does all the work and the others get a free grade. Then there are the artistic assignments in math, which are always graded in a biased way against smart kids. Another example of this would be how the class material is designed to be monotonous, and since smarter kids generally are more likely to have ADD/ADHD it makes them hate school. 
Is this an elaborate plot to silence the smarter kids in an anti-intellectual culture, or is this just some Reddit post coming from an annoyed A+ high school student(I legitimately don’t even study and am taking 2APs as a freshman and my school is super hard)?</p>

<p>Edit: I didn’t expect as many upvotes and views, and especially the good answers . Thank you guys so much. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The system in the US is seriously dumbed down. I did most of my early schooling in another country and skipped 2 grades when I got here. I also got in trouble a lot because it&#39;s incredibly fascist. Most classes discourage participation and teachers enjoy acting like dictators. I ended up dropping out. That was almost 20 years ago and now there&#39;s sjw teachers and common core crap, it&#39;s truly awful. Might&#39;ve been the school I went to but that seems to be the experience of many people I&#39;ve talked to.</p>

<p>1: Lots of smart kids burn out and get horrible grades</p>

<p>2: those that do not burn out get their creativity killed and are wired to follow orders directly.  </p>

<p>&quot;Lots&quot; is a strong word. I&#39;ve seen a lot more dumb kids burn out harder than smart kids burn out, at least in high school. Might change in college.</p>

<p>Depends on your school, classes, and teachers.</p>

Kids basically only learn to pass a test and not to actually learn the applications of their knowledge and actually retain said knowledge.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean the parents don&#39;t make the standards of the school. These teachers jobs literally depend on getting their students to pass xyz exams and not actually learn meaningful shit. The problem with focusing education to pass a test is you get a bunch of morons who can&#39;t draw connections and actually think for themselves. They are trained to be sheep, not a good precedent to be set.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your post has a little too much elitism than I would prefer (regardless of whether I perceive myself as one of those smarter people)</p>

<p>but I think most of what you&#39;ve said has a solid argument.
But I personally believe the conspiracy is not to crap on smart kids, but to crap on every kid.</p>

<p>Big class sizes, boring teaching, memory based bullshit, etc. 
Try not to take it personally like a smart vs average vs dumb kid thing.
It can become a slippery slope with that type of thinking.
But yes I believe the education system is deliberately rigged in multiple ways that kill critical thinking, creativity, innovation, etc.</p>

<p>Everyone learns differently and yet we&#39;re all taught the same crappy way.
Then there&#39;s the whole thing about the &quot;drugs, sex, money honey&quot;
music industry, violent/gorey Hollywood, processed foods, pesticides and GMOs, air pollution, WiFi/cell phone radiation, etc. etc.</p>

<p>The elites don&#39;t want smart workers. They want slaves too dumb to question authority, and just smart enough to operate the machinery. (A paraphrase of George Carlin&#39;s words).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And its not just in HS either Universities are now starting to do this as well with the exception of a maybe a couple of my professors. For example when i took discrete math the first time with a teacher who did nothing but who would just literally read from our textbook and write stuff on a overhead and didnt even try to make sure that anyone understood it and this would go on for 2 hours at a time. And she made our 3 tests we had for the whole semester a whopping 90% of our grade. and whenever i went to ask questions she would subtly put me down and assumed im just not paying attention.  </p>
