        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>right now there&#39;s a surge of new accounts miraculously reaching the front page whether its a joke, a meme or missinformation, on the front page is an anti trump post sitting at <del>28.7k</del> 31.4k and counting upvotes from a 11-day account, ok seems normal to most, upon checking his post history you can see multiple posts a day to the typical front page subreddits the last 11 days most if not all with no value added to the thread posted, just vague answers and sentences that provide no insight at all, his longest post was x-posted to ~4-5 different subreddits which is about his impression on Kimi no wa wa, in his post history there is even an inquiry on piracy on how to (in his words) &quot;How do I get illegal passport of the United States of America?&quot; a lot of feeding trolls to spark conflict and every the majority of posts he made have been removed as is standard procedure when &quot;ageing&quot; an account. The cherry on top was his response when I called him out for being a shill he responded with <a href="https://imgur.com/a/c4Szd">this</a>
and a clear search through his history would show random strings of text not relevant to the topic the majority of time, I would like to point out that these new accounts make it to the front page with relative ease and if you couple that with the video removed from <a href="/r/videos">/r/videos</a> where a guy was basically boasting about paying his way to the front page and that reddit is compromised... it makes sense with its popularity and simplicity that you can just purchase <del>propaganda</del> advertisement for anything and everything, remember around the time before Archer: Vice came along there were stickied ads all over reddit announcing the return? What about the sudden surge of Rick &amp; Morty posts prior to the sauce being re-released? shills are everywhere and in full force, this website along with other places invaded with cancer would be better off with bio-metrics required for access with a failsafe that would burn your retinas or paralyze your fingers/hand if misused.</p>

<p>tl;dr    new accounts that reach the front page are not coincidences, most if not all are paid to reach the front page and push some agenda with the cover that &quot;reddit is filtered in a way that no fake news would really be at the front therefore if its on the front page it must be real&quot;</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/wO7Xi">more removed posts</a>      </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Funny thing is, if one wanted to, they could totally interpret it in that way lol. That&#39;s the whole point of shills, IMO. Muddy the waters to  where no one knows what&#39;s real or not, who is a shill vs a newbie, who is engaging in good faith and who isn&#39;t. It is the intentional destruction of Free Speech on the internet. </p>
