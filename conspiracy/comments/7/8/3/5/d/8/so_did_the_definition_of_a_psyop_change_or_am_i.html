        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I remember when I first came on to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, one of the first terms I learned was psyop, and it didn&#39;t take me long to Google what it means.</p>

<p>However, I had accidentally done a &#39;quick search&#39; of the word, (which, on a MacBook, happens when you &#39;force-click&#39; on a word), and... I didn&#39;t see the definition of psyop.</p>

<p>Which is funny, because when I remember the definition of it being easily accessible, and it was the Wikipedia-made definition. Which is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Psychological operations (PSYOP) are planned operations to convey selected information and indicators to audiences to influence their emotions, motives, and objective reasoning, and ultimately the behavior of governments, organizations, groups, and individuals.</p>

<p>The purpose of United States psychological operations is to induce or reinforce behavior favorable to U.S. objectives.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But that definition doesn&#39;t show up anymore; as a matter-of-fact, a new definition that now appears on Google (course courtesy of &#39;Military.com&#39;) seems to be the first result I see when I want to search for the definition of the term &#39;PsyOp&#39;...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>PSYOP is the dissemination of truthful (sic) information to foreign audiences in support of U.S. policy and national objectives. Used during peacetime, contingencies, and declared war, these activities are not a form of force, but are force multipliers that use nonviolent means in often violent environments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Has anyone else noticed this? I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m late to the game.</p>

<p>edit: I encourage you guys to read the full definition of the term.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to encourage everyone to read the full definition on the website, as it is much longer. It seems as though they want us to think that PsyOps don&#39;t happen in the US, when we all know otherwise.</p>

<p>Some key sentences that kind of seemed really suspicious to me were:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Psychological Operations are a <strong>vital part of the broad range of U.S. political, military, economic,</strong> and <em>ideological activities</em> used by the U.S. government to secure national objectives. PSYOP is the dissemination of truthful information to <strong>foreign audiences</strong> in support of U.S. policy and national objectives. </p>

<p><strong>Persuading rather than compelling physically, they rely on logic, fear, desire or other mental factors to promote specific emotions, attitudes or behaviors.</strong></p>

<p>Both tactical and <strong>theater-level psychological operations</strong> may be used to enhance peacetime military activities of conventional and special operations forces operating in <em>foreign countries.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is really disturbing. They&#39;re admitting that they do, well, exactly what they do, and not without being deceitful and leaving out the fact that they use PsyOps in the US.</p>

<p>Can anyone else think of a &quot;theatre-level&quot; (keyword: THEATRE) psychological operation that&#39;s happened?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>google used to give the proper definition of fascism as being corporate run/influenced gov bent on fascist ideals and dictatorship like rulle etc. </p>

<p>Then it was a definition devoid of corporate definitions and more aligned with nazis. </p>

<p>Now this is what it gives me: Fascism is a way of ruling that advocates total control of the people. ... Fascism comes from the Latin fascio, meaning “bundle, or political group.” In fascism, the people are looked at as a bundle — one body that must be controlled by the government with absolute force.||</p>

<p>So either google is loosing its processing power, or the might that is google is changing their internet to what they believe it to be true. Hence why sudden shift in things liek this, as google is a US company and US had years of bad laundry become public. Internet is global so its important to keep it off there, as the US international approval and politics are taking a dip. </p>
