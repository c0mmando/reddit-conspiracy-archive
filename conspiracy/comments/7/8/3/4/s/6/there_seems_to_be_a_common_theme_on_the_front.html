<p>Then the top comments of each post is about how wonderful they were as presidents or &quot;look how cute W is&quot;. It&#39;s a pretty blatant and shameless PR campaign and of course Reddit is being used as a propaganda asset.</p>

<p>And of course the one former president in attendance that might actually be considered a good person, Carter, is completely absent from the front page.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is because we are seeing the union, once secret but not blatant, of the Centrist Establishment of both parties. This is an excellent time to showcase it. My fear is that we will get an American Macron come 2020, who will take the husk of the Democratic Party&#39;s infrastructure and donors, align with the Republican centrists, destroy any chance for a candidate like Bernie to run and form a new Centrist party to take on Trump. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He will never have my vote. I almost hope we runs so he can feel the pain of rejection from the American People. I don&#39;t think Zuck could beat Trump, and if he ran against Bernie or someone similar to him in a Democratic Primary he would be shown for the fraud he is, but I agree. If a new centrist party is formed, Cuckerberg is an excellent fit for them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie chose HRC as he believed she was the lesser of two evils and could advance his agenda better had she won, though there were many reports that he had grave doubts she would be able to. He fought the Primary all the way to the end in Cali and angered Clinton and much of her inner circle in doing so. By endorsing HRC he has ensured the Party can not &quot;Nader&quot; him by blaming him for the loss, and has come out politically stronger. HRC attacks Bernie more in her new book than she does Putin, which says a lot.</p>

<p>In addition, Bernie founded Our Revolution which as an organization has helped take 8 state parties from the Democratic Establishment and put them in the hands of Progressive citizen activists- these are real, tangible victories. It is because of these reasons I don&#39;t think Bernie sold out or betrayed the cause. Even now Democrats are grumbling that he isn&#39;t formally a party member...they fucking hate him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie believing Hillary is the lesser of 2 evils is a huge problem.  The dems have better &amp; younger talent like Tulsi Gabbard.  As long as there are superdelegates there is absolutely no reason for anyone to have anything to do with the Democratic party.  Bernie&#39;s role is to take people who have good intentions &amp; lead them to slaughter.  Donald Trump just mentioned today people have been telling him to end the Fed.  Bernie wants to tax the shit out of us.</p>
