<p>Not to me. Investigations involving child abuse should be lengthy and have a lot of caution to make sure nobody is wrongfully convicted. A false conviction like that could ruin people even if it were proven false publicly. On top of that, it&#39;s similar to the drug war. They&#39;re not as focused on the little  fish as much as the big ones who produce cp or have large amounts of it. So making sure every part of their investigation is extremely thorough is important. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But what do those employees do and what are their qualifications? I&#39;d put a few bucks on the fact that at least 6/10 of them or more are administrative or tech positions. A lot of them are very likely just regular jobs. They just happen to be for the FBI.</p>

<p>But what are the other 10 things they&#39;re looking into? Obviously some things are more important than others. For all we know something else takes priority.</p>

<p>For the record I don&#39;t disagree at all. Just playing ball for the conversation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well honestly I think this is just a ridiculous conversation to have.

<p>So what? We might each have an interesting perspective on the topic. Which to me is worth talking about. </p>

<p>That plays into my point though. How is it fair to pass judgement on the methods and the frequency of use of said methods when they have x amount of other, and potentially more important things to deal with.</p>

<p>Really nobody but them know.</p>
