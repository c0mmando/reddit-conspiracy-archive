       Was just going through the news feed for the past few weeks and noticed a trend right around Vegas and Weinstein for the fbi to do Pedophile stings. Something they could of been doing decades ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       But isn't it odd that they just seem inept in Vegas in the public's eye, and are now getting their 'good guys' news out to kind of shift the publics suspicion of them?

       The FBI has done an Operation Cross Country every October for like the last 11 years... FBI has been ramping up their pedo busts over the past couple years... prolly as a result of better technology/honeypots/backpage trolling.

       Not to me. Investigations involving child abuse should be lengthy and have a lot of caution to make sure nobody is wrongfully convicted. A false conviction like that could ruin people even if it were proven false publicly. On top of that, it's similar to the drug war. They're not as focused on the little  fish as much as the big ones who produce cp or have large amounts of it. So making sure every part of their investigation is extremely thorough is important.

       But what do those employees do and what are their qualifications? I'd put a few bucks on the fact that at least 6/10 of them or more are administrative or tech positions. A lot of them are very likely just regular jobs. They just happen to be for the FBI.

       But what are the other 10 things they're looking into? Obviously some things are more important than others. For all we know something else takes priority.

       Well honestly I think this is just a ridiculous conversation to have. The FBI deals with all sorts of crime across the country, to sit and nitpick to try and figure out what exactly they're dedicating their resources on, which we obviously don't know the true limits of, is just pointless.

       So what? We might each have an interesting perspective on the topic. Which to me is worth talking about.

       That plays into my point though. How is it fair to pass judgement on the methods and the frequency of use of said methods when they have x amount of other, and potentially more important things to deal with.
