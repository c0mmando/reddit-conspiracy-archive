      <p>
       Since some time, I have had some strange symptoms like head-ache, hearing some strange beepings and sometimes getting unconcious. I've had headache before, but this is something completely different; I feel like some sort of foreign, maybe spiky, object was in my head. It was like this for 4 months.
      </p>
      <p>
       I consider myself woke, intelligent, critical. Short: Dangerous for the system. If
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       exist and they have the technology, I would be one of the first people whos minds they would read.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another strange thing: About a week after I got the symptoms, I went over the street without looking, the cars stopped instantly. I walked over the street again and they stopped, too. I stood on the street for minutes and they did not run me over. It was like I was the only thing they focussed on; as if they were watching me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a firm believer in some sort of gangster government that controls the world and has superior technology. It would not be a stretch that they could invent probes to put into peoples brains to influence or read their minds. I believe I might have a device in my head that turns me in some kind of Frankenstein slave, or maybe a tumor.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to the doctor, he said that nothing was wrong with me and that it was nothing. Could I somehow remove the device myself? Thanks ahead!

       Find a new doctor and tell him this story, as you typed it here. Im sure he will help you if anything needs to be removed.
      </p>

       I wouldnt go trying to remove anything yourself, there's too many important bits that will definitely get damaged.

      <p>
       Uhhh so you're saying cars stopped for you while you randomly walked around or stood in the street? Do you have a license or drive regularly because that is what cars do when people are doing what you describe, and yea if you were in the street I can almost guarantee that you were the only thing they were focused on, and yes they were probably watching you as you were somewhere you were not suppose to be.....
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a doctor but it sounds like a horrible case of paranoia, you literally used
       <em>
        "and they did not run me over"
       </em>
       to support your argument? Do you really think it's odd that drivers did not mow over a pedestrian? Most drivers do everything they can to avoid doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe seeking some type of professional counseling to help manage this would be a good idea

       Again, some dumbass walks into traffic and stands there, then yeah, people usually watch the dumbass.

       On a side note, this is some of the most horrible make believe shit I've ever read. In short, you're not being targeted, you're mental. Seek help, before you fucking get run over.

       If you actually believe this ( I doubt it) there are many of us which are aware of the horrible things our government does. This is a conspiracy subreddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would they target you ? Have u spread information that no body else knows about higher up power? ( I doubt it) and if you just an average guy that does his own research about our present world then there you go. Nothing's wrong. Go to a doctor.

       There are 500,000 people on this sub who are into conspiracies and the bad things government/secret societies etc do. There are many ordinary people who research and know the same things you do. So unless you have some kind of information that is not 'out there' already, unless you used to work for or continue to work for some govt agency or contractor and found out some deep dark secrets, or are a popular journalist with damning information and platform on which to reach many many people, I really really doubt that anyone would be doing this to you.
      </p>

       Think back and consider if there's anything that could have made you a target, something very unusual that wouldn't be within the norm for most people. Do you use/buy research chemicals? There have been suggestions that intelligence agencies, for some reason, are interested in people who buy a lot of reseaerch chemicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other than that, the only reasons I can think of for why people find themselves targeted like this, when there's nothing obviously 'different' or threatening about them to TPTB, are: 1. These mind control/gangstalking programs are experimental and as such are totally randomised - they just randomly pick a sample using social security numbers or something. This would make sense if they are running experiments with this stuff, as having random samples are important for experiments. 2. There is something about these people that IS threatening to TPTB, but the people themselves don't realise or know it yet, somehow TPTB can find out about this 'property' or certain individuals and these gangstalking programs are eitehr a way of experimenting or a way of suppressing or damaging whatever it is about the individuals that is threatening. 3. A case of mistaken identity - for some reason they think you're some secret agent who they suspect faked their own death and ran off full of secrets - maybe you look like them and facial recognition picked you up from CCTV, or you have similar voice patterns and phone surveillance picked you up or something of that nature - that is the least likely.

       Obviously the first thing to think about is a mental disorder or brain lesion or tumor. Tell your doctor you're having these experiences and tell them you are worried about your brain. Don't tell them you think you have an implant. Tell them you're worried about a tumor or lesion. Get a scan. If there's some implant in there then they'll come to you and ask you if you've ever had brain surgery before and explain what they've found. If you initially tell them you think you have an implant, then they will most likely assume you are crazy, and if a scan comes back showing something like that, they will be far less likely to identify it as such, because their own cognitive dissonance won't allow them to accept that the story you've been telling them could be real, so avoiding talk about implants etc and sticking to concern about an organic brain issue means you're more likely to get a more objective and rigorous assessment by the doctor. I hope that makes sense.

       Good luck!

       Best practice for you in these types of situations occur is simply ignore it and do not acknowledge their presence, go about your day as usual, do your routine if you have one as if you are oblivious that anyone is watching. (Just blend in)

       Out of all the people in the world - why would you be one of the first they would target for mind reading? I'm really sorry to say this but this is very typical with either acute psychosis or longer-term illnesses like schizophrenia, that you somehow make yourself important enough that some entity would spend loads of manpower and resources just to read your mind out of all peoples minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       In every single case of gang-stalking or similar stories as yours on here, everyone thinks that they are important enough for literally tens of people to spend so much time fucking with their head. Give that a long think for yourself - why am I so special? You will not find a reason, but this doesn't matter with these illnesses because you will rationalize it for yourself in some way.

       I think your foil hat is getting old and thin.  Go out and buy a new box of Reynolds brand, not the cheap store-brand stuff.  Makes those hats last 10x longer.
