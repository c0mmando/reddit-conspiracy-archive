       This is why you rarely every see movies, shows, or news media where people are complaining over money. If anything, you will see someone teaching the masses how to survive on $1200 a month by being “responsible” spenders. Basically, they teach how to suffer successfully.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you pay attention to the faces of all the news anchors, they look calm and happy. They are projecting this message:
      </p>
      <p>
       Yay! I’m so happy to be an American where I am free, rich, and happy!
      </p>
      <p>
       The objective is to trick struggling people into thinking the whole world is doing great but they themselves must be some kind of loser if they are struggling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Movies/shows have many other agendas but the News in particular is the real brainwashing tool. They must drug the news anchors because they seem super human. They rarely make mistakes and have literally razor sharp control over their own fake behavior. It is best to pay attention to their fake, warm smiles, constant eye contact, and ultra cool body language. They behave how people would behave in a world without corruption. They are also usually ultra politically correct to give off a moral appearance. This way, it appears that someone of high moral ground is sending information to the masses out of love. Meanwhile, they lie and manipulate the masses. They are wolves in sheep’s clothing just like that CIA spook Wolf from CNN.
      </p>
      <p>
       To top it all off, Zionists control American media. Americans are kicked to the curb and left out of the process unless they are willing to be good slaves to Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       CNN has been outed as a CIA front but these shameless scumbags continue lying through their teeth live on TV.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has gotten ridiculous. We will need a lot of rope and many lampposts very, very soon.

       Chris Hedges addresses this as part of a bigger cultural problem in "Empire of Illusion".  The American Empire is a hollow shell, spiritually and economically, propped up by fake smiles, pointless Facebook statuses, aggressive police and surveillance, military plunder of foreign resources, and Wall St and real estate speculation.
