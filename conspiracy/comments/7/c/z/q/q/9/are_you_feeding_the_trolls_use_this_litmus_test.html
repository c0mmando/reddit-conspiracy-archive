        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7czzn5/strong_evidence_of_shills_during_the_russiagate/">
         Favorable evidence supporting the existence of shills (photo album).
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The things this user is saying is baffling to you.  So you respond with facts refuting his argument.  Then comes a flippant flurry of dismissive personal attacks on your views along with questions about your (lack of) intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps this fella's had a bad day?  Maybe he's here to sow discontent among those who keep an open mind. There's dozens of reasons why they may be engaging in the latter.  These types are what many call shills.  There are many flavors - fat shills, skinny shills, happy shills and stupid shills.  They add nothing of value, and reply for the sake of amusement or to simply make noise.  Identify who they are and save time not engaging them, but also try to understand, it is almost impossible to pinpoint a motive.  And of course, never directly call a shill a shill.  Besides being against the rules, that will almost instantly wreck your own credibility.  Besides, that is already in their playbook.
      </p>
      <p>
       The test:  If someone seems unwilling or unable to engage in a meaningful discussion, or seem to be defending
       <strong>
        political ideals
       </strong>
       instead of
       <strong>
        provable facts
       </strong>
       , then; look at their post history (4 pages deep) before responding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do they post in r/news, r/politics, r/worldnews?  These three big subreddits are the most obvious tells.  To a smaller degree, TMoR and The_Donald.  Red herrings come from both sides of the aisle.  For those with deep seeded biases towards any entity or party of the establishment, it makes perfect sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you find activity in those places, there's a high probability their worldview is based around fairy-tales and lies.  Or that they have something to gain by investing in these lies.  It's likely they are not worth arguing with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consider how corrupted and censored the above sub-reddits have become and ask yourself, what kind of individual would engage in such a highly transparent and inorganic echo-chamber?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        I'd guess three general groups of people.
       </em>
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        People who want to change opinions (less common in my experience, and usually an exception to most shills)
       </li>
       <li>
        Those who still subscribe to identity politics and will defend that stance until the cows come to pasture
       </li>
       <li>
        People who have something to gain from pushing particular narratives and agendas
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       When someone seems "off" in their responses, browse the history and if you find any of those telltale subreddits, I personally guarantee there's a 90% chance that debating these people will prove no more effective than talking to a wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are obviously always exceptions and I would never discount someone because he or she posts on r/worldnews for example.  When you critically assess the basic quality of their replies along with where they are posting and replying, you yield pretty accurate idea of their intent.

       <a href="/r/games">
        /r/games

       and subreddits from popular online games along with the typical subs.  There does seem to be similarities in the niche subs they use.

       I used to be a converter (1) but not so much anymore. It was during the election that did it - seeing people you thought were legit discerners be swayed by Trump, has definitely made me more cynical.

       Sure.  I meant until that group becomes more aware of the importance the utilization of politics plays in strengthening unrest in the lower 0.001% of the population (Barnays social manipulation), as a means for the ruling oligarchs to directly benefit and widen the economic gap.

       Your “personal guarantee” isn’t worth much to me, no offense.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don’t have to go through comment history, or disregard an opinion based on where they’ve posted before.
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is the content of their reply. Did they engage with your point, or distract?  Did they address your topic, or insult you?
      </p>
      <p>
       A perfect example of this is the right wing media after this Roy Moore scandal, or honestly any scandal on the right. “But the emails!” “But Bill got a bj in the office!”, etc. I’m sure the left does this too but I don’t have a good example off the top of my head, feel free to respond with any examples!
      </p>
      <p>
       Since I’m sure I’ll be called a shill, for the record fuck Hillary and fuck Trump. Can’t wait for trolls to distract from my point and insult me as well, seems very common on this sub

       I generally dislike the idea of judging users simply by where they have posted without regard to what they posted there.  I don't ignore posts by users who have posted in different sub-Reddits just as I don't want to be ignored for posting in this one.
