    <div class="md"><p>Put your faith in God, not men.</p>

<p>&quot;Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you?  And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.”</p>

<p>Thomas said to him, “Lord, we don’t know where you are going, so how can we know the way?”</p>

<p>Jesus answered, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14">“I am the way and the truth and the life.</a> No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.”</p>

<p>Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.”</p>

<p>Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work. Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the works themselves. Very truly I tell you, whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father. And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son. You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, shouldn&#39;t it be possible than that hitting a metal pole does not always hurt? Could this mean that perception is indeed everything?</p>

<p>How can you claim to know, sure you know the names we accepted as truth and we concluded some things are &quot;real&quot;, but there are so many theories promoted by mainstream that now are almost accepted as truths that it is almost impossible to even find the truth anymore.</p>

<p>So many people tried to make the world see it could be better for us all, but why where they &quot;shot down&quot; if they became so big they actually could make a change for the better?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, i see the problem here, you have stopped believing and trust completely in knowing, just like science took over religion.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t you see that mainstream science is actually acting and reacting as a religion and are part of the same game?</p>

<p>Every invention or theory, both in religion and science that has come up in this world has been shot down fast, this while every human would benefit from it. Why would this be done, why would anybody keep humanity from reaching their full potential?</p>

<p>Everything in this world is designed to keep humanety seprerated, in fear, anxiety and bad health, science is part of this and covering this up. Many mainstream religions are also designed to keep people seperated or make people helpless or passive while give away their own powers to something else. Why would you give away your natural powers? Why would some not like it if we find out what we actualy are and capabe off?</p>

<p>Mainstrean science and religions are just as big part of the same problem as money, government, media and education are.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The one and only problem with the concept of questioning everything is that it could very easily lead someone down a rabbit hole. I&#39;ve been practicing this &quot;question everything&quot; ideology for some years now and all I&#39;ve really gotten out of it was a horrible case of suspicion towards everyone and everything.</p>

<p>Granted, suspicions could very well turn out to be true and therefore warranted but the point I&#39;m trying to make is that if we live and die by this idea to never trust anything and question it all then at some point we&#39;re bound to find ourselves alone and distrustful of everything.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a weird kind of double edged sword. I feel like at some point we all have to essentially pick a side and take a leap of faith.</p>

<p>Deleted FB back in 2012 because it was obvious then how it was going to turn out. </p>

<p>The media in general I&#39;ve always been skeptical of. Got rid of television a while back and now I, like many others, have basically crafted my own way of getting the news: Start with whatever google news has to say, or some other generic aggregator, then I check a few different sites from different POV&#39;s to get different perspectives (RT, The Atlantic, The Guardian, Al Jazeera, Breitbart) I like to see what they all have to say. Then I usually conclude it by coming on here to see what the average joe thinks is up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with you that its okay to be skeptical but not overly skeptical because you lose faith in everything. I started with the question everything ideology, I did end up being overly skeptical but I didn&#39;t end up being paranoid about everything, although I almost got to that point. However, I moved on, instead of wasting my time by  just questioning everything, I now question things to see if there true, test theories to see if there true, pursue the truth and not be afraid of being wrong, that&#39;s how we learn and grow by trial and error. We have free will and the capacity to understand how our universe works, the problem is to find the truth of the universe and ourselves. </p>

<p>However there are those who want to keep the truth to themselves to use it as an advantage to those who do not know, for the simple purpose of dominating those who do not know. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand he didn&#39;t literally mean we don&#39;t know nothing and the concept of never being 100% certain about things... but it&#39;s kind of hard to explain that rationale in a title with limited characters. And I agree with your interpretation of hitting a pole hurting, I guess I didn&#39;t do very well at explaining that in my comment though. Everything that we experience is based on our own perception; our own personal truth and reality.</p>

<p>At the same time, applying this philosophy to today&#39;s society, one would assume that not knowing anything would also apply to the media/government/politics and how things are portrayed. My main point is that none of us knows the real truth about what&#39;s going on behind the scenes, and we&#39;re all just doing our best to interpret truth from fiction based on the facts presented and our own perception of them. There is no black and white in areas of politics, and there&#39;s definitely not always a right and wrong side. It&#39;s a lot more complex than that. Socrates said this after going on a journey to discover the wisest man and found that the people who are deemed to be most wise in society, aren&#39;t anywhere near as wise as they think they are because their self righteousness and arrogance prevented them from looking beyond their existing knowledge. </p>

<p>I find issue with the self righteousness of all sides that come here and wanted to humbly remind everyone that we don&#39;t really know anything at all</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Relevant quote from my favorite scientist, Richard Feynman. He said something along the same lines, tho a bit more long winded. I&#39;ve always found it to be a pretty powerful quote.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I can live with doubt and uncertainty and not knowing. I think it&#39;s much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don&#39;t know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we&#39;re here. I don&#39;t have to know an answer. <strong>I don&#39;t feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell.... possibly.</strong>”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand he didn&#39;t literally mean we don&#39;t know nothing and the concept of never being 100% certain about things... but it&#39;s kind of hard to explain that rationale in a title with limited characters. And I agree with your interpretation of hitting a pole hurting, I guess I didn&#39;t do very well at explaining that in my comment though. Everything that we experience is based on our own perception; our own personal truth and reality.</p>

<p>At the same time, applying this philosophy to today&#39;s society, one would assume that not knowing anything would also apply to the media/government/politics and how things are portrayed. My main point is that none of us knows the real truth about what&#39;s going on behind the scenes, and we&#39;re all just doing our best to interpret truth from fiction based on the facts presented and our own perception of them. There is no black and white in areas of politics, and there&#39;s definitely not always a right and wrong side. It&#39;s a lot more complex than that. Socrates said this after going on a journey to discover the wisest man and found that the people who are deemed to be most wise in society, aren&#39;t anywhere near as wise as they think they are because their self righteousness and arrogance prevented them from looking beyond their existing knowledge. </p>

<p>I find issue with the self righteousness of all sides that come here and wanted to humbly remind everyone that we don&#39;t really know anything at all</p>
