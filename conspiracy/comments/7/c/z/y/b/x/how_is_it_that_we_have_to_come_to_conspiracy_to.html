       It's this thing. Ok, so the poster Q on 4chan signed off with that and people didn't really care, then POTUS signed his tweet with it, and it became a link connecting them because, of course, like you, +++ meant nothing to people, until then. Like "oh shit maybe that dude on 4chan isn't larping for once" type of deal.

       I think that Q didn't really deify Trump, but you did, so I said that I
       <em>
        think
       </em>
       your hatred of Trump blinds you. Could be wrong. I do know for certain that you're not going to get anything out of his threads if you go into it with that attitude, but I'm not certain it's due to hate. Pretty sure, though, if painting Trump in a non-negative light is enough to discredit someone in your eyes.

       He does regularly take time to point out how potus is saving the day, and patriots are to have faith.  None of what Trump has supposedly accomplished was done without massive collaboration of many who have also sacrificed much, maybe even their lives.  Sure, he deserves credit, but he is definitely not alone.

       However, I was pleasantly surprised today on r/news when reading about the school shooting in CA. Most of the comments were not the typical GUN CONTROL!!! They were more like, we need to enforce the laws we have and do better background checks. Logical responses at the near top of the feed.

       Not always. Depends on the thread. Some get shilled hard and all real comments get buried, but most threads aren't vote manipulated that hard. And anything that hits r/all is going to have floods of useful idiots from outside coming in to spout bullshit at us too.

       Media has failed us. Their goal is to keep us dumb and uninformed. It's why they never report on world affairs unless there's a terrorist attack or a plane crash. It's also why the schools are so bad. It's all be design. They want to keep you dumb and distracted. Sites like this show that people are waking up and will seek out what's really going on. We are already in WW3, you just can't tell cuz this world war is an information war.

       Been like this for years now, welcome. Check the most heavily down voted topics / comments, browse /new and you'll have some modicum of truth. Don't be alarmed by the trolls and shills, they come in waves and are actually fairly good thermostats as to when something real is happening, cause that's when the cash flows to the shills.

       Sometimes I sit and wonder what shills are like as people, but then I think about my job in a call center where pay is partly based on commission, and I'm like "oh, right". They're bad people, for sure, but they're like.. They don't even realize it. I always think of that quote by that retarded football player who was like "I'mma get mine before I get got though". That's pretty much the mindset. Total tunnel vision. Unthinking and incapable of caring for more than their immediate friend group/maybe their family. Of all the types of people, those types are the least likely to pick up trash; the least likely to walk their basket to the bin at a grocery store; the most likely to drive enormous vehicles they don't need. They don't think about things in a "what's good for society" type of way. They just think "what'll get me mine before it gets got". Simpler that way. Easier. So very ignoble, though.

       funnily enough, it's more comforting to consider them shills. It's flattering, really, because a lot of people are shilling in an unpaid capacity; shilling for the preservation of their completely retarded reality tunnels.

       I used to cop it heaps (obliquely, of course, coz Rule 10). I stuck around though and, I must admit, hasn't happened for ages. I still get downvotes when I don't subscribe to, or I outright mock, a particular theory that others are passionate about, but I figure that's fair enough. ie: I think it's stupid and/or founded in malice, they feel I'm quashing their pet passion and/or insulting them personally. Blows traded.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do still find myself annoyed by the frequency of shill accusations in general though. It can be very lazy and dismissive.

       Shills and bots are the boogey man. Rather than slamming shills with so called facts that people could use they just dismiss as shill. It does nothing to sway the average reader really. It does however work as a defense mechanism

       I got called a trumpster for saying most of his supporters were just so fed up with the establishment they lashed out in their only way possible, voting for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've also been called a racist for saying something that's racist against a white person is also racist.

       I've been referred to as a Hillary supporter or Soros shill for telling the trump supporters that the topic at hand is trump and to stop deflecting

       I think you’re right it’s a defense mechanism but I also think people have grown justifiably paranoid. There are enough instances of shilling for there to be reasonable doubt when someone is consistently pushing an agenda, information, or narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, I think people have gone way overboard with it and carelessly make accusations with little to no evidence. It’s a shame because this behavior allows them to dismiss other’s opinions without having to consider they may be wrong.

       I always check to see how old the account is and the pattern of their comment history.  When I see a less than month old account, already racking up a ton of karma, and posting aggressive and consistent messaging, always choosing to address the same topics, then I become pretty confident it's a shill.  And I find a lot of them.

       ive been on reddit since occupy started (the number is my badge for r/worldnews bans, and if things werent so hot right now id be making it 7) 
this sort of muddying the waters or diversions have been around since the start, Digg.com set the stage for this to become a thing, reddit just took awhile to be main stream enough to get the real investments in to it before it was as obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think we are probably approaching the point where bots and sock puppets out number the real users in most subs, and its just gotten more and more obvious.

       at the same time their really is a fucked up chunk of society that has lost the ability for rational sane thought entirely, be it from education or just fucked up shit in the water like flynt.

       I'm sure literally thinking "everyone who disagrees with me is a bad person, and must be being paid to be so bad" is the sign of the free thinking non dogmatic mind. Maybe you're the shill sowing d vision and discord, silencing dissent, to strangle the free exchange of ideas. How much are they paying you? I'm disgusted.

       There are other conspiracy forums on the Internet. There is a big one that is basically agreed apon that it's run by the CIA as a place to spread misinformation. Now alot of the posts here that are popular start out on this other big site and then end up here. Why does no one seem to question any of the stuff posted here as being misinformation?

       It's a good question. I think it goes to human nature and political biases for the most part, as much as users here will claim they are non-partisan (yeah, maybe a proportion are, sure. But I believe they are far fewer than the purists or whatever might think)

       People who hate Trump will frequently readily accept a MSM article with no ID'd sources. People who hate Hillary will often eagerly swallow a 4chan LARP that says she is about to be indicted.

       Meanwhile those of us that want to jail all the corrupt bastards on both sides are forced to sift through the bullshit

      <p>
       I made a new account a few weeks ago so I could freely discuss what was going on without friends and family that know my main Reddit account seeing so I can avoid that ridicule. I came here searching for a place to spread information against both sides, for a place to discuss the issues we are facing from both sides. I'm baffled that people that think Clinton is corrupt somehow don't also think a billionaire who was bailed out by the banks owned by the rothschilds/Jews they hate so much is somehow not owned by the Rothschild's and jees they hate so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm baffled that people on the left don't see how their politicians are beholden to the same corrupt corporations our representatives on the right are beholden to. Hello Corey Booker literally voted for big pharma at the beginning of this Congress and people use him as an example of someone that should run on 2020.

       I remember when I saw the post in r/science a few months ago talking about how people who following conspiracy theories have a mental illness. I commented saying how I don't believe many conspiracy theories but the ones that seem plausible always seem to get so much negative response. Then I listed a few reasons why I thought comet ping pong has been a place that promotes sexual abuse to children and even listed why. I tried to make it as easy to digest as possible and it got like 500 down votes.

       I'm learning that downvotes sometimes mean you struck a chord.  And even though they technically "buried" it, each one of these condescending skeptics considered your words and reacted to them.  So the messages do get heard.  I'm trying not to be disheartened everytime I put myself out there and have the hordes come at me with pitchforks and burning torches.  I think it's most important to speak your truth, now matter how controversial, at least in an anonymous forum where there isn't so much fallout into your social and professional life.  In those cases I'm learning "Do not cast your pearls to swine" is often more helpful.  It's not that I'm ashamed of anything I have to say or offer, it's just that I know how malicious the hyenas are, how they can twist your words and try to constantly put you on the defensive.  It's exhausting.  Those people can die in their ignorance.  Peace.

       I remember one comment someone said, they said just because they have band posters with kids in demonic child sex sacrifices didn't mean they were bad. A guy asked "have you ever been in a coffee shop and seen any of the bands flyers?" 
 Uhhhhh yeah dude, I frequent coffee shops and none of them are kids being sacrificed or in a sexual ritual........ 
 That got down voted too.

       So pathetic, that whole idea and response to you.  I really don't know what's going on with our culture.  It's like we're all just a bunch of self-righteous tattle tails out to get each other and expose each others "wickedness".  Just fucking be cool.  Remember how great it feels to rebel, to rock and roll, to spit in the face of conformity, to express yourself as you want, to just fucking be yourself and do you what you want as long as you aren't directly hurting anybody.  All we do is continue to repeat the same mistakes, to repeat history.  I thought we were well past puritanism and witch hunts, but apparently not.  I told a girl the other day, who was criticizing Eminmen for msogynist lyrics and bashing all these other artists for their personal faux paux... I told her that I want no part of the world she's trying to build.  I'm an artist myself.  So many broken people are drawn to art to transcend their own limitations/shortcomings and aspire towards a more transcendant vision.  You know the world is full of shit when they start going after artists for petty offenses and try to discredit their entire worth and output.  I feel so much of the freedom we have fought for, both as soldiers in the field, and cultural warriors on the page, screen and stage, is just being trampled by this high-strung, pharmaceutical gobbling, inexperienced, misinformed, self-righteous, and quick to judge generation.  It really gets under my skin.  But I'm not the only one, and I'm not surrendering yet.

       I'm skeptical about everything. But I do remember when that Comet Ping Pong thing broke, and some found the Instagram of James Alefantis. He deleted the account pretty quickly, but you can still Google a lot of the pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy is apparently some well-known society person in DC, and pretty much every picture was something extremely creepy. A lot of weird pictures of kids, with weird comments left on the side. He had one of himself naked and covered in blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone at your place of work had a social media page like that, people would start talking pretty fast. So I can't say if Pizzagate is real or not, but the dude that owns is definitely a fucking freak.

       I interacted with a shill once early on in the election year. They had posted an anecdote about Hillary Clinton. It was some feel good story about something she did a long time ago and OPs friend told them or some bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem was, the anecdote was not at all relevant to the discussion. So I reply, “wtf are you talking about?” I check the comment history of this poster and they’d been spamming this anecdote all over the place. I should have archived and documented immediately. By the time I thought to, they’d deleted their profile and comments.

       Great points and thanks for the explanation. A huge problem we all have if discerning where reality and shilly larping begin and end. We seem to all know certain things don't add up for sure, but then we can easily get duped to chasing another false paradigm or premiss. And none of us can truly prove it because we weren't there and so have to rely on information from 'experts'. So I really appreciate the interaction with people trying to help others think more critically.

       Hmm, if you've been lurking for a year, you've literally never seen the baseline. This has been the year of the shill.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am going to pretext this by saying I think trump and Clinton are guilty thieving idiots, but basically every story involving hillary that has momentum or any amount of push behind it for the last 3 years, with some digging, will reveal it was a shilled topic. It was very obvious during primaries where you'd see pics of an event that looked packed, view it from a different angle and it had maybe 50 people max...but it went from obvious, to mind blowingly open season , no shame shilling during pizzagate.  We had the full weight of I believe every shilling organization on top of that topic and they still haven't left and won't leave until pizzagate / pedogate ==== bigfoot..it's not even denied that they do it, we've seen the budgets allocated to these organizations,  we've seen leaked slack discussion,  we know the admins don't care....I mean it's not like the idea is new, they just used to be called crises management , or. Public relations teams,  they're spinsters.

       Thanks for the insite. It was really pizzagate that got me back into this shit and more involved on here. You are right, it probably helped to know the baseline and see it change when a certain uncomfortable subject like pizzagate threatens those in power. It is kind of interesting how the bots and shilling instantly correlated with the subject being brought up. They probably had it waiting in the wing for such an event, but I am speculating maybe it gave them a perfect opportunity to test out 'their' new AI-bot/shilling propaganda tactics. Also it seems people gleefully enjoy trolling more than ever which doesn't freakin help trudging through this muck.

       Good points, see the last season of South park? Totally glorified trolling. I find even in real life people are into trolling too much, I work with a bunch of older men and to get them to talk serious about anything that can't be hit with a hammer or requires 4 people to move just ain't all that interesting. Find a old stoner though and jackpot for conversations

       I did see it, and good call at me being a stoner :p Yeah, I think a lot of us can see how douchey people have snowballed into these days- myself included. I think it's helped me to be conscious of trying to be friendly more than ever. I can't even really fault a lot of people for being brainwashed into the right-left paradigm. Just when you think you woke up from one type of social programming you seem to find yourself siphoned off into another type of propaganda.

       Always challenge the official narrative in your head but let the evidence speak for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good example is Vegas. The entire thing has stunk from the beginning. Changes in the narrative. Secrecy around the shooter and his motive that directly goes against every other instance we've had in the past several decades. Motives are released in about 24 hours. A lack of proof paddock even carried a bag in the hotel. A security guard directly involved that was supposedly shot that wasn't anywhere in the state license database. Why someone would use a bump stock when semi automatic fire is more accurate and only slightly slower for anyone that's shot before. A mysterious shot by a swat officer (accidental discharges in the military are punished as a crime why not police?) The huge campaign to discredit conspiracy theorists YouTube censorship.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a bunch of evidence that leads you to believe it's not what they're saying. It could be something like they're trying to protect the nadalay bay from the loads of lawsuits. Or they're trying to shield Saudi Arabia (again).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all up to you to decide. Not every mass shooting is a false flag or conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should also just flat out know both parties are corrupt and accept that as fact so we can move on to fixing things. Don't be a partisan person when it comes to these conspiracies. The longer we fight over partisan political the longer it takes to fix

       I totally understand where your coming from with Vegas. But I don't understand why everyone is claiming some sort of conspiracy just because we the public don't think things add up and there is no proof of alot of the official story. Don't people understand that the public is now owed any sort of proof or evidence of anything that happened? Just because we have no been supply with evidence of what happened does not mean it didn't happen the way they say it did. Of course things are gonna seem strange to us because we are only going on speculation and nothing more. People are gonna find what they wanna find when they are blindly searching for some sort of conspiracy. I know there are smart people in this sub and they gotta understand the points I am getting at. Now I don't know if Vegas happened like they say it did but personally I don't just assume it didn't because we have not been given proof. And I sure as hell don't start looking at grainy photos and videos and reading into them and also believing any person who comes forward claiming things happened differant. I don't get the thinking that because we are in the dark about something means there is some sort of conspiracy going on. Every single shooting this sub goes nuts claiming something is going on. Something can't be going on for every event that happens.

       Your right, many things are being pegged as conspiracy theories these days, and that is because we've had some very big reveals the past year. Weve been shown that conspiracy as a term was invented to automatically discredit people whose idea / narrative goes against the government/corporate narrative. We've been shown that the CIA has participated in taking over our news media, politics,  entertainment, experimenting and spying and drugging  US citizens against their will, up ending governments around the world, controlling politicians through political blackmail. This isn't speculation, this isn't a conspiracy, this is fucking admitted in their own goddamn files CIA FOIA READING ROOM. So here's my advice,  catch up on old hand conspiracies (remember when the conspiracy theorist thought that the government was listening in on all your calls? , they were, they are) then when a news story comes up you will have an idea of the game they are playing (fuck the commoner) , if the news is disparaging someone as a bad evil person,  chances are that man is a saviour. If a health practice like anti Vax is touted as evil? Likely the best thing you can do for yourself. Reality is tipped on its fucking head, history is in the process of making the alternate history mesh with the narrated history. We will land somewheres in the middle

       Cannot emphasize enough that this has been the case for many many years. JFK happened while most here were not yet born, but the vast majority back in 1960's "let it slide" because the Powers That Be said it was a lone gunman. Meanwhile conspiracy theorists wouldn't let it drop for 55 years now, and still at it!

       Truth is hard to kill. I wonder how my years we will hear about some of our day to day conspiracies, there's aspects of the Bush presidency i never thought people would forget, but i am amazed at how many of his moments are now completely gone from public memory.

       Well another aspect is that some conspiracy topics now have their own dedicated communities, so you don't see high level discussion around say the engineering aspects of a UFO because there's several ufo specific subs, and that goes for various other conspiracies as well such as spiritual, paranormal, health, etc.  As long as hillary remains unprosecuted though, I respect the donalds right to be here. The events and people surrounding her ARE a conspiracy. Political conspiracies are fucking HOT right now which is why they have and will continue to dominate discussion, I don't get it.... people will talk for hours about a stupid ball game or puck match, but the biggest game in the world that touches every single aspect of our lives is something we don't have time for. Also I don't care what sub other users come from as long as they can put their ego aside when they enter the door. Also I don't remember the Republicans being near so whiny when assange was leaking all their Iraq war shit. Sure they tried to shut him down but fuck hillary/podesta/soros are goddamned scarrrrrred. I've never seen the kind of outright media control and manipulation as I did during the run up to last election. (Small exception being when ron Paul was running last year, that was extremely blatant)

       Well ya there has been, the Cia , the army, the NSA all have revealed frameworks for controlling multiple social media profiles. Backed by leaks from insiders/Snowden leaks. I've seen various training flowcharts they use to direct conversations. Had a friend who used to work at a call center that deletes/edits comments to remove profanity,  sounded pretty mundane but in hindsight could have been pretty nefarious. People who do these types of things have to sign piles of NDA's so it's pretty hard for them to reveal anything concrete. Nonetheless , evidence is out there.

         To be fair, it's hard to find a place to post some things because the major subreddits like r/news, r/politics, r/videos etc. have such narrow rules about allowable content, that leaves r/conspiracy as a reliable Plan B for content no other sub is willing to host.

       I think its just rich and powerful getting richer and powerful as time goes on. People get delusional, god complex, etc, and they want it all. Censorship and suppression of different views is part of that. Subs like /science or /history censor any thought that is not in the mainstream. It just means that there's someone profiting from them.

      <p>
       This sub has been left alone for the most part because it has huge stigma about "tin foil conspiratards" and all of that. Most people don't see this sub as legitimate.

       One answer is because people conspire to do all sorts of shady things, not least of them being the suppression of their actions. The Internet has allowed for much be uncovered, which can't be had. Most outlets and institutions are already corrupted, so next up is to throw millions of dollars on paid shills to occupy "threatening" forums. Ones that actively thinking freely and looking into people conspiring are trickier for them, because that's exactly what they don't want us doing.

       It’s trending downwards IMO. There wasn’t this much partisan bickering before the election. Wikileaks and the idea of Trump vs Deep State has flipped this sub upside down.

       The world is controlled by groups of people who have secret plans that harm others. Many large governments in particular conspire to kill people and commit other crimes against humanity. Of course r/conspiracy is going to talk about those things. It's unfortunate that other subreddits cover up discussion of these things, but are you surprised? Things are getting better with regards to transparency on these issues, but the world has always been like this, artificially controlled to squash discussion of these issues. We just have to keep pushing back where ever we can.

       Since it is part of their narrative to discredit “fake news” as conspiracies, they, surprisingly, allow most things to be left up.  There is still a good bit of manipulation with upvoting and shills, but at least you get some raw data to filter through as to how it may fit and the possibility of it being accurate. Closest you can get to actual truth on the ground now that we have no free press.

       r/politics and r/worldnews are brigaded by factions. Some days it's just a stream of anti-Trump slather on and on. I'm a left-leaner myself but the "left" today isn't anything I recognize. How many of those purple haired freaks have ever spoken with a blue collar worker? Precious few, I guess. And there's still people out there defending Hillary FFS. The rest of Reddit seems to have turned into pornhub judging by the front page. That leaves r/conspiracy.

       Most of what is talked about on this sub is pure speculation. People like to think they know what is actually going on when making posts here but 99%of everything posted here is pure speculation. So coming here does not tell you what is exactly going on. It only tells you what people are speculating is going on. Everyone likes to think that everything is a conspiracy and I am sure people here are correct sometimes but not everything is gonna be a conspiracy all the time. There are gonna be things the happen in this world that happen exactly as we are told and then there are gonna be times that we are not told the truth. But if you read this sub people seem to think 100% of the stuff going on in this world is not happening like we are told which is just silly. Sometimes people here are gonna be correct but alot of times there just gonna be grasping at anything they can to try and find something that fits the way they think.

       The old media is dying. Now we can converse among ourselves and compare our own information. Before, a small group of people could pump media into every single home. Now, everyone has that same power, and we've realized we've been lied to for a very long time.

       I didn't come here to find answers. I came here to find the questions that I wasn't asking on my own. We are not capable of answering the questions posed by this sub. We don't have the resources, or the access to the proper information. What can be provided here, are the hard to answer questions that no one in the mainstream is answering. The way that WE can affect change is by continuing to point out these unanswered questions until enough people are awakened to their own ignorance, to the point that they demand answers. When we try and answer questions, we make ourselves look like fools ex: the towers were brought down by mini-nukes, the planes were holograms. No one will believe that. When we leave the unanswered questions out in the open, we give ourselves legitimacy ex: why did the towers fall at free fall speed? Why did a building that was not struck by a plane still collapse?

       I'm referencing what my mindset was prior to joining the conspiracy community. What I'm saying is that prior to joining this community, I didn't question these things. I simply accepted what I was told. We are an online community of citizens, speculating on truths that we do not have access to. Or at least that is the case for me. I am personally very curious as to what is going on in Antarctica, and on the dark side of the moon. But to truly know, I would have to actually travel to those places and see for myself. Anything short of that would require a degree of faith. As an average citizen, I do not have the means to travel to these places. So I will never truly know. As it relates to this sub, I believe that the sub should be more than a community of people who enjoy discussing these topics. I believe that we should be a force for change. The only change that we could truly affect would be to awaken the masses. I believe that the best way to accomplish this is not to try and answer our own questions, but rather to demonstrate to the masses just how many questions have gone unanswered. We must awaken their curiosity, and then allow them to become frustrated by the lack of means by which to satisfy that curiosity. Let the masses demand the truth. But first they must be made aware of the fact that the truth eludes them now.

       The word "conspiracy" has been twisted and construed negatively. To make "conspiracy theorists" seem unintelligible and crazy. But the reality is that most people who are on this sub are posting and looking for the truth instead of blindly following along the narrative of the main stream.

       It was cool when conspiracy talk on the internet was about aliens and theory's about weird supernatural-esque shit but now it is just scary that conspiracy talk on the internet is about politics and what is actually happening as it has become taboo to speak open and honestly about certain situations.

       A great majority if the posts here are not what is really going on. Manyof these are just ideas in an echo chamber and actually are not really happening beyond the confirmation bias of this sub. That being said the occasional post has its roots in real life similar to what you read in 4/chan. If this is the only place where you think you can find real info then you may want to evaluate how you look at or find news in the first the place. As in this is an informative place in relation to what?

       Because we live in a world of Mass Deception. Not 'up to our eyeballs deep', more like 'hundreds of feet down' deep. Because 'conspiracy' is not the exception, it is the rule. It is how the 'few' rule the 'many'. This is one reason why it is so hard to discover the truth.

       It's not down the rabbit hole, no.. we are all deep in the hole, it's climbing out of the rabbit hole. Because it's easy fallin in, but it's a bitch to climb out.

       This is the best analogy that I can give you about President Trump. Imagine your house in on fire. It was set on fire by a bad group of people who are out side. In that group there are some people who claim to be your friend. Trump is running into the building and he has promised to help rescue important or valuable things in the fire. People are yelling at him, rescue this or rescue that. Many of these things are easily replaceable or are of lesser value to what he knows needs rescuing first. As he passes these things in the burning house, people are saying you're bad, you're not doing this or you're not doing that Trump. Currently, he is still in the fire and he will exit with an item that saves the house. "It's the insurance policy" to "Rebuild America"! and this is why Conspiracy is the only place to figure out what's going on.

       Research.  We're stuck in a global cabal, under the powers of 3 families. Literally everything we see, hear is controlled. Our Government it not our government. The only part that is ours now is the executive branch. This is not Pro-Trump, this is not Dems vs. Repubs. There are no dems vs. Repubs, its all a big show to keep us fighting. Wake up.
