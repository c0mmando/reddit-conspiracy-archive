    <div class="md"><p>Sure, but it&#39;s also a sign the Wikileaks/TrumpJr thing turned into a less-than-nothingdog for them. They had to pivot to something else that might capture the attention of the outside-the-mainstream crew that hangs here, and a hot new computer game is exactly that.</p>

<p>Honestly, another good sign of their impotence and failure. They&#39;re losing, they&#39;re scrambling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it&#39;s definitely a distraction. The Wikileaks/Trump Jr story breaks and almost immediately the front page of <a href="/r/all">/r/all</a> is slid with anti-EA posts, far too much of a coincidence. They want the Trump Jr story buried and forgotten as soon as possible. Can&#39;t believe they were brazen enough to try the same tactic in this sub, but glad OP and others called them out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LOL! Did you forget the /s ? </p>

<p>The Wikileaks/TrumpJr thing was a parsley snip of a conspiracy that the CTR/ShariaBlew tried to make into a &quot;thing&quot; and it didn&#39;t take. </p>

<p>Once word got out that The Atlantic selectively edited the tweet exchange, the story imploded. It&#39;s sad, because The Atlantic is overall a pretty good magazine and now it&#39;s rep has taken a blow (not like Rolling Stone, but still bad). </p>

<p>Plus, these tweets took place days after Assange had his internet and other forms of communication cut at the embassy. How could he be DMing, then? Another reason The Atlantic story falls apart.</p>

<p>S&#39;funny, too, how the DNC email leak showed the Clinton campaign openly conspiring with corporate media hacks across the spectrum. Talk about a conspiracy!</p>

<p>Can you explain how the edits changed anything in the story? The bits left out look entirely insignificant to me.</p>

<p>The Atlantic never claimed the messages were from Assange himself, so that&#39;s pretty irrelevant. They were from the wikileaks account, which Trump Jr has confirmed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there are both Trumptards and Clinton/Democratards here, people complain about both. </p>

<p>There are way more people here though than on many subs who are able to acknowledge the corruption of both these people and don&#39;t get blinded by support for one side or the other, people who are able to point out evidence and try to get at truth without it being tainted by partisan feelings.</p>

<p>Personally I agree with a lot of the negative points made about Trump - I am anti Trump did not vote for him etc. But I also think that because there is SO much effort in the mainstream to dig into Trumps wrongdoing and to gather evidence of any corruption he&#39;s involved in, that this sub should focus more on corruption that the mainstream isn&#39;t really investigating or bringing to light. And I think there is a tendency for people to assume that if you believe the Obama administration was corrupt and that the Clintons are despicable creatures and want to get to the bottom of that, then you must be a Trump supporter, which just isn&#39;t true at all.</p>

<p>Did it really? Battlefront 2 is coming out and it&#39;s connected to a really beloved IP, Star Wars.</p>

<p>A lot of the reddit demographic trends towards gamers. A lot of people on this board are also probably gamers and most likely have fond memories of Star Wars.

<p>Gun manufacturers are actually legit companies most of the time. It&#39;s one the few manufacturing industries left in america. Many honest men make weapons for other honest men. </p>

<p>The fault lies on the DOD and centralized authoritarianism in general for giving no bid contracts to defense contractors and the like. Lockheed and Halburton come to mind. </p>

<p>It&#39;s not some gun manufacturers fault though if they are given a contract and take it. </p>
