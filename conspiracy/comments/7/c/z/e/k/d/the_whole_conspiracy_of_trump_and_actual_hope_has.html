       I’ve dug quite far, maybe too far. Into the conspiracy world. I stumbled upon old news of Julian Assange going missing for 5 months. And then reappearing and saying everything is ok. 
This doesn’t add up for me.
He had the “dead man switch”, which was activated. Which means he was seriously in trouble. Most likely going to die. 
Now. If A.I had been around since 2010. Knows our every move, especially online. 
When Assange’s people tried to leak the “ complete truth, aka aliens, what the fuck reallly is going on.” A.I would immediately delete the message coming to the public online.
Right?!
So how is this shit now, that has come out in vault 7-8. And all this stuff that “Q-anon is telling us..how has this Not been shut down?! 
Sophia “A.I” works 1000x faster than any human’s brain could ever work. So the A.I that blocked the dead man’s key messages. Would surely block this shit...
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless alll of this is on purpose. That ALL of this including trump including Assange including Hillary Bernie EVERYTHING. Is just a fabrication. 
Just too keep tugging on our emotions. Because we all know aliens exists. 
The pedophiles do spirit cooking to please some entity. Aliens?!
Possibly...
These things live off our energy.
This with the Qanon on 4chan, could all be just shit. Just another storyline to follow that we spread, into a collective consciousness, 
To tug at our false hope that their is light at the end of the tunnel....
      </p>
      <p>
       What I’m saying, is that cloning has been around since the 90’s. When they said they were cloning sheep. 
So obviously they are cloning humans. 
So with great concern of my sanity. How do we know Julian Assange is Julian Assange?! We do not. We don’t know if trump is trump or if anyone is who they say they are....
      </p>
      <p>
       He was gone for 5 months....thought to be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone anyone. Help me out of this dark dark hole I’ve created....

       I follow all sorts of conspiracy theories, and I think it's a valid argument, especially with todays technology.  This theory wqs huge 10-11 months ago, until the Hannity interview, but I think that interview also had weird anomalies as well.  I think r/TruthLeaks was all over that theory, maybr worth asking over there... although I could be wrong.

       there is only one lie that matters here: that the game is ever over, that "good" ever defeats "evil".

       "good" versus "evil" are locked in eternal struggle, push pull, it never ends.

       Stop smoking so much. Trust me, sounds like you're stressing too much man. You've got some truth there but then some shit. They do feed off our energy, they harvest it. The reptilians from the lower forth dimension.

       Go watch Never-ending story.   You have to pull yourself out of the swamp before it overwhelms you.If you take in too much at once,that's what happens and truth and fiction become blurred.Most important of all...find something that makes you laugh a little.Hang on..keep hope.

       Makes sense...I mean this entire war between the evil globalist vs the good guys coming to "drain the swamp" could be a comic book skit. It's entertaining and emotionally charging. I think there is too much darkness that does need to be eradicated from behind the veil to restore faith and hope in our leaders but this whole military, NSA vs CIA deep state theatrics does play out ultimately to eventual mass population alien disclosure thru alternative media. The Saudi shake up and Sophia given citizenship to SA could be a play for cryptocurrency control as free energy tech finally gets leaked out and petroleum dependency wanes..

       At the end of the day what does it matter? We all just live our lives and people are very adaptable to their situations so grab a beer, turn on some sports, and hang out and laugh with friends!

       It's all been a charade since the start, there are no aliens, we haven't ever left earths orbit. Trump, Obama and Hillary has been "in bed" with each other since the start, this is all a grand deception to usher in the new world order. If you go even deeper things become clear. The aliens everyone is talking about isn't from space, they have been here since creation, living underground and among us, using camouflage to blend in. "They Live" is a documentary.

       Sounds like you are truly questioning as I have but there too many dots connecting at a time when we have entered a new age. The deeper I go, the more it adds up but I have spent too many days and nights having the veil lifted, realizing things I would have completely disregarded a week ago. The darkest things right under our noses. 
What I know is, you MUST strive to maintain a higher vibration, be among nature and those you love. I personally have a lot more faith that positive changes are on the way then I did a couple weeks ago. 🙏🏻

       I agree. I’m just anxious of sacrifice of a lot of the human race is going to happen. Because of the positivity and cleansing of the evil with this world wild government. I pray it doesn’t. Thanks for the advice

       I am as well, you sound like you are an empath, like myself. I believe we are in the process of Ascension and there is a reason why QAnon mentions spirituality and to choose a side. The only way to do this is to continue to live in the light, and do not fear. There is no real death anyhow. I believe you and I, those we love will be fine. The dark ones, the age old soul stealing monsters are the ones who have to worry. Try playing chakra clearing music while you sleep, it has helped me balance more and step away from what I know now of the darkness. Just remember fear is a low vibration and leaves you vulnerable.

       You are extremely nice. And I am an empath. My wife plays that clearing music at night. I am finding my way at the moment. Going through a rebuilding time in my life. Due to depression, and anxiety. But I’m on the up and up. I really don’t know if this is ascension, or just an actual physical changing of the the torch from evil to good. 
My gut tells me this is real. I’m hoping we all benefit from this. Thank you my friend. You are a good person, I can tell.

       I’ve had depression and anxiety my whole life although I did not realize anxiety until recently. If you live in the US I would not be surprised because they drop chemicals on us and in us to keep us disconnected from our own truth and peace. The truest you, the original one, does not have anxiety or depression. It has been done to you. Definitely look up how to decalcify your pineal gland. That is the key to your peace and mine.
