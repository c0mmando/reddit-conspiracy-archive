So who, exactly, was manning that account and sending Don Jr. DMs 5 days after the internet cut?</p>

<p>Almost nobody is mentioning this in regard&#39;s to Don Jr.&#39;s messages, let alone that the tone of the messages sounds decidedly unlike Julian&#39;s/Wikileaks pre-October 16th posts.  The entire Wikileaks account has sounded different since then.</p>

<p>Julian Assange has claimed for years that he doesn&#39;t run <a href="https://twitter.com/wikileaks">@wikileaks</a> twitter. Although I&#39;m sure he has access to it.</p>

<p>Julian Assange runs the <a href="https://twitter.com/JulianAssange">@julianassange</a> twitter account....</p>

<p>It&#39;s also EXTREMELY strange that a meticulous person such as Assange does not keep DM of an important communication platform.</p>

<p>Remember guys, this is the guy that audio records any interaction with outside people for &#39;Forensic Journalism&#39; as he calls it.</p>

<p>Finally, that website he sent Don Jr is a honey pot it seems and changed owners a few times since. </p>

<p>(give us your dads tax returns -- it would be good for you -- also make us ambassador ) </p>

<p>I mean this is clearly trolling.  </p>

<p>I fail to see what the issue is.  Is it that WL asked for some info?  Is it that they had a twitter conversation with DJTjr? I mean, what is so out of line here?  It is not like they show he was given access to info that was not released yet -- or even an indication of what would be released.  It is not like they show WL conspiring to hide harmful information about DJT.</p>

<p>Read the tweets.  WL asked for info, WL teased upcoming releases.  </p>

<p>So fucking what?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a few questions about Assange in general that isn&#39;t related to your question but I don&#39;t think it deserves its own thread. Sorry for going off topic.</p>

<p>Is Assange still in charge of things? What happened with all that stuff last October when a bunch of file hashes (or passwords?) were Tweeted, Equidore and John Kerry being 2 of the 3 topics if I recall right. A ton of social media sites were down the day a CIA plane supposedly took off from a London airport that had been shut down for unrelated reasons. Has Assange used his PGP key at all to sign stuff like he used to, since then? What of that weird video where his tie moves through his shirt collar? How about when the Wikileaks acc Tweeted &#39;Help him&#39; barring 1 letter, as a part of misspellings in each tweet?</p>

<p>Wikileaks appears to be operating in the same manor as always. I haven&#39;t seen any reason to suddenly doubt them after last October, but the PGP key stuff and his disapperance for like 3 months leaves me curious about those events. Any comments or links to other info, I&#39;d be grateful for. Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t. I did a few searches and I came up mostly with how to verify your own PGP key.

    <div class="md"><p>My guess - Wikileaks Twitter account is run by multiple people he trusts. This could also be why everyone thought Wikileaks Twitter was compromised when they noticed irregularities in the way tweets were pushed out. When he lost his internet, he still had communication with people like Lawyer and embassy staff and members and Pamela Anderson.aube even folks from Wikileaks org. He could just have asked them to be the messenger..</p>

<p>Also ... Do you think CIA/FBI and establishment knew he was talking to Trump Jr and that&#39;s why they cut him off?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going super left field here- I don&#39;t even know if I believe it, but I am starting to think wikileaks and Assange might be part of the &#39;all the world’s a stage&#39; motif. All of this plays out like a dramatic movie. If wikileaks or anonymous was seriously a huge national security threat they would just shut off their websites I would guess? It sure gives them a lot of publicity just like how MSM pulls stunts to get their publicity. If I made a website selling gucci bags I would get shut down instantly. Definitely borderline retarded and crazy but just testing out this line of thinking..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well... They also have back-up plans for when they do have their internet shut off. They&#39;re phones can be tethered... There are a lot of other options other than: One of the worlds most renowned systems security analysts being unable to get some internets :P</p>

<p>The argument wikileaks didn&#39;t have internet is invalid. Within hours of NOT having internet, they had internet. Use your noggin folks.</p>

<p>Keep going Julian.</p>
