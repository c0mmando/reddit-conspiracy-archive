       Seriously, food prices keep going up and wages stay the same. Something's up. Either the dollar is toilet paper in value by now, or its a concocted plot to make everyone broke AF and check to check.

       Dollar collapsed a while ago. They’re just printing money since the recession. Inflation is rampant but they redefined it years ago and no longer report on it accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pretty sure when the history books are written 100 years from now if we don’t destroy the planet before then, they will consider 2017 to be around the start of WW3. The inflation, cost of food, low wages, etc are a result of economic warfare between the US and the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We enforce our dollar with military power, it’s a fiat currency with no value system behind it anymore.

       Maybe that's the case in the US, but definitely not in Canada. Fresh, healthy food is expensive in comparison to unhealthy food.

       Provide some prices.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just cant imagine the price of dried beans or canned beans and fresh onions/carrots is more expensive than shitty food. I've never been able to find it in America. It doesn't even come close. a can of chick peas is like 70 cents and has way more nutrition than anything else you can buy for 70 cent. Spend 20 bucks on spices that will last you a year and you'll never been  unhappy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly I can buy a bag of frozen broccoli, spinach or kale for under 2 dollars. That's a great meal. Season with a little grated garlic and nutmeg. Perfect.

       I know every time I'm south of the border, I'm awed my how cheap groceries are in the States. But then restaurant food is cheaper too. So your point probably holds up. Wish I didn't hate the texture of beans so much.

       Eating out of cans is fresh and healthy? No thanks. It's nasty and not fresh in my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try eating a healthy salad 3 to 4 times a day, everyday, then tell me how much your grocery bills is. Tell me if you get the proper nutrition eating chick peas and canned beans. My wife and I fill our cart with fruit, vegetables, meat, etc and our bill is $200 - $300 every single week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compare that to when we ate out of cans, frozen pizza, hot dogs, cheap stuff, we were living off of $100 - $150 a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is cheaper to eat out of the frozen section at Walmart than it is to eat Fresh! I know this because I travel and have to eat on a budget for work.

       Those 3 frozen items you listed are $1.77 each at Wal Mart and about $2.50 at Metro here in Ontario Canada.

       You just need to eat them more often. The only reason you have gas is because your gut flora isn't used to breaking down fermentable carbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also look for epazote AKA mexican oregano. Aside from making any Mexican dish taste better, it has been proven to reduce the gas produced from eating beans.
      </p>
      <p>
       It actually tastes great unless you have one of those super taster genes. Then it tastes like Lysol.

       I figured this out in my 30s. I have $40 food money for the week and need to feed myself and my kid. I don’t take food stamps or assistance so we’ve got $40 to cover food for 4 days.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could get about 3 full meals (for two of us so 6) at mc Donald’s and supplement with ramen. This was my 20’s.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I buy pasta, some chicken breast, hamburger meat, etc and keep my kitchen stocked with basics. I can cook and it’s healthier, cheaper and lasts a lot longer. Plus leftovers. 😁

       It might seem cheaper in the short run to pop in to a McDonald's, but it isn't. Preparing your own meals is and always will be less expensive.

       No, not where I'm from. It's cheaper to eat out of the frozen section than it is to eat fresh healthy food. In talking to people though, our definition of healthy food is different. People are confusing what I am saying with what the OP is saying. I'm saying healthy food is expensive compared to shitty food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some peoples definition of healthy food is canned beans. No thank you. I prefer beans that come straight from the ground into my mouth. That is fresh and healthy.

       Why are you comparing fresh food to fast food? It's about healthy food. Just because you can't eat fresh veggies and meat every night doesn't mean you can't eat healthy.

       Eggs no, I eat them all the time. Canned beans? Go look at the sugar content of beans. No thanks. Eating out of a can is not healthy, fresh eating. I'm talking about fresh produce. Why is that so hard to grasp?
      </p>
      <p>
       I get it, you guys like to eat nasty preservatives, sugar, and unfresh because it's cheap. No one is stopping you. I only eat fresh foods, luckily because I can afford it.

       I have a friend like you, it's gotten so bad he won't paper towel, knapkins, anything like that because "white dye" gets into you. He started out almost exactly like you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't eat fruit/veggies/beans because "It's all sugar and sugar is cancer"
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't eat anything out of a can because "That's eating metal, cancer"
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually he got into believing that the only "healthy" way to eat is just 100% produce but he "cant afford it" even though it's cheaper than his terrible diet which has him overweight and tired all the time.

       When a crazy guy twists your words by claiming you twisted his words.
      </p>
      <p>
       You said any of the items he listed were $ 10 , no implication that you meant all since that would make those prices for each item fairly reasonable. You know what you said and what you meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im thinking maybe you do live in your moms basement and dont actually have any idea what groceries cost (hence the $10 brocoli claim to try to get sympathyvor whatever you were going for) since thats what youre projecting out and you're not so literate.

       It really isn't. A bag of rice is less than a dollar. A bag of beans is like 60 cents. A head of Kale is 66 cents. Frozen vegetables are 1.50 a bag.  Food is actually really cheap if feel like cooking.

       You should be able to get it from the FDA website. There's a page that shows all imported food coming into terminal markets and ports and bridges. that's the best way to get it.

       i could post my company's historical internals but that's a bad idea. this is common knowledge in the produce industry btw.

       Better not move to Australia.  Sweet potatoes were $9.99 per kilo last week.  Right now, ordinary potatoes are over $4.00 per kilo.  Broccoli is $7.00 per kilo. Carrots 2.29 kilo. Nectarines right now on special for $7.00 kilo. Cauliflower @ $5.00 each and they're garbage. Capsicum (bell peppers I think in the US) $9.00 kilo

       It really isn't. A bag of rice is less than a dollar. A bag of beans is like 60 cents. A head of Kale is 66 cents. Frozen vegetables are 1.50 a bag.  Food is actually really cheap if feel like cooking.

       How about the cost of rent? I used to live in a complex that was pretty expensive. $2100 for a one bedroom. The building had a high turnover and a low vacancy. Every month, doors all over the complex would have 3 day notices and eviction paperwork. The rent went up regularly. I moved when the rent went up to $2300. There were always RVs lined up in the street in front of the building with homeless people. It smelled like urine everywhere and I constantly found hypo needles, foil with heroin residue, and crack pipes all over the complex.

       I just don’t understand how this is sustainable from their point of view. The rent is too damn high. Everyone is getting priced out of the market. This is not sustainable in the long run so what is the point? There aren’t enough people in this area, which is actually a higher end area, who can afford the rent here.

       To me it looks like part of a bigger conspiracy, i have seen many very recent examples from all over the world where good furtile gound and water sources were poisend, harvest was detroyed by some "natural" events and Meat or other animal based foods renderd usesless becouse of some scandal.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time many biological farmers are "discouraged" to grow any food and local or personal food and water sources are also recently under attack.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it feels like "they" know the endgame is near and they are now using every tool to make food more scarese and when the shit hits the fan there will be even more misery becouse of the absence of food and water. And if we follow "their" path for our future "they" will take complete controll over all food and water sources and take on the responsibilety of resolving the mess "they" created temselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       The food and water conspiracies run very deep and all effort to better the situation is (at least) making good food more expensive and difficulter to obtain.

       You just need to eat them more often. The only reason you have gas is because your gut flora isn't used to breaking down fermentable carbs.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can also look for epazote AKA mexican oregano. Aside from making any Mexican dish taste better, it has been proven to reduce the gas produced from eating beans.

      <p>
       It actually tastes great unless you have one of those super taster genes. Then it tastes like Lysol.

       Those 3 frozen items you listed are $1.77 each at Wal Mart and about $2.50 at Metro here in Ontario Canada.

       Even at Fort Mac or Iqualit you can get a bag of frozen veg for under $10.
