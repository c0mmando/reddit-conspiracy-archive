       One of the first times I was linked to a mocking conspiracy sub (I will not name it), I had no idea what to expect. I saw the little robot on my post (bleep, bleep, boop), and I clicked the link. What I saw next I was not prepared for emotionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       I scrolled through the comments, and my eyes welled up with tears. I do not care if this is embarrassing because it is true. While no specific comment remains in my mind today, I felt humiliated. For the first time, I understood the new type of cruelty the internet can promote. It honestly took me a few days to recover. I was about to give up on posting on Reddit. Luckily, somebody on
       <a href="/r/c_s_t">
        /r/c_s_t
       </a>
       uplifted me, and I decided that I would never participate in a subreddit that humiliates another person. I thought about the subreddits I visited in the past that were made to mock users, and I realized I was in the wrong for enjoying subs like that. Unfortunately, it took me getting mocked myself to realize why it was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have written much about humiliation and degradation the past few years. Humiliation is a tactic, in my opinion, to keep people in line. From “Psychology Today”:
      </p>
      <p>
       “Ritual humiliation in traditional societies can serve to enforce a particular social order, or, as also with hazing rituals, to emphasize that the group takes precedence over its individual members.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Moreover,
      </p>
      <p>
       “One important respect in which humiliation differs from embarrassment is that, whereas we bring embarrassment upon ourselves, humiliation is something that is brought upon us by others.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, humiliation cuts deeper than embarrassment, and “People who are in the process of being humiliated are usually left stunned and speechless, and, more than that, voiceless.” It can be traumatic.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201408/the-psychology-humiliation">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/hide-and-seek/201408/the-psychology-humiliation
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to share a few times in my life that I have been deeply humiliated:
      </p>
      <p>
       • Growing up, my older sister had to baby sit me. She hated it. She used to beat us up regularly. Upon visiting my parents a few years later, they were laughing hysterically about this abuse. It was pure humiliation (and they could not understand why I was upset).
      </p>
      <p>
       • I was on vacation with my ex-boyfriend, and he was drinking. We had to drive to an event. He was in the passenger’s seat. I said something that pissed him off, and he started punching me while driving. I had to pull over, or else I was about to slam into traffic. He ripped off my shirt, and I had to stand there half naked, desperate and humiliated.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        To humiliate someone is to assert power of them, and I was powerless.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       • When I was a little girl, my dad told my mom that I had fat thighs. I was like 8 years old. I was humiliated as they both laughed about my body. (I was super skinny).
      </p>
      <p>
       There are thousands of incidents where I have been humiliated, and I only brought up ones that came to mind first. Further, I wanted to show that humiliation can happen at different levels. When I am linked to
       <strong>
        unnamed sub
       </strong>
       , it is about humiliation. They are asserting power over me, and they want to make me feel powerless. Really, it is public humiliation, and it is very common on Reddit.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are consequences to humiliation. The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and Law writes, “Suffering severe humiliation has been shown empirically to plunge individuals into major depressions, suicidal states, and severe anxiety states, including ones characteristic of posttraumatic stress disorder.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, do not get me wrong. There are real circumstances where perhaps humiliation is a fit punishment for a crime or serves a purpose. However, I think these circumstances should be rare.
In this post, I want to discuss why I believe humiliation tactics used on the internet, in general, are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        But conspiracies are dangerous!
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       When people humiliate me online, this is the go to argument. They are claiming that since I am posting ‘dangerous’ ideas, then I have a right to be humiliated to protect the naïve. There is so much wrong with this argument, but let’s just consider it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let’s say that everything I believe and write about is wrong, and that I am promoting ‘dangerous’ ideology. If people want me to stop doing so, my argument is that humiliation will not work.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Forbes,
      </p>
      <p>
       “A person who feels humiliated retreats automatically to a defensive position and can’t listen constructively. So, their behavior isn’t going to change; they’re just going to hate and mistrust you.  Their loyalty will be weakened  and their motivation to succeed and make you look good will be diminished, if not damaged irreparably. Inevitably, humiliation is followed by anger or even rage, which becomes  even more dangerous when that anger is suppressed and out of the person's awareness.”
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/prudygourguechon/2017/10/06/want-to-be-a-great-leader-never-intentionally-humiliate-anyone/#4e6b07527572">
        https://www.forbes.com/sites/prudygourguechon/2017/10/06/want-to-be-a-great-leader-never-intentionally-humiliate-anyone/#4e6b07527572
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       According to the article, great leaders do not humiliate, and humiliation does not really work for correcting behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people wanted me to change, the best way would not to be humiliate me, but rather, talk to me as a human.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, let’s just say that I am not crazy and what I am saying is true; then humiliation is even more dangerous.
      </p>
      <p>
       As noted earlier, humiliation can lead people to depression and suicide. When I noted how I felt at the beginning of this post, I was not exaggerating. I felt absolutely terrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chances are, subs that use humiliation tactics will eventually link to somebody who is not crazy. Subs like this may be humiliating the innocent. What happens to these people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone can be strong against harassment. This is what I CANNOT comprehend. In an age of ‘equality’ and ‘anti-bullying’, we see more and more extremes in people who participate in this humiliation tactics. It is a complete contradiction. Also, I am not trying to create partisan issues here, but I know that many of these subreddits that do humiliate lean on the left. However, to counter that, I have participated in subs that lean on the right and attack and humiliate users as well. So, please note, this is not a partisan issue. It is a people issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are told to love all and not to bully, but this is hands down bullying.
      </p>
      <p>
       As somebody who was shamed and humiliated as a child, I now know it was emotional abuse:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-legacy-distorted-love/201209/shaming-children-is-emotionally-abusive">
        https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-legacy-distorted-love/201209/shaming-children-is-emotionally-abusive
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Though we are adults now, I now see clearly that adults can emotionally abuse one another.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        What’s the answer?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is quite simple, and it is quite corny, but I feel the answer is compassion, love, and kindness. Now, before I get attacked, I do not believe people should sit there and be walked all over. I think people have to defend themselves at times, and there are times for war, and times for peace. Further, there is probably a time and place for humiliation, but I think it should be rare and a last resort.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in general, in an idealistic environment, people would listen to one another. If we are really concerned about helping each other online, we would follow rules of Socratic and collegial discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       As you may know, Socrates was a Greek philosopher who taught his students by asking questions. In schools, socratic seminars are used across the nation, and I believe socratic discussion should be used as a staple on online forums, especially conspiracy forums. Socratic discussion is not debate, as debate asserts that somebody is ‘wrong’ and somebody is ‘right.’ Socratic discussion is collaborative dialogue:
      </p>
      <p>
       Here are the tenets of Socratic discussion versus debate:
      </p>
      <p>
       Debate...
      </p>
      <p>
       • defends thinking to show that it is right
• calls for investing in one’s beliefs
• searches for weaknesses
• rebuts contrary positions and may devalue others
• assumes a single right answer
• demands a conclusion
      </p>
      <p>
       Dialogue...
      </p>
      <p>
       • expects others’ reflections will improve their own thinking
• is temporarily suspending one’s beliefs
• searches for strengths
• respects others and seeks not to alienate
• assumes that cooperation can lead to greater understanding
• remains open-ended
      </p>
      <p>
       (I took this from a PPT, so sorry no link).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now there is a time and place for debate, so I am not saying debating is wrong. However, I feel that people would learn much more if they participated in Socratic discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, even when debating, people can focus on tenets of collegial discussion:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.isbe.net/Documents/collegial-discussions.pdf">
        https://www.isbe.net/Documents/collegial-discussions.pdf
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In a way, I feel forums can be treated like a classroom full of students. In a real classroom, a good teacher would not allow attacking, screaming, and other tactics we see in online forums.
By the way, here are tactics that are commonly used to mess with online threads:
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.blackopradio.com/disinformation.html">
        http://www.blackopradio.com/disinformation.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is that collegial and Socratic discussion is possible, even online. It does not require humiliation, and even if people do not agree in the end, everybody can learn something.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when we go back to the original argument, that some forums like
       <strong>
        removed
       </strong>
       exist to ‘correct’ people and their dangerous views, I call bullshit. I think people can learn and change through some compassion and understanding. Think about a good teacher – they would never humiliate their students in order for them to learn a lesson. They would talk to the like a human being, and maybe the internet is making us lose humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        The Dangers of Humiliation
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet has changed bullying, and I think for worse. In the past, the archetypal bully may have beat somebody after class (which is not good!), but now bullying tactics are much more subtle, dark, and manipulative.
      </p>
      <p>
       My students are evidence of this. Many have been victims of online harassment and bullying, and the consequences have been devastating. Here are some examples of the extreme consequences of online harassment and bullying (very sad read):
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://nobullying.com/six-unforgettable-cyber-bullying-cases/">
        https://nobullying.com/six-unforgettable-cyber-bullying-cases/
       </a>
       Technology has changed things, and it will continue to do so. The internet has made people feel anonymous, and there are dangers to that. BBC writes,
      </p>
      <p>
       “Technology makes transparency even more important because studies show people are more likely to behave in a dishonest or morally questionable way when they can hide behind it. A research paper Wasieleski co-authored in 2012 revealed that students cheat more often when technology makes it possible. The internet especially gives people the feeling of anonymity, as if they can get away with it without anybody knowing who did it.
Proximity also makes a difference. People are less likely to behave badly when their victims are nearby, Wasieleski said. The web, of course, does a good job of making people feel far away from one another, and thus makes people more likely attack strangers online who might be on the other side of the globe.”
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the question I like to ask whenever I write something online: Would I say this to this person in real life? If the answer is no, I do not post it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have to remember there is a human behind the screen (for the most part).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Conclusion
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I wrote this because I am attacked online daily. It gets exhausting, and tonight, after being questioned about my beliefs, I wanted to defend them. If you want to help somebody change, show them love and compassion. Hatred breeds more hatred – it is as simple as that!
      </p>
      <p>
       To end with a quote from Martin Luther King Jr:
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultimate weakness of violence is that it is a descending spiral, 
begetting the very thing it seeks to destroy. 
Instead of diminishing evil, it multiplies it.
Through violence you may murder the liar, 
but you cannot murder the lie, nor establish the truth. 
Through violence you may murder the hater, 
but you do not murder hate. 
In fact, violence merely increases hate. 
So it goes. 
Returning violence for violence multiplies violence, 
adding deeper darkness to a night already devoid of stars. 
Darkness cannot drive out darkness: 
only light can do that. 
Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a world where maybe we feel safer physically, but emotionally and spiritually, there are many battles. 
I suppose this post will likely be downvoted and attacked, but before you do so, I hope you can create discussion with me. Thank you for reading.

       You're welcome. Point a gun to your head. Think about the shit that has happened in your life. Think about what you are talking about. Take a swig, cock that trigger, and see. If you pull it. You are weak. Society is filled with a bunch of pussies. Your ancestors would beat the fuck out of you if they heard this drivel. You're getting upset about people posting online? lmao. You put it out there. Expect a response. Newton's law. Coddled Americans. Makes sense.

       It's reality. Have you ever contemplated suicide? Have you ever starved? Have you ever felt any physical effects? You are complaining about online trolls. Billions of people are starving, raped, abused, and let to the slaughter and here you are pissing and moaning about 'online abuse'.

       Yes I contemplated suicide as a teen and a counselor helped me.

       I was abused both physically and emotionally my entire life.

       As Aristotle said, it is the mark of an educated mind to entertain an idea even if you don't believe it. Those who feel they need to belittle and attack anyone who they disagree with are part of a far larger problem. To me, it ties into the larger issue of Free Speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       For Example, Antifa/ARA seek to "silence" Nazi's, or anyone they consider to be Nazi's. But in reality, Free Speech gives these voices, however despicable, the opportunity to be heard. This benefits us, however, because it allows the racists, the fools,the ignorant, to be outed publicly by their own words. In my opinion, censorship and belittlement is never the option. If you disagree with someone, you should be able to have a rational discussion and be OK with the fact that you and them will likely still be at odds at the end of it. It is the mark of an emotionally and ideologically insecure person to attack and smear those who they disagree with, instead of having a rational discussion.

       A problem identified by the ancient Greeks. In the Odyssey, when Odysseus returns to Ithaca and slays the suitors of Penelope, it solves nothing. The family members of the suitors, who constituted the pinnacle of Ithacan society, begin preparing to avenge themselves upon Odysseus. It is only with the "deus ex machina" of Athena descending from Olympus and demanding a halt of the bloodshed that prevents further violence. Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of an Olympic goddess descending upon our current lives to stop the needless violence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Violence is a cycle, and death is just the beginning. I hate to quote the TV show Dexter, but Harry, Dexter's father, put it best: "Death starts a chain reaction, and if you're not careful you will be caught up in it yourself". Hate begets hate, violence violence, and death death. It is up to us as individuals to stop the cycle, which upon writing this I see applies also to emotional and physical abuse.

       Not sure why you engaged this guy =OR= the TMOR weirdos. They don't matter. YOU matter. What YOU'RE doing matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The TMOR crew are impotent. They've already lost. Let me repeat that for you: THEY'VE ALREADY LOST.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact they continue to spew their bitter bile as the things we've been trying to shout to the world are revealed as true EVERY FUCKING DAY NOW, is just a sign of how further and further THEY are being turned from reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, when I used to rightfully mock them as impotent, it was really only in reference to their laughable failure to put a dent in this sub and not get nearly the readership or "stickiness" of our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now, their impotence is far more all-encompassing. Now, they're losing the battle of ideas and culture. Their impotence has become their lone distinguishing feature--not their ability to humiliate.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no reason for you to let them do that to you, because they have no power at all any more. TMOR is a small, flaccid, weak, laughable crowd of impotent losers in the battle of ideas. Don't ever forget that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past two weeks, I've had previously slumbering people reaching out to me on FB and email about the best JFK assassination book to read, asking what I think about PG and where can they read something non MSM about it, asking me who I think the biggest Hollywood name to be "outed" is ("Spielberg," I say, and they gasp. Then I send them the Crispin Glove essay).
      </p>
      <p>
       But more than anything, they're ESPECIALLY "proud" of seeing through the Las Vegas bullshit. So proud of that and like to brag to me they're not being fooled, no sirree. The Vegas thing was a big big clusterfuck failure for the controlling powers and it's loosened a lot of closed minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       But here's the thing: Not those wacky impotent losers on TMOR. They're totally doubled down on Vegas and everything else that many Americans are waking up to. And "losers" is right, because let me emphasize again: THEY ARE LOSING. TMOR is IMPOTENT and LOSING.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know you pay very close attention to what's going on, but I also think you may allow the personal baggage your shitty family foisted upon you to darken your worldview. Can't you see how incompetent the bad guys suddenly are? They can't get out of their own way, stuck in a pattern that's worked for them in the past, but doesn't now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just look at the long list of self-immolating celebrities and their amazing inability to even apologize or accept responsibility correctly. Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, now Louis CK, not only are they fucking horrible evil people, when they tried to salvage their way out of the mess, they made it WORSE. They've simply lost the ability to relate to humanity, the outside world--so blinded by their narcissism and self-satisfied sense of superiority.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, that's what's happened to the impotent TMOR crew, too. They are so narcissistic and consumed with the fragrance of their own facial farts, they can't get out of their own way. The world has changed, it's left them behind, and they don't realize they're trapped in a limp-dick circle jerk cult of vanity and loss.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's really pretty delicious, and you're not enjoying it! YOU, who have done so much to wake up so many people, who have been so good at using facts and empathy to castrate these impotent losers, are giving them far more power than they deserve or have earned.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just let them go and ignore them. Block and never think of them again, unless it's to laugh about the bunch of them, all the "Top Minds," sitting in a circle, jerking each other off fruitlessly because their dicks are so small, soft and useless.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can try to plea for their compassion, but you'd be better off praying for their soul's salvation. Stay removed, perhaps God will grace them.
      </p>
      <p>
       But don't waste another moment's energy on them. They don't deserve it, and, frankly, they've not even earned it. You're the one who's done all the work, all the thought, all the effort. All they can do is tear things down in hopes the wreckage covers the little hole they want to crawl into and hide away from the ever-tightening noose of revelation that will show them to be complete intellectual frauds.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fine. It's cool. You got this, because you got it already. Okay?

       I do think at times my worldview is dark, which is why I am thankful I found Christ to brighten it. Further, I always try to end what I write positively.

       Yes, they can be very mean. They're just miserable, hateful pieces of shit. The best revenge is not just living your life well but maintaining your
       <em>
        ideal
       </em>
       self. It wasn't long ago I started wondering if hatefulness is really a form of mental illness. Of course, no one takes it seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then I discovered a book, "People of The Lie, The Hope for Healing Evil" by M. Scoot Peck, MD.
      </p>
      <p>
       He writes: "When I say that evil has to do with killing, I do not mean to restrict myself to corporeal murder. Evil is also that which
       <em>
        kills the spirit
       </em>
       . (my italics) There are various essential attributes of life--particularly human life-such as sentience, mobility, awareness, growth, autonomy, will. It is possible to kill or attempt to kill one of these attributes, without actually destroying the body. Thus we may "break" a horse or even a child without harming a hair on its head."   P. 42
      </p>
      <p>
       People do try to "kill" our spirit, all the time, in many ways. Maybe they're not consciously aware of their 'darkness' (or emptiness) but it's obvious when they attack someone else. They want to 'dim' your brightness, don't let them. Blind 'em with your light.

       Don't let TMOR sucker you into a "debate" on their turf cause there is no winning that... it's the equivalent to being caught wearing crip colors in blood territory. You are outnumbered from the get go and they are working from a position of power. People really enjoy you around here and that is what matters... don't waste your time on them... just like life ya gotta stay away from assholes, cause most people are kinda simple and they try to build themselves up trying to knock someone else down... Prolly the exact same thing your sister did. It's just human nature... and the fact that you can express your emotions so well shows that you have a good grasp of your own internal thought processes... trace those emotions and find out the root cause. No one should ever let online harassment get the best of them, because in the end it's just words on a screen... Probably a lot more difficult for normal folks, but I got such a tight lid on my feelings that I honestly don't know if I have ever let myself be humiliated. I can't really offer any advice as far as dealing with emotions go... but remember there are plenty of people around here that really like you... accentuate the positive... eliminate the negative... latch on to the affirmative. They only have power over you if you let them.

       Thank you for this polka! Excellently written and a raw perspective.

        Let’s say that everything I believe and write about is wrong, and that I am promoting ‘dangerous’ ideology. If people want me to stop doing so, my argument is that humiliation will not work.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This is the one point I think I'd have to disagree on. I think it
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       work, though maybe not how you envision. The point of humiliating someone in the context of these "dangerous" ideas is not primarily to change the target's mind, it's to change how that target is viewed by third parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the first level, if the humiliation is done in a persuasive manner, it will make the onlookers think the target
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       crazy/delusional/etc. Part of this is fear of humiliation themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the second level, they want the target to lash out or react. One, it will often make the target less rational and more emotional in responding (which makes the arguments less compelling to onlookers.) If the target then claims they're a target of humiliation and harassment, all the better. Also, if the target becomes depressive or suicidal, they're less effective at spreading whatever message they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       And third, it conditions onlookers to resort to using humiliation themselves. Being on the side of those who are doing the humiliating can give one a (false) sense of power and superiority. What better way to stifle dissension than entraining more people to engage in the tactics themselves?

       Great points!
      </p>
      <p>
       The question is
       <em>
        should
       </em>
       humiliation be used to correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it can work, I do not think it does overall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, it may promote social conformity, which can be good or bad depending on the context.

       I think the "should" depends on your end goals. For me, you, and those of us who want to create a better world for all of us, I think the answer is
       <em>
        usually
       </em>
       no.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your answer of love, empathy, and compassion are almost always the better path for correcting behavior, at least on a person-to-person level. If someone is behaving in a way that's actually hurtful to others, it probably is a result of having been hurt themselves. Humiliation only feeds the vicious cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a broader, more societal level, I'm not sure if the answer is always as cut and dry. Politicians and other people with power aren't necessarily acting from the same place, and aren't going to respond to the same tactics. Publicly shaming them might be the best way to proceed, because the goal is not so much to change their behavior, but to change the behavior of their supporters who enable that behavior. Could be a slippery slope, though.

       Good points. I agree! There is a time and place for humiliation but it should be rare and depend on context.

       May I ask, did you realize the truth about your family first or your government?  For me (and I feel I'm backwards), I first realized the truth of my family then it was an easy journey to the truth about the world. I'm always curious how it goes for others.
