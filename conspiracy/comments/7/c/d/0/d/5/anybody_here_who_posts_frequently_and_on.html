       Yes, this is a goofy theory. However I never had this issue until I started posting here about pizza gate and other topics that are damning to TPTB.

       hell, even the typing mechanism on my phone will randomly "scramble" and edit words I type, and I've found comments I typed being edited before.
      </p>
      <p>
       The charger thing is annoying. Can they fuck with the charge on your phone somehow? Anyone else ever experienced this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I should also mention that I receive phone calls and night and day from random numbers around the country. When I pick up, nobody's there and nobody says anything. I don't even answer them anymore

       I really don't mind that. Well, privacy invasion is horrible obviously, but they're selling it to people for what? To cater advertisements to me?

       The CIA can potentially take control of your car while you're driving it(if it's a newer model), correct? Is t that how Michael Hastings may have been murdered?

       that's one aspect only. they are also creating "digital profiles" on you, creating a highly sophisticated profile that can predict some scary things about, including even predicting who you know, will know, or did know, your travel plans, your health and diet, and all your political leanings.
      </p>
      <p>
       these profiles are the information that is being sold, not the raw data. or sometimes the raw data is sold to companies that generate these profiles, and then passed on to other companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       most common use is for advertising. but what else will they start to do with that info in the future?

       I am like, 99.99% cetain that is not what is happening to you. Probably just got a lemon of a phone. If the CIA wanted to stop you from leaking info, like for real, you wouldn't be posting about it online. you'd be dead or in a mental institution.

       I doubt a significant percentage of developers really care to track users to be quite honest (and this is coming from the lead developer of a medium-sized projects with about 20K monthly users). That's not to say that there are those that do, however.

       Factory reset your phone. If it happens again, buy a new battery for $20. If it happens another time, then you may be onto something but you would have to chip in to get a brand new phone to see if it happens to that one. Document everything.

       A lot of fucky stuff happens to me whilst I'm on r/conspiracy...
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainly the typing on my phone gets all wonky. Words are corrected and it become very difficult to simply type a simple short word. It's like the autocorrect feature here all "wonky" and someone is fucking with me while I type to create typos and make it difficult for me to type.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yes, my battery life is often suppressed as well. But ONLY notice these things after I post or talk about something really incriminating or something that the shills try to keep "hush hush"

       This sounds like little technical things they program into these apps that they assume we honestly brush off or don't really care about. But they are enough to slow you down and deter you from making a post or being active...

       I've been thinking the same thing. My phone went to shit over night when I updated iOS a few weeks ago. I get calls from random numbers and no one is on the other end, the audio on my phone calls breaks up the first time someone calls me so I have to hang up and call them back, my phone freezes multiple times a day, and my phone stops charging if the cable is moved. It's really really weird.

       This is probably what's going on.  Unfortunately if you're not careful this probably happens alot because of investigation and some of the sites that are linked that we come across everyday.  I worry sometimes about even downloading pictures because of what can be put in them.

       Phone calls are probably scammers. The battery of a smart phone can be fickle. If you are buying cheap gas station chargers, they suck. I really don't think anyone in power is worried about this subreddit.

       Probably off topic but 
Back when I was right out of high school (2003ish dial up or dsl I forget ) my computer would turn it self on.  This happened mostly if I left the house with the whole family. I'd come back to pc being on. I got paranoid and set up easy things I could check to see if anyone had entered my room. But none ever showed it. Finally I got fed up and left a note on my screen when going out that said for whoever it was to stop messing with my computer. It never turned on by it self after that. I've had other weird shit happen too but I'd assume everyone does.

       "Can they fuck with the charge on your phone somehow?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It is impossible for others to listen in on your phone, or document every person you have contacted. just kidding.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last night, I missed a call. When I returned the call, it went to a voicemail from a cemetery. when I looked up the number, it said it belonged to a man named Baltazar Garcia. Not a funny prank. Quite scary, actually.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sad to say that many children and teens are monitored through their phones. Many explicit pictures have been confiscated, and teens have been threatened with assault charges. Communities encourage it. The people encouraging, then watching should be prosecuted for sexual assault and stalking.
