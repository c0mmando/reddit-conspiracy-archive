        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Background:</p>

<p>I was raised Jewish and come from a long line of really amazing Jews who started businesses, worked in government, they made insane wealth during the depression from starting metal forging businesses which BOOMED during the war. My family is filled with self-made wealth from flooring businesses, to car dealerships, to government contracts. My father&#39;s side was even involved in Jewish mafias - so I guess we&#39;d be prime targets for being involved in these sorts of nasty acts. But we aren&#39;t. We don&#39;t even practice anymore and my father works at a Christian church to aid the homeless and he married a fucking southern Baptist. My grandfather spent his retirement aiding the homeless as well through Habitat for Humanity. They&#39;re deeply spiritual, smart, moral people who seem to naturally attain wealth / power but they have always used it wisely and humbly and are very giving. They&#39;re not complete Zionists and I&#39;ve even heard my dad and grandfather question Israel as potentially engaging in genocide against the Palestinians and they simply want peace.</p>

<p>They are solid 100% American men who believe deeply in American values, democracy, and question official narratives just like people here. My father has been privately very open to the conspiracies I&#39;ve shown him even though he works for a major Government agency. He voted for H but said he felt really bad about it because she simply seemed to be the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot;. Sometimes I wonder if some of this is just in our genetics? My family is (nearly) all very intelligent, professional, powerful people who have made major changes in our communities for the better. I know that is a really dangerous thought these days and I definitely don&#39;t believe in any sort of superiority and I know none of my family thinks that either.</p>

<p>I just hope when the hammer drops it&#39;s not another tribalist based race war. Some of us are very good people who are on the good side fighting for truth. We should be very careful of blaming an entire religion. We need to differentiate or we could start to become the bad guys. Maybe it starts with words. Perhaps &quot;Criminal Jewish Elite&quot;?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by all of this. None of my immediately family is corrupt. My grandfather used his money from service in WWII to start his own business which was exact right time and market when needed and he did really well. They purposefully didn&#39;t give my dad anything (had to pay for college / his own car) and he worked his way up from coder to Vice President of a major company. And I&#39;m fairly successful myself from a combination of my art, working for a large car dealership (in the back crunching numbers, not sleazy salesperson), and I even gamed the Steam Community Market really early on and made about $10,000 just using some code I created. IDK man. You need to consider a less black and white world view. It&#39;s all a gradient.</p>

<p>I know I figured it was a pretty risky thing to expose but I like to be very honest and it really does blow my mind when I think about it that my family looks so much like they could be &quot;them&quot;. I had never really thought about it until recently when all of this Jewish Criminal Elite shit started coming apart. It makes me wonder if there&#39;s just something in Judaism itself, the culture, or maybe our genetics. I guess my point is you can look like a bunch of greedy, power hungry Jews, but really just be high contributing members of society who happen to also be Jewish.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s just straight from the propaganda they receive. None of them think they&#39;re supporting a killing machine just like they don&#39;t think they are when they pay US taxes (like I think lmao). Jews are taught from an early age that Israel is the final chance they have at having a country again and that most of the problems Jews have faced over the last thousand years are simply due to that. They don&#39;t even fathom how to question it. I know because I was indoctrinated. It was never about supporting a nasty government, it was said to be just part of our progress and you could disagree with some of their actions, but no one ever thought about questioning the state. I guess it&#39;s more like being &quot;German&quot; during Nazi Germany but not necessarily a Nazi.</p>

<p>Every time we&#39;ve ever given Jews a chance they&#39;ve fucked us over. Every time we&#39;ve ever differentiated between &#39;good&#39; and &#39;bad&#39; Jews, we&#39;ve fucked them over.
After every pogrom and expulsion and genocide some survive, and they&#39;re the sneakiest and most manipulative of all their kind.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>vs. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You were the one being lazy. You have this idea that there is no possible way your family did anything wrong, there is no possible way they fit into any of the stereotypes, and you feel no obligation to learn the other side for yourself. You feel no obligation to think about who built the country your ancestors immigrated to exploit the fruits of their labor. You want it spoon fed, you want your goy to do all the leg work for your mind. I even told you were to look, the most concise view of revisionist history, and you just blow right over it. No sense of humility, just keep driving forward with the &quot;I do no wrong&quot; attitude. On top of that, you try to demean your opponent into acting on feelings instead of reason, while being incredibly hypocritical. Ironically, I don&#39;t even agree with that anon, I think your blood is that of the devil, something that will never reach harmony with nature. Something that could never build a modern society. You people call it free will, but it isn&#39;t, it is an illusion of self. You people are selfish, genetically.  </p>

<p>You are also pretending like I didn&#39;t see this: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you go through the information on <a href="https://holocaustdeprogrammingcourse.com/">https://holocaustdeprogrammingcourse.com/</a> only a blind man could support the theory of the holocaust.
You either support that 6 million died and cling to your false victim status, or you are happy they didn&#39;t die. Which one is more antisemitic? More Jews died as a result of Allied bombings than died at the work camps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So don&#39;t pretend like you wanted to learn about the holocaust, either you knew exactly what you were doing, or worse you didn&#39;t. Either way, now you know why aren&#39;t gonna waste the time putting each of you on trial. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/communist calls every Capitalist a pig with no obligation to learn from the other side, without any humility feeling as if they&#39;ve done nothing wrong and can never build a sustainable modern society, they are selfish and disillusioned. r/the_donald says the same about liberals. r/politics says this about r/the_donald. r/conspiracy says this about the elite. r/circlebroke says it about r/uncensorednews. r/topminds says this about r/conspiracy.  r/coontown use to say this about black people. r/atheism says it about Christians. And I&#39;ve heard it said about Muslims first hand especially after 911. And here you are saying it about literally all Jews. That it&#39;s in their DNA (perhaps you believe in Jewish superiority more than I do lmao).</p>

<p>At some point you have to wonder if maybe there isn&#39;t exactly one group we should point at and that perhaps this is simply tribalism rearing its head again. America was founded on the notion that tribalism could be beat and that all men are created equally. They were wrong. We are still very much animals and we haven&#39;t found a way to truly respect each other as individuals and we often still cling to our in-groups to maintain hierarchy and control while dehumanizing those who seem to stand against us. Tribalism has simply changed forms into a culture war. Perhaps the ultimate goal of these groups is simply to dehumanize / subjugate the other until they are the winning tribe. But perhaps no group will ever really win. Perhaps it&#39;s simply crab in a bucket syndrome. Perhaps the best way to do this is to try to fucking work together and put down our individual biases for one second and listen to another person&#39;s perspective. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do here with you, but you are very set in believing I am inferior to you without having ever met me, simply based on my &quot;tribe&quot;. Shame on you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I&#39;ll buy that. My take on the topic is that &quot;<em>we</em>&quot; as a whole don&#39;t share the same views on Jewish/Zionist threat.</p>

<p>Frankly, I don&#39;t really care that a religion believes it is owed land and servitude by rite, my issue is how you go about it. If a god bestowed it upon you, sit tight and let it fall into your hands. If your religion is right, it will happen eventually without intervention.</p>

<p>Forceful subjugation and oppression is the ultimate enemy of mankind, in every form. No matter how holy you believe your cause to be, if you need to make someone else&#39;s life worse because they don&#39;t believe in the same imaginary friend you do, you are a stain on humanity.</p>

<p>I believe there are many people of the Jewish faith that do not support the Militant Zionism that currently rages in Israel. I also believe they are not doing enough to speak against it, as the monarchs of the Jewish faith don&#39;t deem it fit to listen to the goyim.</p>

<p>If you are of the Jewish faith and don&#39;t openly oppose the Zionist agenda, you are silently supporting it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep, we&#39;re cool. Being in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>, there&#39;s gonna be a few outspoken, ultra-paranoid users who think that every Jew is in on some big secret that involves controlling the worlds money and largely treating all goyim as slaves.</p>

<p>Religion is nothing, if not psychological. If you are devout and your religion states that you are superior to all others, then that idealism will affect your daily life, constantly. You will be more confident when dealing with those you feel are inferior, less inclined to feel guilt when using those around you for your own well-being.</p>

<p>These are not bad traits if you want to advance and be &quot;successful&quot; in our current society. I would go so far as to say they are a necessity, in order to rise above the rest. You, yourself, have already shown a bit of this in your post and comments.</p>

<p>But, they are not <em>good</em> traits to have. At least the wholesome, utopian idea of good. As it is, for one to succeed, others must fail. Those who succeed are in the best position to change that standard, however they will not, because that is what they know.</p>

<p>I&#39;m falling too far into philosophy, perhaps. Let&#39;s just say that being &quot;successful&quot; doesn&#39;t always mean better.</p>

<p>Your OP speaks on behalf of this entire sub - saying <em>we</em> should differentiate between &quot;good&quot; jews (presumably putting yourself in this category - despite claiming on the other hand you&#39;re &quot;non practicing&quot; ((lol))), and those very bad <em>criminal jews</em> (&quot;not me guv&quot; ((honest))).</p>

<p>Why do you think <em>you</em> get to control what <em>we</em> say, or how we say it? Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s rather arrogant?</p>

<p>You should be careful. Some people take offence to allusions the diamond industry is controlled by jews.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am open to a lot of things. I don&#39;t try to believe anything full-heartedly that I haven&#39;t experienced for myself. I&#39;ve seen some things on the numbers being skewed, that it was entirely staged / propaganda, that the prisoners were actually communists, that the Jews that were killed were only of a certain tribe as to purify, and that Hitler was actually 1/4th Jewish, I&#39;ve seen that Jewish bankers and American corporations helped set up the Nazis and dismantled them. I don&#39;t know wtf happened and I don&#39;t think anyone here does with 100% certainty either.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/communist calls every Capitalist a pig with no obligation to learn from the other side, without any humility feeling as if they&#39;ve done nothing wrong and can never build a sustainable modern society, they are selfish and disillusioned. r/the_donald says the same about liberals. r/politics says this about r/the_donald. r/conspiracy says this about the elite. r/circlebroke says it about r/uncensorednews. r/topminds says this about r/conspiracy.  r/coontown use to say this about black people. r/atheism says it about Christians. And I&#39;ve heard it said about Muslims first hand especially after 911. And here you are saying it about literally all Jews. That it&#39;s in their DNA (perhaps you believe in Jewish superiority more than I do lmao).</p>

<p>At some point you have to wonder if maybe there isn&#39;t exactly one group we should point at and that perhaps this is simply tribalism rearing its head again. America was founded on the notion that tribalism could be beat and that all men are created equally. They were wrong. We are still very much animals and we haven&#39;t found a way to truly respect each other as individuals and we often still cling to our in-groups to maintain hierarchy and control while dehumanizing those who seem to stand against us. Tribalism has simply changed forms into a culture war. Perhaps the ultimate goal of these groups is simply to dehumanize / subjugate the other until they are the winning tribe. But perhaps no group will ever really win. Perhaps it&#39;s simply crab in a bucket syndrome. Perhaps the best way to do this is to try to fucking work together and put down our individual biases for one second and listen to another person&#39;s perspective. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do here with you, but you are very set in believing I am inferior to you without having ever met me, simply based on my &quot;tribe&quot;. Shame on you.</p>
