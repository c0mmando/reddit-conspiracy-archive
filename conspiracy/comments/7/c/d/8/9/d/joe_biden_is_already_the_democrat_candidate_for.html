    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it would be possible to maintain the office of VP, be way over the normal age for a serial killer and never be caught or even suggested that you were a killer. The only close case for a serial killer would be John Wayn Gacy and he doesn&#39;t really share any life circumstances or traumas that most serial killers go through. Basicly, its idiotic to think that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That’s another thing that boggles my mind, there are legit creeps in office who don’t even try to hide it whether In public or on/off camera, but another guy gets a little too fired up at a rally and yells “BYAAH!”
And that derails his political career. I understand it turned into a PR nightmare for him with the Chappelle Show skit and everyone making jokes (it was pretty damn funny) but just the idea that something as harmless as that completely shut him down but other guys preying on children out in the open doesn’t do squat is disgusting and beyond me. </p>

She is the only one that would give Trump a run for his money, provided she stays clean and continues after Trump &#39;cleaning government house&#39;. She&#39;s the right gender to satisfy all that pushed Killary because she was a woman. She&#39;ll satisfy heartbroken Bernie supporters. But while Debbie wasserman-schultz, Pedodestas and the whole circus of criminals that IS the DNC continue to have jobs/ties with it, it will rot and die, no matter who they choose. Tulsi would have to clean serious house there first and then run for POTUS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is why the work is being put in now. Our Revolution, founded by Bernie, has taken 8 state parties from the Establishment. Any registered Dem can show up to local meetings and vote for their Precinct Chairs. Precinct Chairs vote for County Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National Chairs. The Party can be taken, if grassroots organization is done, which it is. There is a long road ahead of us, but there is a chance for a fair Primary if we can keep taking the Party from the Establishment one precinct at a time.</p>

<p>It wont be easy, and it is by no means guaranteed, but the path has been laid out. The option is there- We The People must seize the opportunity and <em>organize</em>.</p>

<p>Sanders is still the only one who will take on Wall Street and campaign financing though, so him or his candidate (one of Merkley, Ellison, Gabbard, or Turner) already has my inclination.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The biggest conflict between Clinton biden and Obama was arming Ukraine. Obama forbade it foras long as he could but gave in. That mistake led to North Korea getting help from Ukraine in nuclear. Also, some of those weapons ended up in Egypt from North Korea. Israel was insanely mad with that and the Iran deal which Clinton Kerry Biden Obama got.</p>
