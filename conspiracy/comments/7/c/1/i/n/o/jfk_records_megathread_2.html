         Upon brief inspection

        , it appears that all of the files so far examined still contain redactions.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the files have not been re-reviewed yet by either the specific agencies (such as the CIA, FBI, and NSA) or the National Archives themselves, then one wonders why they would release them now in their present redacted form. It’s Alice in Wonderland time.

       Technical I think it was Alice &amp; wonderland, with an amperstand when Q first started saying it. If I'm remembering right the Alice &amp; Wonderland/ Alice and Wonderland switch happened after people caught on that he was NOT saying Alice in Wonderland. small detail but the guy say everything he posts has specific meanings we are supposed to figure out.

       First pages talk about Oswald in Mexico trying to get a Cuban visa (for transit), but as the URSS would delay is soviet visa for 4 months more he didn't get any. He got mad and some few days later went back to the US.

       Haha fuckers. For these pages to be fully redacted in 2017 means only one thing. The CIA has still got something to hide about Oswald.

      <p>
       Most likely conclusion is that he was closely associated with them, if not an outright employee.

       As soon as Oswald = CIA, the "crazed lone gunman" theory goes out the window.

       Right now liberals are weirdly invested in the idea that our intelligence agencies are trustworthy and good, because they're currently fighting Trump. The anti-Trump mantra at this point is basically, "How can you not trust 17 intelligence agencies?"

       Fair enough. But even Bernie Sanders has bought into the hysteria, and he was supposed to be independent. I used to consider myself liberal before I realized there is no one on the left that represents me at all.

       Can you link that because I haven't seen Bernie feeding into the Russia thing at all.  I mean he's going to take shots at Trump for anything possible so I imagine he's probably touched on it when he's questioned but he's not railing on it like typical dems.  He is quietly putting pieces in place for a big change in the democratic party.  The more he plays along with Democrats for now the more sway he will hold.  There is still a Liberal base in the democratic party that wants to stick with Dem's it's important for Bernie to not rock that boat atm.  He made the contrast between corporate dems and progressives during the primary but kicking the party while it's down would not do him any favors.

       Yeah like I said.  He was asked about it and he says "I think the evidence is overwhelming and all the agencies are in agreement."  He really has no basis to disagree, even if he has his doubts.  He would risk being labeled a "conspiracy theorist" and really stands to gain nothing.  Whether Russia had anything to do with it or not, it's going to be "proven" that they did.  Anyone arguing against it or even showing hesitation on it is going to be discredited.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie does not have time or energy to waste dying on every hill.  He's picking his battles and he's playing ball at times.  Going against the Russia investigation would be very high risk and very low reward.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be like a politician being asked who they thought did 9/11 and them saying well I'm not to sure...  Even though most people would agree with them they would be done for.  There is more to politics than making people happy.  Remember elections only happen every couple years, in the mean time the people elected are wielding the power.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would say expect the fired up Bernie to strike again during mid terms and then probably gear up for either another run or backing someone else to run.

       Was about to point out what the other guy already did. Much as I'd hope you wish people didn't think conservatives were represented entirely by Ryan/McConnell/the rest of the GOP establishment, don't think that the Democrat party is the voice of liberals (even ones like me that live in California :P ).

       right.  what's the point of creating a stir over sexual assault that happened between two adults over 20-40 years ago...(not talking about pedo stuff)
      </p>
      <p>
       unless it's to cause a diversion.   (i'm a woman so i am not condoning assault) . I am just noting that the statutes of limitations have passed.

       States that Oswald attempted to assassinate retired General Walker in September of 1963 in Dallas.
      </p>
      <p>
       Document continues on citing conversations with a Delgado, who was in the Marines with Oswald during training. He states that Oswald was in contact with Cuban embassy while in Marines, and Delgado gave him the idea to contact the Cubans. Delgado continues on that Oswald rarely received mail, but after confiding in Delgado that he contacted the Cubans, he started receiving mail with a seal in latin that he couldn't make out what country was from but was governmental. Assumed it was Cuba. Also states that a civilian man arrived at their base requesting Oswald, and that this man and Oswald met for an hour and thirty minutes to two hours. Delgado assumes the man was from the Cuban consulate in Los Angeles. CIA report agrees with assertion and can't identify the man.

       Page 22 of the PDF, bullet point 31 and 32 goes into detail of a Ms. Garro's recollection of seeing Oswald at a Cuban party in Mexico. States that Oswald had a mistress while down there of the name Silvia Duran(who was married at the time?).

       Is it me or am I interpreting it wrong, Cuba/Russia assassinate Kennedy, the CIA/FBI fucked up and let it happen. Rather than pursue justice  (i.e WW3) they swept it under the rug and let the military help, in doing so keeping them in business for the next 60 years by keeping a senate that is pro military. Eisenhower had it all right. This potentially is explosive to whats going on in the world right now, we need to put the wrongs right. The truth must out.

       This country could certainly use a national conversation about placing absolute trust in government, I'll agree with you there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sad part is that if we had that conversation the Intelligence agencies would likely spin it as "We prevented WWIII! Now we need a backdoor into every smartphone so we can keep doing this good work on your behalf!" And 75% of the population would agree with them.

       That saying it's stupid. Having a casus belli doesn't mean you need to use it. It's unwise to always go to war just because you can.

       I think that it wasn't the Russians nor the Cubans. I don't have the link to the files to  but on the askreddit thread about the jfk files I you can find them in one of the top comments. Apparently, Castro told Cuban officials that is was not him, and the Russians freaked out when Kennedy died because they thought that it was a way for the US to justify an attack towards them. Also, the Russians had pretty good relations with Kennedy (even after then missiles crisis), so they didn't have any reason to kill him.

       Not much you've said as there is not much to be taken from what little they've given us. It's almost like the purpose of the release was to make conspiracists more affirmed in their suspicions, while simultaneously making the average person who probably only read a headline about the files being released think "Well nothing big came from the release so official story is probably legit"; little do they know how heavily redacted and therefore suspicious this all is.

       Quick question: Does anyone really think the Agency that successfully overthrew a duly elected President with a coup that include a Vice President, a future President, the FBI, Secret Service, military intelligence,  a chief justice, Hoover, and the mob (obviously this is not a conclusive list)?

       Only two scenarios fit:
      </p>
      <p>
       The intelligence agencies were watching Oswald because they needed a patsy. A fall guy. They set him up to look like the shooter and he was unaware of the entire plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intelligence agencies, specifically the CIA, were working him as an off the books agent and set him up to take the fall. Hell, he may have even been tasked with shooting Kennedy but before he could others did, which shocked him and so he ran and hid. No one believed him during the interrogation, which wasn't recorded.

       Evidence of Revision is a 9 hour long documentary series whose purpose is to present the publicly unavailable and even suppressed historical audio, video, and film recordings largely unseen by the American public relating to the assassination of the Kennedy brothers, the little known classified Black Ops actually used to intentionally create the massive war in Viet Nam, the CIA "mind control" programs and their involvement in the RFK assassination and the Jonestown massacre and other important truths of our post-modern time.
