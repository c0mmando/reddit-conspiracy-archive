        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Gonna tell you the story of how I was woke.</p>

<p>I was 19 years old, an apprentice carpenter and same as everyone else I witnessed September the 11th on tv.</p>

<p>Went to work and thought it was everything they told me it was. Ie, Al Qaeda and terrorism.</p>

<p>One dude I work with, who is woke as all fuck, he&#39;s 75 years old and would lecture you on how the CIA killed John Lennon, made one remark to me I&#39;ll never forget.</p>

<p>&quot;There will never be world peace as long as the US is in existence&quot;. </p>

<p>Whether you believe this or not I don&#39;t care. It was a wakening for me. I couldn&#39;t believe that shit he just said. But the tv told me we&#39;re on a freedom mission!!</p>

<p>Anyhow I started looking beyond my TV and it looks like he was not wrong. Even people I never would have thought would be woke started to wake up. Now I talk to these &quot;never to be woke&quot; like they&#39;re woke as fuck.</p>

<p>Do you guys think that 9/11 is their undoing? Do you think that they underestimated the technology that would be available that is the internet? </p>

<p>It&#39;s like they played a game from the cold war in the internet age. </p>

<p>If I read that, I assume he meant &#39;was&#39;. Do you really think he was playing some clever trick of saying that he was &#39;woke&#39; when he was 3 and 9/11 happened?</p>

<p>You&#39;re being purposefully thick. That&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing downvotes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that since they managed to (somewhat) foil at least a good portion of the general public for a while, it wasn&#39;t the final straw. It probably will prove to be the most deplorable, in terms of destruction and lives lost (but this could be argued subjectively against larger wars started by the same groups and their families) - however the real undoing will be the thing you mentioned, people waking up. The Documentary &quot;Rich Man&#39;s Trick&quot; was entirely self-funded and produced, and it is to me the most important Deep-State awakening material I&#39;ve seen. Not because it outlines some sort of caught red-handed material, but because it so clearly outlines the long-term efforts of this collective in a brutally obvious way. Starting around the turn of the 20th century, to the start of the 21st, from Globalists to Nazi backers to Pirates with Airplanes (the CIA, that colluded with Oil tycoons, Dallas Police and the mob to assassinate JFK) and how this group would set the stage for the next 60 years of american &quot;diplomacy&quot; - efforts such as this video, loose change, the Corbett Report videos ...they&#39;re driven partially by people wanting to get the story straight, but even more so that motivation is guided by people just waking the hell up and saying this is so not right, given that it is 2017 and our world and all of its technology is still grappled in permanent chaos and corruption. So, you&#39;re right, but it wasn&#39;t necessarily the act itself, but the bell it rung in so many people&#39;s minds. Even if it takes a few chimes for us to hear the alarm clock, it keeps ringing. And we&#39;re getting the fuck out of bed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s pretty much what I meant. The act might not be as powerful as it is to people younger than me but you best believe that people younger than me are looking into it, with purpose. Try and stop em. This may be their undoing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Amen, yeah I basically agree with you. They were able to sequester the JFK stuff for a long time and bury it, but the internet age made 9/11 have too much lingering inconsistencies. And we&#39;re getting very comfortable with the fact that major institutions are too susceptible to being corrupted at the head or watered down to appease general interest to be trusted with finally uncovering anything of meaning, so individuals are beginning to become part of a massive collective of information sharing versus that of a single entity, which is truly invincible without the use of pure Owell-ian tactics, which they&#39;ve clearly engaged in but just as it only takes a few to breed corruption, it also only takes a few to disable it by speaking out. It is still a mess of misinformation and agendas, but I do think we&#39;re at least putting up the right front against being fed more and more lies. </p>
