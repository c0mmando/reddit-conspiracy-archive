        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Today, as many of you know, is Veterans Day. It is a day to honor the servicemen and women that fight for our country....however....today isn&#39;t really about them. I thank each and every one of you for risking your life (presumably) for mine.</p>

<p>However, i have a beef to pick with Veterans day. This day has become another day that the government has subliminally told us that what we are doing (wars) is totally fine and its how it should be. Its the military industrial complex who benefits from war, not the people. These veterans are not protecting our freedom, like the media wants you to think, what they are actually, and more sadly, are political pawns on a battlefield. These soldiers fight for corporations and politicians, and sadly the general public cannot understand that. We need to as a society stop fucking going to war. The only reason that we are at war is to pillage other nations while saying &quot;democracy!&quot; It is total bullshit and this mindset that the government on a daily basis installs in the general public without their knowing (psy-ops) is what actually pisses me off. </p>

<p>This is not attacking the veterans who have died, risked their lives for me, some dude behind a computer screen. This is an attack on the mindset that the government has installed in the general public that the military industrial complex is a total scam. Fuck the military industrial complex. Bring our soldiers home and give them a chance at a real, civilian life. Not one of chaos and destruction. No one deserves that. </p>

<p>Let the down votes begin.</p>

<p>Um you do realize that since 9/11 and beyond, anyone enlisting into the military had some speculation that they would be sent to war? Anyone who was sent to war (prior to 9/11) unexpectedly is most likely either retired or have left the military on their own accord.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are not forced into enlistment obviously, but I do think that they are brainwashed/manipulated into enlisting. This brainwashing happens by the media, politicians, and career military personnel. The people who enlist shouldnt be taught how to kill other people because of their religious beliefs, skin color or government style, they should be taught how to take care of the American citizens. Instead of giving them a rifle, maybe give them an education. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anecdotal evidence. </p>

<p>My point is that instead of going over seas to be taught how to kill, maybe we can teach them how to take care of citizens around the world. The only reason we are at war, ever, is because we go into another country and say &quot;we aren&#39;t leaving until there is a democratic government!&quot; How well has that worked for us? What if Russia wanted to set up base in our country and say communism is the right way to govern? Who says that there is a right way? The way we go about being the world police is completely backwards and hypocritical because if it was any other country that was the world police, the US would throw a fuckin hissy-fit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a very recent view of the US Military.  Our recent &quot;conflicts&quot; for sure are unnecessary.  And we often try to install democracy.  That isnt the purpose of the military.  If you look at historical events you see the need for a military that knows how to kill.  WW1 WW2 Korea.  All situations that didnt involve the US directly but we were needed.  All places where we still have an active military presence.  Whether we like it or not we are the world police.  People fear our military.  And rightfully so.  </p>

<p>All that said i would be perfectly fine calling back all of our soldiers in the sand box.  The middle east is a waste land and we arent fixing anything.  But having a presence in Europe and in Korea is more understandable to me.  We arent trying to change them we are just a presence.  A deterrent for future Hitlers if you will.  If they wanted us to leave they would ask us to leave.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for your service.</p>

<p>I do agree that there is humanitarian service that plays into the military, however, the media won&#39;t tell you that, nor will the people signing up to fight want to do that. Usually you hear &quot; Lets go kill some towheads&quot; which is totally assbjckwards. The only reason we are in the ME still is because of some BS war that was started by GWB, and that Obama and now Trump won&#39;t back out of. Why? Simple, military industrial complex is extremely powerful. Thats why Eisenhower, a 5 star general, warned the American people on his last day in office about the power that the military industrial complex holds. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol! not gonna compare twinkie eating with war fighting.</p>

<p>I&#39;m playing devils advocate here for the sake of ppl simply having the wrong idea on the mindset of the lowest foot soldier on the battlefield; no one, and i say no one meaning i havent met the person, is on the ground thinking that what he&#39;s doing is for the good of his country. to be quite honest with you, i figured out in bootcamp (basic training) that the whole &quot;fighting for ones country&quot; was bullshit lol.</p>

<p>Furthermore, America as a whole was manipulated and brainwashed after the events on 9/11 took place so the notion that military service members are being brainwashed like some MK Ultra mind fuck experiment is also bullshit lol. Did you ever stop and think that there are people who actually enjoy doing what they do? There are no shit human beings that enjoy going to war! The nostalgia of fighting alongside someone who you know has your back no matter what, the adrenaline you feel, the satisfaction and relief you feel when you survive.....people actually love that shit dog lol. And only a small few get to experience it, which also plays into satisfaction of it all. So no.....sorry, i&#39;ve never met anyone that has been manipulated and brainwashed into fighting. </p>

<p>People enlist b/c they would rather go to the military than college, the $$$, the benefits, the security of a job.....i could go on and on.</p>

<p>It&#39;s 2017 people, lets stop fueling this idea that military service members are mindless manipulated puppets directed to do the King&#39;s bidding. I mean shit, do any of you realize how much military contracting jobs are paying??? Based on your military background and experience, one could land a job paying 6 figs just to go sit in a 3rd world country for a year. Thats better than what the average American is making.</p>

The eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in 1918 a ceasefire was declared and fighting on the Western Front in France came to a halt. In the US this day morphed into Veterans Day, a day to celebrate all soldiers, living and dead. Knowing the history behind Veteran&#39;s day helps me appreciate it for what it is. </p>

    <div class="md"><p><strong>Imperial armies exist to remove violent, young, unemployed men from the homeland</strong> and send them to the periphery of the empire to pillage resources and rape the local women. Every empire has done this- Rome, Britain, and now the US. Empires collapse when those distant armies cannot be sustained, and the flow of (violent young men out/resources in) stops or reverses.</p>

<p><strong>The military is essentially a welfare program.</strong> It exchanges obedience to the current elites for food, shelter, education, healthcare, and hiring preference. It also sustains thousands of contracting companies as corporate welfare.</p>

<p><strong>Imagine what would happen to the US economy if the military disappeared.</strong> No more military bases dotting the south (50% of the economy in some states). No more giant defense contracts making jobs and propping up the stock market. No more college or healthcare for all these poor, ignorant, impulsive young men. And suddenly we&#39;d have a couple million additional unemployed people looking for work!</p>

<p><strong>There would be a revolution.</strong></p>

<p>So when you thank a vet, you&#39;re part of the problem. Don&#39;t thank a vet, explain to them how they were bribed into joining a pyramid scheme to prop up the current corrupt regime. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have nothing but respect for those soldiers who have fought or are fighting. I feel sad for them because they are used as political pawns and are seen as expendable by the military industrial complex. Thanks for the history lesson, I didn&#39;t know thats how we got to where we are today. Sadly, today I feel like the message has been distorted by the media and is now used to promote war. </p>
