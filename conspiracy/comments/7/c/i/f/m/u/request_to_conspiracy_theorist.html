       Maybe something like this already exists and someone here can link to it. But it would be great to have a resource for people to access to help them get their message out easily and as painlessly as possible. For example I am in this process now and I am having a tough time figuring out what kind of images/media I can include to convey my message.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, doing the audio and voice over is a nightmare in itself - if I want it to be decent and taken seriously.

       I don't like the idea of leaving something so important up to chance. I would rather take the safe route and do it as well as possible. There is a big responsibility here. If you aren't in this situation you may not understand the logistics of this. There are reasons why you have to make sure you get it right the first time.

       Using that logic, you're probably going to fail. If you try and imitate what other people do, or what you perceive is "right," I promise you will come across as insincere. Be creative.

       I see what you are saying.. but I think you underestimate how important coming off as professional is. I feel I know my limitations in this way. Speaking publicly is not my strength at all. So I have to find something that works for me.

       I am trying that. But again it's a toss up for me.. if I come off too poorly speaking it may be better to use a robot voice. Also, because there is so much info I have to convey it may make it too difficult to do it naturally. I think this robot voice is pretty good. The first one on the list -

       Most people won't read the info.. that's why I need to do a video. To try to make it as entertaining as possible. If nothing else it makes it a bit less dry than reading... I could offer it both ways though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already tried to tell my story in a script form and people wouldn't bother reading that. And I tried to make it an entertaining story.
      </p>
      <p>
       This gets back to my point.. if you aren't talented at presenting info people struggle to get through it. People have been spoiled. I don't think this is an accident either. It's part of the game. Part of suppressing information. Info wars....

       What's more important though.. the way the info is presented or the info?
      </p>
      <p>
       If how the info is presented is anywhere near as important or more important than the info then do you see the problem? There are other aspects of this you would have to know the info to understand though...
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it this way.. imagine if you were the keeper of the secrets.. how could you make it difficult or impossible for someone to get important info out if they had it? Again.. this is all part of "info wars"... this is what I have to battle. If it was easy don't you think it would be done already? What do you think stops the truth from getting out?

       And that is why they are winning this info war.. they understand this.. Again.. without understanding it all you can't see that. It's essentially disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it to you this way.. Imagine I told you to explain to some random person on the street why you are a conspiracy theorist. Imagine how difficult that would be. Now ask yourself why that is... why it is so difficult. The same reason it is so difficult for us to explain this to the average person is the same reason it is so difficult to get deeper truths out. It is the complexity... the devil in the details.. the more important the truth the more difficult it is to get out.. because they have made it that way.. using the same methods.

       It seems very classic 'we are on a higher plain', 'you can't handle the truth etc'. But without you putting forward any evidence or even what your topic is roughly I cannot reasonably believe you

       It's not a higher plane anymore than you are on a higher plane than the people who don't believe in conspiracy theories at all. We are all brainwashed to some degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was just in a position where I was on a path to finding the truth - in certain areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's not something that is easy to understand. There are reasons I can't just make those things known here. I have to do that when the time is right. If I try to deliver the overall truths before I can explain why I knew this is the answer then I may be stopped before I can get the truth out..

       So is that why you couldn't explain to the average person on the street why they should believe in conspiracies? Because you are mystical?

       You aren't responding to my points. You have just made up your mind and are ignoring the reality. It isn't easy for you to explain the the average person why they should believe in conspiracies for the exact same reason it isn't easy for me to explain to everyone here what I have discovered... in both situations it is rare knowledge. I have simply put the time into it.. time that others haven't. Imagine a college professor trying to explain an advanced concept to a student.. it takes time for people to understand these things. Especially when there are forces working to prevent people from understanding them.

       You haven't tried to say why I couldn't convince someone. And yes you do need knowledge built up but you can do that in one post. And uni lecturers frequently tackle complicated issues that they expect students to get if they've done required reading etc

       I didn't think I needed to explain that.. but you are ignoring the reality of the situation. How do you know info is easy enough to convey in one post? And even if it was if it was all text most people wouldn't read it.. just like you say you have no reason to believe me they wouldn't have a reason to go through all the reading and thinking necessary. So I have to make that as easy to consume as possible.. and it's going to take time.

       It's like saying "why didn't Einstein just say E=MC2 and everyone hailed him a genius. There are things Einstein said that haven't been proven until modern times.
      </p>
      <p>
       My discovers are on that level.. they aren't easy to understand or believe or prove.. it took me years of study and maybe a whole lifetime to get to this point.

       So you think you could convince most people on the street to believe in conspiracies? If that is the case then what's the problem? Why hasn't everyone been convinced if it's that easy?

       Yes.. and I could have a series of videos too.. wouldn't it be better to have videos on Youtube rather than threads on here that would just go to the bottom of the page and disappear for ever? At least on Youtube people might run across them. Not on Reddit though where posts disappear never to be seen again...

       Well it would be something, build up to videos. Or start a blog, if what you have is really so important you'll be able to think of loads of ways to spread it.

      <p>
       People filter everything out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could tell you why that is.. but I want to include that in my info. What you don't realize is that if I don't do this right others will take info I put out and use it for their own purposes.. this has already happened. When this happens it dilutes my message.. then people have even less of a reason to take what I say seriously. Again, these are things you simply can't understand until you have tried to get info out. It's an impossible puzzle to solve. They have created this environment.

       But it isn't easy to get this info out ASAP. This info is different than something like what Snowden puts out or Assange or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said before.. this is something that requires a lot of study and thought. If I just told you what it was you would think it was crazy and there is no easy way to convince you. They have set it up this way as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But see even explaining this to you now gives away important info.. because it is part of my unique story. So let's say someone who really IS out for attention or money takes my story and uses it for their own content and they have an audience and I don't then I just look like someone trying to copy them rather than the other way around. This is why people like you being so skeptical and distrusting and accusatory is so damaging to someone like me.

       Others have said this too.. it isn't about glory. There is important stuff that needs to be done with this info and I believe I know how it should be done and what should be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       You and others just have a negative and paranoid mindset. Again.. you can't know the issues with this if you haven't been involved in this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have tried to contact journalists and other mainstream people.. and tried to give them the whole story. But like you they have no reason to believe me or I can't even get their attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again.. you are just speaking from a place of paranoia and lack of understanding. And it's sad because you and others are shooting yourselves in the foot.. the truth could be out if people just open their minds ironically.

       How could you know that if you don't know what the info is? You are making an assumption.. you lack imagination. If it was easy to get the truth out it would be out.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you have to realize is that most the time the truth doesn't get out not because someone can't say it.. but because the world wouldn't understand it.. but see.. I just gave out important info someone else will take and then I am just another guy... and it prevents me from getting the truth out more... but once again you can't understand this because you have never been in this position.. Just wasting time explaining this kind of thing over and over takes an immense amount of time.. Time that is wasted.

       Get kff your ass and start spreading it, I've suggested How. Care about people learning the truth not about you being the one to give it  out if you are being honest. Also if you're scared of being murdered going to mainstream press wouldn't exactly help

       Again.. if I just posted the info here there is so much of it and it is so complicated to digest only a handful of people would bother.. and likely the people who don't want the info out.. so I all I have done then is to maybe get myself killed or cancer...  these are the problems people can't see from the outside.

       That's fine.. I am not asking you to believe me.. just consider I might be telling the truth. Consider that there are issues involved you can't understand from the outside. If people can't understand that the truth will never get out. They have won.

       Robot voice is the opposite of professional. If you are trying to communicate with people, then a person needs to speak. Whenever I come across a robot voice video, I immediately hit the back button. Robot voice is never a solution. EVER!

       We are talking about levels of unprofessionalism here not levels of professionalism. I think people are blinded by the fact that most the people we see online or on TV are people who excel in this ability. Most in the world don't.. I am one of the worst. It's the lesser of 2 evils to me. You can't say which is better or worse without being me..

       Robot voice is extremely unprofessional. It is the quickest way to ensure that people do not listen to or watch your video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking in such a way that you have control over exactly how you say it is not an innate ability, it is a trained skill. If you do not train yourself to modulate your voice, then you will not be able to do so. Everyone can do it. Whether or not you want to work at it is a different issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't speak to your audience, then perhaps you have nothing to say.

       It takes time though.. and a good speaking voice. And as I said there is an immense amount of info I need to convey. If this was just a short video then you would be correct.. I could do that. But trying to do that for the amount of info I need to convey is overwhelming or would take too long.

       Most people won't read the info.. that's why I need to do a video. To try to make it as entertaining as possible. If nothing else it makes it a bit less dry than reading... I could offer it both ways though.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already tried to tell my story in a script form and people wouldn't bother reading that. And I tried to make it an entertaining story.
      </p>
      <p>
       This gets back to my point.. if you aren't talented at presenting info people struggle to get through it. People have been spoiled. I don't think this is an accident either. It's part of the game. Part of suppressing information. Info wars....

       You aren't reading my replies though. I already went over that.

       You aren't responding to my points. You have just made up your mind and are ignoring the reality. It isn't easy for you to explain the the average person why they should believe in conspiracies for the exact same reason it isn't easy for me to explain to everyone here what I have discovered... in both situations it is rare knowledge. I have simply put the time into it.. time that others haven't. Imagine a college professor trying to explain an advanced concept to a student.. it takes time for people to understand these things. Especially when there are forces working to prevent people from understanding them.

       Others have said this too.. it isn't about glory. There is important stuff that needs to be done with this info and I believe I know how it should be done and what should be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       You and others just have a negative and paranoid mindset. Again.. you can't know the issues with this if you haven't been involved in this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have tried to contact journalists and other mainstream people.. and tried to give them the whole story. But like you they have no reason to believe me or I can't even get their attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       So again.. you are just speaking from a place of paranoia and lack of understanding. And it's sad because you and others are shooting yourselves in the foot.. the truth could be out if people just open their minds ironically.
