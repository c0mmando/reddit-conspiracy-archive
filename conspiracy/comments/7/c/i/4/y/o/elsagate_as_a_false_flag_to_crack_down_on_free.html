       What if people with a desire to suppress free speech are creating these videos, not to target children, but to make it appear as though people are
       <em>
        trying
       </em>
       to target children? This would give youtube an excuse to engage in greater censorship, and as net neutrality is likely to be a thing of the past soon the role that major sites like youtube play in dispersing information will only become greater. If youtube can convince people that suppressing free speech is a good thing (think of the children!) it will only become more normalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that relying on automated content filters to provide children with appropriate content was a terrible idea to begin with. When we have better AI this may well become feasible, but as our technology stands right now it simply isn't viable to expect a content filter to do a perfect job. It's fucked up that these videos are being made, but consider carefully what the appropriate response should be. Parents should be given an easy way (if one doesn't already exist) to put their children's accounts in a whitelist mode, such that they can only view specifically approved channels and videos. Watch carefully for the backlash of elsagate to move into freedom of speech suppressing territory.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing I've noticed is that the views of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       and similar communities are easily influenced by moral outrage into supporting short-sighted opinions. Think long-term. Freedom of speech is the real thing at risk here, there are better ways of protecting children than empowering censorship.

       We think we are but usually we are not alone with our thoughts. The major red flag for me was how all these big corporations were not petitioning YT behind the scenes to remove the content for copyright infringement. They are quick to pull other infringing content down but  allowed these for how long?

       That's the implication I intended. However, it is also possible that one group is making these videos to target children and easy revenue, and another is trying to exploit it to further their political ends.

       While those two entities are somewhat connected, or hand-in-glove, I do think they're creating the videos for different reasons.  One money and trafficking, the other now sees political opportunity.

       Eh. The big original videos were made by some guys that used to do those shitty ass youtube prank videos. Two of the dues that are in it are the Bradberry brothers. They made some of those pranks in the hood videos. H3H3 made a video on it a few months ago. Are they weird? Fuck yes. But they weren't made by some shadowy cabal or people with a complex agenda like this. They were made by douches who know that kids dictate what is popular on youtube.

       This is completely incorrect. The trend of these videos did not come from a single source. It especially didn't come from a barely successful Youtube prank channel, they just cashed in on it.

       Google removes and blocks a ton of material. That being said, a channel with multiple copyright violations as well as objectionable content, being allowed to propagate suggests there is an alternative angle to it. De facto.

       I'm 75% sure the Federal Gov't will use this to pass legislation to regulate and monitor the internet, selling it as "necessary to protect the children." The same with all the hit pieces coming out about ISIS radicalizing US teens over social media.

       I doubt it's just a false flag. When I looked into Elsagate I found a couple who was making the videos together. Both of them separately had 2 other channels with just as many views and subscribers. Together they are taking in a lot of money together.

       I work for an MCN and one of the Elsagate channels is in our network. I can share some non-identifying details.

       <li>
        They're coming from Vietnam

       <li>
        They don't make very much money, even though their viewership is insane (they can't monetize well with the constant trademark violations)

       Honestly, it seems like people with little grasp of the English language are eking out a living with stupid video arbitrage. They can't make videos for adults because of their language abilities, so... creepy ass "kids" videos. It's a better living than being a prostitute or being a mechanical turk, right?

       Yeah I'm not a talent manager or anything so I don't know for certain, but I do have access to the numbers. They've got the same viewership as our top top channels but make a fraction of the money.

       Do you know if any of these videos are included in Google Preferred? They say Google Preferred is a compilation of their top subscribing channels and videos. Some of the Elsagate videos have upwards of 10MM views so I suspect some of em may fall with GP

       I thought about this, but then I noticed that a lot of these users that upload them seem like pedophiles, and the "gibberish" comments actually contain content related to human trafficking and murder when decoded.
 I haven't figured out every method used to write these coded messages, but I noticed that a lot of them are letters and numbers meant to be typed on a Thai keyboard. If you type it on the Thai keyboard and translate it to English, you have hidden messages. 
I assume that some of the ones that I haven't been able to figure out may just be children typing random keys, but I don't think they would comment on somebody else's comment if that were the case. I've also noticed that a lot of these comments are HUGE chains of dozens of comments and most have many likes, so it cannot just be children. 
This is definitely something. There is a possibility that it may be bots, but I don't think that bots would talk about arranging meetings and discuss prices in Bitcoin...

       Interesting, but some examples and corresponding decoded text would be useful. Even if that is so, a well-executed false flag would include details like this.

       I just found this out and haven't had too much time to research it, but I've translated a handful of comments so far, and others that have helped have found comments relating to prices in bitcoin, Satanic rituals, and using suphuric acid to get rid of bodies on the first post linked. On the second post, which is way more detailed than mine, other users have found comments about meetups, money exchanges, serial killers. I'm sorry that I don't have a ton of time to write a better response, but there are a lot of details in both links. You should really check it out

       If YouTube wanted to crack down on free speech, they wouldn't wait until perverted kid videos to do it.  In fact they already did it.  They've been doing it for at least a year now.

       You are a moron, but that's okay. A lot of people are, so in some remote sense you are in good company. If you had actually read my post, here is what you should be pushing for to help your child (who I pity, given the parenting he/she must have to tolerate)

      <blockquote>

        Parents should be given an easy way (if one doesn't already exist) to put their children's accounts in a whitelist mode, such that they can only view specifically approved channels and videos.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Past that, you are trusting an automated filter. That is poor parenting.

       Or maybe freedom of speech doesn't apply to morally repugnant content. Your freedom to swing your fist stops the minute it impacts my person. Same goes with making harmful content that has pedophilic undertones. This is not political speech, this is disgusting trash that no human, however old, should be subjected to. I would be completely fine with rounding up the people who made these videos, and hanging them in a public place until they are dead. And anyone who supports pedo speech with them, you faggot.

       The funny thing is that since you think you have the moral high ground, you can't see what a disgusting person you are for making comments like this. When I said I pity your child, I mean that genuinely.

       Which part did you find disgusting exactly? There are times in life when moral outrage is called for. Psychological attacks on children are one of them.

       You never answered any of my questions. You ramble on about some dumb and complicated solution to a very simple problem. Maybe you are not a faggot. Maybe you are just autistic. I stand by everything I have said.

       Yeah I'm not a talent manager or anything so I don't know for certain, but I do have access to the numbers. They've got the same viewership as our top top channels but make a fraction of the money.
