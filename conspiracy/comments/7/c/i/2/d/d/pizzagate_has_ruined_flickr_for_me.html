       I'm a photographer and father of two young girls.  Unsurprisingly since they were born I've taken lots and lots of photos of my beautiful daughters and for the longest time I've uploaded those to Flickr to share with friends and family.  I also happen to be a Flickr Pro user which means I get access to statistics on how many hits they get and where the search results come from.  I started paying a lot more attention to those stats once Pizzagate broke as a story and I noticed some troubling trends.  I usually get a hundred or so hits on my photos on any given day.  When I upload new pics that will be increased as people are seeing stuff from my links or general feeds and go on to browse my photostream.  On days like that if I post a few links to various subreddits or Facebook it'll help push those stats and I'll get maybe a few hundred.  Every once and awhile I would see something really concerning, I'd see pics of my kids getting thousands of hits.  The most logical conclusion in my mind is that a bunch of pervy types are passing around links on message boards.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've since locked down all my family pics.  I can give access to my friends and family but it makes pic sharing kind of a pain in the ass.  It feels so disgusting to think that some pedo is drooling over my kids.  I hate that it has to be locked down, as a photographer I love sharing my pics with the world but I can't stand the thought of those fucking deviants looking at them.

       I've gone as far as getting a court approved parenting plan that prevents any of my children's parents from posting my kid's likeness on social media or face contempt of court charges.

       What? There has to be something missing from this story, how did you convince the court to agree to this? Was this a divorce and you were just adamant that you don't want your kids on social media or something? How does it effect the entire family? Do you monitor all of their social media and report violations? Wouldn't they need to all be individually told about this? What happens if someones great uncles nephews daughter posted a photo from a family reunion, is she smacked with a contempt charge?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the million questions, I'm really not trying to throw shade at you, just courts and law in general is a big interest of line (no so much family court) and I have never heard anything like this, I'm 100% not asking you to dox yourself or anyone else but if you could mask all the personal/private information I would love to see the court order, just sounds super interesting

       My children have a 29 page parenting plan and all adult family members have a copy. It was a result of a family member "advertising" children.

       Enough said, that makes much more sense, I was in disbelief thinking this was just an out of the blue request or part of a brutal divorce that a judge actually approved, thanks for clearing that up though

       Not going to lie. I intentionally try to forget about pizzagate. I was actually watching Hancock in the background when browsing here and saw the post about the heart within the heart “girl love” in the movie. I can’t believe I didn’t notice it before as many times as I’ve seen the FBI symbols

       Convenience always comes at a cost.  Cancel your account, print the photos and send them by post.  Up until recently that's how we all did it.  Much more rewarding.

       imgsrc.ru is a much worse website. There are probably tens of thousands of albums focused on children/young teenagers in suggestive outfits/positions. I think the worst part about it are the password restricted albums; People will give you the passwords if you share your own content with them, it's an endless cycle of pedophiles creating and trading material.

       Someone definitely needs to look into this website.
