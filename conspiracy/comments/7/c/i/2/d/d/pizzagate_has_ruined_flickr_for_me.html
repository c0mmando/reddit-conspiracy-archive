        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m a photographer and father of two young girls.  Unsurprisingly since they were born I&#39;ve taken lots and lots of photos of my beautiful daughters and for the longest time I&#39;ve uploaded those to Flickr to share with friends and family.  I also happen to be a Flickr Pro user which means I get access to statistics on how many hits they get and where the search results come from.  I started paying a lot more attention to those stats once Pizzagate broke as a story and I noticed some troubling trends.  I usually get a hundred or so hits on my photos on any given day.  When I upload new pics that will be increased as people are seeing stuff from my links or general feeds and go on to browse my photostream.  On days like that if I post a few links to various subreddits or Facebook it&#39;ll help push those stats and I&#39;ll get maybe a few hundred.  Every once and awhile I would see something really concerning, I&#39;d see pics of my kids getting thousands of hits.  The most logical conclusion in my mind is that a bunch of pervy types are passing around links on message boards.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve since locked down all my family pics.  I can give access to my friends and family but it makes pic sharing kind of a pain in the ass.  It feels so disgusting to think that some pedo is drooling over my kids.  I hate that it has to be locked down, as a photographer I love sharing my pics with the world but I can&#39;t stand the thought of those fucking deviants looking at them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What? There has to be something missing from this story, how did you convince the court to agree to this? Was this a divorce and you were just adamant that you don&#39;t want your kids on social media or something? How does it effect the entire family? Do you monitor all of their social media and report violations? Wouldn&#39;t they need to all be individually told about this? What happens if someones great uncles nephews daughter posted a photo from a family reunion, is she smacked with a contempt charge?</p>

<p>Sorry for the million questions, I&#39;m really not trying to throw shade at you, just courts and law in general is a big interest of line (no so much family court) and I have never heard anything like this, I&#39;m 100% not asking you to dox yourself or anyone else but if you could mask all the personal/private information I would love to see the court order, just sounds super interesting </p>

    <div class="md"><p>imgsrc.ru is a much worse website. There are probably tens of thousands of albums focused on children/young teenagers in suggestive outfits/positions. I think the worst part about it are the password restricted albums; People will give you the passwords if you share your own content with them, it&#39;s an endless cycle of pedophiles creating and trading material. </p>

<p>Someone definitely needs to look into this website.</p>
