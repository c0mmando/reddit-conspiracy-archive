        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">51</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-11 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Kolyin.html">Kolyin</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Earlier there was a post defending Moore by claiming that the Post had tried to bribe people to pretend to be victims; the only evidence of this was a tweet from <a href="https://twitter.com/umpire43">Doug Lewis #MAGA</a>. </p>

<p>Turns out lots of people were curious about that claim, and started looking through the account&#39;s tweets. It turns out to be a rather bad fake--the account pretends to be a vet but mixes up terminology and the facts of his backstory.</p>

<p>Doug Lewis #MAGA has <a href="https://twitter.com/daveweigel/status/929102233806999553">two, three, or four Purple Hearts</a>. He left the Navy in 1972, but says he <a href="https://twitter.com/umpire43/status/929201893523574784">served on the Nimitz</a> -- a ship that wasn&#39;t delivered to the Navy until 1975. </p>

<p>[Edit: a commenter pointed out that I misread his Twitter bio, and he doesn&#39;t claim to have left the Navy in &#39;72. I did misread it, but I don&#39;t know if that <a href="https://twitter.com/umpire43/status/928791082506375168">fixes the problems with his dates</a>.]</p>

<p>Other allegations I can&#39;t confirm include no one of his name serving on the Kitty Hawk and mangling terminology an actual Navy vet would know (CN vs CVN).</p>

<p>This is loathsome. Someone is trying to defend Moore against very serious allegations by lying about the reporters who broke the story and pretending to be a vet to make his lies more credible. He&#39;s using stolen valor to cover for a possible act of child molestation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only problem with using the word larper is that it normalizes the behavior. I&#39;m glad you left it out.</p>

<p>If we just start dismissing these things as &quot;just another larper&quot; instead of discouraging the behavior, more people will likely do it.</p>

<p>I just thought of something kinda dumb / funny... Internet using humans all over the world should come up with international doxxing standards (like rules of war). Basically saying that if a Twitter user breaks certain rules, we should try to doxx them. </p>

<p>To me, this would qualify as a doxxible offense </p>

<p>I speak (a little, terrible) Russian, and it struck me as it&#39;s struck others that this account doesn&#39;t use apostrophes correctly. It&#39;s not true, as some have said, that Russian keyboards don&#39;t have apostrophes. But it is true that native users of Cyrillic have a hard time using them properly sometimes. So you might see someone using commas where apostrophes go, like this account does.</p>

<p>That is not what his profile says, you just don&#39;t understand what he&#39;s written. Normally I&#39;d think the &quot;22 years&quot; part would let you know you&#39;ve misunderstood something, but given that this is reddit I don&#39;t expect much of anything from anyone here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My knowledge is limited, I was prior Navy as an aviation electrician. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve only seen them in action on a carrier. They would run the ships newspaper, ship tv broadcasts(usually random stuff like weekly bingo, which amazingly is very popular and can have cool prizes), photographs of the deployment along with photographs for any events and sent to bigger Navy, the ship&#39;s deployment book(think high school yearbook, yeah I know), and random other stuff.</p>

<p>While they do sea tours, they also have jobs ashore including overseas. They can basically go anywhere and probably have jobs less in the spotlight that I know nothing about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>About five thousand people depending on the specific class and ship, out for at least 6 months at a time. Though us aviation guys tend to stick separate than the boat guys. Boat guys are attached for years to the same ship, so lots of cross socializing. Us aviation guys are attached to squadrons(mostly except AIMD which I&#39;m just listing if any other Navy guys want to get anal so ignore). Hence why I never socialized with any of the communication guys. I&#39;ve just seen the effects of their work.</p>

<p>I&#39;d add on that it&#39;s also like having lots of roommates. I slept in a room with ~87 other people who are usually in your job. Some good times, one day I remember waking up mid sleep to find my bunk-mate below me was having his mattress switched out for the bottom of a toilet. I definitely miss it.</p>

<p>There is a is a direct quote. Being published on Breitbart is not relevant, for any shills.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Moore said when Hannity asked him to respond to the dozens of establishment Republicans demanding he step down from his race for the U.S. Senate:</p>

<p>If you step aside for any allegation, then you might as well not run because when you run you’re going to get allegations. First, I would tell these individuals they wouldn’t make good judges. They wouldn’t make good people in the judicial system because you are innocent until proven guilty. In this case, this woman has waited over 40 years to bring a complaint four weeks out of an election? It’s obvious to the casual observer that something is up. We’re also doing an investigation and we have some evidence of some collusion here but we’re not ready to put that to the public just yet.</p>

<p>I speak (a little, terrible) Russian, and it struck me as it&#39;s struck others that this account doesn&#39;t use apostrophes correctly. It&#39;s not true, as some have said, that Russian keyboards don&#39;t have apostrophes. But it is true that native users of Cyrillic have a hard time using them properly sometimes. So you might see someone using commas where apostrophes go, like this account does.</p>

<p>You might be right! I glossed over the &quot;22 years,&quot; went straight to the dates. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this fixes the problems with the purple hearts, or his multiple birthplaces, or brothers who might be dead or not but definitely stand for the national anthem.</p>
