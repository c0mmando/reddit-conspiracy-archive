        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I’ve posted in TMOR, I made fun of conspiracy theories on AboveTopSecret, but I also post sincere discussions and articles on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> and I participated in ATS discussions with a truth seeking open mind.</p>

<p>I think there are conspiracy theorists in TMOR or Conspiratard, but instead of engaging the community of investigative minds here, they chose the nitpicking side because they want to keep a watchful eye on conspiracy theories in general but also don’t want to fall into the perceived pitfalls of believing without being backed up by consensus in the media and people they know IRL.</p>

<p>I think that both Conspiracy Theorists and Conspiracy Skeptics share in common the general subject matter, they just go about it differently. Since there are real people on both side but hostile tribal attitudes in both towards the other, it impedes the discourse. If there was a middle ground between conspiracy and TMOR there could be a place to investigate and debunk equally.</p>

<p>Isn’t it possible that a divide and conquer attitude is used by TPTB to divide people interested in Hidden History, Criminal Cabals and Secret Societies into camps that hate each other instead of cooperating to find the truth? By making sure skeptics and theorists are always divided they can slow progress towards the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I doubt it, I happen to think there is a conspiracy to infiltrate conspiracy groups (see Cass Sunstein) to make them look ridiculous and at the sametime that group also attacks them for those conspiracy theories.  I&#39;m sure a large amount of normal people/users get wrapped up in both side.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>TMOR doesn&#39;t do &quot;productive&quot; nitpicking...they slander and berate and belittle people, and they lie in accusing users and entire subs of being &quot;pro-nazi&quot;. The only thing I do on TMOR is lurk so I can see what terrible things they are saying about others and to ensure my posts aren&#39;t linked there, which some have been before.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think any middle ground should be established with TMOR as an anchor for one side. If you really hung around r/conspiracy you would see there is push back all the time against ideas and a demand for more rigorous thought. It doesn&#39;t always happen but it happens more often than not. I&#39;m sorry, but I generally disapprove of the activities and general tenor of TMOR.</p>

<p>No, I show up every day or two and check the first couple pages of the sub, and all I see usually is hostility. Also, why use the word &quot;conspiratard&quot; lol...perhaps you have spent a bit too much time there.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, shill accusations are part and parcel of Reddit nowadays. 2016 was a watershed moment, and agents from all sides are operating site-wide, especially here on r/conspiracy. I myself have been accused of being a shill, and only when I have gone against the DNC or the Russian Interference stories.</p>

They are happy doing their thing... and we don&#39;t need their help. There&#39;s a few people that walk the line between the two subs but not many... We can&#39;t post our topics there... and they can&#39;t comment on our threads here. It&#39;s prolly better that way... people are free to fraternize between the two subs, but I know people here have used my TMOR post history against me on this board... but TMOR has never called out my conspiracy post history as a negative. Different strokes for different folks... They are content watching the fish... they don&#39;t need to tap on the glass. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As a libertarian socialist I think we can collectivism the bottom of <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ihrBYwX.jpg">Maslow&#39;s Heirarchy of Needs</a> and allow people more freedom to participate in the top. If the lower class wasn’t spending 50% of their income on rent and 30% on food we would see more time for the top of that pyramid, where people can fulfill their desires like creative pursuits. Self-fulfillment can be an achievable goal for everyone, capitalism stands in the way of lots of people living their dreams, but society would be healthier if everyone had a chance to reach the top of the pyramid. </p>

<p>I think that since the government enforces property rights and enables the rich to exploit the poor that capitalism isn’t the only problem, but the nature of a coercive hierarchy inherent in the power structure of nations impede our potential.</p>

<p>Because they are diametrically opposed ideologies? Actual Anarchists believe in the non aggression principle. Marxists believe in stealing from the haves to give to the have nots forcefully.
