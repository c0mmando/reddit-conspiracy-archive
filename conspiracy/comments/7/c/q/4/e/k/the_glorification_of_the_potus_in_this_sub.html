      <p>
       Greetings all of my brothers and sisters of
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       .  While I can imagine what the predictable "far-left" or "far-right" responses will be to such a topic in this sub, I honestly want to spark a discussion and hopefully generate some dialogue for this community to do some reflecting on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have been reading this sub for MANY years. I was reading articles and discussions here for years before I even signed up for an account so I could participate (and oh, what a different place this (and Reddit) was back then) and am now a 4 year member.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Bush was president, this sub was extremely critical of him, as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Obama was president, this sub was extremely critical of him, as expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       It honestly seems as if half of the articles posted about Trump in this sub are positive while the other half are extremely critical of him. I'm not sure if this is by design - meaning that TPTB/Reddit have truly left us devoid of any platform to discuss things without being controlled/influenced/infiltrated by disinformation, divide-and-conquer techniques, and racist agent provocateurs.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand that Trump lead his campaign with the promise of "draining the swamp," ending corruption, and bringing the power back to the people, but  anybody who still believes that is either dillusional or just plain retarded  (pardon my French).
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess my confusion is - WHAT REALLY
       <em>
        HAS
       </em>
       HAPPENED TO THIS SUB?  Is it just more of this "T_D takeover" that has been going on for the past year?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is all this 4Chan L.A.R.P. stuff planted disinfo a psyop by the Trump Administration to co-opt and reinforce faith in the same constituents that drove him to the White House and keep their loyalty?
      </p>
      <p>
       Have we just come so far from our original purpose here and this sub literally doesn't represent what it was created to be? We now praise our POTUS? Meanwhile, the most probable and provable conspiracy theories that we can point to in the political spectrum lead directly to his doorstep.......
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe he IS super smart. Smart enough that his main goal is psychological warfare against his own people (?). Or maybe there are just too many internet savvy people who are so obsessed with him that they're unwittingly doing his dirty work for him?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thoughts.....?

       I'm not sure that he is. Entertainment, or at least his selected format of reality tv, doesn't benefit much from globalism as much as other industries.
      </p>
      <p>
       And real estate doesn't mix very well with globalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean he's not a "globalist puppet," just that his professional background is not that invested in globalism.

       The bankers and the Cabal decide the appointments.  The ones that Trump wanted were resisted.  You are right about that.  They threw Trump a bone or two, but that is about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The push was to surround Trump with New World Order globalist traitors from the very beginning so that Trump would not upset their treasonous plans.  This is exactly what Trump appears to be doing.  I mean, he better be...

       You read about those people and how "bad" they were from the same sources talking shit about Trump. None of us know Trump personally, only edited and cartoonishly exaggerated and filtered shit. None of us know who he really is. It could very well be everyone he appointed is a great person but slandered by the actual evil assholes under the guise of being "good".

       That's not even a serious question. Why did some people like Obama? Are you so biased that you can't fathom why any person could actually like Trump?

       To answer the question, some people like Trump because he is winning the culture war. Liberals have never looked more clueless. This is a refreshing moment for some conservatives.

       Pay attention to all that is happening.  Do you enjoy OPEC and our dependency on oil and gas? Do you love banks raping everyone? How about all the JFK files.  Does it make you happy that CIA/FBI worked to assassinate a great president and lied to the public? What else have they done for profit for Rothschild? What would Clinton had done today? Push for more dependency on Saud? Yup.  Pushed for identity politics? Yup  Favored more tax on middle class? Yup.  Go to war for Rothschild? Yup. The same slave style of do more for the elites and fuck the peasants. Bush, Obama, Clinton
      </p>
      <p>
       I've had a hard time with Trumps appointees.  I know that Clinton was supposed to win.  I wasn't a fan of Trump.  But after the election I couldn't help but think how fucking bad the media predicted the election.  I'm a data scientist and I know how and who does the analysis for the media.   They don't fall this hard on their face.  Especially when simple survey and analysis done by private companies painted a very different picture.  Most likely NSA or someone stopped CIA from rigging the election in Clinton's favor.  Sorry if you don't believe it but I'm certain that was the case.  They expected her to win.  Also keep in mind that Trump is NOT the master here.  Some group of people have selected Trump to play this part.  He is working with them.  So when you play politics at that level - you have to do certain things that sometimes don't make sense to others.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is even more interesting? Liberals for years have been against big government, banks, OPEC, big Oil, wars and so forth.  Now they are adamantly against what is happening here because Trump is the face leading the charge.   The media has literally taken everything they believe in and made them hate it because of 1 man.

       What planet do you live on?  He has the former chairman of Exxon as his secretary of state, he has lifted regulations on banks,  and he has increased military spending and threatened war against several countries.  When have liberals been against OPEC?  The only people against OPEC are big american oil companies, not liberals.  Trump is leading the charge for US corporations, not  liberalism.

       Since none of that happened, I'll say no president would do that, and presidents threatening war over imaginary events is probably grounds for removal via the 25th amendment.

       I gave a source for my threat story, where's yours, honeypie?  "Russia"  didn't pay the C.F. $100 million, most of that was from Frank Giustra, a Canadian, who had divested from U1 at the time.

       Judge him by his record i say. I'm longest standing moderator here and on face value i think Trump is just another presidential turd in the toilet bowl of American politics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd love to be proved wrong but so far i haven't seen shit, i think he's just another puppet - a gormless one and his actions against climate change data and science only reinforces the idea that he is just another corporate token for the elite and a really stupid one at that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admittedly the media has been on his case since day one in a breathtaking way but i have seen little to make me think he is a pioneer, or some sort of saviour of the American democratic system.

       We're less critical of Trump because it's obvious the media and the deep state do not like him and want him out. So we see him as an outsider to the machine, and perhaps one of us. We are obviously wary of his ties to big money, big donors, Epstein, etc., but maybe, just maybe he is different than the rest. Personally, I put him in the same category as I did Sanders - someone aware of the corruption and who wanted to put a stop to it.

       This so much. All Trump had to do was steal some populist talking points, make a few more up, and half of all right leaning people believe every single word of it. No proof, no evidence, he said it, so it is true. And the dude is the most prolific liar ever to be President.

       Not really. Trumps voter base was probably the most misinformed in modern times. The conspiracy and fake news apparatus was (and still is) directly behind Trump. He played to the lowest common denominators, the fears, the hate, the ignorance.

       You have a somewhat unique moment, where the elected representative and factions of the deep state are deeply antagonistic.   Most of the opposition, and critique of Trump, has been centered around this issue, you know, no way Brennon and Clapper are making things up, we believe our IC type of posturing.  That is not going to fly.    Very few are actually engaged in a policy critique, in fact the only time the media had a pro-Trump orgasm, was when he bombed Syria on a dubious pretext.

       The politics &amp; T_D crowd make their way over here and are shocked that this isn't a safe space for them. This is a conspiracy sub...so it's not shocking that there are lot of anti-government view points.

       The political talk will die down when a less controversial person is elected president I think.

       Reddit used to be a really nerdy site for scientific talk, and never being overly opinionated. It didn't even have a comment section before. Everything was about being neutral instead of childish opinionated crap.

       Most real conspiracy buffs know that IT DOESN’T MATTER WHO THE PRESIDENT IS. IT IS ALL THEATRE. FREEDOM OF CHOICE IS AN ILLUSION. OUR NATION IS NO LONGER A DEMOCRACY AND HAS NOT BEEN FOR A LONG TIME.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not every conspiracy is political. Conspiracies go above and beyond politics. You’re whining about people on this sub hoping that Donald Trump actually is anti-establishment and maybe, just maybe a good guy. Meanwhile the rest of the world and media are doing everything in their power to bring Trump down through this completely laughable “Russian meddling” narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should always be critical of the president, and I would say that most people who frequent this sub ARE critical of him. so stop whining and add something creative to this sub.

       It's still early so many supporters are still hopeful. So far he ended the CIA's Syrian terrorist program (although the Pentagon is still meddling), and he enforces existing Immigration Law. The majority of the Liberal Mainstream Media are attacking Trump voters 24/7, as well as inciting real-life violence against since the campaign trail. These attacks, often seen as hypocritical and superficial, are isolating the community as victims and serve to embolden their support of POTUS. I don't trust the guy or anybody else in politics, but it is interesting enough to watch. Let's focus on his actual policies, good and bad, and refrain from fanaticism on both sides i.e. MAGA-boosting and Donald-shaming.

       I think the flaw people fall into is that Trump receives so much negative press from MSM that he must be against the establishment and they're all against him. First, this is the message Trump/Bannon weaved from the start- us versus them. He plays into it, instigates it, flames it and the media loves it. No one really watches cable news or read newspapers, so they need drama to suck people in to watching for ratings. He helps them with his tweets, in party leaks, basically the same negative media presence he's always sought. As long as your name is out there, you're relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, people forget the negative press of George W and Clinton during their first 100 days. Both hadn't accomplished anything, no significant legislation passed and did stupid things in public (Bushisms and Clinton scandals popping up). Bush got to have the whole 9/11 to conveniently prop him up to a second term and change the press for a while. I wouldn't be surprised if we get a fake war soon for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, everything leading up to the election showed that people simply (and rightly) hated Hillary more than they hated Trump. Lesser of two evils was the term bandied about. Even here it is "yeah he's a crook, but it would be worse with Hillary." True, but doesn't mean Trump has our best interests in mind or is some revolutionary comrade. At least Trump is entertaining, even if his campaign promises were just populist rhetoric and his administration is filled with bankers/liars/Zionists.

       On the whole r/Conspracy and most of reddit is anti Trump. Perhaps because of the paid shills, or maybe as people read only the headline.

       The reason I think I don't have such a problem with Trump (Daddy) is because the media hates him, the establishment hates him and he resonates with the people. He must be doing something right.

I'm not sure if this is by design - meaning that TPTB/Reddit have truly left us devoid of any platform to discuss things without being controlled/influenced/infiltrated by disinformation, divide-and-conquer techniques, and racist agent provocateurs.

       Seems like the simplest explanation.

       After years of being dominated by left-wing shills, Reddit is now a battleground for shills from both sides. This sub is particularly prone in that it does not maintain the strict ideological bubble seen in other subs, nor does it ban users simply for being subscribed to blacklisted subs.
