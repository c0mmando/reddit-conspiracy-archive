<p>It&#39;s a fake, manufactured &quot;scandal&quot; by right wing kooks and the moronic Trump administration, his lackeys, and his pea brained supporters. All a ruse to try and take the heat off the real scandal, that Trump personally colluded with Russia and Putin to win the election and directed his entire campaign staff to do so. </p>

<p>Far more evidence directly linking Trump to going out of his way to collude with Russia/Putin to win the election than anything Uranium One. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really.  It&#39;s a uranium mine.  American workers extract the ore and process it then it is presumably sold in the nuclear energy market.   Uranium must be enriched in order to make it usable as fuel for nuclear reactors.  It must be highly enriched in order to be used in nuclear weapons.  It would be a stretch to think that Russia purchased Uranium One (for about 1.3 billion) for the sole purpose of obtaining the rights to the Willow Creek mine just so they could ship it off for some dark, nefarious purpose.  It&#39;s ridiculous because; 1.  Russia has around 600 tons of Highly Enriched Uranium stockpiled already... and 2. Willow Creek ran an operating deficit of about $10 million last year.  I don&#39;t really think Russia gives a rip about our uranium.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump talking to Putin is not high treason.</p>

<p>The Clintons and Obama didn&#39;t sell anything.  If you want to get into influence peddling... have at it.  Unseemly, yes... Illegal, no.  Uranium One was a Canadian-owned company.  The owners of that company are the ones that did the selling.   CFIUS reviewed the sale and did not block it.  The sale transferred the mining rights for the Willow Creek operation to Rosatom.  It was a full two years before Willow Creek became operational.  They are not producing significant amounts of uranium today... in fact in 2016 they ran a $10 million operating deficit.  </p>

<p>The goal of the Rosatom purchase of Uranium One was their Kazakhstan operation... not Willow Creek.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no, the person who got the most electoral votes was. Trump did. He appointed Sessions, who is apparently “the swamp”, despite all that stuff about draining it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question, I&#39;ve posted this same question in another thread, looking to see if anyone knows the answer. I&#39;ve researched and can&#39;t find anything definitive. Can Trump and/or Mnuchin reverse the Council of Foreign Investment (I think that&#39;s the 9 person panel name) decision on Uranium One? For example, can they reverse it and require Uranium One to divest their interest in the US mines to a company/companies cleared as a non-national security threat? I&#39;m not sure, but I think Obama or Bush did that with some Chinese companies. Seems that if it is questionable, not in the US interest, etc... the admi  should push to reverse it...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I would assume the same. Prior examples against China called out that their access to mines or factories were in close proximity to military bases. Seems the same could be used in this U1 situation, if not just a blanket that we know determine that uranium is a resource that is in out best interest to maintain at home.</p>
