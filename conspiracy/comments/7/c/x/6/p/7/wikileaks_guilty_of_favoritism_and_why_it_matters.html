<p>IT DOESNT.</p>

<p>If the DNC or MSM media can prove WL fabricated evidence or purposefully leaked bad info then maybe this nothingburger will matter.  This story appears to be an attempt by Bush/Clinton Cabal to get ahead of other leaks coming.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I&#39;am not a shill.  I&#39;am a free thinker that has been both supportive and critical of Trump in the last 12 months. Check my post history.  </p>

<p>Here is what we know for certain.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>WL &amp; Assange are Anti HRC, Bush/Clinton Cabal and anti globalists.</p></li>
<li><p>WL has as far as I know have a 100% track record in terms of truth and accuracy with their leaks.</p></li>
<li><p>WL has ALWAYS held on to intel. Holding on to intel is a strategic bargaining chip for WL.  If WL were to release all leaks and all info it has they would have NOTHING to use as leverage to keep themselves and their families safe.  (WL and ASSANGE HAVE HAD A DEAD MAN FILE FOR AT LEAST 5 YEARS)</p></li>
<li><p>WL appears to be Jedi mind tricking Trump into giving WL info they can then use later as said bargaining chip.</p></li>
<li><p>This story is more about attacking the source in hopes of discrediting the content by association.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>BOTTOM LINE</p>

<p>This really doesnt matter at all and anyone with half a brain could see Assange was very anti HRC and was going to do whatever it took while still telling the truth to ensure HRC didnt end up in white house......  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not disagreeing that Wikileaks could be a compartmentalized branch of intelligence agencies, but even if they had released incriminating information on people (which they have already), it wouldn&#39;t be their decision who goes to jail and who doesn&#39;t. Putting someone in jail because of illegally obtained emails isn&#39;t an easy task, especially when your targets are millionaire political moguls with the best lawyers in the world.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calculated releases as a way to keep the American public distracted also doesn&#39;t send anyone to jail regardless of their attorney or their status. What has WikiLeaks provided that was truly information that seems outside the realm of intelligence with the goals being to divide, distract, and make submissive of those who follow them? My opinion is of that WL is a CIA operation, planned to be a leader for theorists and political activists, with a shining track record, and a lovable (and in danger I may add) leader... so they don&#39;t try and do anything themselves.. because hey, WL has us covered. They&#39;re going to save the world. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then what I&#39;m asking for is to provide proof that they are &#39;for the people&#39; as they claim to be. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got an idea. We&#39;re going to create a front org with a great track record. It&#39;s target demographic is edgy conspiracy type folks and political party fringes. We&#39;re going to drop TONS of information on them, and make sure nothing can be discredited. We&#39;re going to gain this target demographics trust and let them feel as if people are working towards making their quality of life improve. We&#39;re going to hand pick a quality leader for this group, and put him in danger. We want to emphasize that danger to tap into our target demographic&#39;s emotions. We&#39;ll release 2 year old tech from the CIA and tons of emails to let them chase anything they can. We&#39;ll imply guilt among world figures to get our demographic against those particular people. We will distract them. And any of them stupid enough to try and send us information will be delivering it directly to us, so we will control those leaks and monitor those people. </p>

<p>In the case of the Podesta emails, yes, it exposed what I had thought for a long time, that the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/hillary-clinton-wikileaks-email-isis-saudi-arabia-qatar-us-allies-funding-barack-obama-knew-all-a7362071.html">Obama administration knew that Saudi Arabia &amp; Qatar were funding ISIS</a>, while our government continued to supply both countries with billions in weapons.  </p>

<p>You think they carefully selected the emails out of the 20,000 that were leaked?  Seriously?  I mean, I&#39;ve seen that argument used against the Intercept (and paradise papers) for selectively releasing data, but the argument is normally against their technique of mass dumping emails. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listen BUBBA (google Hunter S. Thompson for fuck&#39;s sake.. good job on whoever made the Chappelle joke though) - If an organization wants the public to believe something to be true, do you think they&#39;re going to half ass it the same way you do at your 9-5? Forgive me, maybe you&#39;re a hard worker. Perhaps not a worker at all. I digress. 20k emails - that&#39;s a lot of information to look through. That will certainly keep the public busy, eh? To the point people were looking for code-words and what have you. A simple solution to that is to plan in advance. Separate e-mail accounts, leak them all after being vetted, boom let the tin foil hats go read this shit for a while.. and when they(we/ish) were done, we&#39;ve got more on the plate for you. They&#39;ll keep feeding so long as we keep eating. Frankly, I&#39;ve lost my appetite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry, I understand this shows Wikileaks DMing DTJ, and them discussing a tactic to sway voters, but isn&#39;t this some of the same things media outlets do with campaigns? I understand Wikileaks may have been the deciding factor in the election, but they did provide transparency. Also, doesn&#39;t the chain of messages he released pretty much disprove the whole &quot;Trump colluded with Putin and Wikileaks from the start&quot; narrative? The DM chain shows DTJ had little idea what Wikileaks was up to. Also, it&#39;s confirmed Assange wasn&#39;t able to access internet Oct. 17. I&#39;m just looking at this from all angles. It does show correspondence between the two, but this would be brushed off in court instantly. DTJ already submitted it to congress.
I keep seeing &quot;THIS IS BIGGER THAN WATERGATE&quot; all over Twitter, but really? It&#39;s a Twitter DM.</p>

<p>Hm yes and the CIA just collects intelligence. They&#39;re a political organization with an agenda and they propagandize by leaking dirt on their political opponents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They aren&#39;t disseminating &quot;The Truth&quot; and aren&#39;t on the witness stand in court for anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m simply pointing out that &quot;The Truth&quot; and &quot;Nothing But The Truth&quot; is insufficient to make a clear judgment of any kind, which is why the OP&#39;s #2 point is completely irrelevant. No matter how much of, say, Clinton&#39;s dirty laundry is aired by Wikileaks, it is impossible to make a <em>comparative</em> judgement between her and, say, Trump, unless his laundry has been similarly aired. </p>

<p>Wikileaks is a trans-national political organization who drives their agenda through leaks that are strategically done to target their political opponents. The CIA does the same stuff, so did the KGB, it&#39;s nothing new, the only difference is that Wikileaks is not (to our knowledge) an arm of a particular state.</p>

Their only real obligation is to provide a safe way for sources to leak and to guard the identity of those sources. Which is why we can&#39;t get JA to just outright say it was Seth Rich.</p>

<p>There is thread on Hot about how the media selectively posted the DMs. I find both very similar yet on complete opposite of the partisan dividing line. I think if whichever side you are, you use the same analysis on both you will come to a unbiased opinion on the merits i perception.</p>
