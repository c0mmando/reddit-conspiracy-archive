<p>What even is this place any more? Will you please start banning people and reporting them to admins who are vote manipulators? I sent the mods of <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> a message awhile back, it had a video of a guy who has 100s of accounts just switching from name to name upvoting and downvoting. He does it all within not much time too and he can control anything that gets posted here.</p>

<p>Why would you not ban this person(have you)? He even shows his usernames in the video because he is an idiot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s actually pretty easy to statistically verify that someone is manipulating votes. Someone could write a simple program to track the average levels of voting based on time, number of users, etc. and if a post deviates from that such that there is a vanishingly small probability that the total is not due to bots, you remove the offending material.</p>

<p>These operations are usually not sophisticated. They will do things like put the exact same number of upvotes on all the comments they agree with, and the same number of downvotes on comments they disagree with.</p>

<p>Not true.  You can. If they&#39;re emotional and irrational and actually succumb to the urge to comment and make it obvious when they reply to a 5 month old thread and instantly are upvoted it&#39;s obvious. And the reddit admins can see it if they get off their ass and do their job. </p>

That and their calls for mod reform &quot;does anyone else think this sub is becoming ____?&quot; NO.

<p>That was, and is a coordinated shilling campaign. It&#39;s designed to avoid factual discussion, reinforce the 2 party kleptocracy by getting us to argue about which slave master is preferable, and subtly influence people to avoid bias against one party but not the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a &quot;belief&quot; it&#39;s an uncontroverted historical fact that these claims came from the CIA and other agencies that have proven themselves to be untrustworthy by their wholesale rape of the Constitution and the rule of law:</p>

<p>A secret CIA assessment found that Russian operatives covertly interfered in the election campaign in an attempt to ensure the Republican candidate’s victory, the Washington Post reported, citing officials briefed on the matter.</p>

<p>A separate report in the New York Times said intelligence officials had a “high confidence” that Russia was involved in hacking related to the election.</p>

<p>Why do people keep calling out account age?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>During the election the lowest quality shills weren&#39;t provided with accounts, so they had to make their own. This led to a spate of low quality shilling by brand new accounts. </p>

<p>Also because shills will talk about anything other than facts, and attacking someone&#39;s account age is a convenient way to infuriate people without actually dealing in facts.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;absolutely nothing.&quot; It always indicated a lack of foresight. If you switch accounts so often then why not make them ahead of time? Do you always go grocery shopping the moment you are hungry?</p>

<p>It also <em>can</em> be a strong indication of someone evading a ban. Using multiple accounts. Or, in general, it&#39;s a very strong indicator for identifying spam accounts sold freely on the open market. </p>

<p>I could post true things all day long and do nothing to help the astute reader because I don&#39;t <em>prove</em> what I&#39;m claiming.

<p>If you haven&#39;t figured it out, nothing is going to be done about any complaints, valid or not. We&#39;ve already had long discussions about all the issues here. Seriously.</p>

<p>This is Reddit. It is compromised. It is biased. The admins have been know to go into peoples comments and change them whenever they feel angsty. Mods are biased (we&#39;re ALL biased!). They have vote-manipulation algorithms in place, and shit-tons of bots, shills, haters, and people sitting around in their dirty underwear in various states of mental lucidity, slapping that up/down arrow (and other things) with glee while eliciting rank farts and volatile belches.</p>

<p>Use &quot;New&quot; or &quot;Controversial&quot; to sort and you should catch most of what would be voted out of normal reach otherwise. </p>

<p>But, hey. Let me know when you&#39;re successful in getting anyone of any authority here to do anything about these eternal complaints. I&#39;ll be the first one to raise my arms to the heavens and shout &quot;Hallelujah!&quot;  And I mean that. Please let me know.</p>

<p>In the meantime, maybe we should just sticky a thread about the obvious BS that goes on here, so when we&#39;re feeling angry about the usual XYZ we can hop on that thread and receive some carthartic back patting. </p>

<p>Obviously, the bots and shills will downvote me, just watch.</p>

<p>This is Reddit. It is compromised. It is biased. The admins have been known to go into peoples comments and change them whenever they feel angsty. Mods are biased (we&#39;re ALL biased!). They have vote-manipulation algorithms in place, and shit-tons of bots, shills, haters, and people sitting around in their dirty underwear in various states of mental lucidity, slapping that up/down arrow (and other things) with glee while eliciting rank farts and volatile belches.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shills want us to know that they&#39;re here causing problems. I think a lot of the posts made complaining about their presence is actually them trying to get us mad by overstating their prevalence and power. They aren&#39;t flooding comments constantly, they aren&#39;t heavily manipulating all votes. It comes in waves depending on if there&#39;s something they want to cover up, but they want us to think they have 100% power over that. </p>

<p>Notice how on posts about Trump/Russia/Republicans, he comments are all discussing the conspiracy or article at hand.</p>

<p>Yet if it&#39;&#39;s a post about the DNC/Podesta/Hillary/Obama/Biden/CNN/Antifa etc, the post will be upvoted yet the comments will be deflecting, attacking OP, attacking the source, attacking this sub, attacking conspiracies, or trying to derail the conversation to Trump/T_D.</p>

<p>Very easy to see through for most here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe be careful with so brazenly calling them out like that. Sometimes the shills intentionally try to get called shills, knowing that calling people shills is against rule #10. Sometimes they even have usernames like u/obviousshill.

    <div class="md"><p>Plus it wasn&#39;t pay to play, they used the wrong term. Pay to win usually means you can only get it by paying and gives you an advantage, like, it is hidden behind a paywall and you have to pay. In reality anyone can just play the game and you get the unlocks as you play, but I agree paying up front for the unlocks gives a disadvantage to noobs for sure. They should do like Destiny did, after the game was out for awhile they allowed you to buy a level pack that would level you up fully, but you still had to get the gear. It saves you time and helps you catch up since the game was already out for awhile. </p>

<p>When they release it right away it hurts everyone because they are at like a 25% damage disadvantage compared to the guy who paid money for unlocks.</p>
