        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I believe what happens to us after death to be the ultimate conspiracy.  For example, there have been many reports of children remembering previous lives lived under different families.  These reports are so credible, that reincarnation can almost be scientifically proven.  However, what does this mean for us exactly?  Do we travel in &#39;soul groups&#39;, or with a karass to do a specific function for God as Kurt Vonnegut suggested?  Does God consider a &quot;generation&quot; to be a group of souls or a group of bodies?  Finally, if it is true that we simply reincarnate, than what is to fear from Death besides forgetfulness?  Is there something more to fear?</p>

<p>We have seen groups of individuals over centuries realize physical goals through long term planning (see: the ruling families).  Is there long term planning with regard to reincarnation or are we just spirits playing with physicality without a purpose?  What is the point to bloodlines if it all gets scrambled spiritually?  What do you think happens after death, and is there a purpose to it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was an American journalist traveling through India around the 1920s that documented many cases in a dry journalistic fashion, but I cannot remember the name of the book - I have it around here somewhere, and in some cases the kids knew explicit details from other families that could not have been otherwise known.  If you search for &quot;reincarnation&quot; in Amazon though there is a bevy of studies, many of which are quite compelling.</p>

<p>Well, you&#39;re gonna need at least two people, right? Who is involved in the death conspiracy? Seems like more of an unanswered question to me.</p>

<p>Schroedinger thought there could be, at most, a single consciousness in the universe. I&#39;m with him. That means that when you die, either nothing happens, or <em>everything</em> happens.:)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are actually serious reincarnation cases and large studies have been done into the NDE-phenomenon.</p>

<p>But I had to learn about this through the internet, because in the mainstream I had never heard of serious reincarnation cases or the large studies done into NDEs. </p>

<p>So the scientific community is cognitively dissonant at the least and I do suspect a larger conspiracy to keep this type of information from the people. You don&#39;t want to empower us feeble peasants. We&#39;re much easier to control when we&#39;re lost and apathetic.</p>

<p>Did you know that we can induce NDEs? They stick you in a chair in a dark room &amp; spin you around real fast. It causes folks to have the prototypical NDE--they see a bright light, they move toward it, they feel that others are present in spirit form, etc. It&#39;s pretty interesting. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve probably seen every NDE video on YouTube. If that&#39;s your bag, check out the one by Nanci Danison. Not the 10 min one, the longer one. The Eben Alexander account is pretty well known. His story of meeting the sister he didn&#39;t know he had is pretty remarkable. There&#39;s a clip on youtube of Rue McClannahan telling her Celebrity Ghost Story, check that out too. If she is telling the truth--and I don&#39;t know why she&#39;d lie--it&#39;s one of the more interesting stories I&#39;ve heard. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have a link?</p>

<p>The classical NDE goes like this:</p>

<p>-Out of body experience
-Entering a black void and then seeing a tunnel of light
-Entering the tunnel fills someone with unconditional love and happiness
-At the end of tunnel the person is greeted by a dead relative or a light being/energy being. An explanation is given of what has happened.
-The person is then taken to a space where a life review is done. Each action in a person&#39;s life is then experienced from the eyes of the other. This way you understand how your actions impacted others.
-The final step is when someone is send back to our 3D-reality. Often there&#39;s a discussion with a higher consciousness because the subject does not want to go back. The new reality of the NDE is actually more real and people realize it&#39;s their real home.</p>

<p>Has this particular experience been replicated? I&#39;d love to see the research for that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is most certainly a conspiracy here. Many cultures around the world have great understanding of the afterlife that is MUCH more developed than the west, especially its relation with dreams. THe aboriginals australians, who were all but wiped out. The mayans who also...were all but wiped out. The africans, who lets be real, are being wiped out. Not to mention the Native Americans who were wiped out. The most developed documentation wise complete with the Book of the Dead, a guide on how to pass on to the afterlife, as well as a guide on how to pass on to the lucid dream world. The Tibetans are extremely repressed by the chinese and are being wiped out as well despite strong resistance. Many of these cultures share a lot more with eachother than they do the west&#39;s interpretation of dreams and the after life. There is indeed a great conspiracy, the Elite cultists certainly know there is more truth there but it is not knowledge they want spread among the masses, its empowering.</p>

<p>I agree.  I believe that the true nature of death, and, thus, the true nature of life are hidden from the common person.  I believe that if we knew more about reincarnation and the purpose of death, then we would be fully functional.  However, as it stands, I do not think we are full functional creatures as we are being discouraged from understanding these things.  For example, what if there is an escape from this physical plane after we learn a few things from reincarnation; however, the ruling class of this plane want to trap us here for servitude?  It is a valid question considering the push by the ruling elite to hide the fact of reincarnation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Y’all this is such a great discussion!! I don’t even know where to begin so I’ll just start.
1)I’ve heard first hand accounts of people tripping and having the crazy out of body experiences and seeing/meeting God/creator of everything. Correct me if I’m wrong- isn’t that WHY indigenous peoples use psychedelics so frequently?
B)My thoughts on reincarnation have drastically changed since becoming a Jesus loving, Bible reading born again Christian- I now believe in reincarnation (to be fair I’m not a expert nor have I done extensive or any research on reincarnation). 
C)I can’t get behind an after life conspiracy so to speak, but I do feel like there is more out there than most realize. I’ve read a few books about NDE and people going to heaven I even read one where the dude ended up in Hell. Maybe once we’re done with THIS life that we’re currently experiencing we do go to a Heaven/Hell and then our souls go to the next “level” until we’ve accomplished all that we’re truly set out to do. Like leveling up almost. 
4)I forget which philosopher (or if it even was a philosopher) said something to the effect of we are everyone we encounter. Essentially (this is kind of Matrix-y) the entire world that YOU know is just a variation of yourself that you created to fill in the voids and unknowns. We are all good and we are all evil. 
E)All we are is dust in the wind
F)We are becoming more aware of everything around us that doesn’t sense, our collective eyes are being opened, maybe we’re nearing the end of our collective journey- we’re starting to break down the 4th wall. But what if this is  just all in MY head. What is really real? </p>
