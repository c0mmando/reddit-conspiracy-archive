       Since about a week and a half after the shooting happened, I've heard practically nothing regarding the shooting. This was probably one of the most important mass shootings in history due to the fact it involved a major music artist and was one of the deadliest, yet it got covered the least?? The Weinstein scandal got more fucking publicity then it.
      </p>
      <p>
       What motive would there be for the media to not publish articles regarding it? There's so much content that we've barely heard anything about, and the more content they publish the more viewers they get which gives them more revenue. So what the fuck is going on?? Sorry for my language, this is just really bothering me.

       Have to agree. It almost seemed they were using the public to gauge which direction the narrative should go. Public awareness was reaching critical proportions, then useful distractions. Or sacrifices as I like to think of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most important thing is for them  to protect the government. A sacrifice like Weinstein and other big fishes appeal to the conspiracy theorist and pizzagaters and become more important than Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also worth noting that the general public has a short attention span it seems, but things are moving very fast now. It's not that Vegas is forgotten it just becomes yet another false flag to add to the growing pool.  People still talk about 9/11 Boston bombing, Sandy hook, we won't forget about Vegas but when they stopped even giving us info then that does kind of stopped what is available to analyze from official sources.  If anything this has shown us a lot about these false flags and how gov operates.

       the latest wrong datestamped (claimed CCTV) video from the strip mall is most interesting in its weirdness and bizarre actions of the actors in it.

       monday 2nd, a day late, as was the Pentagon 9/11 gate camera video.

       must be a technical legal thing so when its called out as fake it cannot be criminal fraud as it was a 'reenactment' not fraud.

       Lombardo goes up and says the door was secured, and they did a 2nd breach. Impossible unless he stopped in the middle of the shooting, shut the door, and "secured" it some other way- not using the lock. These rooms are connected by 2 doors that only lock from their respective sides. So either he walked out in the hall or he screwed it shut in the middle of the shooting, or he teleported back into the other room.

       I'm mostly pro-gun.  I'm prior military.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main reason I can't see the LV shooting or any potential (however unlikely) cover-up as being for an anti-gun talk is the fact that Sandy Hook happened without consequence.

       If you can't further legislate gun control on the deaths of young school children, it's a lost cause.

       Also, casinos have cameras everywhere but the rooms.  Not sure what further security they need, short of inspecting every bag coming in like the TSA, which I can't imagine they'd want.

       This is exactly the kind of discussion we need to have on this sub for it to be effective. I don't know too much about how it would affect gun legislation, but what you're saying makes sense. What does that leave as the only other option? That something big happened that we don't know about that night. Something involving the Saudi's and the helicopter landing on the roof of the helipad.

       I feel like this is, although pretty crazy, one of the most possible theories. The bright side of the story would be that their not talking because it actually did go down like that and they're still investigsting/retaliating.

       It could also just be that the police response wasn't adequate as there were officers already inside the Mandalay Bay for another situation/event either 1 or a few floors below ( ill have to look for the article again ) , maybe they are just trying to cover up why those officers heard the gunfire for 10mins and did nothing to stop it...  Just one possibility that you don't have to create saudi's shooting out of helicopters etc for..

       Have you studied Sandy Hook? Fakest false flag of all time. The children that "died there" amazingly performed at the Super Bowl that year. Have you seen the videos of their crisis actor parents laughing when they thought they were safe and off camera one second, then tearing up for the camera the next. Unlike LV no one was actually killed that day at the already closed down elementary school.

       Here's the thing though, sandy hook was going after semi-auto modern sporting rifles, which is something people will never give up and are 100% legal. A few days after the Vegas Shooting there was going to be a vote on a silencer bill. A lot better chance of having something not pass then making something legal, illegal.

       Incentive for a cover up is to smother the truth with the narrative. Because if the truth were revealed the ones responsible for the act and then the cover-up would be hurt.
       <br/>
       Who stands to gain are those doing the act and the covering up and telling the story.

       If you are told an epic story and you ask questions about the hero and the villain and all of the plot holes, and they give an answer that makes no sense in that universe... and then they stop answering questions about it without ever giving a decent answer to any important question... one might say that story is total shit.

       Why do you think? They're burying the story because they fucked up tremendously in covering up what actually happened. Attempting to come out with any new information would only discredit their official narrative even further.

       Official narrative as in the lone wolf story I mean. But I see what you mean. Their silence is everything. The nightclub shooting story was all that was talked about for like three months.

       I don't hate a concert theory because I'm 50/50 between OP gone wrong and planned false flag. What sucks is we will never know the truth of the story besides the truth that what they tell us is a lie.

       The only consensus is that the "official story" of a single-shooter, gambling drunk guy gone mad is 100%, absolute bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest is up to you to decide, but their story was so weak that wayyyy too many people (such as yourself) were asking questions and awakening, so they needed to get it out of the news cycle ASAP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you wake up to the truth that you're not being told the truth, you then go backwards and look at other 'incidents'..... and you won't like what you see.

       All official narratives are trying to pin it on a lone shooter, which is hilariously bullshit.  Consider that the upper floors of that hotel are owned by the Saudis, and on the night of the shooting, a helicopter was allowed to touch down and pick up a Saud prince (in the middle of a terrorist atrack.  Really?).  Consider that this particular prince was later arrested in that Saudi Arabia pseudo-coup for corruption and other charges.  Consider the NUMEROUS multiple shooter reports from those at the scene.  Note how the local police chief HAD to have a handler next to him and tell him what to say or let him know if he was saying too much.   Look at the alleged "hero" who was shot in the leg and a key witness to the biggest mass shooting in recent US history, but he was allowed to leave the country for alnost a week.  Then to only appear on fucking Ellen Degenerate and give his only interview, which was clearly led by Ellen herself and he just sat there and agreed with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing reeks of a huge and poorly managed cover-up.  Either there was a gun deal gone bad, an assassination attempt on a Saudi royal, or some other false flag theory to distract the public.  The official narrative is broken beyond repair, and instead of adding more band-aids, they are dropping it completely.  Very shitty damage control.

       Packed with explosives, and many theories also hypthosise that the fuel tanks at the airport were supposed to be blown up with it.  I didn't include that part because my text was becoming a wall lol.  So many things here point to multiple planners and a genuine full-scale terror attack to include a possible assassination.

       They said he had "some tannerite" in his car.  That could mean one single novelty target you can buy at any gun store in North America that makes a bang when you shoot it.

       If I’m not mistaken, I thought that the official story was 30 lbs of tannerite? Idk how powerful that would be, but I have shot a gallon sized milk jug full of tannerite in the desert before and it could definitely blow up a vehicle. I’d assume 30 lbs could be pretty devastating

       Your analysis is good. I remember watching a video of the seconds before the shooting started and hearIng two single rifle shots before the automatic fire started. Some people knew what that sound was and started walking away before all hell broke loose. Maybe paddock/someone was shooting at the tanks because the plan got f'ed up. Maybe the vehicle was supposed to be parked next to it. Or maybe the vehicle wasn't involved like FeenixArisen said below.

       We will probably not know for sure until 25 years for now, which sucks.  The beginning shots were either shooting the tanks or they were zeroing shots, not too sure.  But we can all agree that the car was meant to be used to do the biggest amount of damage, because i think that it was located upstream of where people were evacuating to.

       I am trying my best to dig it up but I am having a rough time.  I wouldn't worry too much about it because it was a smaller sized thread and had no real backup evidence outside of what i believe was a 4chan post.  There is also a chance i am mis-remembering what I read because there was so much stuff going on at the time and I was balls deep in all these versions of what could have really happened lol.

       We don’t hear about the Vegas shooter because every time we do they get caught in another lie.

      <p>
       The excuse of glorifying him is an old media trick used to distract us from the obvious holes in the narrative.

       So instead they start taking about child rapists and shootings in churches instead? And they will bring up the next shooting too. Its not because of copycats...

       It's a cover up for either something huge and international on lockdown by the feds or Mandalay Bay has enough money to control every piece of information coming out of LV about this. If it's found out that they were grossly negligent then they will go down completely and even if they aren't the quieter they can keep this the better for them. The lawsuits are coming so any scrap of evidence will be used by the litigants lawyers to bump up the settlements.  They want to keep everything as quiet as possible so their name  isn't in the news every single day about the shooting.

       I'm not sure what the true story is but I think the fact that it happened in Las Vegas has a lot to do with the limited information.  The casino industry and the city itself don't want to be in the papers all the time over a story that might drive conventions and tourists away.  They have enough clout to keep the information flow extremely limited and enough lawyers and private security advisors to keep the locals and Feds at arms length.
      </p>
      <p>
       All that said, there is absolutely no reason that this should hinder a "free" press from investigating and covering.  To be that's the truly odd part...

       It was a failed assassination attempt on the Saudi crown prince. He's the guy that was being escorted out of Tropicana under armed guard. Paddock was trying to set up the assassins with weapons but they panicked, killed him, and then tried to escape under cover of chaos once they realized the prince wasn't in the room right above them.

       I'm pretty sure that everything that can be proven in this theory has been. There's still a lot to it that we don't know if it's true because they won't release all the footage, and they probably never will, so we'll never know 100% what happened unfortunately.

       He performed the opening of an episode of Saturday Night Live on 10/7 where he said he was still coming to terms with what he saw.

       He played Tom Petty's "Won't Back Down." Maybe they were afraid to let him get in front of a mic again.

       Interesting note on the CMAs, there was an act where Eric Church, who also played the Vegas music festival, sang an acoustic version of Amazing Grace. It led into a group number with all the country stars singing together. It felt like a custom made moment for Aldean to put on a powerful performance. Instead they all sang the Hootie and the Blowfish hit "Hold My Hand" led by Darius Rucker. I'm my opinion that was an easy backup song everyone would know the words to and further pushed Vegas from our minds.

       It's very strange for sure. Sources within the hostage rescue team that was sent up the hotel to take him out say he fired on them, and then they shot him. Supposedly he had set up cameras streaming to somewhere for others to watch. They also found Antifa material, and there is links to ISIS. To me this sounds like a false flag, and I think the reason it's not being covered is because it's part of a larger investigation with many arrests being made around the world right now. The owner of the top five floors of Mandalay bay is a Saudi Arabian prince and has been recently arrested. There is a major purge happening, and continuing this coming week. The cabal is being rounded up, and there is going to be massive civil unrest when you see who will be next. The American left is going to flip out when next arrests happen, as they think Trump is going after his political adversaries, and believe the lie that Russia affected the outcome of the election. There is a reason why the government investigation isn't interviewing Julian Assange, because they all know Russia didn't hack the emails, they were leaked, but need to keep this story going to save themselves. This is going to be very big news.
      </p>
      <p>
       However yes, so far no surveillance video footage has been released to the public from the hotel showing him even walking into the building. There is a war going on in the deep state community.

       As we all know, this story barely has an official story, except the basics but is lacking details. There is a lot eyewitnesses that have conflicting views, and there is more questions than answers. Either way there is a cover up for some reason, which there is many reasons as I'm sure you can imagine.
      </p>
      <p>
       The source about the FBI hostage rescue team and what they found that wasn't being reported by the media for the official narrative was from Alex Jones which was sent to him by his source in the FBI. I'll provide the link and let you look further if you want:
      </p>
      <p>
       This was the live clip:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqql4js8lo">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biqql4js8lo
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have ISIS claiming he converted to islam months ago, multiple times even though the FBI and media was saying there is nothing to that. You can google that because it was reported for a while. ISIS has been making contacts with drug cartels in Mexico under common cause against the US, and has been working with MS13 to help with human trafficking getting their people into the US. Then Antifa in Europe has been contacting ISIS due to their shared hatred, along with Antifa in the US traveling to Europe to make connections as well. You have to look at it as a controlled opposition using A-symetric warfare and funding rebels to use to incite civil unrest and attacks. Follow the money, which seems to be drying up with the purge of various covert connections and the shell companies. Trump is making moves behind the scenes which are not making that much noise in the media because they are focused on taking him down, not talking about successes. The dark web which was taken down recently Alpha Bay and Hansa, which was a major market place to fund dark operations and organize human traficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Julian Assange is still alive, as I haven't seen evidence to sway me that he's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       I understand the MGM's desire to not get further bad publicity, but when a crime takes place the surveilance video is collected by the authorities, which for some reason has not been shown to the public through the news channels at all. Nothing which is strange.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus now we have CNN asking questions like why does the shooters motive even matter. My initial thought to the media not covering the largest mass shooting in US history is because it didn't fit their narrative they have been pushing on the American people. At first you had people on twitter happy that likely Trump supporters were killed even though not all country music fans are Trump supporters. It doesn't fit the narrative that right wing nut jobs with guns are killing black people, which is what they tend to push.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I have more question than answers, just trying to provide some info to the convo.

       Distractions and the need to push their laws. With every mass shooting that comes, more and more people fall in line for their masters. It's beyond pitiful how unthinking the human race has become. It's hard to find someone with an open mind these days.
      </p>
      <p>
       There will be a few weeks of the Texas shooting and the right to bear arms bullshit. It will go quiet, then there will be another. Either aimed at new gun laws or terrorism and laws to shut the borders.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real terrorists are the people in power. The ones who mastermind these bullshit events to try and solidify their Personal agendas. Fuck the 1%. It's a shame that the people who truly have the power, the 99%, don't wake the fuck up and realise this. 
Instead they would rather vote in a new leader, then complain when they lose out. Fuck the rest of the world! I want my damn wall!

       Bandwidth - you guys had another major shooting already and other major stories. Also I assume they are also waiting for more info. Guaranteed there are reporters working on the story but there seems a real desire to get more facts right lately as the media is under more scrutiny.

       This is why MSM is pushing all the high-profile pedos. Think about it. 
John Travolta, Charlie Sheen, Corey Feldman etc accussations have been around for years! But the fact that it's getting national attention is whats suspicious. I believe it's to fill in then drown (in our memories) the LV shooting.

       We are so spoon fed and stories so cherry picked it's a joke. Notice how Bill Cosby has dropped out of the news?

       Out of curiosity, let's toil under the assumption that the Vegas shooting line so the other mass shootings are a false flag event. What is the point? The cia just likes to shoot Americans? This is a continuous attempt to be able to adjust the second? If it is the latter seems a bit redundant considering any push to adjust the second has stalled after each previous mass shooting. If it is the former then why do they just like to shoot Americans? Seems like a lot of people on this sub are so quick to claim conspiracy, but never sut down to think about why there would be a reasoning behind the conspiracy. People are posting about his an exec from cnbc had his children killed after a report on a fraud case claiming it was obviously the defendants in the case who orchestrated the killings. Ok? But, why? The guy wasn't part of the case. What would be the Motive behind killing his kids? Case is still on going... High ranking dems kill fuck children in the basement of a pizza place to gain favor with Satan. Ook? Am I supposed to assume that Satan is real? And that Satan will grant me special powers in this life if i do sacrifice kids in his name? That's asking me to assume a lot.

       According to Q on 4chan
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        SA Opposition tried to assassinate SA Prince
       </li>
       <li>
        Potus group foiled attack, price evacuated
       </li>
       <li>
        Assasins found in room w/ "shooter"
       </li>
       <li>
        CIA/FBI coverup that SA was involved in fear of war
       </li>
       <li>
        Opposition prince assassinated in SA 2 weeks later
       </li>
       <li>
        Prince arrested in SA
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       So long story short, if true, SA, the FBI and CIA are to blame for the shooting, and it really didn't need to happen.  All it was was to coverup international involvement.
