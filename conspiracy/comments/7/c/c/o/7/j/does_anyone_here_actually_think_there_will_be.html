    <div class="md"><p>If a Progressive Populist like Bernie runs in 2020...there is a very good chance. If a Corporate Democrat runs against Trump, he&#39;ll likely get a 2nd term and the Dems will be in the wilderness until at least 2024, and they&#39;ll only get out then if they finally return to their People oriented New Deal roots.</p>

I like Tulsi, I would just prefer she get a little more experience to fully solidify her credentials.

    <div class="md"><p>In all seriousness, why post this here. It has zero context. It&#39;s not conspiracy related, it&#39;s just weird political guessing, no one knows what will happen in 3, 7, 11, etc years from now. In the last 50 years, it&#39;s been pretty well balanced between R&#39;s and D&#39;s, even with similar political shenanigans. Why would that change, unless you have some context you&#39;d like to share</p>

<p>If you said, &quot;with the DNC election rigging, will anyone trust voting in a democratic presidential race or will it be forgotten by then?&quot; has some context. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if its a dumb question as much as one born from a misunderstanding of the Party system in the US. We are currently in the 6th party system (the 5th being the New Deal coalition). This came about from the realigning of Southern interests in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s and with the New Democrats in the 90&#39;s. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the Democratic Party going away any time soon, as both parties have been the dominant political bodies since the 1860&#39;s. What OP might not understand is that there will always be 2 dominant parties, and <em>only</em> 2 dominant parties in the current system, because of FPTP voting. Even if one Party collapsed, it would quickly be replaced by a realigned &quot;big tent&quot;, but more likely the Party would stay the same and just alter its core tenants radically, like the 90&#39;s Democrats. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The DNC stories are only damaging to the Establishment wing of the Party. The Progressive wing, lead by Bernie, is taking back the Party at the grassroots. 8 State Parties have been captured and put in the hands of Populist Progressives, and Cali would have been taken too if the Party hadn&#39;t literally stuffed the ballots. Bernie Sanders if the most popular politician in the country. If the Party returns to its New Deal roots, they will win, and win big. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is why Bernie was seen as so radical by the Establishment. The &quot;New Democrats&quot; lead by Clinton in the 90&#39;s, jettisoned Economic issues in exchange for Economic Conservatism and Social Identity Politics. Identity Politics can not be a platform in and of itself, it must be in conjunction with Economic Justice as well. But instead, in the absence of Economic Leftism, it has been allowed to swell and take up most of the air in the room of the modern American Left. Bernie seeks to return to the New Deal Populist politics of FDR and the Democratic Party from the 30&#39;s-70&#39;s. </p>

<p>The intellectual base for Identity Politics and away from Inclusive Economic politics was laid in the 80&#39;s. Here is a great blog post about the difference between the Pre-80&#39;s Economic and inclusive Left and the post-80&#39;s Identity Politics Left. There is indeed a difference, let me know what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why the grassroots is on the march. It starts at the local level. Any card carrying Democrat can show up at their local meetings and vote for Precinct chairs. Precincts are the smallest organizational unit in the American voting system. Precinct Chairs vote for Country Chairs, who vote for State Chairs, who vote for National Chairs. Organization at the grassroots <em>will</em> work, it just has to be done, and it is very difficult. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, Trump.  He&#39;s more Democrat than either Clinton or Obama. </p>

<p>That being said, official democrats are going to have a tough time. People are onto the media&#39;s BS, and the Democrats have no charismatic candidate on the scene.      </p>

<p>Worse they have no issue other than &#39;do whatever Trump doesn&#39;t do.&#39;  It makes them look like buffoons (e.g., when they don&#39;t vote for a Supreme Court nominee they previously unanimously confirmed).  Their only tactic is to demonize and victimize, rather than come at an issue with facts, logic, and reason.  I&#39;ve voted Democrat in every election until 2016, and would gladly vote again if they started back up with some honesty.  </p>
