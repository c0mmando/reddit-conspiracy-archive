    <div class="md"><p>I could see shadows of people, one time it was in the &quot;static&quot; of the world. They were black and looked the same shape of a human. It was when I was smoking weed, sleep deprived and drinking a little, like 1 shot worth.</p>

<p>Another time I was on magic mushrooms and I could see people you would describe as &quot;cloaked&quot; they were invisible but completely visible. I could look right through them but notice they were there, exactly like predator from &quot;Predators or Alien vs Predator&quot; could cloak. When I saw the cloaked people there were about 10+ of them and I was outside at night. Another time I was with my friend and he said he could see eyes looking at us all over the forests. I didn&#39;t believe him at the time but 100% do after the 2 other experiences happened to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The gnostic teachings claim that celibacy is infrasexual AKA just as deprave as anything else. They say that is why it leads to so much homosexuality and pedophilia (claiming both are infrasexual). </p>

<p>Celibacy is a distortion of our deep intuition that tells us not to spill our seed. Rather than sex without ejaculation which brings us closer to God, no sex at all brings us misery and brings us closer to the devil. It also creates sexual shame which we are realizing is wrong, but is being distorted in the other direction with the &quot;sexual revolution&quot; which promotes spilling your seed with everyone and everywhere. See the distortion and hijacking?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into gnostic sexual teachings when you have a chance. They preach NEVER ejaculating and never orgasming, not even the non-ejaculatory orgasms that many Eastern practicioners preach.</p>

<p>They say that ejaculation is the road to all evil and depravity. The highest sexuality involves sex without orgasm which they claim is the highest form of bliss, and in my experience there is truth to it. They claim that reproduction should only come from pre-ejaculatory fluid. Those souls born from pre-ejaculation are said to be &quot;supermen or superwomen&quot;.</p>

<p>Either beings living in higher dimensions or out of time, so we perceive them as something other than &quot;people&quot;.</p>

<p>Or... </p>

<p>Beings living out of phase with us, say they&#39;re whole being vibrates at such a high wave length, we cant see them. Like how dogs can hear higher level sound frequencies than we can. This would also explain sightings of ghosts and such.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not really. Before my diagnoses all i dod was smoke pot once in a while and maybe have some wine coolers. After diagnoses i figured &quot;why not experiment with drugs? Whats the worst that could happen, it&#39;ll make me crazy? They say im already crazy so fuck it&quot; in hindsight.... That was a bad choice lol. It exacerbated them quite a bit but i still see / hear the same things i always have. I honestly have no clue and am open to suggestions on what it may be cuz most of them sound a hell of a lot better to me than schizophrenia. Real/ or  fake, the invisible beings seem usually with ill intent and seem to get off on the fact they scare me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;d try a few different things. Seek out a medium and see If it can be controlled. Or go to a priest for an exorcism. Or go to an evangelical church and accept jesus. You never know which path could work</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look into gnostic sexual teachings when you have a chance. They preach NEVER ejaculating and never orgasming, not even the non-ejaculatory orgasms that many Eastern practicioners preach.</p>

<p>They say that ejaculation is the road to all evil and depravity. The highest sexuality involves sex without orgasm which they claim is the highest form of bliss, and in my experience there is truth to it. They claim that reproduction should only come from pre-ejaculatory fluid. Those souls born from pre-ejaculation are said to be &quot;supermen or superwomen&quot;.</p>
