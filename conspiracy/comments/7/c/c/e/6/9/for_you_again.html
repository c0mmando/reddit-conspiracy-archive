      <p>
       The fear of doing nothing, of not moving on, not growing, living stagnant.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to grow, nothing grows in a safety or comfort zone, there is no meaning to life, we are all waves that are put together as neutrons, protons, electrons and other shit we still don't fully comprehend, quarks, antimatter, but that doesn't matter, you are here, I am here as well, that is what matters, that is all that matters in life, is that we find a way to live through harmony, not control, not fear. You are the fruit, life is the tree, it has birthed you, the seed is the earth, earth is the seed, life is the tree, and you are the fruit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know if there is a spiritual side of life, but I have always tried to reach for an answer, just as you have, what if I told you the answer is literally right in-front of us, what if I told you I wrote this just for YOU, you are powerful, the hope you bring to this world is light, no matter what you face, you are here, with me, reading this, if you go, your light goes, the hope you will bring to the world would be gone, don't go.
      </p>
      <p>
       All I know is you are here reading this with me, and I am here hoping for life to get better, just as you are, I think about taking action, but I fear people would not understand my intentions, just as we all do, none of us want to sound insane, but we all want to help, we get tripped up and scared of the result of trying to simply help bring change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what the world will bring in the future, but I know I need you here, we all need each other, there are monsters in this world, and they will continue to feast on those who remain alone, the only action I can think of, is trying to reach out to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do know the future looks horrible, we see it, corporations are trying to control everything, and they destroy what they cannot control in hopes that they must rely on the system they put in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not know how to change the future, I do not know how to take the necessary action to change the world, to change all of our futures, but I know if we work together we will find something together, we are not a hive-mind, but we are still one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will never surrender what I love, that is my love for seeking the truth, an answer, a path, something that will provide us with the assurance that something better is ahead, or even the steps to take to lead to a better future for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I am crazy, but most men don't fear their future, they fear their childrens' future, they fear what they are leading their children into and what they are leaving them behind to build with.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are not building anything for the future as long as we keep distancing ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is the future you see ahead what you want to leave your children? I have no children, but I can tell you that with children or not, I fear the future for everyone, due to us losing our connection with each other, and allow barriers to be placed between us.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the time you have read this, something bad has happened in the world, I don't need to use an example, we can all think of tons of various examples of the bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only answer I have found in my searches, is that we are all here together, no matter if there is an ethereal higher dimensional plane, or if we are on a flat earth, or if we are in a simulation, or any of that, what matters is that you are here, at this moment, with me, with everyone. The answer is in our hearts, not in our minds.

       Just focus on you. Try to fill your life with as much positivity as you can, and treat everyone as an equal human being just trying to do exactly as you are. At some point, you've just got to realize that our time here is temporary, and we need to make the best of it while we can. Lead by example, and hope others follow in your footsteps.
