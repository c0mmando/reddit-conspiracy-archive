       Why would they want his image being tarnished with sexual assault allegations in the midst of all this, especially considering his past relationship with JE.

       It baffles me how fast these posts are downvoted to 0 permanently, despite encouraging comments that agree with the OP.

       They are protecting their puppet from being mentioned in any sort of incriminating sexual abuse/pedophilia talk....it's disgusting.

       Ppl just want to hope that trump is turning his back on this type of culture and will expose it all.  That's the only reason I ever really defend him.  I'm sure that might sound stupid, but I feel it could be true at this point.

       Welp, we tried last year and they damn near shut down the internet.   Remember all those Arab twitter accounts sharing child porn?  When it got exposed, twitter shut the site down.  Keep in mind- one of the big Saudi princes who just went down had a huge stake in twitter.   And those guys are almost def involved in human trafficking.  Look at all the trafficking in Libya, Kosovo, etc then look at who funded these nation's dip into depravity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think this could all be connected.  Usually I'm a cynical bastard, especially about someone with an ego like trumps.  But he might actually be going for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is essentially his only redeeming quality and the thing keeping me from bashing trump like I used to.  It's not hope or faith.  If anything, it's confirmation bias.  I think I see a pattern, perhaps

       I have a suspicion the "we" in all of this will stfu if Trump is brought down. Not because people believe Trump constitutes the ring leader in all of this (though even if he was, his fall wouldn't mark the end of it), but because it would no longer be politically expedient to continue pushing it.

       But I don't think it's actually "whataboutism" when used to shine a light on how it's a broader, non-partisan issue, which is how I interpreted OC's photo. I feel like that's more akin to broadening the spotlight than deflecting attention or blame, ya know?

       I like how you frame this as a problem specific to information critical of Trump. Try posting the link between Clinton and Epstein. You'll also be instantly downvoted.

       In fact, almost every thread and comment gets instantly downvoted. There's a bot and shill problem here, yes, but it's not a one sided problem as you're trying to claim.

       They quietly disappeared a related court case right (13 year old girl) before the election - but when you're a star they let you do it.

       What pisses me off is that each team ignores half of the story.  Trump had a relationship with Epstein.  The Clintons had a relationship with Epstein.  Each side is only willing to admit one of those things.

       If you want me to stop downvoting this shit then start looking at both sides of the issue instead of using it as a partisan attack.

       If you come to that conclusion, you would also have to believe nobody died in Las Vegas. When I see posts about how it's a hoax, it's treated the same way.

       I know Trump has had claims against him....  if True I think he should be held accountable.  It's one of the most despicable things you can do.  I DO find it suspicious though that claims came out before the election and then just disappeared.  Especially the one woman that apparently had a history of filing claims and then withdrawing them when she was scrutinized.....

       Has he ever settled out of court that anyone is aware of?

       I don't give these people the benefit of the doubt, based on "hope" that they will defeat the system. We have to do this and expose them ourselves.
