       Makes no sense at all. Obviously that was a leak because it helped Trump. Why the hell would a democrat enemy release that one page? It did nothing for them.

       It was done before these messages and these messages definitely indicate that WikiLeaks didn't have anything, which is why they were seeking DTJ as a source for them.

       Idk who you are or what you do, but you seem to have a very deep knowledge on a lot of topics. I'm not sure how you acquired this knowledge, through research, common sense or reliable sources. But I have a small feeling (it may be wrong) that you have knowledge or info that the majority of people do not know about, or info we may not even be ALLOWED to know about.

       Agreed. At first I was kinda miffed, but then it got funny because I thought about it.

       This is some kind of desperate preventive attempt to undermine WL. But if what's coming is salacious enought--like, say Clintons 30K emails--it won't matter.

       Think about how much these guys have failed and failed, even with the media totally behind them.

       Remember when they tried to frame Assange as a pedophile? That worked for less than a day.

       The truth is going to bury these suckers and fuckers. They are getting so desperate and so transparent, it's laughable.

       Some of the comments in those TrumpJr/Wikileaks posts are so blatantly propaganda, it's a joke: "I'll never trust Wikileaks again!" "Wikileaks is as bad as Breitbart!" Change your diaper, dude.

       In 24-48 hours, something REAL will happen and all this will be wiped away. Really, to even think this is any kind of major story is a joke.

       It’s already exposed. It’s in all alternative news. It’s fact. Mainstream news is ignoring it all and it’s dead. It has no where near as much power as a year ago. Just cause it’s not televised doesn’t mean it’s not happening. Truth community has had an amazing 2 years. Just look at the JFK files. Look at the reaction to the Vegas shooting. That is the most dismissed mainstream story I have ever heard. Weinstein is opening it up for Cory Feildmen to get som traction. It’s official. The world is a different place.

       Fun fact: This phrase refers to one's following of strange, nonsensical or banal clues, hints or signs, which then lead to amazing, unexpected, eye-opening or mind-expanding discoveries, situations or truths. (The first instance of a "Follow the White Rabbit" act occurred in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, where Alice followed the White Rabbit down the hole into a world most twisted and psychedelically surreal.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Often these discoveries run contrary to your basic beliefs or perceptions of reality and can be disturbing in that you are faced with having to accept as truth that which you may vehemently wish to deny, or you simply cannot wrap your head around that which seems impossible. Either way, your truth has just imploded before your very eyes and you can no longer cling to it with any sense of confidence or rationality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to be confused with "Following A Rabbit Trail", which is usually not very productive at all.

       I've been defending WL for a while, but I just don't see it here.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I understand it, Assange outed himself on this before the Atlantic. Then Don Jr. releases the emails. So it's not the anti-WL people dropping this to discredit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it seems clear to me that this is WL trying to collude with Trump and help him win. After following WL for about ten years, this is extremely troubling to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, I believe their flawless record still stands. So while I've lost a tremendous amount of respect for the organization, whatever comes out later I have no reason to doubt.

       Did you see that The Atlantic truncated the text (NOT EMAIL) exchange? They left out a key portion.

       Also, If you dig around the subreddit you'll be reminded this was right after the Embassy's internet got cut and something funny went down with Assange--killed, silenced extradited, no idea.

       Both Cryptome and AnonScan said this exact thing. And they’d certainly know. I, like you, felt the same way. It just isn’t how Julian talks.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, it’s worth remembering that the WL Twitter account is not always Julian himself speaking. There are trusted staff who have access.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the biggest thing, to me, is that Assange is fully aware that all agencies have access to his Twitter DM’s. He’s not a moron about privacy and security. He wouldn’t conduct any business or say anything in a Twitter DM that he wasn’t ok with the whole world knowing.

       I do wonder about who actually writes most of the WL posts. Assange himself is usually quite articulate, but some of their output is often not very professional, imo. The dialogue in the DM's here seem immature for the nature of the discussion, maybe it's just me. Probably.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't mean to imply that I was giving the middle finger to WL or Assange, if that was how it was taken. I'm a big fan of Assange and what he does. It's just that the whole dialogue was very off to me. I'm aware that Assange apparently confirmed these were indeed from WL and the "conversation" (whatever minor conversation there actually was) happened. I also agree that this was not done without full awareness that it would be accessed by outside sources. Why this conversation occurred...there is more than one possibility. Whichever one is right, it's purpose was fully contrived.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just that I do have some vague feelings that something isn't quite right, especially in the past year or so. Hence, my remark that I can't quite put my longest finger on it. However, as long as their reporting remains flawless, I'll continue to hope that all is well.

       I've not kept up with this particular story, but are we certain that these communications came from Assange?  Has he confirmed or denied that they are his?  I agree with you that they seem like an odd thing for Assange to do, especially the ambassador stuff.  This smells like an ABC honeypot impersonation, at first glance.

       had to be leaked from the congressional oversight committee. these messages were already turned over to them beforen the atlantic wrote their story about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       either way nothing incriminating in the messages. all it showed was wikileaks trying to get trumps tax returns to leak themselves and wikileaks hating hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       which i find ironic when wikileaks hated bush all the democrats loved them. when he turns his guns against them this time around, well, go see the two stories here on r/conspiracy and read the comments to see for yourself. the irony.
      </p>
      <p>
       what i find more humorous is many of the statements they're saying now is what republicans were saying during the bush years about wikileaks and wikileaks not going after the clintons, obama, extra.

       In the full transcripts with Don jr released which every media org omitted, clearly to twist WLs words, he clearly states the sentence after "they will never do it". So its a jab to the Trumps and the Aus government and by extension the anglo-american alliance. In the sentence after Assange even mocks how Trump talks, showing again that this was not a serious proposal that they thought would work.

       Doesn't sound like just a "jab" to me. Of course Assange knew he would never become ambassador, but he wanted Trump to put him forward anyway as a power play to frighten the countries he's currently running from. Who's going to risk mistreating someone that the president of the US has personally vouched for as an ambassador? That was the intention of the request.

       yeah thats if the trumps actually suggested him for ambassador which is extremely unlikely, assange knows that that would never happen due to the incumbents in the US gov. to any sane person it would be obvious that a new administration would NEVER suggest a person who publishes that countries secrets and is vehemently anti-west and anti-establishment, but we are talking about the trumps here, retarded decision making is their strongest suit. so thats why he probably put an actual reason for the suggestion on the off chance they did it. "They wont do it" is said first so this is clearly what they think would happen

       Wikileaks is more political than journalistic and considering Assange's position, it looks too logical for him not taking a chance at "freedom". Not forgetting what happened or didn't to WL this year. I can see how it further devalues their credibility but I also could understand why some would find his position extreme enough to allow acting against their own values.

       I think OP is just an idiot. With the amount of screeching the media has done over everything Trump does, if there was evidence of collusion with Russia, they'd be on that 24/7.

       No, someone who endangers the lives of millions of Americans or betrays actual state secrets deserves to be put down.

       I would argue that whistleblowing isn't treason, however betraying this country and acting on behalf of a foreign state definitely is.

       Thanking Trump for lying to you and colluding with a country that wants to see you relegated to poverty at best and subserviency at worst is pretty much the definition of cuck. I've actually noticed y'all use the word less now, is it because it applies to Trump supporters so perfectly with all these revelations?

       He'd simply rather die for Russia, and Russian oligarchs. If you think any war fought under Trump won't be a net benefit for Russia you're fucked in the head. It guessing you are anyway since you think the man who puts businessmen in politics doesn't support corporations.

       I don't know what's coming up but they certainly try to put a damper on that Donna Brazile revelation that Hillary campaign along with the DNC rigged the Primary. And all that money donated to the Bernie campaign automatically went to Hillary. Not even SNL Weekend Update covered the Donna Brazile revelation.

       That's what you think. Obviously, the Deep State is playing 4D chess here. My guess is DT campaign baited JA/WL to get evidence for election "meddling" and collusion with Trump campaign.

       Bingo! Mark my words, they will produce more shit conversations, and indict JA for collusion. The Swamp Trump will be going after WL. Sessions will be put in use.

       The bad news is that there are members of the dnc which know this and the recent SNL sketch is the nail in the coffin for the old dnc. Expect a new face for the dnc. They will use that attractive milfy senator to try and appeal to young people as hip and cool.

       I think you're spot on here.  I think what we're witnessing with the wikileaks hate is this brazen and last-ditch (hopefully not successful) attempt to brandish the media and beat everyone over the head with giving wikileaks a bad connotation so they can tie the administration to the website...Its desperate.  Its so strange...none of the focus on the mainstream at all is on what wikileaks is leaking.  Like, damn, just how dumb and asleep do they think we are...I don't think they realize just how much of the population woke up the past few days.

       Are you serious now ? Nowhere is it showing they are 'biased' , they had their nemesis in Hillary so ofc they would try to make her loose. JA even said in his RT interview they are not letting Trump go but all the emails had to get out to the public before the election so the AMERICAN voters could decide if she really was worth the presidency. If you fuck nuggets in the US were smart you wouldnt have voted for either of the 2 at all. You know you got more than 2 choices...

       No by all means expose Hillary and any other corrupt official. The problem is when Wikileaks presents them selves as a neutral observer when in fact they were working for Trump and Russia to maximize the political effects of the leaks. How am I supposed to trust anything they say if they clearly support Trump and wont publish anything that damages Russia.

       Actually Trump seems to be backing them. Letting them do what ever they want with healthcare taxes, domestic spying, lobbyiest litterally appointed to every department, ratcheting up tension with Iran, selling arms to SA &amp; Israel. It's a neocon wet dream!

       All good points, in a sense. I will note:
      </p>
      <p>
       1- Obamacare is designed to implode, and it will. Something needs to be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       2- Taxes thing may or may not happen. It's such a convoluted mess and the media can't be trusted at all, so I really don't know what the new tax rules entail.
      </p>
      <p>
       3- Domestic spying is already so far gone, you can't imagine. They monitor everything already, in ways we don't even know yet. What's happening now is a slow rollout to get people to accept what's already happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       4- Regulatory capture has been a "thing" forever. Obama had his cabinet hand-picked by Citigroup. I realize this is "whataboutism." Not meant as defense, just observation.
      </p>
      <p>
       5- Iran deserves to be left alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       6- No doubt the USA/KSA/Israel axis of imperialism is out to take over the ME. No doubt at all.

       Yes but Trump is supposed to be our hero. This sub will defend him to the death no matter how much he supports neocon policies. I've yet to see him do one thing that suggests he actually cares about fixing these issues. Seems more like he supports all the establishment bullshit.

       I know someone who from my realtive small point of view was quite simular to you. He also became emotional entrapped in a simular way and never made it back. He lost his wife and his children.

       How did your "someone" lose his wife and children? Are you making threats again? Let's find some clarity here because you're starting to sound even more sinister.

       I am most certainly not a victim, though it's interesting you continue to pursue that route. You do not define me. You will not define me. You are no one. No one.

       Except that literally Trump Jr is the source of this, if he didn't say anything to the Congressional committee, we wouldn't know about it. No one twisted his arm, and he's even confirmed the tweets between himself and Assange. I actually respect the guy for admitting it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what you're basically arguing is that Trump Jr is trying to undermine WikiLeaks? Just because it was leaked, doesn't mean it isn't true.. especially when Jr confirmed it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can argue that how it is presented to you is to undermine WikiLeaks, but if you literally just read the tweets themselves, they did that to themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       You keep saying "these guys", but you're ignoring who "these guys" actually are. Assange and Jr, but mostly Assange trying to make WikiLeaks more unbiased by begging for leaks that they think will come out anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media didn't have to convince me of anything, the tweets themselves do. So blame the right person for making WikiLeaks look bad, Assange for what was communicated, or Jr for sharing it in the first place.

       The fucking DMs - both "edited" and unedited - clearly show Wikileaks (a) suggesting to Donald Trump that he vocally contest the results of the election if he loses and to at the election was "rigged," and (b) requesting that Trump make Asange ambassador PRESUMABLY as some sort of thank you to Wikileaks (otherwise why on earth would they ask this).

       You continue to make excuses. You excuse ONE DM because Julian made it public. You excuse a SECOND DM because you aren't sure it was for nefarious purposes. But you are ignoring the DMs you can't explain, justify or refute.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than make excuses, perhaps you should recognize the truth. When you struggle to explain something away, perhaps it's not meant to be explained away. At the end of the day there is NO excuse for (1) providing Trump with the username and password of the anti-Trump PAC website, (2) encouraging Trump to vocally contest the results of the election if he lost, and (3) actively conspiring with Trump to provide Wikileaks with self-incriminating info (tax returns) so that Wikileaks could look LESS like it was in fact conspiring with Wikileaks.

       Are you about to tread out the tired talking point that conspiring doesn't apply to the election law in question. And try to undermine my points by suggesting I don't understand the laws in question?  Well let me preemptively cut you off - it will save us both time.
      </p>
      <p>
       52 USC 30121 prohibits foreign nationals (both Wikileaks and J.A. Quality under this definition) from making or promising to make a contribution of a thing of value (this is a poorly defined term but the FEC has held it to be broadly interpreted and does include merely the provision of information) in connection with a federal election. 52 USC 30121 also prohibits a person from soliciting, accepting or receiving a thing of value from a foreign national.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people use the word "conspire" what they mean is conspire in the general definition of the word which is to make secret plans to commit an unlawful or harmful act. The unlawful or harmful act would be what we described above (unlawful act), or more generally Wikileaks attempts to convince Trump to contest the election in the case he lost (harmful act).

       You said that there was a criminal conspiracy here, which was inexcusable. The conspiracy was for Trump to "provide Wikileaks with self-incriminating info (tax returns) so that Wikileaks could look LESS like it was in fact conspiring with Wikileaks". What is the evidence for this "concerted conspiracy to break the law"?
 Which law does this break?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your points (1) and (2): "(1) providing Trump with the username and password of the anti-Trump PAC website, (2) encouraging Trump to vocally contest the results of the election if he lost" clearly do not show a conspiracy, they show Assange giving Don Jr a private message on Twitter that Don presumably did not specifically ask for (or are you just assuming a vast communication between them outside of these messages).
      </p>
      <p>
       IF you want to say that WL broke the law then what specifically was the "thing of value" they provided?? You make this sound like a spy movie. Obviously WL's activities are disliked by many governments.

       First, you say I said there was a "criminal conspiracy" which in your words is inexcusable. I think what is inexcusable is you (a) fabricating that I EVER used the term "criminal conspiracy" and (b) completely ignoring that I already rebutted your point. Your persistence in trying to undermine what I said by LYING and pretending I said there was a criminal conspiracy is pathetic at best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, did you read my comment?  A "thing of value" has been interpreted by the FEC to include things such as information. And as per the 2004 Grover Norquist case, EVEN information that is publicly available can be considered a "thing of value."  Ergo, the "thing of value" provided or offered by Wikileaks includes as follows: (a) providing the username and password to a rivals website, (b) offering their URL to be shared with trumps followers who could then comb Clintons email for dirt that would harm them - in fact, there is now a good argument that Wikileaks mere collection of those emails and dissemination of this emails may have been directly for the benefit of Trump.

       By misrepresenting the wikileaks conversation. It can easily be summed up by the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks: "Hi, we would like you to release information on Trump. We think this will be good for you because we're releasing info on Hillary."
      </p>
      <p>
       D. T. Jr.: "No."

       First, what misinformation. Quote for me what I misstated. Don't try to undermine someone with phoney accusations - prove out the words you wish to stand by.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, the way you represent the PMs of misinformation. There seems to be a quid/pro/quo to this. Wikileaks was feeding information to Trump and pretending to be his ally and THEN once he was in power they ask for his help by requesting he push for J.A. to become ambassador. Did that not happen?  Wikileaks also encouraged Trump to contest the election and FALSELY claim the election was rigged. Wikileaks claims it did that because it would help expose media corruption, but it was Wikileaks doing the corrupting.

       The request from Assange was for Don sr to suggest Australia make him their ambassador to the US, not because he expected they'd do it, but as a signal so they'd let him go free.

       I mean, hiding in an embassy for years because you're afraid to face your rape charges seems like assassinating your own character, no? If it was all false he should have just gone to trial and said so.

       Wikileaks provided Trump JR with the username and password for an Anti-Trump PAC.  They also asked Trump JR to disseminate their website so his followers could provide a free service and comb clintons emails. They also encouraged Trump to contest the election and call it "rigged" if he lost AND requested Trump make Assange amabassador for Australia.

       Are you fucking blind, stupid, or a god damn shill?  When you purposefully misrepresent the facts, as you have done by suggesting Wikileaks merely asked for a retweet, you lose all credibility. You clearly have an agenda and that agenda does not involve the truth.

       Not at all. I just don't even think there is a story here - never mind a bombshell.
Assange even tweeted about this as it was happening back  in July,Check the facts. I even remember laughing about it back then. 
Promoting Wikileaks and trolling for leaks is what Wikileaks do !
You seriously think a few tweeted messages is - some kind of illegal influence over the election ? 
It's laughable.
As for the DNC leaks - the truth and corruption the hurt - but why shoot the messenger.

       First, don't push a false narrative. Wikileaks publicized the tweet in July 2017. Did they publicize the tweet where they asked Trump to push to make J.A. ambassador?  No?  Did they publicize the tweet where they encourage Trump to contest the election if he loses?  No. Did they publicize the tweet where the provide the username and password to Trump of a rival PAC?  No. So don't push a false narratives be that they were transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, encouraging the presidential candidate to contest an election specifically with the intent of causing disruption is the definition of election interference. What on earth are you talking about?  Wikileaks specifically asked Trump to undermine the credibility of a democratic election by calling it "rigged."

       I have followed Assange for years. I never took the - make me an ambassador - tweet  seriously at all , do you ? I was amused : going from one of the USA most wanted to ambassador seems a tad ridiculous don't you think ?
Nothing here is shocking or illegal ? Or bleachbitted !
      </p>
      <p>
       Hillary actually paid actual Russians and actual msn ..........illegally!
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly - it seems Assange expected Hillary to lose and fell for fake polls. 
One wonders how those happened across all the msn , in light of those polls when contrasted with other / online / UK / etc polls , and now proven 1000000 illegal votes ,not to mention the result , contesting a Hillabilly win seems like common sense!
      </p>
      <p>
       What illegality or influence are you claiming here?
You seem confused, do you actually believe the Assange = Russia BS, proof?
      </p>
      <p>
       And by the by , I am not a US citizen and have no partisan affiliations. 
Watching this from the outside is hilarious. ...it seems like hysterics and sour grapes and a blame game by the DNC.

       The USA got exactly what they deserved.

       First, you clearly do have a bias and a narrative. That is revealed by your focus on Clinton which literally has NOTHING to do with this story. You are trying to deflect from Wikileaks and J.A. with the old stupid argument "well at least they didn't do what Hilary did."
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, Wikileaks did break the law by using the username and password to access the website of the anti-Trump PAC. That is undeniable. Trump may or may not have broken the same law - we can't tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, Wikileaks and Trump potentially broke 52 US 30121. Wikileaks offered the username/password, offered its Clinton emails for Trump's user base to comb through in order to find dirt on Clinton, and offered to make itself seem less pro-Trump in order to give credence to the Clinton leaks.  All of these things could be interpreted as a "thing of value" under 52 US 30121's broad definition which includes providing services and information. In addition, Trump solicited a "thing of value" when he requested advance notice of the Wednesday data dump.

How did it affect the American election ? It didn't.  That's my pov.

       At which point does he state he is seeking to avoid anything by sorting by new? It's implied of course, but as for what he might be avoiding you've inserted your own interpretation.

       I don't think that's a conspiracy. People like to do that. They don't like conspiracy, they think their smarter than you (us? I'm not sure where I fit in) and look down on you all (us?). They see something as challenging to us an all pounce on it. It is what I would expect.

       Meh.  I'm not going to dig through them, the s/n ratio with the armchair analysts will be through the roof, and I don't know who I'd trust in the media to give me an accurate picture of the contents.

       I can absolutely guarantee, however, that the first "smoking gun" found in her emails is going to be so wildly misinterpreted that it'll make everyone involved look like a pizza-shooting dipshit.

       I'm going to ask users to consume this thread critically and try and spot your own memes and scripts posted by different accounts (I know I saw some). The voting patterns will also appear strange I'm sure to our users here and that is also noteworthy. Are the most upvoted comments from users who regularly consume and contribute to

       What is your argument for this receiving news coverage? Are you hoping to destroy Wikileaks credibility? Are you saying anything Wikileaks has posted is untrue?  Or, are you saying that they may have withheld information about Trump? This does not change any of the Clinton crimes uncovered by WL. This does not change Podesta’s creepy emails released by WL. They still maintain 100% legitimacy on their releases. I’m just missing the point?

       Both sides (lol) have said that this occurred. Trump Jr. and Assange himself. Is that not enough? Do you have to have physically been there, behind both of their shoulders as they sent messages, to see that as proof?

       What I’m saying is that CNN literally gave Hillary debate questions prior to said debate. No coverage. Here you have Wikileaks (not necessarily Assange) suggesting they leak a tax return, and promoting links that are in their mutual interest. I just don’t think that is even close to completely ruining Assange or even Wikileaks credibility and believe that this is simply an attempt to destroy said credibility through inflating the topic and severity.

       A media outlet is attempting to obtain information to publish. That's what media outlets do. Trump Jr declined to provide the requested information. If he had chosen to provide it, that would have been OK too. Again, this is what media outlets do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know people were upset with the DNC/Podesta emails about "friendly" reporters. Those people are ninnies. They've never worked with the media and they don't understand how regular human relationships work.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who were upset about the special dinner parties for reporters aren't wrong to be a bit taken aback. That's weird. The people upset with Glenn Thrush sending Podesta a copy of his upcoming article and asking for edits &amp; basically permission to publish have every right to be upset. As do the people upset over Brent Budowski's grand scheme to pretend to be impartial while steering people toward Hillary. The reporters behaved stunningly unethical in those instances.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in these DM's comes even close to anything like that. This isn't a Big! story; it's barely a story at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only things to take away from this are:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         WL didn't have info on Trump, so we know they weren't sitting on anything.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         WL tried to get info on Trump to publish in its entirety. Not spin it, like dishonest journos do--publish it as-is. That is what honest journalists do--they try to cover both sides, and do so impartially.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Don Jr. was clearly not interested in "working with" WL, despite the fact that it would have been both legal and (probably) ethical.

       Wikileaks greatest principle is supposed to be impartiality. In addition to this they are meant to be an unfiltered conduit of truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The twitter DMs show Wikileaks actively requesting Donald Trump to contest the election results if he loses (there goes impartiality) and reveal that they were only interested in leaking information that hurt Hilary and/or made Wikileaks look less pro-russia (there goes unfiltered truth).
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, this isn't an argument. You can't argue that Wikileaks credibility as a NON-BIASED organization is toast. These DMs clearly show Wikileaks has an agenda. That puts everything they have done in question.

       What's wrong with you?  Your response is "these are black and white printouts"??? Asante and Trump Jr both verified the fucking DMs.

       It shows that they’re trying to act as if they’re impartial when they’re actually favoring a then candidate. That’s what’s all screwy about this, and what makes it more is that they lied about it.

       Hillary was a crucial part of an administration which backed a conspiracy to destroy Assange through illegal imprisonment, framing him as a pedophile, separating him from his young children for years, forcing him into exile, all for doing what journalists just did to him: releasing information. I don't think he should have to explain why he was talking to jr, but if he was helping them, so the fuck what. Anyone with eyes can see how ridiculous this whole thing is.

       Those text messages don't indicate any colluding. It shows WikiLeaks knows how to use social engineering to obtain new anonymous sources. DTJ just didn't take their bait. Assange straight out said he talked to Trump Jr and tried to get him to release his emails through WikiLeaks.

       I'm having a hard time seeing a palpable "collusion" in these mostly one-sided messages. Seems like Wikileaks (if it was indeed THE Wikileaks.... they seemed somewhat childish) was vying for a scoop and trying to frame it as beneficial to both sides. I got the feeling that DTjr was suspicious about the dialogue, and pretty much dismissed it after a while. Definitely the tack that WL took was a little "off."

       heh. I don't doubt that the DM's posted were 'real' in the sense that they happened. I don't think it was Assange himself that wrote them, although it appears he was privy to them, based on his tweets. They weren't his style at all, but then, his style seems to have changed.  And I have no idea who writes the WL posts, but they never seem very professional to me. I wonder about their being compromised in some way, but who knows?
      </p>
      <p>
       My remark was basically to point out that there was not one iota of the appearance of collusion in the DMs. Regardless of what I think about the authenticity. Which I was just pondering, so relax.

       Collusion requires at least TWO parties agreeing to something (typically) nefarious. Based on that fact, please tell me what plot WL and DTJr planned together and agreed upon in this DM exchange. Don't offer up some other thought, opinion, diversion, as is likely to happen in these kinds of cases. Directly provide the specific information I've asked for.

       Everything Assange does is suspect and has been since the DNC release. We knew that already since there was no way that someone wouldn't have come forward with some dirt on Trump for them to release, and now we know his credibility is suspect, since here he's been shown to actually be suggesting to Jr ways in which they can make Trump look more credible in their attempts to make the Clintons look less credible. Assange is no longer the freedom fighter you want to believe he is. All your heroes are dead

       Is it as important as the dnc rigging the primary? Is this news bigger than cia and saudi arabia funding terrorism? Is it bigger than global money laundering? How about paradise papers? Give me a break this is corporate propaganda and disinfo.

       You're argument is pretty dumb tbh. What you're trying to say the context of their messages are not suspicious because they didn't try hard enough to hide them? Wikileaks literally tried to encourage a presidential candidate to contest the election results and not conceed. There is no journalist value in that what so ever. There was a clear attempt by wikileaks to either get Trump elected or to destabilize the US election.

       Umm, they communicated privately. Especially when it concerns the son of a presidential candidate and the head of a document leaking agency supposedly aiming at revealing "the truth". It blows WikiLeaks' credibility out of the water. Trump and his family are not private citizens. They are now civil servants who are subject to scrutiny.

       Yeah, no shit, the DMs prove that Wikileaks was conspiring with Trump to attack the Clinton campaign.  In order to do that more effectively, they wanted to coordinate planned info releases in order to give themselves a figleaf of objectivity.

       I support neither party.  I'm Canadian.  But as far as treason goes, look into Uranium One.  To date there is no evidence Trump has done anything illegal.  That's not to say he hasn't, but I like evidence with my accusations.

       How is Uranium One treason? Uranium One isn't even an issue to those who actually understand it. There were NINE members of that board who approved it and all claimed they still would. And Hillary isn't the president, and in all honesty... WTF CARES ABOUT HILLARY!
      </p>
      <p>
       You know how I KNOW that you're a Trump supporter? Because you deflect with Hillary. It's all whataboutism. No responsibility. This is about Trump and the crimes he and his cohorts have committed.

       As far as I'm concerned the entire American justice system is a farce so long as the Clintons walk free.  In any case, you're the one who brought up treason.  The problem with Uranium One is that the Clintons took $140 mil in bribes in exchange for helping the deal.  Just because Hilldawg isn't president it doesn't mean she's one bit less if a criminal.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a Trump supporter.  I think Trump is a self serving idiot.  That doesn't mean he deserves all the lies and propaganda targeting him.

       I'm sure it's just a coincidence that several people involved in uranium one gave the Clintons $140 million. While Hillary was SecState.

       Nine people. Out of that 140mil, 131 of it came from one guy, way before the Uranium One deal, three years AFTER he stopped being involved with uranium One altogether and sold off his shares, and 18 months before Clinton became Sec of State. 
Out of the remaining 8+mill, only 1mil of it came during the UO deal. Clinton was one seat out of 9 and neither had veto or approval powers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Uranium in question was not allowed to be exported outside of the US as a stipulation of the agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, unless you think that some debunked allegation that surfaced from a book written by a BREITBART writer, and that $1mil was enough to persuade Clinton to somehow persuade 8 other committee members to also vote in favor of it, and knowing that this was investigated by bipartisan committees two years ago and only resurfaced now because trump used it as a deflection when news broke about Mueller's impending indictments... well, I mean cmon man. How is this treason exactly?
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, assume this is all true... it still isn't a bigger story than Trump, clear as day, colluding with Russia to steal the election.

       Pappadapolous ha something to say about that. As does Don Jr who can't get out of his own way. Watergate prosecutors have openly stated there is already enough evidence to convict, but Mueller isn't quite done yet.

       All great talking points, and all complete horseshit. At the time of the deal, HRC was Secretary of State, had the ear of the president, and even way back then, was the future presumptive democratic nominee for president. No one in their right mind would cross her.

      <p>
       What's more the idea that these private businessmen would suddenly start making massive donations to the CF with no expectations of favourable treatment in return is balls-to-the-wall stupid. The donations were obviously bribes, and anyone claiming otherwise is either off their rocker or gaslighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trumps a moron, as anyone with any sense can see, but the evidence for his crimes pales in concern to evidence for Hillary's crimes. The should both be held to task for everything they've done, and people like you should stop letting politics interfere with reason.

       Quite prossibly. Except it only serves to further damage the party.

       I think where you say "party damage limitation exercise," it may better be described as an effort to keep certain big money donors on board.

       ONE of Wikileaks tweet DMs was made public. Did they make public Wikileaks DM requesting that Trump make Assange an ambassador?  Did they make public the DM encouraging Trump to vocally contest the result of the election if he lost?  Did they make public the DM sharing a private username and password of an anti-Trump PAC to Trump Jr?

       Julian posted that tweet intending for folk to do what you did - mistake ONE public disclosure of the most innocuous DM for the public disclosure of ALL the DMs which simply didn't take place. He is trying to pretend he was transparent when clearly he was not and could not.
      </p>

       First, I never said Trump Jr was "responsible" for those tweets?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, he COULD be responsible for any subsequent tweets he received after first engaging with them as he clearly did not show he was rebuking them at first. Also he directly solicited information at one point by asking what the Wednesday leaks would be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, Trump Jr will more likely be responsible for lying about the tweets, not the tweets themselves.

       We need some counter to this shill problem. Eventually with fancy pants AI bots 99% of internet posts will probably be computer generated. The chilling effect is real. Eventually people will quit coming to this sub as we dont want to have to put up with defending basic premises of this sub.

       Assange is lying. He's attempting
       <a href="https://twitter.com/JulianAssange/status/930232091681443840">
        to state that
       </a>
       the tweet he posted about in July of this year had something to do with
       <strong>
        THESE MESSAGES
       </strong>
       exchanged between Wikileaks and Don Jr.
      </p>
      <p>

        When you actually go the July tweet
       </a>
       it had nothing to do with correspondence between Don Jr and Wikileaks but was an attempt by Wikileaks to have Don Jr give them the emails he had conducted about meeting the Russian lawyer about Clinton opposition research back in 2016. Instead, Don Jr posted them on his Twitter account this summer.
      </p>

       I don’t believe for a second that Assange would use Twitter messages to send anything important. He is the king of Leaking. The best in the world. He is smart enough and has been around long enough not to send this sort of shit through Twitter. Dumbest thing since the trump being pissed on by Russian prostitutes thing. Fark. I can’t believe it’s this easy after all we have seen and come through that something so dumb passes as legit.

       Agreed. At a minimum he was ok with all this being public. Basically they're working a source for info. That's how it's done - assurances of quid pro quo. How do people think DC scoops happen? I'll give you something juicy if you do me a favor later on. That's journalism.

       They literally link to thegatewaypundit but if you want a non-shit source you can 1) read the emails yourself and 2) use google on your own, you are an adult

       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/10/09/exclusive-new-email-leak-reveals-clinton-campaigns-cozy-press-relationship/">
        link The Intercept

       and it was worse than I remembered, overt lists of surrogates including those secretly taking payments...

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As The Intercept previously reported, pundits regularly featured on cable news programs were paid by the Clinton campaign without any disclosure when they appeared; several of them are included on this “surrogates” list, including Stephanie Cutter and Maria Cardona:

       Oh here's a
       <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/10/john-podesta-emails-wikileaks-press-214367">
        Politico
       </a>
       article on some related, but different, emails indicating collusion with the press. What's particularly sad is that his best effort to explain this is essentially that "Everybody has to do this" to cover political news. "Not that it's right, but that it just is."
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, if we are talking of evidence of an
       <em>
        intimate level of collusion and conspiracy
       </em>
       , this coordinated group of journalists spreading favorable news through a supposedly unbiased press seems like a much bigger deal than some fucking tweets. But, again, the people attempting to crucify Wikileaks over this are the same who refuse to see any malfeasance in what their releases exposed.

       I think most people are missing the bigger picture regarding Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of the source, more truthful information is always of value to the curious skeptic. If you feel like a a fanboy of a band who just saw his idol shooting up heroin, that's just you conflating the value of the music with the value of the musician. Motive for publishing information, does not detract from the intrinsic value of information, it only corrupts the general sentiment of the gullible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Governments and organisations are always welcome to disclose more information to provide contradicting context to leaks, but that usually comes at a cost that they don't like to pay, and is (again) of value to the curious skeptic. Until the
       <em>
        actual information
       </em>
       that Wikileaks provides becomes as blatantly fake as the MSM, I'll continue to read it.

       I think one of the big issues that a lot of people have is that we now have confirmation that Wikileaks is not unbiased as they had always claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now we know that Wikileaks has an agenda, just like Fox News or CNN or Brietbart or Share Blue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Julian Assange, when previously asked why the leaks are never Trump related, said before that none of the stuff he had on Trump wasn't any worse than the stuff that he says publicly. Is that something we can still trust is true?

       Trump says the most outrageous shit so unless someone leaks something like tax returns showing he broke the law (like he was trying to get don jr to do) or that he diddled kids with his billionaire friends, its safe to say they don't. Considering Trumps been a private person and his company is controlled by his family, its very unlikely any leaks will come out via this way, unless that kid he doesn't like feels like she wants to bring him down.

       Disagree. Contextualize this stuff. Assange is sending unencrypted twitter DMs to a presidential campaign that was already "colluding with Russia?" right around the time they are also publishing damning leaks of the opposition and essentially "fishing for collusion" right before getting their internet shut off? And the content of those DMs is insane. This "story" is fishy. No doubt Trump Jr. thought he was communicating with Assange / WL, but I think it's pretty clear to anyone with half a brain what's happening here.

       First, why do you think it's unencrypted? When you go to Twitter, it shows https, which means it's secured. Almost every website does this.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, the protocol over which data is sent between your browser and the website that you are connected to. The 'S' at the end of HTTPS stands for 'Secure'. It means all communications between your browser and the website are encrypted.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Also, they're incredibly likely to be using VPN and other security measures considering they deal
       <em>
        in stolen information
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not arguing what you're generally trying to say, I am saying that you are arguing it poorly. Hope this educates you a bit more, having a better informed argument only helps you.

       Ok, point taken. My point was simply that Twitter DMs are far from the most secure form of communicating - especially if you're someone known for secrecy / privacy, and especially if you're allegedly attempting collude to effect the US Presidential election. Agree?

       That really isn't the point, Twitter is the method they had to communicate. The platform itself is secure enough, that if they take further security measures they are solid.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they chose to communicate by some encrypted anonymous app, the real weakness isn't how they're communicating, it was that Junior shared what was communicated. Using some other means wouldn't change the fact that it came out, not by hacking, but by Jr.
      </p>
      <p>
       They likely assumed he wouldn't implicate himself, when in reality he is implicating them. He doesn't come out looking good by far, obviously the campaign took actions based on WikiLeaks communications.. but they look really bad, considering in their AMA they said they don't do
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       what they did.

       You're right. Even if we say it was a cia op. I'll give you the benefit of the doubt here. So even if we say that, how does that negate trumps intent to collude with a foreign propaganda arm? The fact he tweeted about a story 15 minutes after being asked to shows he had intentions to use said Russian propaganda outlet to help win. Which shows intent to use a foreign campaign contribution. Which is illegal.

       Either way, at the end of the day they're exposing wrongdoing and the truth while the MSM is trying to hide and downplay it to prop up their candidate they're biased for. This is nothing more than an attempt to discredit Wikileaks and take away from what they exposed.

       I saw this same argument in a different post, so I'll post the same thing.  This does not confirm that they didn't have info on Trump.  It just confirms that they didn't have anything that fit into their desired agenda.  They could have some nasty stuff on Trump, but because they wanted him to win they were not going to release it.  As they stated they needed something small to make it seem like they were not biased so people would trust them more.

        Please make sure to understand that this is not an argument that they did have big things on Trump, just that this whole thing can not be used as an argument that they didn't have anything on Trump.

       What information was held back? This accusation is completely baseless, if anyone had info on Trump you could just send it to a different outlet. And with that, you could send your chat logs with Wikileaks to that outlet to expose them AND Trump.

       For now no. just common sense seeing the timing of the leaks, the cleverly spun narrative by wikileaks and Russian media, etc. But as this story has come out, as the probe progresses, I am sure you will get sources to your heart's content. Hope you do not still be in denial

       It's all pretty ironic. Everyone was all like "leak stuff from the Trump campaign or you're obviously biased!" -- so they started actively seeking out material from the Trump campaign, even going so far as to try to solicit leaks from Trump's own son (although that almost certainly would not have been the extent of their efforts). Evidence of that attempt emerges, and suddenly that's even more proof of bias.
      </p>
      <p>
       The possibility really has to be considered that they leaked stuff on the Democrats because they received stuff on the Democrats, and that if they received something similarly newsworthy on the other side, they would have released it -- but instead, they were put in this position where they were desperately trying to chase down Trump leaks to repair their image and failing. Hmm.

       You have to be extremely naive if you think this was an attempt to solicit leaks and not try to "come across" as "balanced". Not even the naivest of naive person will try to get leaks from the guy's own son.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all the different news about Trump campaign coming out now, I refuse to believe wikileaks did not get any of that stuff at any point. So many info was easily available. Forget about during the campaign, why are those leaks not happening now from wikileak when every other media outlet has been releasing news about people involved in Trump's campaign?

       Maybe because lots of other, more "reputable" news outlets are printing those leaks, whereas WikiLeaks tends to specialize in things they don't touch (like how several major outlets turned down Chelsea Manning before she reached out to WikiLeaks).
      </p>
      <p>
       You know what would be a HUGE story for any news outlet? "Our source tells us [damning info about Trump campaign]. Our source also tells us that they submitted this highly newsworthy and verified authentic information to WikiLeaks but
       <em>
        were rejected.
       </em>
       "
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone who goes to the trouble of submitting leaks to WikiLeaks is going to want the dirt out there. It isn't believable that WikiLeaks would or could suppress something on Trump submitted to them that was newsworthy and verifiable without that story making it to another outlet and further damaging their credibility.

       Well, I'm not so sure that WikiLeaks can be called a "foreign actor". I'm all for Trump going to jail if he broke the law, but although they were obviously trying to change people's perceptions.. that is kind of what a campaign does.
      </p>
      <p>
       WikiLeaks has servers everywhere apparently, but mainly in Sweden.. I think that someone would have to prove that WikiLeaks is an agent of some specific foreign actor before what you said becomes true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the exchange between Jr and WikiLeaks shows they don't want to be seen as pro Russia, but that doesn't make them an
       <em>
        actual agent of Russia
       </em>
       . It's just one more but of evidence that will help investigations.. I actually respect Jr for coming forward with it, he has more integrity than his father at the least.

       52 USC 30121 prohibits foreign nationals (both Wikileaks and J.A. fall under this definition) from making or promising to make a contribution of a thing of value (this is a poorly defined term but the FEC has held it to be broadly interpreted and does include merely the provision of information) in connection with a federal election. 52 USC 30121 also prohibits a person from soliciting, accepting or receiving a thing of value from a foreign national.

       Then the question becomes, is simply replying to someone in another country a crime? I'm not defending him, but I imagine they've been contacted by every kind of nefarious foreign power you can imagine.. and seeing how none of them have a background in politics, they'd be dumb enough to fall for shit.

       There's an important part of almost all law called
       <em>
        mens rea
       </em>
       .
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mens_rea">
        The standard common law test of criminal liability is expressed in the Latin phrase actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea, i.e. "the act is not culpable unless the mind is guilty".
       </a>
       So, did he knowingly accept or solicit this information? He only replied 3 times, but their actions did reflect that they received the messages..
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't know. I think every day we get a clearer picture.. I think it's just as likely they'll end up being charged for crimes they didn't know were illegal until after the fact. Maybe they knowingly and purposely sought out information, I just don't think this is a clear example of that.

       I think it's the pretend bipartisan approach WikiLeaks takes. We know they're biased. We don't really know why yet. Pretending to not be biased is a big problem.

       People pretended like they just released what they had with zero bias. That's what this is in response to. It's great if you already saw the bias, but many didn't.

       haha, with some genuine conspiracies actually hitting the frontpage of this sub, it's nice to see that the trolls have a place to hide; this thread. The deflection is fucking real, man.

      <p>
       I'm not into conspiracies
       <em>
        at all

       , but it's fucking hilarious watching you guys try to steer the discussion away and talk about
       <em>
        literally anything else
       </em>
       other than the actual conspiracy unfolding before our eyes. Kind of sad to see a sub that is supposedly about skepticism fall so deep into the pro-Trump rabbit hole.

       Because the other posts on this sub, you know; the ones with actual sources, reached the frontpage of
       <a href="/r/all">

       What I’m saying is that CNN literally gave Hillary debate questions prior to said debate. No coverage. Here you have Wikileaks (not necessarily Assange) suggesting they leak a tax return, and promoting links that are in their mutual interest. I just don’t think that is even close to completely ruining Assange or even Wikileaks credibility and believe that this is simply an attempt to destroy said credibility through inflating the topic and severity.

       Fair enough. Just predicting because it seems to fit. But you are totally correct.
