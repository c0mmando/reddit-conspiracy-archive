       Edgy post brah. What those messages show is wikileaks was activingly working with and for the Trump campaign. So all that bullshit about then being impartial is over. When they pretended that they blew off Cambridge Analytic because they wanted to remain impartial is completely laughable. The reason you guys are upset is because Julian has finally been outted as Trumps lapdog.

       I would hope they would be as outraged as they are now. Using Wikileaks to lessen the impact of true investigative journalism is bullshit to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want my honest opnion, this entire leak of conversations between Don Jr and Wikileaks really has no meat. It's just huge hypocracy and maybe an exposal of Wikileaks. That's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were stories broken over the last few days about Turkey allegedly bribing Mike Flynn millions for an illegal extradition of Gulen. But that never got any traction here. It didn't gain much attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm only posting here on this thread and others because of all the excitement. I think this story is interesting, but compared to what came out about Flynn, there isn't really anything that important to me.

       It's probably because Don Jr. is involved as opposed to Flynn who Trump has distanced himself from.

       I'm a corruption first voter.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have my own political views about different things, many that would fit in one part, some would fit in another party.
      </p>
      <p>
       But over the past two years, I have kindof given up on really siding with parties. I'm not American. Parties in my own country always do fucked up shit to grease donor projects and bribe people running for office to drop out of races. I see shit for what it is now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a straight up addiction to investigating corruption. Following money flows and looking up LLC registration is now a hobby for me.

       It has to do with buzzwords honestly. Manafort and Flynn did much more illegal stuff than Don Jr did. So unless you include the word "Indictments" in the title, people rarely give a shit. The story includes "Trump" and "Wikileaks", so it is natural for people to care more about something that has better buzzwords.

       For anyone of those lazy POS who aren't mature or responsible enough to actually be politically informed, Trump and his son directly acted on information shared with them.

       I read the article, please provide quotes that show they were actively working together.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I read is that WL was trying and JR was pretty much ignoring them.  WL suggested they tweet a link, to extremely important information about the dirty Clinton cartel, they tweeted.  That's working together to you people?  Your spin is weak.

       Wikileaks informs Trump Jr about podesta emails, and then fifteen minutes later Trump himself immediately starts to tweet about them, and mentions that people should dig into them. Something assange specifically told them to do.

       WikiLeaks would have released Podesta’s emails and DNC hack stuff wether or not he spoke to Trump Jr.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe if he had anything on Trump, he would have released it. He never mentions having anything on him which he felt gave the appearance of bias. He asked Jr. for Trump Tax returns or anything else so he could release it, which is exactly what the left has been asking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing sounds to me like WikiLeaks trying to get a source to provide them with leaks so they could publish them. I don’t see anything that looks illegal. WikiLeaks has a perfect record on the material they’ve published. The worst thing they did was possibly coordinate publishing dates but it’s also not unusual for a News Paper to contact the Source before publishing a damning story.

       If they had dirt on Trump, and they were indeed "colluding" with the Trump campaign, you would think there would be a DM to that effect, that the Trump campaign do 'x' or wikileaks would release damaging information.
