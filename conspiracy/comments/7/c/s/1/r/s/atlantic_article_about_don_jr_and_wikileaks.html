       Here is the text from Atlantic that is, IMO, the most damning part of the DM exchange:
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the third reason, though, Wikileaks wrote, that “is the real kicker.” “If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,” Wikileaks explained. “That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.” It then provided an email address and link where the Trump campaign could send the tax returns, and adds, “The same for any other negative stuff (documents, recordings) that you think has a decent chance of coming out. Let us put it out.”
      </p>
      <p>
       In the
       <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/930228239494209536">
        original DM
       </a>
       they say:
      </p>
      <p>
       “That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source,
       <strong>
        which the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with
       </strong>
       .”
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would the author purposefully leave out such a key line after writing everything else out word for word?
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not a Trump supporter at all, you can check my post history. It is interesting that the narrative being pushed on here that this is confirmation that Assange is working for the Russians. This to me just seems to be a desperate attempt by Assange to further his selfish goals of getting out of the embassy and making money through donations to Wikileaks.

       I got downvoted for posting about the author of this piece has an apparent axe to grind with Trump. She was fired at Politico for a tweet in December 2016.

       The messages are real. Thanks to Don Jr you can read them as they are.

       The author is important. Some of these journalists are just scumbags and actively on the payroll of groups other than their publication.

       Not really, the bias was clear, was pointing it out back then, regardless I enjoy leaks, and didn't vote for either.  But keep projecting, it tends to make one feel better.

       Yea it does. They were definitely pro-Trump and it was obvious. Assange hates Hillary. I never was trying to argue they weren't. This to me just seems like evidence that Assange was playing the PR game for Wikileaks to give the media what they wanted. Trump leaks from Wikileaks. By leaving that line out the author implies that this is directly related to Russian collusion. Almost like Wikileaks is admitting they are "Pro-Russia". It is intentionally misleading.

       Thank you for this. It is so obvious now that you mention it. If they are chasing a tax return, they obviously don’t have anything. Plus they would have leaked something, at least, to give the illusion of fairness to both sides. All these liberal sheep can’t read between the lines.

       To be honest with you, in my mind I hadn't even tied that together in my head yet. Clearly at least part of their intent with what we see today was to appear fair, especially to counter the slander from the Clinton campaign about them (that has carried on), and that also clearly means they don't have anything on him because again, nothing has been released. They would have released it.

       One. Yes you clearly are a trump supporter.

       Two. Because writers do this thing called condensing quotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three. Because it has nothing to do with the story? This isn't CNN, where they give a voice to every single party in the controversy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assange's claim that he's being slandered, while he's directly aiding her political rival, is not important to the story. No more than Trump's hatred for Nato. Or Clinton's email servers.
      </p>

       Writers cut out the shit that isn't important.

       Sorry friend, but you're dead wrong here on your second assertion. The way it's written in the article makes it seem like it's a complete sentence by ending with a period after Pro-Russian source. If the author wanted to condense the quote with journalistic integrity, she would have ended with an ellipses, not a period, to recognize the fact that that was not the sentence in its entirety. These are rules you learn in your first class at J-school and are imperative for ethical reasons when pulling direct quotes for a story. But then that wouldn't have as much of an impact as her editorialized version, would it?

       It opened the discussion up for criticism. The author could have avoided it by including the full quote, which is all of nine words extra in length.
      </p>
      <p>
       This drives to the major issue people have with the MSM; selective reporting and major spin.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm certain it wouldn't have made a material difference to have included those nine words. It does make a difference to have selectively edited them out.
