        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">85</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-14 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/hungarianmeatslammer.html">hungarianmeatslammer</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here is the text from Atlantic that is, IMO, the most damning part of the DM exchange:</p>

<p>It is the third reason, though, Wikileaks wrote, that “is the real kicker.” “If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,” Wikileaks explained. “That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.” It then provided an email address and link where the Trump campaign could send the tax returns, and adds, “The same for any other negative stuff (documents, recordings) that you think has a decent chance of coming out. Let us put it out.”</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/930228239494209536">original DM</a> they say:</p>

<p>“That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source, <strong>which the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with</strong>.”</p>

<p>Why would the author purposefully leave out such a key line after writing everything else out word for word?</p>

<p>I am not a Trump supporter at all, you can check my post history. It is interesting that the narrative being pushed on here that this is confirmation that Assange is working for the Russians. This to me just seems to be a desperate attempt by Assange to further his selfish goals of getting out of the embassy and making money through donations to Wikileaks.</p>

<p>Edit: Bolded important part</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea it does. They were definitely pro-Trump and it was obvious. Assange hates Hillary. I never was trying to argue they weren&#39;t. This to me just seems like evidence that Assange was playing the PR game for Wikileaks to give the media what they wanted. Trump leaks from Wikileaks. By leaving that line out the author implies that this is directly related to Russian collusion. Almost like Wikileaks is admitting they are &quot;Pro-Russia&quot;. It is intentionally misleading.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry friend, but you&#39;re dead wrong here on your second assertion. The way it&#39;s written in the article makes it seem like it&#39;s a complete sentence by ending with a period after Pro-Russian source. If the author wanted to condense the quote with journalistic integrity, she would have ended with an ellipses, not a period, to recognize the fact that that was not the sentence in its entirety. These are rules you learn in your first class at J-school and are imperative for ethical reasons when pulling direct quotes for a story.
