    <div class="md"><p>I love these people who come on so self-righteous and act like they know what&#39;s going on when they <em>don&#39;t know SHIT.</em></p>

<p>Look, moron, read this story from The Guardian, which did a really good job--even though they hate Trump--as actual JOURNALISTS taking this fraud&#39;s story apart:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-13-year-old-cancels-public-event">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/02/donald-trump-rape-lawsuit-13-year-old-cancels-public-event</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A Guardian investigation in July found that a publicist calling himself “Al Taylor” attempted to sell a videotape of Doe relating her allegations for $1m. It linked Taylor through a variety of means including shared email addresses and phone numbers to Lubow, formerly of Springer’s daytime talkshow.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, Jerry fucking Springer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lubow was connected to a contentious claim, raised in the 1998 documentary movie Kurt and Courtney, that Courtney Love offered a fellow musician $50,000 to murder her husband, Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. </p>

<p>According to the New York Post, Lubow was also behind a tabloid newspaper story that OJ Simpson bought illicit drugs on the day his estranged wife Nicole Brown was killed.</p>

<p>When the Guardian quizzed “Al Taylor” about his true identity, the publicist replied: “Just be warned, we’ll sue you if we don’t like what you write. We’ll sue your ass, own your ass and own your newspaper’s ass as well, punk.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But you just keep screaming from your high horse, I&#39;m sure there will be shills and morons who agree. But you&#39;re wrong. Or a liar. Or a fraud. Or a bot. </p>

<p>What you are <em>not</em> however, is well-informed. </p>

<p>And <em>that&#39;s</em> why the media doesn&#39;t chase Trump/Epstein. And, of course, because there are a ton of media whores who went to his island, too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you and other trump supporters are saying that the media hates trump and that the system wants him out of power correct?  This is your belief that he is truly against the NWO. </p>

<p>And there&#39;s a huge massive hysteria going on regarding powerful people and sexual abuse in the media currently, correct?</p>

<p>Dude, if I were trying to sabotage him, I&#39;d drop that Epstein stuff ALL over the place and get this dudes ass implicated and rally the people remove him from power. You claim he&#39;s innocent, isn&#39;t this a dirty trick they would pull? </p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t they jumped on this shit? Because he&#39;s not really against them, he&#39;s an asset of theirs, and you&#39;re falling for the reverse psychology of the social engineers. </p>

<p>Not particularly a Trump supporter. Just don&#39;t trust the media AT ALL (and I know from personal experience x33) and think the DNC and Clinton cabal totally corrupt.</p>

<p>Trump&#39;s not even running things. He&#39;s a reality show president. The military and some other non-CIA types are running it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If the MSM brought anything up about Epstein they would also have to bring up a shit ton of people that are tied to him. I doubt they&#39;ll ever use that card weather it&#39;s fake or not. As far as a Jane Doe goes, who is she? I would be more inclined to bite if there were some kind of evidence. Even circumstantial. If your evidence is Trump saying he&#39;s a great guy. I will wait for something more. I&#39;ve said the same thing about people I don&#39;t care for in social situations where I felt like I had to, just to get along with everyone else. From my understanding, a lot of high up people were friends with Epstein. If you had plans to run for president, you might say the same thing until he&#39;s exposed. Then you can say I never liked the fucker. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of Trump and Epstein posts on this sub lately. We&#39;ve known this for months. </p>

<p>Why is it being rehashed and by whom? We know the elites are desperate. So it looks like they ARE calling Trump out for this, just not in the MSM but on Reddit for now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;ve been covering up all sorts elite pedophile shit.  Epstein has dirt on a wide variety of people who are connected.  Also, why crack that can of worms when theu can pull bs like Trump trying to murder Koa fish.  I&#39;m not a fan of Trump, but that shit was ridiculous.</p>
