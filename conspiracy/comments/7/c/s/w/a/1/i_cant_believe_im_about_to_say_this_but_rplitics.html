       The top post of both subreddits is the same article about potential collusion between Wikileaks and the Trump campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, unlike the other subreddit, the title in r/conspiracy is outright lying about the content of the article.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Trump tweeted about Podesta emails 15 minutes after WikiLeaks asked Trump Jr. to: report
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From /r/p*litics
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Leaked emails show WikiLeaks and Trump Jr. Conversing about possible deals between them
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       From
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       The first title is outright fact. Is it worded to elicit a certain reaction from the reader? Yes, but that's not lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article reveals no deals, nor attempts to make deals, had anybody actually read it. Wikileaks communicates with Trump's son in an effort to get him to leak information from Trump. For example,
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Hey Don. We have an unusual idea,” WikiLeaks wrote on October 21, 2016. “Leak us one or more of your father’s tax returns.” WikiLeaks then laid out three reasons why this would benefit both the Trumps and WikiLeaks. One, The New York Times had already published a fragment of Trump’s tax returns on October 1; two, the rest could come out any time “through the most biased source (e.g. NYT/MSNBC).”
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the third reason, though, WikiLeaks wrote, that “is the real kicker.” “If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality,” WikiLeaks explained. “That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.” It then provided an email address and link where the Trump campaign could send the tax returns, and adds, “The same for any other negative stuff (documents, recordings) that you think has a decent chance of coming out. Let us put it out.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Now, that's pretty damning evidence isn't it? Oh... well, it might be if not for the fact that
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       thing; Literally the only thing Wikileaks offers to do is leak files. They word it in a way that makes it seem like it is in Trumps' best interest for them to do,
       <em>
        because that's how you convince someone to do something.
       </em>
       Wikileaks is "colluding" with Trump by trying to get his son to release not only his tax returns, but anything else they can get their hands on. Can you imagine? Wikileaks trying to get leaks?
      </p>
      <p>
       However, once this "colluding" doesn't work out, they decide to "collude" with the entire american public by requesting the exact same thing
       <em>
        <a href="http://fortune.com/2017/01/23/wikileaks-trump-tax-returns/">
         publically,
        </a>
       </em>
       to anyone that might have them, when Trumps' son did not release them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The article contains a number of DMs from Wikileaks goading Trump Jr. to leak documents, or give free advertising for what they had already leaked. All while trying to convince him it's what's best for the Trump campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's it. Not once does Wikileaks offer to withhold information, give preferential treatment of any fashion or even remotely offer any kind of "deal" as the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       post suggests.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       has either fallen below, or been targeted in the same way for propaganda like r/p*litics or r/The_D*nald.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a damn shame.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: Made it clear that it's the same article being retitled.

       Uhh, since you're responding in a comment chain I'm not sure if you're talking about the op of this chain or if you're talking about the Wikileaks employees that talked to Don Jr.
      </p>

       If this chain, I was commending him for reading deeper than even I did. If you're asking about Wikileaks, I didn't make an opinion on that.

       If you want to have a discussion about Wikileaks trying to convince people to leak things, or about how they leak documents at all, and the morality thereof - That's a big, but unrelated discussion with plenty of discourse around it for you to form your own opinion on.

      <p>
       I was just talking about all of it really. I don't see how the r/p headline isn't just a sensationalist headline to highlight that Trump's trying to deflect from this "big leak", in order to get people to think that the evidence is damaging.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I don't see how the r/conspiracy headline is inaccurate, considering no deals were struck, therefore were just
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       .

       What you're missing, from my perspective, is that not only were there no deals made, there were no
       <em>
        possible
       </em>
       deals in discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even when the author tries to cut them early to remove context, the alleged "possible deals"consists solely of either Wikileaks attempting to get leaks, for no compensation - which is less than they offer for some actual public leak requests where they'll put up a bounty
      </p>
      <p>
       Or it's them linking a leak they already posted and trying to get Don Jr. to either give it exposure himself or from his father.
      </p>
      <p>
       There simply aren't any deals being proposed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, I think you and a number of people here have perfectly valid concerns regarding the morality or of using a political opponent to provide exposure for a leak. I think that might factor in to when you first asked if I thought what he did was wrong or not, though I wasn't thinking of it at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect that observation, and I think there's a real discussion to be had there, I can't even blame some if this bolsters their accusations of "collusion." However, that wasn't the intended subject of this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hope that clears up my position, thanks for the respectful response. :)

       Missed the point, shill.

       Just because something is
       <em>
        perceived
       </em>
       to be false - in this case Wikileaks impartiality - doesn't mean it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       false.
      </p>
      <p>
       You asshats always forget that Assange has published numerous leaks from Russia and, when that's pointed out, you always claim they didn't take down Putin so they couldn't have been good enough (in your eyes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing is, you forget that he's former KGB and is from a nation with a record of "disappearing" troublesome journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's risk vs reward. Hell, you get more from publishing blatant lies in the United States than you do from publishing truth in Russia.

       Here is a clear attempt by Wikileaks to publish selected leaks from the Trump Campaign to fool you into believing their impartial.  It's pretty explicit.  You'd say Wikileaks is a shit institution if this is how they get all their leaks.

       I can't believe how The Atlantic irresponsibly reported this. They are no better than neon nettle or Breitbart. Nor can I believe that people will come here and put up posts suggesting r/politicz has more integrity than our place.

       Of course, considering the battalion of bots and shills that are here trying to drive the false narrative, the integrity has been fouled all around.

       You hit it right on the head!  Well said.  Totally agreed.  People should just read the damn messages, they aren't that long.  It's pretty simple what was going on.  Wikileaks was trying to coerce Donald Jr into leaking documents in a deal that could be beneficial for each party.  Wikileaks improves their reputation since they didn't have anything else on Trump and Trump gets to release "his truths" through an unbiased source.

       Sorry, I'm not subscribed so I only see posts here when they get to
       <a href="/r/all">
        /r/all
       </a>
       . Although I've seen people complaining about manipulation here, it never seemed as pervasive as it was on other subs - given that this sub only has a highly upvoted post every once in a while, unlike the other ones which are clearly paying to have every other post upvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first line of my post mentions that they're about the same thing, but I could edit it to say that they're the same article if you think that's better? The point is that the title in each sub is different, and the
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">

       title is a falsehood.

       Stop pretending to be so naive. Obviously wikileaks didn't just roll up to Don and say "hey bro can we have your dad's tax returns?" He wanted something small he could release on Trump so they could pretend to be impartial. Obviously they wouldn't just ask Don for any real damaging information on Trump. Wikileaks was clearly working with and for the Trump campaign to help them get elected. Oh the day the pussy grabbing tape came out, wikileaks rushed to their computers to release a bunch of Podesta emails. They timed releases to help Trump. They told us "Cambridge Analytica approached us and we said no." Cool dude  this guy has been trying so hard to pretend he's impartial. We now have direct proof that he's not.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if they timed releases to help them, and they kept in touch and tried to help each other, why on earth would Julian ever release damning information on Trump even if he got some? He's not some impartial warrior for the truth. He's a dude with an agenda. End of story.

       Okay, but that's exactly what the article says. I even posted the quote above for you. He actually does "roll up to Don" and say ostensibly that.

       too clean, then by all means believe what you will.

       For the record though, I think your better off focusing on the steaming pile of shit that has been the trump presidency so far, rather than continuing to try and fight a losing battle over campaign scandals. With the seemingly endless corruption scandals that keep coming out on Clinton's side, the fact you're still trying to get something out of Trump-Wikileaks is not a good sign.

       Im not on some crusade to bring down Trump. I don't think he would ever get impeached for his connections to Russia. The point of the story today was outting wikileaks. They aren't some truth seeking organization that's willing to release anything on anybody. They are an organization that got information from Russia to help Trump win. They will never release damaging information on Trump while he's in office. To me this entire story is about wikileaks. The fact that Don Jr. Was a useful pon for them is a side note.

       It's pretty simple what I think. Russia gave wikileaks DNC and Podesta emails to release. They timed those releases and kept in touch with the Trump campaign to help them out. Both Russia and wikileaks wanted Trump to win.

       I see. The Russian influence in the election is undisputable. There's documented proof of Clinton receiving generous amounts of money, and purchasing the Dossier by proxy. The Trump connections have yet to become quite as clear, but there was that Don Jr./Ambassador? thing. Either way, I'm ready to agree it would be foolish to pretend they weren't in contact previously, given how well Trump and Putin are getting along. If we ever get solid proof that Russia gave Wikileaks the emails, I wouldn't be the least bit incredulous.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, where it falls apart for me is your insistence on Wikileaks directly colluding with both parties. What has Assange gained? He's still holed up in that Embassy, if you don't believe
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       that he's been killed. Wikileaks hasn't suddenly started pouring out CIA files from Trump about the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as I can tell, as evidenced by the correspondence in this article, they simply took advantage of the race to release files during controversial upticks to get the most eyes on them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Between them getting no benefit, and these candid communications showing nothing more than them using the president to signal boost their stuff, I just can't justify the leap in logic without something more solid.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, assuming Russia did give WL the emails, and seeing as they were also heavily involved with Clinton,
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       that it was revealed they bought partisan ads for both sides online, all I can see is that they played both sides and would have been cozy with whoever got in.
      </p>
      <p>
       While still a bit curt, I appreciate you sharing your view.

       Trump had to fire his campaign manager because of his sketchy ties to Russia. He would later get criminally indicted. Trump brings Flynn into his cabinet. Then we find out that he's a Russian agent. So he gets fired. The FBI is investigating the Trump campaign. Trump tells Comey to back off Flynn and be loyal. He doesn't. So he gets fired. Sessions recuses himself from the investigation because he lied to Congress about meeting with the Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bring in Mueller. He finds enough dirt on Manafort to charge him. He also criminally indicts Papadaoplous, who tried to set up meetings with Russia and lied about it. Don Jr. meets with a Kremlin cronie in Trump tower hoping to get dirt on Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you see any strange pattern going on here? What a bunch of crazy ads coincidences.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why Julian supports Trump. Maybe he just hated Hillary that much. But Russia wanted Trump. You said they bought ads on both sides. That's not true. They bought ads for Trump, Bernie, and Stein. They wanted to do everything they could to take votes away from Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Russia probably did get some dirt on Trump. If the friendship didn't work out, they would have something to hold over his head to get what they want. But luckily for them, Trump has been a nice little boy who has happily appeased them.

       You're absolutely right, the whole cabinet mess had slipped my mind since I was focused on pre-election. I didn't doubt it much, but I certainly accept Trump's heavy ties to Russia now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think you're reaching to indict Julian on anything too much more than "Maybe he just hated Hillary that much." I suppose it works if you take the twitter comms at face value. The whole "You scratch my back I scratch yours." But it just seems too impersonal for that. WL digs and digs, and they can't get what they want from Don Jr. Why fake message him at all, if they were going to go public on their tax return request? Hmm.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ad stuff though, it looks like you may be right. There was even a solely anti-trump ad that didn't promote anyone, but no Clinton. This is r/Conspiracy however, so you'll have to forgive me if I imagine the possibility that Facebook withheld such an ad.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let's suppose that's not the case, then what of the Dossier purchased from Russia? The money from Russia, if you really squint your eyes could be ignored, or even claimed as a smokescreen. It's too much of a stretch to pretend they're unrelated for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Less involved? Sure, certainly less actual people - but then we don't get to see Clinton's cabinet. Ultimately, I was never going to argue to hard against Trump-Russia, it's the push for WL to be labeled as nothing more than a mouthpiece after they've released on both sides that I object to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should they have tried harder to get something on Trump? Probably, but that would mean sitting on Clinton's stuff longer than they did to release it piecemeal so it would actually get paid attention to. Ultimately, if we go with the idea that Hillary really was someone Julian truly wanted to make sure had their corruption revealed, there's never going to be a time where he could get attention on her stuff than during her run.

       Missed the point, shill.

      <p>
       Just because something is
       <em>
        perceived
       </em>
       to be false - in this case Wikileaks impartiality - doesn't mean it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       false.
      </p>
      <p>
       You asshats always forget that Assange has published numerous leaks from Russia and, when that's pointed out, you always claim they didn't take down Putin so they couldn't have been good enough (in your eyes).
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing is, you forget that he's former KGB and is from a nation with a record of "disappearing" troublesome journalists.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's risk vs reward. Hell, you get more from publishing blatant lies in the United States than you do from publishing truth in Russia.
