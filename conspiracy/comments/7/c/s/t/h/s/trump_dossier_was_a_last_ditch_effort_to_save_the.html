    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Friends/associates that have fun together for fifteen years...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you have any evidence of that?</p>

<p>So far, all I&#39;ve seen linking Trump and Epstein is the one quote you provide, and a quote from an alleged transcript in which Epstein states that Trump flew on Epstein&#39;s brother&#39;s plane from Florida to New York.</p>

<p>And the one story about Trump kicking Epstein out of one of his resorts/communities.</p>

<p>The quote you cite seems leading; it&#39;s an empty soundbyte with false praise about a well connected guy it likely wouldn&#39;t make sense to call out. I&#39;ve never even seen when it&#39;s dated to.</p>

<p>The single flight is entirely innocuous. Worse, for all that it gets disingenuously shilled, it does not live up to the claims which are attached to it.</p>

<p>And kicking Epstein out of a Trump property seems entirely contradictory to all this talk about connections between the two.</p>

<p>Do you have anything else to support a connection?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh and Trump&#39;s nominee for Secretary of Labor was the Alexander Acosta, the US Attorney that gave Epstein his bullshit deal for one year in prison.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I doubt he tapped Acosta because the guy only slapped Epstein on the wrist. I&#39;m not familiar with Epstein&#39;s case, what charges they brought against him, what charges they managed to prove, or what possible sentence was in play.</p>

<p>It&#39;s unsightly, but I imagine when selecting someone for such a position, you&#39;re typically examining more than a singular event in their career. And I don&#39;t know put Acosta&#39;s name in the running for the position.</p>

<p>As someone who has worked for more than a decade with the microfilm collection of Soviet documents in the Hoover Institution Archives, I can say that the dossier itself was compiled by a Russian, whose command of English is far from perfect and who follows the KGB (now FSB) practice of writing intelligence reports, in particular the practice of capitalizing all names for easy reference. The report includes Putin’s inner circle – Peskov, Ivanov, Sechin, Lavrov. The anonymous author claims to have “trusted compatriots” who knew the roles that each Kremlin insider, including Putin himself, played in the Trump election saga and were prepared to tell him.</p>

<p>Which one of the claims are you referring to that has been verified to be false? I want a specific page number/quote from the dossier and an explanation/source one the debunking.</p>

<p>For an example of a verified claim that you can follow in the response.</p>

<h1>Dossier Claim About Page</h1>

<p>There claims in the dossier about Carter Page meeting with Igor Sechin(head of Rosneft) in Russia during the campaign. Page has admitted to meeting with Rosneft executives during a trip in 2016, and has admitted to in interviews that he spoke about Russian sanctions when he took the trip during the campaign. He admitted that he did not meet with Sechin directly, but that he met with the head of Investor Relations at Rosneft, Andrey Baranov.</p>

<h3>Claim</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Speaking in July 2016, a Russian source close to Rosneft President, PUTIN
close associate and US-sanctioned individual, Igor SECHIN, confided the
details of a recent secret meeting between him and visiting Foreign
Affairs Advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, Carter PAGE.</p>

<p>According to SECHIN&#39;s associate, the Rosneft President (CEO) had raised
with PAGE the issues of future bilateral energy cooperation and
prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western
sanctions against Russia. PAGE had reacted positively to this demarche
by SECHIN but had been generally non-committal in response.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Evidence Proving One of Carter Page Allegations</h3>

<p><strong>ABC Interview</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stephanopoulos pressed, &quot;It sounds like, from what you&#39;re saying, it&#39;s possible you may have discussed the easing of sanctions.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Something may have come up in a conversation,&quot; Page replied. &quot;I have no recollection, and there&#39;s nothing specifically that I would have done that would have given people that impression.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Testimony</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>MR. QUIGLEY: Did he ever talk to you about the fact that that company was under
sanctions by the United States?</p>

<p>MR. PAGE: I have no recollection of that.</p>

<p>MR. QUIGLEY: You have no recollection of ever talking to him about the fact that
his company was sanctiOned by the United StateS?</p>

<p>MR. PAGE: See, this is where I&#39;m careful, because sanctions, it&#39;s a key thing -- or</p>

It became a movement among his supporters, a widespread acceptance that there is in fact a political elite that believes they are above the law of man.

    <div class="md"><p>I think its pretty clear at this point that powerful DC lobbyists (some of whom ended up on Trump&#39;s team) were bought by Russian and Ukrainian interests over the past 10 or so years.</p>

<p>The problem: this hurts the old cabal more due to the U1 coverup and sale, which seemed to be rubber-stamped by the old guard.  That&#39;s why the Russia narrative is starting to backfire on them, especially with the exploratory effort for a special council now.</p>

<p>On one hand, we have concern that Russian interests manipulated social media to support Trump&#39;s campaign.  The implication being that they would be /hisguy/ in office.  We&#39;ve seen evidence of the manipulation, but no evidence of him doing anything illegal on their behalf or on their directives in office.  Meanwhile, the Obama administration initiated a sale (and following coverup) of a strategically significant amount of uranium to a authoritarian state that runs on nuclear weapons.  Try to impartially weigh that against twitter bots.  </p>

<p>The evidence of actual, harmful collusion is there.  It&#39;s just not with Trump, it&#39;s with the Obama administration.  And that&#39;s what makes this all so fascinating.</p>

<p>This is just straight up wrong. What does &quot;runs on nuclear weapons&quot; even mean? And it was uranium used for nuclear <em>energy</em> NOT nuclear weaponry.</p>

<p>This sub was immediately flooded with hundreds of one week old accounts, all of them having literally no karma under their belt whatsoever.  They all puked up the exact same lines, &quot;I&#39;m not very active on Reddit, but now I&#39;m here to discuss and learn about this completely real conspiracy!  I would think you guys would welcome an actual real conspiracy to talk about for a change!&quot;</p>

<p>The shills were %100 obvious.  You&#39;d have to be developmentally disabled to not be able to tell the true conspiracy forum users apart from the blatant shills.</p>

<p>Yet....
that was the day our mods started banning the real, actual users of this sub and actively defending invading outsiders from our attempts to weed the garden.  </p>

<p>That was the day I officially consider as this sub having gone completely to shit.  We were swarmed by a powerful and organized outside force which quite obviously didn&#39;t belong here.  The mods responded by intentionally abusing the rules and those trying to single out the invaders were banned.</p>
