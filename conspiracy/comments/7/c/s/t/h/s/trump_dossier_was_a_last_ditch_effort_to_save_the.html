       This bundle of opposition research has changed political history.  Without it there would be no Russia investigation.    Somewhere in the fbi is a huge political file linking this false document to the current Trump/Russia investigation....they really thought they were untouchable to the point they had a completely verifiably false document become the cornerstone of their salvation...

       Trump only rode on Epstein's plane once and that was to a public appearance. There is little to no damning evidence Trump has the connections to Epstein that so many purport as 'smoking gun evidence' of anything.

       I didn't vote for Trump. What's funny is the people so vehemently against him use the same talking points like you. Using 'dear leadr' using 'cult' and other phrases. Just shows your bias. Were you with her or did you feel the bern?

       The amount of people vehemently defending everything Trump does who then turn around and say "I didn't vote for him" or "I'm not a supporter" is too damn high. If you defend everything he does and support his policies then you are a supporter no matter what you say. And I voted for Bernie in the primaries (I'm a registered independent in a state with open primaries) although I disagreed with much of his platform. He was better than Clinton and Trump by a country mile.

       Nazis aren't actually socialist. They were fascist. And they weren't democratic... because they were fascist. Read a fucking history book dumbass. Either way, Bernie isn't even a socialist anyway. It's stupid that he calls himself that. Nothing he proposed was real socialism, which is good. Cuz full-blown socialism is stupid.

       Actually, Nazis were National Socialists unlike Italy under Mussolini who were Fascists. The latter was really the same thing just kind of reworked off the ideology of collectivism. Both are the same, just different names. It's all collectivism. Bernie is more akin to Nazi Germany than Fascist Italy or Communist USSR. You tell me to read a book but, I have. How many have you read? lol.

       It depresses me how ignorant you are. Nothing about Nazism was remotely collectivist. It was a textbook authoritarian and militaristic fascist regime in nearly every single way. If Bernie is the Nazi, why did all the actual being-Nazis support Trump? Lol. But whatever man. Talking to you is pointless. I hope you educate yourself one day.

       In name only. In reality, Hitler took after Mussolini in nearly every way. Nothing about Nazism was ever about "the German collective". It was about Hitler and his inner circle's complete and utter power. You're the ignorant one. I'm done with you. You know you're full of shit or you are just dumb as fuck. Either way fuck off.

       So far, all I've seen linking Trump and Epstein is the one quote you provide, and a quote from an alleged transcript in which Epstein states that Trump flew on Epstein's brother's plane from Florida to New York.

       And the one story about Trump kicking Epstein out of one of his resorts/communities.

       The quote you cite seems leading; it's an empty soundbyte with false praise about a well connected guy it likely wouldn't make sense to call out. I've never even seen when it's dated to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The single flight is entirely innocuous. Worse, for all that it gets disingenuously shilled, it does not live up to the claims which are attached to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And kicking Epstein out of a Trump property seems entirely contradictory to all this talk about connections between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have anything else to support a connection?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Oh and Trump's nominee for Secretary of Labor was the Alexander Acosta, the US Attorney that gave Epstein his bullshit deal for one year in prison.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I doubt he tapped Acosta because the guy only slapped Epstein on the wrist. I'm not familiar with Epstein's case, what charges they brought against him, what charges they managed to prove, or what possible sentence was in play.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's unsightly, but I imagine when selecting someone for such a position, you're typically examining more than a singular event in their career. And I don't know put Acosta's name in the running for the position.

      <p>
       As someone who has worked for more than a decade with the microfilm collection of Soviet documents in the Hoover Institution Archives, I can say that the dossier itself was compiled by a Russian, whose command of English is far from perfect and who follows the KGB (now FSB) practice of writing intelligence reports, in particular the practice of capitalizing all names for easy reference. The report includes Putin’s inner circle – Peskov, Ivanov, Sechin, Lavrov. The anonymous author claims to have “trusted compatriots” who knew the roles that each Kremlin insider, including Putin himself, played in the Trump election saga and were prepared to tell him.

       Which one of the claims are you referring to that has been verified to be false? I want a specific page number/quote from the dossier and an explanation/source one the debunking.

       Dossier Claim About Page
      </h1>
      <p>
       There claims in the dossier about Carter Page meeting with Igor Sechin(head of Rosneft) in Russia during the campaign. Page has admitted to meeting with Rosneft executives during a trip in 2016, and has admitted to in interviews that he spoke about Russian sanctions when he took the trip during the campaign. He admitted that he did not meet with Sechin directly, but that he met with the head of Investor Relations at Rosneft, Andrey Baranov.
      </p>
      <h3>
       Claim
      </h3>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Speaking in July 2016, a Russian source close to Rosneft President, PUTIN
close associate and US-sanctioned individual, Igor SECHIN, confided the
details of a recent secret meeting between him and visiting Foreign
Affairs Advisor to Republican presidential candidate Donald TRUMP, Carter PAGE.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to SECHIN's associate, the Rosneft President (CEO) had raised
with PAGE the issues of future bilateral energy cooperation and
prospects for an associated move to lift Ukraine-related western
sanctions against Russia. PAGE had reacted positively to this demarche
by SECHIN but had been generally non-committal in response.

       More importantly, since the dossier came out the FBI has stated multiple times it launched an investigation to check the claims of the dossier.

      <p>
       We don't have access to what they found out, but I'm sure Mueller does. Likewise, I expect Mueller only to use FBI confirmed information in his indictments and charges while discarding anything they could not confirm.

       Because when you really want to hurt your opponent, you hold onto dirt during the campaign and wait until they're elected President.  Then you release it.  Through Buzzfeed.  It's a masterstroke of the political elite.

       Or you release it when you know you’ve been pushed into a no win situation.  It was thought that Trump would do what he said he would do and “lock her up”. It became a movement among his supporters, a widespread acceptance that there is in fact a political elite that believes they are above the law of man.  And now there are whisperings of a cleansing...maybe it is bigger than first thought, maybe it is a fraction of what was first believed.  The truth lies somewhere in between...

       So they knew if Trump won they'd be pushed into a no win situation, because during the campaign he promised to "lock her up", so they waited until after he won, and was no longer saying "lock her up", to use the thing to stop him from winning.

       I’m open to that.  Honestly the more I look into all sides of this information the more I start to realize that maybe none of it has to do with anything we think it does.  Maybe Trump/Russia is no more important than Hillary/uraniumone maybe they are both equally important.  If so , and either way we have a major fucking problem in our country...the political elite have sold our countries soul to the highest bidder.  How do we take it back?

       I think its pretty clear at this point that powerful DC lobbyists (some of whom ended up on Trump's team) were bought by Russian and Ukrainian interests over the past 10 or so years.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem: this hurts the old cabal more due to the U1 coverup and sale, which seemed to be rubber-stamped by the old guard.  That's why the Russia narrative is starting to backfire on them, especially with the exploratory effort for a special council now.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one hand, we have concern that Russian interests manipulated social media to support Trump's campaign.  The implication being that they would be /hisguy/ in office.  We've seen evidence of the manipulation, but no evidence of him doing anything illegal on their behalf or on their directives in office.  Meanwhile, the Obama administration initiated a sale (and following coverup) of a strategically significant amount of uranium to a authoritarian state that runs on nuclear weapons.  Try to impartially weigh that against twitter bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       The evidence of actual, harmful collusion is there.  It's just not with Trump, it's with the Obama administration.  And that's what makes this all so fascinating.

       This is just straight up wrong. What does "runs on nuclear weapons" even mean? And it was uranium used for nuclear

       The Steele dossier is not the cause of the Russia investigation. It's a collection of raw data that was never even intended for the public. It wasn't an effort to do anything other than compile legitimate opposition research on Trump.

       I remember the exact day that bullshit dossier came out.
      </p>
      <p>
       This sub was immediately flooded with hundreds of one week old accounts, all of them having literally no karma under their belt whatsoever.  They all puked up the exact same lines, "I'm not very active on Reddit, but now I'm here to discuss and learn about this completely real conspiracy!  I would think you guys would welcome an actual real conspiracy to talk about for a change!"
      </p>
      <p>
       The shills were %100 obvious.  You'd have to be developmentally disabled to not be able to tell the true conspiracy forum users apart from the blatant shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet....
that was the day our mods started banning the real, actual users of this sub and actively defending invading outsiders from our attempts to weed the garden.
      </p>
      <p>
       That was the day I officially consider as this sub having gone completely to shit.  We were swarmed by a powerful and organized outside force which quite obviously didn't belong here.  The mods responded by intentionally abusing the rules and those trying to single out the invaders were banned.
