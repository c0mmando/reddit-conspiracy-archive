       I’m talking about the shills who claim this sub has become “The_Donald 2.0” or “T_D lite” to try and tarnish our credibility. They’ll say things like
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7bv7mf/comment/dpl0l9w">
        “Where are the pizzagaters on this one”
       </a>
       when the post and others like it are very highly upvoted. Or, on Trump’s corruption;
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/78ffzd/comment/doteggr">
        “Let’s watch this clusterfuck get downvoted to oblivion
       </a>
       when the post, again, is highly upvoted (&gt;5000). Another comment I remember yet can’t seem to find was “This would’ve been popular on the
       <em>
        old
       </em>
       r/conspiracy” when, you guessed it, the post was very highly upvoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get the idea. They’re trying to brand us as partisan Trump supporters so they can discredit anything we say, don’t let them.

       If you have hard evidence that someone is a shill (ie they are being paid or otherwise encouraged to post disinformation) then message the mods and we will remove them. Otherwise, a shill accusation can be levelled at anyone, and is therefore just a way of insulting someone you don't agree with.

       Some of the issues which get discussed on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       are extremely controversial and attract a lot of haters. The mods ban swathes of accounts which have clearly only come here to troll, insult and denigrate. We are talking hundreds every month. If you see one of these accounts, report them.

       A question about spam accounts. It's not against the rules(spam is only for personal side), but for instance this guy makes over 400 submissions a day at a rate of almost 3 per minute. Clearly he is not aiming to discuss.

       There are a few other users like that. People with 200-300k submission karma who drop 6 or so links like clockwork at similar times each morning (my time zone), with very little comment karma.

       Frequent posting is not against the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as an account is posting material which is on-topic, not an apparent attempt to forum slide, and from multiple sources (ie not promoting their own blog, or whatever), then we wouldn't intervene.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are not interested in what somebody has posted, just ignore it. If you hate it, downvote it. If you think it breaks the rules, report it.

       Accusing other users of being a shill is against the subs rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, how can you truly tell? Just because someone has a popular opinion doesn’t make them a shill. You have to engage to figure out if they are shills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Beyond that, everyone calls out shilling on a daily basis here. Regardless if it’s against the rules.

       Also outside of r/conspiracy most of these "shill opinions" are very popular.

       Many here try to throw the trump russia collusion under the " its msm narrative" even though also a lot of people see this without being influenced by MSM etc. The russia trump story is going on since fucking 2013.

       I've gotten away with calling out people a few times so far. I always provide evidence, avoid immature behavior (i.e. name calling), and limit my own political opinions/speculations to comment discussions after the initial callout. I find that removing politics from it makes it so that I have few emotions attached to it and therefore don't feel the need to get defensive.
      </p>
      <p>
       My experience with calling people out is that
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       users themselves rarely say anything to me, because they often don't comment organically anyways, though sometimes they delete their posts and/or go dormant.
      </p>
      <p>
       The callout
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       seem to attract very hostile, defensive, and partisan users though. They seem to get very emotional, call
       <em>
        me
       </em>
       the shill for collecting evidence, then they make a broad claim completely lacking in evidence and call me an loser for trying, lol. It's pretty funny because I don't think they realize all they are doing is shining a light on how partisan and emotional they come off.

       You’re welcome. I usually don’t find many downsides to being polite, even when impassioned. Coming from a place of genuine curiosity and recognizing ones own defenses, I think is key to positive discourse and insight.

       I suspect they want to ban people who disrupt the sub. Sending them a message with your evidence doesn't the sub, so you shouldn't be banned for it. Allowing people to call each other names can be very disruptive to most subs.

       "Russian bots" is pretty similar, but calling someone a "Trumper" isn't accusing them of being a shill. It's calling someone partisan.

       While there are probably shills amongst those people you're describing we really don't know for sure without other proof. Some people might actually just hold those opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, plenty of people get around rule 10. In fact it's fun to track those comments then see which mods even do anything about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is a short list of ways I've seen users in the past week
       <em>
        subtly
       </em>
       get around rule 10:
       <br/>
       "Back up! calling in backup!"
       <br/>
       "Thanks for the record
       <em>
        correction
       </em>
       "
       <br/>
       "Thank you for sharing the record"
       <br/>
       "Shill"
       <br/>
       and my favorite, "Spill"
      </p>
      <p>
       Additionally, why are the mods "split" on the issue of networks of users copying and pasting content (posts and comments) from other places. That behavior and the regular link submission karma farming that happens is real shill-ish behavior and there seems to be nothing to be done about it as when the mods do anything, they get accused of being shills themselves. I can't begin to imagine the immature, shit flinging they have to sift through daily.

       I think a lot of supposed "shills" are just children/young adults who get a big rush out of coming here and reaffirming that they are logical and that conspiracy believers of any kind are not.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can't really stop them, they're going to feel awesome for posting condescending stuff and since there are so many of them they get a ton of validation from each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also people who feel like they're helping fight Schizophrenia by just shitting on anything on this sub. I have a badly delusional friend who is basically addicted to "X product will give you cancer" conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sometimes I see a thread title on
       <a href="/r/Conspiracy">
        /r/Conspiracy
       </a>
       and I think "That is non-sense to any sane person but, shit if my friend read that it he would believe it instantly". It makes me want to speak against like, "crazy shit" on this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see those videos linked here sometimes titled like "DEMONS DEMOCRATS, THE NUMBER 11, OCTOBER 5TH PREPARE YOURSELF" and I just wish there was some moderation about shit that clearly agitates schizophrenia and offers no valuable information to anyone who doesn't have a psychiatric disorder.

       Lol. I'm constantly seeing people complain about "shills" here. In fact, bitching &amp; moaning about other people and their shill-worthy status really muddies up the focus of a lot of otherwise decent discussions on r/conspiracy, to the point of ridiculousness sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing to do, in my opinion, is IGNORE them, and/or, BLOCK them so you don't have to see their posts and get distracted. Report them if you must, but, geez, don't contribute to the their static by trying to have any kind of discussion with them. Shills or Trolls, you're not going to change them, you don't have the power to ban them (unless you're a mod), and by engaging with them, you're falling into their trap. Rise above and just IGNORE/BLOCK/REPORT.  Done, done and done.  Move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you must make some kind of point, then reply to their shilly post with "Blocked." And then do so.

       And circle jerk so hard they get friction burns. They also try to confuse new onlookers through mimicry of our arguments which are inversed but anyone who knows the chronology of events knows its crap.

       It's a good rule. Without it, so many conversations would look like this:

        I think that _____.

         Well, I disagree because _____.

       There are a few other users like that. People with 200-300k submission karma who drop 6 or so links like clockwork at similar times each morning (my time zone), with very little comment karma.

       Frequent posting is not against the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       As long as an account is posting material which is on-topic, not an apparent attempt to forum slide, and from multiple sources (ie not promoting their own blog, or whatever), then we wouldn't intervene.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are not interested in what somebody has posted, just ignore it. If you hate it, downvote it. If you think it breaks the rules, report it.

       I once reported 13 links in conspiracy new tab from a single guy in less than an hour and all of his posts got approved. Main reason I'm asking because they seem to clutter and not be productive.
