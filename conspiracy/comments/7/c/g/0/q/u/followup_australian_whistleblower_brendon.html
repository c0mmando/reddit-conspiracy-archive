        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">107</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-11-12 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/freeboc.html">freeboc</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last week I wrote an article about Brendon O&#39;Connell, it reached the frontpage of this sub with a little over 600 votes. If you haven&#39;t seen it, I highly suggest you read it (including the discussions in the comment section) before reading further: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7bcpjs/australian_whistleblower_brendon_oconnell/?sort=controversial">Brendon O&#39;Connell ARRESTED in New Zealand for exposing the Australian government and the infiltration of Zionist elements</a></p>

<p>For the few who didn&#39;t read the post and thought it was just about Brendon harassing &#39;some jews at a supermarket&#39;. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5CsmBYuFjg">Here is the video that led to the ORIGINAL 2011 ARREST of Brendon O&#39;Connell</a>. If it was just about Brendon verbally harrassing Jews at a supermarket, he wouldn&#39;t have to request political asylum as an Australian man against the Australian government.</p>

<p>Brendon is a political dissident from Australia, he fled Australia when he was on bail and made his way to Iran (of all places). When he got there, he couldn&#39;t speak a word of Arabic (or Persian?). Now the Iranian authorities took the situation very seriously, they gave him political asylum due to his situation in Australia. It was an ideal for him to stay in Iran, but he had to leave due to problems with someone who was helping him out there. Watch <a href="https://isolatebutpreserve.blogspot.nl/2017/02/video-case-in-full-why-i-left-iran.html">THE CASE IN FULL - Why I Left Iran</a> by O&#39;Connell himself.</p>

<p>He made his way to Malaysia and stayed in Kuala Lumpur, in a hotel. He came into contact with someone from New Zealand who did say that if he came to New Zealand, he would be given a fair trial.</p>

<p>Well Brendon did take that advice, he did go to New Zealand. Unfortunately it seems that he <strong>may</strong> have been set up, at least that&#39;s what it looks like. On arrival at Auckland Airport, he was arrested and there weren&#39;t any charges laid.</p>

<p>Usually this would actually be considered a form of torture, because if you arrest somebody for over 24 hours without laying charges on them, that&#39;s exactly what this is.
However, Brendon is being held on <strong>character grounds</strong>. That&#39;s a really vague term, but this is what they use to keep &#39;terrorists&#39; in jail. Basically anyone who&#39;s a threat to national security.</p>

<p>As you know, Brendon is a political dissident and whistleblower (again, please read my first article). He&#39;s anything but a threat to national security.</p>

<p><strong>Who are the people working against Brendon O&#39;Connell?</strong></p>

<p>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Australia (DFAT) and Julie Bishop have been making things tough for Brendon&#39;s legal team. Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop who overlooks genocide in West Papua for the sake of Rio Tinto profits, knows who Brendon is and has a personal dislike for him because of Brendon&#39;s previous work of exposing her in the past.</p>

<p>She&#39;s corrupt to the point that <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-10-26/bureaucrats-to-be-grilled-over-adani-funding/9086262">DFAT is in the news right now</a>, they&#39;re facing legal questions over possible secret requests for foreign cash to finance Adani and their controversial mines.</p>

<p><strong>Brendon O&#39;Connell&#39;s letter</strong></p>

<p>Brendon did manage to get a letter out to his lawyer, provided by Daniel Walker from Activist News. In <a href="https://youtu.be/WPjGkWqTTso?t=2m54s">this video</a> he reads portions of the letter. But here&#39;s the text version anyways:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Dear Kevin, this prison is an utter shithole. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it, words escape me. I thought New Zealand was a progressive nation ... they are violating laws. The food is an absolute disgrace and is a joke, you don&#39;t even get a cup, seriously. People use empty milk cartons.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got no clothes, no shoes. I was barefoot for nine days. ... I had red on my shoes which show that I&#39;m part of a gang, which is also not allowed. ... No underpants, I was mine in the shower every second day and I hope they dry by the morning.</p>

<p>I told staff I have no one to send clothes or material too (his wife was killed while Brendon was on the run) and they just told me &#39;Too bad.&#39;</p>

<p>The gangs in mainstream run the jail. I&#39;m in segregation as I have no family or gang affiliations in mainstream... We are on rolling lockdown at least every two or three days a week, only out for two hours a day. Usually a 23-hour lockdown. A normal day is a 21-hour lockdown.</p>

<p>The jail is a multi-storey with no opportunity for sunlight. Staff told me there are no work processing facilities for prisoners to write up a legal paperwork. I asked &#39;How does a prisoner conduct their own appeals and legal paperwork?&#39; They told me there are no facilities for that.</p>

<p>I asked one guard if they knew the court of justice, they just shrugged. They will not copy legal paperwork, they told us to get our lawyers to do it. I have absolutely no faith this letter will get out of the prison as everything is absolutely difficult. Not even Western Australia is as remotely backwards as this.</p>

<p>I suffer a lot of anxiety. Everyday I learn something new about how backwards it is here... I was lured here by a man called Chris Paul.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Given the situation this is very alarming because Brendon, without exaggerating is being tortured under these conditions. He was never supposed to be arrested in the first place, they&#39;ve got no real grounds for his arrest.
So what they&#39;ve actually done is holding him under character grounds (the wildcard for taking someone out of society). </p>

<p>Brendon also has a Bitcoin which he has been using to collect funds, which was supposed to go to the high court appeal. However, the New Zealand authorities seem to have his encrypted key and due to him being held on &quot;character grounds&quot; they could potentially garnish that account or make it look like someone&#39;s hacked it and stolen it.</p>

</ul>

<p>TL;DR: I think this is a fundamental case that everybody needs to get behind, regardless of what your opinions are on Brendon O&#39;Connell, there&#39;s no denying that what&#39;s going on here is absolute corruption. Brendon was probably lured to New Zealand and jailed for no reason, so they keep him under &#39;character grounds. In prison they didn&#39;t give him any clothes, not feeding him properly. They&#39;re not even giving him enough water. They&#39;re refusing him all of the necessary paperwork and all of that stuff to go ahead with all of his court appeal. Brendon is being tortured. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YrB1SXqJKGU">Watch this 8 minute video for more information</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen news stories that describe O&#39;Connell as having been put on probation and with restrictions on publishing stuff on the internet. That, and he has still been putting up stuff about Stanley Keiser that got him in trouble years ago. Also he made death threats to Keiser and Jews &quot;These bells toll for thee&quot; and corrections/law enforcement people, so yes, he was stopped at an NZ airport... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s see, an account created 4 months ago named freeboc which obviously means free this guy, making a post that&#39;s about the same as the one from 5 days ago, where most people recognized this guy was clearly being a racist, was charged because of something you didn&#39;t mention, fled the country..</p>

<p>Why should I feel bad? Why should I <em>donate</em>? I think it&#39;s just as likely you are the dude, making up a story for attention and money.. otherwise why are you repeatedly working so hard on his behalf?</p>

<p>I&#39;m with the other guy.. bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m posting this for one reason, to get the truth out. If you actually did the slightest bit of research, rather than blindly following a few trolls commenting on my post you would&#39;ve known. How about you research Operation Talpiot and the technion, The protocols of Zion and the Oded Yinon plan (aka the greater Israel project). Maybe it&#39;ll break that close mind of yours. My bad I can see, it&#39;s the Hollywood pedos and the Hillary Clinton thing that&#39;s so important. While we&#39;re at it, let&#39;s blame the right, democrats, republicans or martians for everything that&#39;s happening, rather than looking at the true cause. Trump&#39;s here to save you!</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You should look into the case because the man I&#39;m &#39;trying to free&#39; got in deep trouble by using open source information anyone can access.</p>
