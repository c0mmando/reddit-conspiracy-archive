<p>Tonight, I gave a guy a lyft ride home (it&#39;s a second job for me, you meet a lot of interesting people). </p>

<p>He wound up being a elementary school music teacher. He told me was a planning on killing me but because I was nice to him and didn&#39;t judge him for being gay (he also was drunk and trying to get with me constantly) he chose not to &quot;do anything horrible to me&quot;</p>

<p>He was the saddest human being I have ever met. So sad. I haven&#39;t called the cops yet but I am going to. It&#39;s just hard knowing how vulnerable even the predators are. Just remember that. We&#39;re all human. I feel sorry for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aint about what, but about how... the legalization movements (rights for women, rights for gays, rights for pedos) all started with psychological games commited by the media, in an effort to raise tolerance of such acts. </p>

<p>When people were saturated through constant exposure to the idea that gays/pedos are common-place, then the movement for legalization can commence. </p>

<p>Its the same psychological method through forced repetition, trauma or promise of a reward, that is used for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5rcb3r/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/">everything human: education, raising awareness, pet training, publicity, propaganda.</a></p>

<p>All these movements and hype that gets posted around here is reinforced to create an illusion of conformity, just like your title suggested, but it isnt (necessarily) real. Its hype, rumors that add-up until a big burst when a big movement will demand to legalize certain activities. </p>

<p>Heck, 30 years ago homosexuals didnt have rights and they were shunned, beaten and stoned. 80 years ago women didnt have rights. </p>

<p>The problem is that people only focus on the good side of giving people extra rights and the effects (damage) they do to the society are included in. 
Making women work and have no time for family is a enormous drawback, the right to vote (which btw doesnt count for s###) is like giving your house for a convertible sports car.</p>

<p>Something doesn&#39;t add up here.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to guess it&#39;s the first line, and the reasoning behind the second is that the police asked you not to waste their time with baseless accusations.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It shouldn&#39;t factor in, but it does.</p>

<p>You talk about the fact the cops wouldn&#39;t believe you -- but the fact is how important you are has EVERYTHING TO DO with that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry.  The moment he makes that admission, it&#39;s time to run to a safe spot and call 911.  If that&#39;s not enough info to go on, then they&#39;ll never believe you.</p>
