       I busted a pedophile nursery three days ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tonight, I gave a guy a lyft ride home (it's a second job for me, you meet a lot of interesting people).
      </p>
      <p>
       He wound up being a elementary school music teacher. He told me was a planning on killing me but because I was nice to him and didn't judge him for being gay (he also was drunk and trying to get with me constantly) he chose not to "do anything horrible to me"
      </p>
      <p>
       He was the saddest human being I have ever met. So sad. I haven't called the cops yet but I am going to. It's just hard knowing how vulnerable even the predators are. Just remember that. We're all human. I feel sorry for him.

       You guys are actually idiots. I'm not trying to prove shit to you. Something weird happened to men tonight and I fucking did the right thing. I could care less if ANYONE else cares. I'm just sharing information. So take it or leave it and be careful who's house you walk into.

       No reason to shit talk people. Nothing you said makes me think this person is a pedo. Just because this person teaches elementary school? Plus, your post history is a lot of incoherence mixed with delusion. No offense intended.

       Again, I don't care. One man's fantasy is another man's reality. This guy HAS killed people. If I was ANY stupider or more naive he would have taken advantage of that and hurt me tonight. Belittling people like me who stay vigilant makes you look like a fucking coward in my eyes. I don't give one fucking shit what you think about my post history. I'm sick of you people not focusing on THE GODDAMN MATTER AT HAND!!!!

       I think the twist is that you’re actually the murderer pedo and you were going to kill him.

       Again, I’m just saying when you say you could care less, that means you care, so use the correct expression “couldn’t care less” in order to convey your uncaring position.

       So, someone on the conspiracy forum you go to, the last line of defense, is making a report about something that happened in the real world, and you're going to make jokes?

       Still need more information. This showed me details and gave me his number. I have him cornered but as far as he's concerned we're friends now. So, it's called strategy. I'm biding my time. Cops won't believe me until I have SOME kind of proof or some crime has been committed in front of me and I have evidence. I was too freaked out to take pictures.

       So you're basically some schlub then -- because if you had any degree of importance, the simple fact the guy said he'd kill you or the like would be actionable in and of itself...

      <p>
       At that point, the cops won't believe you, no matter how much evidence you have.

       The man was pitiful. He just wanted a friend to watch porn and be gay with, it was really sad. I don't have any more importance than anyone else, that shouldn't factor into whether or not I was right in my actions. That's stupid. He didn't threaten me, he admitted to me an hour into us hanging out that he was originally going to "do horrible things to me"

       You talk about the fact the cops wouldn't believe you -- but the fact is how important you are has EVERYTHING TO DO with that kind of stuff.

       I'm sorry.  The moment he makes that admission, it's time to run to a safe spot and call 911.  If that's not enough info to go on, then they'll never believe you.

       This has nothing to do with homosexuality.. that's not the point.. the guy was gay yes but did you read the OP? He's an elementary school teacher and told me he was planning on raping and killing me.

       Aint about what, but about how... the legalization movements (rights for women, rights for gays, rights for pedos) all started with psychological games commited by the media, in an effort to raise tolerance of such acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       When people were saturated through constant exposure to the idea that gays/pedos are common-place, then the movement for legalization can commence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its the same psychological method through forced repetition, trauma or promise of a reward, that is used for
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_S_T/comments/5rcb3r/the_conspiracy_of_opinions_or_how_the_state_is/">
        everything human: education, raising awareness, pet training, publicity, propaganda.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       All these movements and hype that gets posted around here is reinforced to create an illusion of conformity, just like your title suggested, but it isnt (necessarily) real. Its hype, rumors that add-up until a big burst when a big movement will demand to legalize certain activities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, 30 years ago homosexuals didnt have rights and they were shunned, beaten and stoned. 80 years ago women didnt have rights.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem is that people only focus on the good side of giving people extra rights and the effects (damage) they do to the society are included in. 
Making women work and have no time for family is a enormous drawback, the right to vote (which btw doesnt count for s###) is like giving your house for a convertible sports car.

       I think you should possibly just read the post and take it for what it is. Yeah, I totally could be making it up. But I'm not. You get to pick who to believe, and it doesn't phase me. My local police and I are in constant communication this week as I've had two instances like this happen now in a 72 hour period, so. Believe it or not. Suck a dick.

       Something doesn't add up here.

       I'm going to guess it's the first line, and the reasoning behind the second is that the police asked you not to waste their time with baseless accusations.

       I did call the cops on the nursery the other day. If you read the other post you would know that. I haven't called the cops yet on this guy because I'm waiting to find out more information. Cops won't listen until you can really overwhelm them with details.

       It shouldn't factor in, but it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       You talk about the fact the cops wouldn't believe you -- but the fact is how important you are has EVERYTHING TO DO with that kind of stuff.

      <p>
       I'm sorry.  The moment he makes that admission, it's time to run to a safe spot and call 911.  If that's not enough info to go on, then they'll never believe you.
