        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;m 28 now, nearly 29. I can somewhat remember the days before the global financial crash in 2008. It seems to me every year since then the world has been getting worse and worse. Maybe it&#39;s just because I was young then, and didn&#39;t pay much attention to such things.</p>

<p>Yes I knew the world was messed up before that, with 9/11 and the &#39;War on Terror&#39;. But now it seems to me a lot worse. Globally, inequality and poverty are off the charts; and I don&#39;t care what the &#39;experts say&#39;, it gets worse and worse every year, ordinary people can feel this, despite what the &#39;experts&#39; say.</p>

<p>Suicides are going up all over the world, and we don&#39;t talk about it, until it&#39;s some celebrity. Something is up with Wikileaks, that shed a light on war crimes, and the dark underbelly of mass surveillance; something new is bubbling in the Middle East and the KSA; there seems to be a war within cryptocurrencies, that were supposed to be our financial saviours.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the revolts against the elite seem pretty tame at the moment, compare to, say, the French Revolution.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, maybe the internet and alternative journalism have just cast a light on all these things, maybe I&#39;m just older and paying more attention, but it seems to me like things definitely are getting worse and worse every year. What do you guys think?</p>

Fuck all you can do but to unearth the detail that in some way affects the trends. </p>

<p>Is the World Worse/Getting Worse Today?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not markedly. But, sufficiently enough to recognize that the unyielding march of progressivism over the last two decades is only going to lead to some form of totalinarianism in the future.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suicides are going up all over the world</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is there evidence of this? And if so, is it controlled for increased reporting?</p>

<p>I want to say that there was a time when a suicide would not be labelled as such due to the social stigma attached to it.</p>
