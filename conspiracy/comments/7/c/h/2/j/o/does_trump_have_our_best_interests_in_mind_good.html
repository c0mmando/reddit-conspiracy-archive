       I creep on this thread religiously &amp; you mafk's are pretty sharp in my opinion. But that's just also barely been forming, as I didn't really consider myself informed about some of these matters until recently. I wanna know what you guys think about the D himself. Yeah he's talked some game, but with all this drain the swamp talk paired with the type of shit going on in SA, makes me think if it's related. (Please provide links if this is fr)

       Whether or not Trump's a good guy, the shakeup in SA is going to have significant consequences on the US political system.  It's proven that a LOT of those arrested were giving money to US politicians/campaigns/foundations.   We're talking billions.  Regardless of who they gave money to, or who those people were associated with, imagine the ramifications on our lobbying alone.

       Lobbying as a whole just fell out of the sky.  At the very least the numbers $ involved will be a lot more terrestrial from now on.  Was this Trump's plan?  I'm not 100% on that.  But right there is a huge win for America.

       How is naming a Goldman-Sachs executive as his Secretary of the Treasury 'draining the swamp'?  Why is the former head of ExxonMobil our Secretary of State?  Why did he let the leader of Blackwater's sister become the Secretary of Education?  Could it be because because her husband donated millions to his campaign?  Remember how this sub used to hate Blackwater for the atrocities they committed in Iraq?  Doesn't seem to come up much anymore.  How exactly is Trump's tax plan to help his .001% buddies in the best interest of the rest of us?
      </p>
      <p>
       This narrative that Trump is somehow this champion of the people is completely absurd.

       It does.  Clinton would have been just as corrupt as Trump had she won, probably worse.  But she's not the one in the Oval Office right now so somehow I'm less concerned about her than the guy with access to the nuclear codes.

       Hillary/DNC/media/Russia/deep state in American government, their "funding" and connections to the arrested Saudi billionaires, Trump forging alliances with the new Saudi prince, Japan, China, Vietnam, South Korea, to put pressure onto North Korea, economy is the strongest it's been in decades, establishment/compromised establishment GOPers stepping down - and this is literally only 1/10 of what's happening.

       You should watch "Get me Roger Stone", where they admit that they don't give a shit and are good at manipulating. Not sure what it would take for you to understand that Trump is just the brash, dirty tricks side of the same establishment that you think you're not brainwashed by.

       No see, I DO believe there are people who are behind Trump, which is why I urged you to watch "Get me Roger Stone" where they lay out their techniques of misinformation and dirty tricks to manipulate. I certainly don't believe that there are no Trump supporters, only bots. What would be the point of propaganda if it wasn't working on people?

       Haha what misinformation? What dirty tricks? What's Trump's end goal? What are these "bad things" that Trump's doing? Why is he building the wall? Why is the economy the strongest it's ever been? Why is ISIS finally losing after just 1 year of Trump in office? Why did so many Saudi billionaires get arrested? Why is Asia giving Trump so much respect? Why are there over 800 sealed indictments? Why did Trump reveal the JFK files when Bush and Obama didn't? Why are Dems turning on HRC? Why is the Podesta group closing? Why did Trump pull us out of TPP? Paris Climate accords? Why is the unemployment rate the lowest in 17 years? Why is so much pressure being put onto North Korea? Why is the US Navy positioned around North Korea? Why has nothing been done about North Korea? And again, what has Trump done wrong?

       See, someone doesn't write it out and they aren't smart. Someone writes it out and they are still uneducated. Articulate yourself, engage in a back and forth, or slink on back to a sub that encourages you to worship a billionaire head of state and still consider yourself a "free thinker".

       If you want to find all the things Trump has lied about, look for yourself. They're easy to find but I don't want to spend my weekend spelling those out for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me rapid fire through the rest of your sarcastic questions, knowing full well you won't consider anything that doesn't fit your narrative of "everything is evil but now I gotta hero!"
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         he's building the wall (with our taxes) for optics. He said as much to the president of Mexico when Trump BEGGED him to stop talking about it once he got to the Oval Office. He said it was probably the "least important" thing, but important politically. He won't make Mexico pay for anything, and who cares if it gets finished? It's not actually important, he just needs a few slabs up to keep his voters thinking he cares.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         at this point. SA isn't worth speculating about in relation to Trump. But Trump isn't a hero, so I would assume if he's involved it's to increase his family's wealth.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         ...have you been following the economy since the 2008 Financial Recession? It's not the "best it's ever been", it's just no longer recovering. If you're talking about the stock market, that has jumped up because Trump promised to rollback the regulations that helped the economy recover. Even if he's unsuccessful at those rollbacks, the stock market is still expected to have a downturn in the next year or so. If he is successful, it might keep it inflated until we fall into something closer to a depression.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -Trump continued Obama's ISIS strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
       -I'm not sure what you mean about Asia giving respect? I'm not sure what's different about Asia now except: Other admins always demanded that the US press could ask questions in China and Trump's admin just said "ok, ok, China said no". Trump also called China a currency manipulator and then promptly took it back after he spoke with Xi. Seems like the power doesn't lie with Trump. And more on this later, but Trump did China a big favor when he pulled out of the Paris agreement.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         3 Trump people have been indicted. I definitely expect more to come. I guess we will have to see who the indictments are for. (Spoiler - they're for Trump's good squad.)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         JFK files were scheduled to be released 25 years ago.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Dems are divided on HRC, just like they were during the election. That's nothing new (perhaps you also give credit to Trump for Obama beating HRC in 2008?)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Podesta group appears to be closing due to their involvement with other lobby groups such as Black Manafort Stone. We don't know all the details yet, but we certainly know what Manafort is being accused of. Yes, Podesta was HRCs campaign manager. And Manafort was Trump's. Stone is a longtime advisor who is the one who urged him to run for president. And Black Manafort and Stone's first client back in 1980? Donald Trump. So whatever these lobby firms are guilty of, it's safe to assume it will tarnish both HRC and Trump.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       -Trump pulled us out of TPP because he seems to be isolating America.
      </p>
      <p>
       -Paris agreement... ok, this one admittedly gets me worked up. Why do you list this as an accomplishment? What do you think this does for you? Paris agreement was just that, an agreement. Its not a tax. It's an agreement that the whole world has now signed onto. Taking the US out doesn't benefit us in anyway, but it benefits China in a big way. They get to step in as the global leader for clean energy, which is the next economic boom. The next generation of US kids could be dreaming of getting a job in China, the land of opportunity.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Trump said yesterday that he's tried so hard to be friends with Kim Jong Un. Is that being hard on him? Seems weak an pathetic to me, and certainly to Kim who has called him names like "Dotard". I don't recall him saying things like that about other presidents. And forgive me if I don't think threatening nuclear war on Twitter is "handling" the situation well.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Unemployment - see my response on economy. Also should be noted that the low unemployment number is accompanied by stagnate income. So with inflation, more people are working for less money. A dream for CEOs of behemoth businesses. Oh wait, Trump has big businesses doesn't he?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       He's not making decisions based on your best interest. Ever.

       And.. dude replies in predictably pathetic way. I'll just say thanks for taking the time to argue his points, it's nice to see people that use reasoning, versus the guy just making claims that basically Trump made.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll also say that the unemployment numbers are based on people still eligible for unemployment.. I know many people that simply didn't find work and depend on their significant other or family for support.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I agree about the Paris agreement, I think Trump has really muddied people's views about what they are.. but with his focus on coal, this country is absolutely losing any advantage it had under renewable energy initiatives.

       Thank you! And you are right. The unemployment numbers Trump is touting now are the same ones he said were fake when he was running for office. The story behind the numbers is important.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Paris agreement is bizarre to me. Unless he's hoping to enrich his coal buddies as much as he can for a limited amount of time before jumping back in. That or China did say "drop out and we will open a bunch of Trump hotels!"
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, that guy is bananas. I genuinely want to understand how people think Trump will make their lives better, but people like that seem to think this is just a game and they're winning.

       Worse, all the shit they said could have been cut/paste from what Trump says about himself on Twitter. These people need to realize politics isn't a team sport.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't think people realize all the different avenues that Trump can receive bribes, buy his products, book his property, make land deals with him.. just tons of obvious ways to funnel money to him for favors. I think over time, we will see how bad it is.

       Leader Donald J. Trump is the eternal sun of the world as he put the dignity and position of the US on the highest level with the MAGA policy. A great statesman of literary and military accomplishments, who is possessed of outstanding wisdom, distinguished leadership ability, matchless pluck and noble revolutionary comradeship, is advancing the cause of America First pioneered by President Washington and led by Andrew Jackson along the path of victory with his sweeping revolutionary practices.

       My comment didn't provide much to the thread, just an attempt at humor pointing out people's blind devotion to politician's who say what they want to hear.

       From a historical perspective, my opinion there have been only 3 presidents who truly grasped their role, genuinely acted in the people's best interest (the best they could), did their best to be above party corruption/influence, avoided needless war and respected the ideas of our constitution: Washington, Eisenhower and Theodore Roosevelt.
      </p>
      <p>
       All others, including Trump so far, have been most concerned with their legacy, getting their name into history, attempting to circumvent the Constitution to serve their donors/party/self, working in the interest of corporations, pushing to war and building up their opportunities for personal wealth.

       There hasn't been any swamp draining under Trump so far, in fact the same financiers and pro far-right Israel people are in his cabinet and advisors. Same cronyism is in place, with his relatives being used to drive foreign/domestic policy. He usesbhis position to advertise for his golf courses, hotels, daughter's clothing lines, etc... He has little respect for the Constitution, especially the 1st and 14th. He has limited knowledge of domestic and foreign policy, and frequently flips his stance on issues to serve the audience. People claim his party isbwotking against him: however, I'd argue the opposite is true which is why nothing has been passed with his party holding majorities in both houses. There's a lot of noise on the Tax and Jobs bill, I'll hold off until there's actually a bill that's endorsed by him from congress to wage judgement. Presidents have little influence over the economy/unemployment in their first year, so I'd wait until effects of less regulation/tax bill/etc... are actually enforced and in play. Wall Street has definitely done well this past year, I'd say it shows that Financiers and Corporations are excited having a potential friend in office and hopes for more pro-corporate legislation and tax benefits are coming their way. Lastly, the ME events have little to do with Trump. This has been building for years, the SA is a power grab sponsored by Israel to build war with their biggest rival Iran.

       I think Trump will go down in the history books as the dividing line between Cold War/Post-War America and whatever our next era is. He is drawing out nearly every insidious force in America out into the light. Nothing will ever be the same after Trump, even if he was impeached tomorrow. The damage has already been done to the status quo.

       Thanks! I figured money was a main motivator more or less, but not in a scale like that.

       Oh I understand where you're coming from. You're ill equipped to engage in a back and forth. I laid out my education credentials and you remain fundamentally uninterested in what I could share regarding current situations. That lack of curiosity is necessary to maintain your views.
