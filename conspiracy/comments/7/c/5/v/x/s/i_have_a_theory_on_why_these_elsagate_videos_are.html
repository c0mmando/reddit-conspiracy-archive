        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Who’s in charge at YouTube?
Who’s in charge at Disney?</p>

<p>YouTube has been demonetizing and censoring independent content creators propagating info geared toward adults, but these disturbing videos geared toward children are being allowed to remain up and monetized on the site, despite being reported every minute for their content. </p>

<p>The two characters we see most prominently in these videos are Spider-Man and Elsa from the animated Disney movie <em>Frozen</em></p>

<p>The likeness of Elsa is owned by Disney. The likeness of Spider-Man is owned by Marvel. </p>

<p>Who owns Marvel?</p>

<p>Why haven’t there been copyright claims made against these videos’ creators by the owners of the characters’ likenesses? These videos receive hundreds of millions of views. That’s a lot of stolen revenue. Would you claim copyright if these characters were yours and being used in this manner?</p>

<p>I think we can all agree that these videos are engineered to subvert the minds of children and insert illicit themes both conscious and subconscious. </p>

<p>Why were these two characters chosen? What type of children are they most likely to appeal to (think demographics, possible situation in the home that might lead to absence of supervision and provide the ability for the child to watch these videos, etc.)</p>

<p>What would be the benefit of subverting the minds of these particular children? Why hasn’t the owner of these characters’ likenesses stepped forward to stop this? A lot of money is at stake. </p>

<p>So why?</p>

<p>I’ll let you draw your own conclusions, but I believe there is a concerted effort by Disney and Youtube leadership possibly in conjunction with elements of the IC to allow these videos to infect the minds of children, especially white children. There is a long history of Zionist individuals and organizations targeting the white population through articles, in movies, etc. You’ve seen the articles. <em>“Dear White People. You Suck. And You’re Racist. Here’s Why.</em>”</p>

<p>This is them going after the children. With deep psychological undertones. Many of you have seen Yuri Bezmenov, the ex-KGB defector, talk about <em>idealogical subversion</em>.</p>

<p>I am not associated with any white nationalist groups, nor do I care to be. I have never posted about race. However, I believe this is happening and I’m not going to not talk about it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. Am too old to have had internet at home as a child, but I had to ask permission for each television programme I wished to watch from the schedule, amounting to a total of 20 minutes a day. There was no question that the programmes would be inappropriate as just four channels were received via aerial. New shows would be vetted by my mother before I could watch them. My peers all had similar restrictions and there were strict rules so older siblings would not cause accidental viewing of inappropriate stuff by the little kids. When I was about 9 I met a stack of other kids who were allowed to watch cable children&#39;s television for a few hours a day, unsupervised - I remember being horrified and assuming that they were neglected.</p>

<p>“Earlier this year, we updated our policies to make content featuring inappropriate use of family entertainment characters <strong>ineligible for monetisation</strong>,” said Juniper Downs, YouTube’s director of policy. “We’re in the process of <strong>implementing a new policy that age restricts this content</strong> in the YouTube main app when flagged. Age-restricted content is automatically not allowed in YouTube Kids. The YouTube team is made up of parents who are committed to improving our apps and getting this right.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen people mention they know people who have made videos like these to make money, when it gets brought up..</p>

<p>What seems clearly obvious, is that all kinds of accusations of extreme stuff has been made, but I and many others were unable to find any of it.. which means YouTube is likely working.</p>

<p>Apparently you can look up the country of origin somehow, I saw a post at least 6 months ago that showed these videos were uploaded from mostly Eastern parts of the world..</p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending it, there&#39;s definitely some weird shit, but other countries tend to have weird shit that&#39;s popular for them. Looking at the comment sections of the videos, besides people being directed there from posts like this, there&#39;s a shit ton of obviously foreign comments that seem to like/support it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just find it annoying when people are intentionally ambiguous especially when they claim to have made a breakthrough. I’ve come across comments on this sub before that are like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Fact 1. Fact 2. </p>

<p>Does that remind you of anything?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just tell us what the point is and don’t assume everyone’s thought process follows your own.  In the original text of your post, you didn’t bring up any ideas that someone who’s put thought into this situation hasn’t pondered, but you said you had a theory and didn’t present it. It’s like saying “I’ve asked all the rhetorical questions you all have and I have a theory, try to guess it!” When you say you have a theory, say what your conclusions are so it adds to the discussion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fight for the minds of our children is very real. Remember that a large part of what agencies like the CIA do is <em>generational</em>. People don&#39;t accept rapid change well. A push too hard toward an ideology in one generation usually causes civil unrest and a stark stance against the ideology. But spread it out over a couple generations gradually, and you can mold the general public mindset to whatever you want. </p>

<p>Right now there&#39;s a huge push to normalize sexual deviency, and Hollywood will push the agenda as they are the group responsible for casting these spells. Put vivid images of kids favorite Disney characters doing sexually deviant things in the minds of these children at a young age, and you&#39;re ingraining this deviancy as normalcy in an entire generation.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sick.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s wrong with sexual deviancy? I think that&#39;s innate in humans, I mean during roman times they had whole cities dedicated to sexual deviancy (see Pompei) it&#39;s only recent that puritanical ideology here in America has suppressed that. Nudity is allowed on normal television in Europe. Sexualizing children is something much more sinister akin to pedophilia, but I think sexual deviancy in adults shouldn&#39;t be condemned. Hollywood is like that because they know it&#39;s normal and a lot of Hollywood is from around the world where sex isn&#39;t suppressed like it is here in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha no it doesn&#39;t. I&#39;m part of a sexual deviant community of doctors lawyers and business men and they aren&#39;t pedophiles. Get a grip. Your just a conditioned pleb if you think sexual deviancy is a bad thing. Like I said there&#39;s a reason it was such a big part of the counter culture movement in the 70s and 60s and is why the government was so opposed to it because it was a middle finger to control and repression and the more the controlled sex the more they could control us by making us feel bad about our innate desires that we all are born with but are conditioned to suppress. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha aw I made you mad cause I called out something that&#39;s sensitive for you. Looks like I was right. You also seem to be conflating two points that are entirely separate. Pedophilia and sexual deviancy in Hollywood and culture are two separate things but I get that&#39;s hard for your infantile peasant brain to understand which is why you result to 3rd grade insults. Its seems your sexual suppression and my sexual freedom is causing some discontent inside of you just like I&#39;ve pointed out, causing you to lash out in anger and emotion. Almost like the truth is hard to hear. Almost like what is exactly expected when people are informed about their conditioning, they get mad. Direct that anger towards the institutions who made you suppress your innate desires. Don&#39;t blame the people who are free from those societal constraints. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I have said on other elsagate posts, the nature of the videos such as abductions , sedation and waking up in caves/strange places with strange people is in an effort to prep children into thinking these things are ok. These are the things child abductors do and these are situations portrayed where these children characters are the perpetrators. This is the normalizing of child trafficing. I would say this more so than deviancy, the children are almost always the victims not the onces doing the deviant acts. I think people are dancing around the nature of these videos in many subs right now. it&#39;s clearly generational indoctrination to prep children into thinking kidnapping and abuse is normal. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not defending it, there&#39;s definitely some weird shit, but other countries tend to have weird shit that&#39;s popular for them.

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s wrong with sexual deviancy? I think that&#39;s innate in humans, I mean during roman times they had whole cities dedicated to sexual deviancy (see Pompei) it&#39;s only recent that puritanical ideology here in America has suppressed that. Nudity is allowed on normal television in Europe. Sexualizing children is something much more sinister akin to pedophilia, but I think sexual deviancy in adults shouldn&#39;t be condemned. Hollywood is like that because they know it&#39;s normal and a lot of Hollywood is from around the world where sex isn&#39;t suppressed like it is here in the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Haha aw I made you mad cause I called out something that&#39;s sensitive for you. Looks like I was right. You also seem to be conflating two points that are entirely separate. Pedophilia and sexual deviancy in Hollywood and culture are two separate things but I get that&#39;s hard for your infantile peasant brain to understand which is why you result to 3rd grade insults. Its seems your sexual suppression and my sexual freedom is causing some discontent inside of you just like I&#39;ve pointed out, causing you to lash out in anger and emotion. Almost like the truth is hard to hear. Almost like what is exactly expected when people are informed about their conditioning, they get mad. Direct that anger towards the institutions who made you suppress your innate desires. Don&#39;t blame the people who are free from those societal constraints. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aw there you go again resorting to 3rd grade insults once again ignoring everything I&#39;m actually saying cause you&#39;re obviously too simple to respond in a composed and logical way when someone challenges your conditioning. Who&#39;s forcing anyone to fuck anyone in sexual deviancy in Hollywood movies or in &quot;over sexualized&quot; culture? Like I said I think your conflating pedophilia and sexual deviancy. I know these words are hard for you to understand when you are so angry but please try to not let your brain capacity to be too overwhelmed. Here I&#39;ll leave this for you, seems like you need it.</p>
