       I definitely do. I was listening to a Christopher Ryan podcast earlier where he and his guest were talking about just that. Of course, anyone alive during any era would be inclined to think this, but it seems like there is a lot of evidence suggesting this to be the case.

       Ive been dealing with this exact thought. Wondering if there comes a time in any generation that gets this feeling of impending change. Big change. Imagine what it was like to have a war going on in your backyard. Not knowing if a bomb was about to be dropped on your house or not because you can hear them exploding all around. Life is very comfortable right now for Americans, even the poor ones. In my opinion the big change we all feel if the rise of technology/AI. The singularity. A transition to a type 1 Civilization. This would be the biggest chance I can see happening within my lifetime. Setting bombing and killing millions of people in war isn't new, it just feels new to every generation that hasn't experienced it. I have no clue if this made any sense, I guess what im trying to say is that although history seems to repeat itself, we might see a change soon that is unlike any other change before.

       We are to a large extent. The thing that gives me some hope though is that there is at least some level of resistance... A lot more than any dystopians that I've read. My hope is that the number of resisters can only grow. It's just a matter of when we can reach a tipping point, and whether TPTB can successfully crush us without looking like pure authoritarians to the sheep.

       Maybe. I think we need to keep our eyes open and stay skeptical. The whole fight between Trump and the establishment could be fake. It could just be there so that Trump can hold up a fake conspiracy, say he smashed it, and then have business as usual.

       This shit has been happening since the dawn of man. We just see things that are further from us because of technology. I will say that in my lifetime I’ve never seen a larger divide between the proles, however the liberals who are shunning socialism and conservatives still trying to run the country through religion can eat a dick.

       After the world/cold wars humanity fell into a deep, comfortable sleep.  Since then, I feel like a much more perverted and demonic evil has thrived in the shadows.  We are just now beginning to see it rear its massive head.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pivot point for our lifetime will be whether people actually break out of their comfortable routine to finally say "No!" to the pedophilia, sex trafficking and underage islands or if they continue to accept the weak ass platitudes offered by the elite to get their co-conspirators off the hook.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think humanity will opt to remain comfortable and let evil thrive.

       You are right to mention technology when considering this.  But first of all let me say I understand and agree with other comments stating it has always felt like this for humanity throughout history.  I think there have been many pivotal moments for "civilization" or human kind over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this time it's different.  Because of the Law of Accelerating Returns (Ray Kurzweil) and the exponential growth of technology, which basically just means that the amount of technology, as recorded through various metrics, is doubling every certain period of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The important thing to remember is that an exponential growth curve starts off slow and is hardly noticed, which is how our technology started off.  It's not advancing slowly anymore though is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a couple names I've heard of for the part of the exponential growth curve where the growth becomes noticeable.  One is the "knee of the curve", because the curve really starts to bend up.  The other name is the "oh shit moment", because...oh shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's where the term "The Singularity" came from.  At some point Science Fiction authors, probably in the 80's or 90's for most of them, began running their imaginations up against some kind of barrier as they tried to imagine the technology of the future.  It was just, too far out there to even make a guess, or too hard to know if their imaginings seemed realistic,  I don't know.  Side note: I believe it was the math teacher and SF author Vernor Vinge who first used the term singularity in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, a fun tool I use to try and change peoples perceptions is to 
ask them this question, which is itself inspired by Dr. Erik Drexler's new book, he's the guy who first communicated about and coined the term "nanotechnology".  I ask them, would you ever put a computer inside your body?  I wait for a response or give them a pause to think....  Then I ask them the 2nd part of it "well would you consider, instead of putting 1 computer inside you, putting 1 million computers into each cell of your body?"  Because designs already exist for such computers and nano-machinces on the scale of one the 800 million protein machines in each of your cells already.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I enjoyed rambling about this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL,DR: Yes I agree, because of technology, and more specifically it's exponential growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       p.s. If you want to think further, ask yourself, if you could fold a normal piece of paper 50 times, how thick do you think it would become?  Each fold represents one level of exponential growth, a doubling.  Remember the growth starts off slow...humans are not good at estimating this type of thing.  I'll cut to the chase: it would be 50 Million Miles thick! I'm not kidding.  Not exactly what it seems like would happen is it?  And that's how our tech is growing, in these huge! doublings.

       Nah, I think it's an emotionally appealing position that contrasts with a rather mundane (relatively) period of human history.
      </p>
      <p>
       What are these technological changes? Movies and games are prettier, there's more consumption, more distractions.  The guy that used to be a burger king manager is scraping by on part-time techno gigs. Medical revolution has been "three to five years away" for decades. We're still broke, we still exist in an infrastructure designed in the 1800's.  Our politicians are as corrupt as ever and nobody gives a damn.
      </p>

       I think the actual historical moment will be 100 years from now. AI will change... everything, forever, and hopefully society will be given a kick in the ass to change.  At that point, there will probably be billions of homeless climate change refugees vs.  a cyborg jeff bezos and his army of sentient drones.

       this line of thought always leads me to wonder what a single repository for all truth would look like. and if we couldn't start building it now.

       i mean, actually, the universe really already is the repository for all truth. but we need one humans can sort alphabetically and search and makes memes out of.

       With recent events (I'm thoroughly enjoying the Q train ride)...I can't help but to see the dots join, illustrating a 'pivotal stage' of human history. We learnt/are learning a lot about the TPTB this year...and we can clearly see how much pressure that they are under. Optimistically, I want to say that we're witnessing their very last days. Our goal was to fight against the NWO, and our victory shall lead us to an unprecedented new era for humanity...finally

       Definitely been doing this. Not exactly praying but daring to hope, believe, envision, meditate (I suppose that's what praying is in a way). Also been informing others too. This has to end, the sooner the better (and more possible as Q says)

       (1) China Russia (oil rich) trading oil in yuan. Venezuela (oil rich) trading oil in yuan. Iran (oil rich) trading oil in Yuan. Other (oil rich) countries will trade in yuan. US print US dollars in 3 QEs. Excess dollars sent back to US. More dollars in circulation in the US. Hyperinflation is a certainty.
      </p>
      <p>
       (2) Look at retail data around the world. Retail is very very bad. Also, 30% drop in property prices. 50% drop in automobile loans. etc ... just look.
      </p>
      <p>
       (3) A good indicator of bad US economy is gold. If gold rises, that means global risk, meaning people are gettting scared and buying the yellow metal. Same for silver.
      </p>
      <p>
       (4) But price of gold and silver is low. Why? Because the price is being manipulated. Price is low because globalist bankers (cabal) are keeping it low. Someone, ummm, cabal, sold 38k gold contracts the other day in 8 minutes, you can see price of silver and gold spike lower.
      </p>
      <p>
       (5) In this context where price is artificially low, look at security services wages, there is a rise in demand. Year on year, wages for them rise 24%. The elites KNOW something is about to happen. All around the world, they are hiring security personnel and buying safes, even renting places with airstrips to fly in their valuables in with heavy security.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the facts are searchable. Do it yourself but don't get caught up in the narrative they are feeding you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saudi Arabia is just one oil producer and was the leader of OPEC, but the US has plenty of shale oil and it is cheap too. In fact, we don't really know how much oil is left in SA because they keep it secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       ANYWAY, AS I STATED BEFORE, OLD SYSTEM WILL DIE, AND THEY WILL TRY AND ENSLAVE US AGAIN WITH A NEW MONEY SYSTEM. LIKE USD/CRYTOCURRENCY.

       Bin Salman literally just locked up all the pro-yuan princes.  Their money can no longer influence other nations to go petroyuan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your post literally claimed Saudi was no longer head of OPEC and that all those oil rich nations were all currently damaging the USD.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have an 18 trillion dollar annual economy, the largest military by a factor of 900, and a renewed position with the head of OPEC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, I would wager your predictions/speculation will not come to pass.

       Are we talking about SA or death of the petrodollar? We are not talking about the health of SA but the health of the US, so the petrodollar. People are not spending, the economy is not great. 20 trillion in debt. Hence inflation. Hyperinflation.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are making the case that SA, which is ONE member of OPEC, will save the petrodollar but I have already stated oil rich countries are leaving OPEC, some have left already. You talk about freezing pro yuan accounts. But you still haven't considered the other countries that deal with trading oil with gold and yuan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which is why Trump tweeted aramco to be listed on the NY stock exchange, because he is trying to help the new king and prince to diversify from oil. Also SA oil will run out and we don't know how much there is left since it is secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think simpler and clearer. SA and US are the ONLY countries to trade in oil in the US dollar. If there is no demand from other countries to trade in US dollars then the petrodollar will die.

       We are always at that time, the time is alway now.  Look around you, we have new technologies with the promises that it will make our lives easier. But, most of us still have to work 40 hour/ week. All the advancements in medicine and people are still dying because they can't afford treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have the technology to usher in a new society in which the tech actually can allow us to live a more full and leisured life. But instead we get cheaply made and quickly obsolete tech rendered out to the masses. That allow conveyances. Still gotta work that 40 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       WE got all this technology and it some how without a doubt has some how pushed us so far apart. It should be bringing us closer together. IT can but it is used to pool large groups of people together to fight vs there counterparts.

       There is a higher-order of intelligence being birthed on this planet. Those who embody this new consciousness will help pioneer what many have called "New Earth", or Terra. We are seeing the siphoning of consciousnesses right now, splitting of "timelines". Those who cannot or will not evolve will be on their own path to destruction. Those who can and will make this next step towards a compassionate and enlightened society will do just that. You choose where you are headed based on the consciousness you embody.

      <p>
       when I went to the hospital earlier this year, there was a nurse there who also was a christian. I was freaking out telling her that I thought it was the end of times, and she told me "how do you think the people who were alive during World War 2 felt"

       Steve Bannon read it too, and a lot of what is going on is detailed in
       <strong>
        The Fourth Turning
       </strong>
       book. Essentially we are in a cycle that has repeated over and over. These years coincide with what happened in 1776, 1865, 1944, and now 2020ish.
      </p>
      <p>
       The book even identified a Grey Champion (Bernie Sanders) and an anti-intellectual demagogue (Trump) peddling division.

       Highly recommend it.

       We already entered it, there's been a quantum shift forward in the collective human conscious that's been going on for roughly 100 years (you can say it started in the mid 1800s, but really didn't kick off until early to mid 1900s). And yes, it has to do with technology. The first big leap in this shift occurred with the advent of better modes of transportation. For the first time, large amounts of people were able to see a world beyond a very small patch of land that they basically never left. Planes and boats eventually propelled this even further, then satellites and the space race even further than that (I've often argued that there is a subconscious 'awareness' that defines most human beings under a certain age, and that is a result of us having pictures of the earth from outter space. We grew up from an early age knowing how we are undoubtedly on a planet in a much much larger universe), and the final major shift - so far - coincides with the advances in mass communication.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, we're very much still in the infancy as a race in understanding and embracing this shift. There are those, and they are many, that are aware of it, albeit subconsciously and it makes them think in a global sense, they aim to be more worldly and enlightened. They understand humanity is a giant tribe that must work together. However, there are still others that haven't really embraced this yet, and unfortunately our schools don't really help to educated the younger ones about cosmology and history before really Mesopotamia, and even that gets glossed over.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, we're in the midst of a very pivotal stage, and if the old guard doesnt fuck shit up over the next few years, which they are increasingly looking like they're gearing up to do, then we can be in for an age of prosperity that the world has never really known. Just my two cents.

       Bit of a rough patch to be sure, but it'll sort itself out.
      </p>
      <p>
       When looking at the entire human race and our conditions hve never been better; violence is down, health is up, etc. As an organism, we're doing alright.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before our peaceful utopian future is here though, there's just one teeny bump in the roam remaining for us to get by, then we'll be all set! The Event that will open our eyes and bring about a new age of global cooperation and stuff. I don't know what it will be though, maybe some kind of natural disaster or asteroid, or aliens, or nasty nuclear war, maybe a global pandemic to thin our numbers and cull the herd somewhat.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Event is even a constant in most good scifi, before we can start building starships, there will be that little obstacle in our path first. In Star Trek it was Khan and the Eugenics Wars.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you know, cheer up, everything is right on schedule. In 150-200 years or so, students will study our time period while the vessels they are in explore our Galaxy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all good.

       Think of the Event as the massive disclosure of what the world truly is, i.e. exposure of the dark forces that run everything behind the scenes. The purpose of rumors of wars (war between nations &amp; drama inside the gov.) stems from preventing this disclosure, a distraction. Those on the side of Humanity are stronger and more advanced than you think. Do not be afraid. Fear is how they control you. You are more than this life time+++

       I think the fallacy here is that any Era is immune from making or breaking humanity. If we are at a crossroads that could lead to the end it is because of how hard everyone coasted for the last couple decades assuming things couldn't be fucked up so much in little increments as to fall apart completely.

       Of course the world in entering a pivotal stage in history, but it will not break humanity.  We are witness to the beginning of what will be the fulfillment of Biblical Prophecy.  The exponential growth in technology, especially algorithms,  coupled with the decline of privacy,   will make it possible for a one-world govt. to control the population, even to the extent of denying people the right to buy and sell unless they have what the Bible calls "the mark of the beast" (probably an implanted microchip that contains all personal/banking/medical information).
