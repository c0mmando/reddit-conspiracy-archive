       For anyone who hasn't seen it, this interview was the first time MSM spoke with James Alefantis, Megyn kelly conducted The interview and it was a huge deal on this sub when it broke. Check it out.

       Now, theres a whole SLEW of legitimate questions she COULD have asked him, but instead he got a softball interview and was portrayed as a "victim of fake news"..
      </p>
      <p>
       Why was there no representation of our side of the story?
      </p>
      <p>
       "Your critics say that once they revealed an FBI pedophile symbol on one of your businesses' logos, it was changed the next
Day. Why do you suspect this was?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Self described investigators have noted that there is an astonishing amount of strange lude sexual and "ritualistic" art in your supposedly family friendly resturaunt. Care to comment?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "What is your relationship with John Podesta? Your pizza place is referenced in his leaked emails a dozen or so times. Also, why have you visited the White House 4 times during the 2nd term of the Obama presidency?"
      </p>
      <p>
       "Why does GQ magazine list you as one of the most powerful people in Washington DC? Do you have any other financial ventures other than your pizza place? You seem to be rubbing elbows with some power DC politicians and elites, James. Can you clear this up for us?"
      </p>
      <p>
       But instead we get a softball interview from two sociopaths to help clear this cocksucker of any guilt or wrongdoing...
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he goes and threatens to kill the researcher who exposed the location his "Pegasus Museum"  kill room.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, he's not hiding
       <em>

       It was so obviously a quid-pro-quo deal. She got the huge NBC contract almost immediately afterwards.

       People on instagram were accusing him of "falseness and conspiracy." Who does that? Not buying it PingPong. LOL...the "sister innocently taped the little girl's hands down," and the "parents gave permission to put it on the internet." That's hilarious.

       Exactly. He doesn't run a chain like Papa John's or Dominoes. How the fuck does this guy have so much money and these connections if he's just a simple fucking pizza shop owner? His pizza better be the best tasting pizza in the fucking world if he's not running some child sex ring

      <p>
       The fact that you think that the logo was at one of Alefantis's businesses just goes to show how you've been duped. It was at Besta Pizza, which has no relationship to Alefantis other than being on the same street.

       You might want to go back and find out which things were actually at the restaurant and which things were on Instagram. Most of the sexual imagery on Instagram wasn't even on Alefantis' account, either.

       His relationship to Democrats is the reason he was attacked! What exactly is there to "clear up"? There's nothing wrong with him holding fundraisers at his restaurants.

       My dog would've carried out a better interview. Kelly had directions to picture Alefantis as a victim, so the questions she chose were in his favour. Also the interview was obviously rehersed, so he was never put on the spot or asked any awkward questions that he wouldnt know how to answer.
