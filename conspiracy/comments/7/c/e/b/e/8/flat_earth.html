I remember hearing this one theory in a video saying that they think the earth is flat and Antarctica surrounds the whole earth and there&#39;s more land on the other side that we&#39;ve never seen. So maybe the governments are hiding that because there could be other beings over there or something idk just a theory I heard. </p>

<p>Debunked. This is actually an interesting one we can get into if you want but its more than likely environmental / people not performing experiments correctly. This is also a great case of the anti science views of FEers. </p>

<p>A quick rundown is imagine this test like having two styrofoam coolers. One with a lid one without. Objects in the cooler with the lid wont lose heat as quickly right?</p>

<p>Same with the moon. If there is no moon that means cloud cover, AKA a lid over that part of the Earth meaning its less likely to lose heat. If its a clear night (Moonlight) then we know like the cooler with no lid that heat will be more readily lost vs the one with a lid (Cloudy night). </p>

<p>There is a reason this hasnt been reported and tested. </p>

<p>Why do you think no one has written a paper on this phenomena?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>horizon always being eye level</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except for when you get a theodolite and see its not. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why all the astronauts are Freemasons,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Pretty sure women cant become freemasons and Im pretty sure there are women astronauts. How do you reconcile that?</p>

<p>From the research Ive done there are only maybe 20 out of several hundred who are masons. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why they faked the moon landing</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Im not going down this rabbit hole but its worth mentioning that we definitely left equpiment on the moon and the moon is definitely very far away. </p>

<p>I went to school for comp sci and part of a final for the software end of my education was to work with the engineering students (Along with a bunch of comp sci students) to bounce a signal off the moon and extrapolate data from it. </p>

<p>One of the things we measured was the round trip the signal took. Turns out the moon is really far away... And there are reflectors there. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>why NASA only prints cgi.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Except for when they dont. There are multiple images of Earth that are unedited non-composite.  </p>

<p>DSCOVR EPIC for one. </p>

<p>Why did you lie about that last one

<p>Lol, what? </p>

<p>Oh, thats easy. </p>

<p>Watch a boat sail over the horizon, it disappears bottom first. increasing your elevation brings it back into view, this should not be possible on a FE. </p>

<p>Look up the Bedford level experiment. A guy showed curvature by putting floating discs on the top of the water. He looked over this long stretch of water with floating discs on it and noted that the discs in the middle were higher than those at either end. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>People don&#39;t write papers on phenomenas that don&#39;t get grants.</p>

<p>Yes they do. Just not FEers. It doesnt bother you at all that people who believe in a FE never bother to clearly lay their ideas out in a written format? </p>

<p><a href="https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/76000/76261/ISS029-E-031270_lrg.jpg">https://eoimages.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/imagerecords/76000/76261/ISS029-E-031270_lrg.jpg</a></p>

<p>Thats what a crepuscular ray looks like from above. Its like you didnt even look at the image I posted for you... Why did you not even address it? You straight up ignored the explanation I gave and posted an image of crepuscular rays. </p>

<p>This is very typical of a FE supporter, completely ignore things that contradict your beliefs. </p>

<p>Again, moonlanding faked or not we have equpiment on the moon. </p>

<p>I literally explained to you how I know this for a 100% fact and you didnt even bother to address it. </p>

<p>You just keep saying the same things over and over without even addressing new information. You dont bother to challenge points Ive made, its like youre a bot just reposting the same info over and over even after having it debunked. </p>

<p>Again... Why did you not look at the DSCOVER EPIC satellite I informed you about? Its like you dont listen... you just straight up ignore counter evidence. </p>

<p>YOU CANT ADMIT SHIT THAT IS IN THE PRESS RELEASE! </p>

<p>NASA never once claimed that composite images were one large photo. They never tried to pass off composite images. They list on their site how those images are made. </p>

<p>Congrats youve discovered a secret that NASA was never hiding. </p>

<p>I get it but you didnt answer the question posed. If you trace the rays back it shows the object is below the horizon. How do you explain that if on a FE the sun never goes below the horizon?</p>

<p>See the problem? </p>

<p>Also never bothered to respond to the vanishing point image... Wonder why?</p>

<p>Please explain how college kids who built a transmitter and reciever did so to get bad results. </p>

<p>Now come on... You mean to tell me that its perspective that causes the sun to appear to be below the horizon?</p>

<p>You are going to have to explain that one to me because it makes no sense and Ive heard some really wacky FE theories before. </p>

<p>Heres another impossible example on a FE</p>

<p><a href="http://nextme.it/images/igallery/resized/801-900/8._Mount_Rainier-802-600-450-80.jpg">http://nextme.it/images/igallery/resized/801-900/8._Mount_Rainier-802-600-450-80.jpg</a></p>

<p>The sun should never be below the clouds on a FE unless its rising from under the horizon. </p>

<p>Im a little disappointed that I give you photo evidence and you cant address them. I give you explanations and evidence and your best response is &quot;Its perspective&quot; with no exposition and no explanation. </p>

<p>Its sad. </p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>I just acknowledged your point. The sun on an infinite plane can cause the rays to show below the clouds. It&#39;s all about perspective. I&#39;m sorry you think I didn&#39;t address it but I thought it was pretty evident from what I proposed.</p>

<p>So on a ball earth the crepuscular rays that point up are possible indicating the sun coming from the horizon which can show sunlight under the clouds  but it also works on a flat plane model. However the crepuscular rays that I showed you can not be possible on a ball earth.</p>

<p>Im not sure about the level of dialogue you are used to but simply saying &quot;Perspective&quot; and dropping the mic is not exactly a great way of sharing ideas. </p>

<p>I took a few drawing classes when I was younger and more idealistic and I never ran into this perspective problem. </p>

<p>Can you explain or link me to a resource (Preferably non youtube) that explains how the sun can appear to be below the horizon or illuminating the underside of clouds without actually being below the cloud line? </p>

<p>Seems impossible to be honest. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>This doesnt make any sense, can you expand a bit on it?</p>

<p>Follow the rays back to their origin and youll see it is below the horizon. That is not possible on a FE... The sun should never be below the horizon, right? So how does that mount rainier picture work on your FE? </p>

<p><a href="http://nextme.it/images/igallery/resized/801-900/8._Mount_Rainier-802-600-450-80.jpg">http://nextme.it/images/igallery/resized/801-900/8._Mount_Rainier-802-600-450-80.jpg</a></p>

<p>This image is not possible on a FE. </p>

<p>Why are you ignoring that?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I explained exactly how your crepuscular rays work. You never bothered to respond to it. </p>

<p>Why are you ignoring the evidence Im presenting that shows you are wrong? Does it go away if you ignore it? </p>

<p>Those rays are very possible on a FE. I showed you how. I guess Ill show you again... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look buddy, just because you can&#39;t 3d image inside your artistic head doesn&#39;t  mean I&#39;m wrong. </p>

<p>Look one more time buddy. The sun is far away. Farther than the perspective that you have at the time that shows the horizon. If you take a nikon 900 you can zoom into the sun and it will bring it right back into view and show that it didnt go beyond the horizon. 
One more time buddy. INFINITE PLANE.</p>

<p>The crepuscular rays you show can be possible on both models but this type is impossible on a ball earth.</p>

<p>Also you&#39;re so sneaky, all you do is talk as if your intellectually superior and accuse me of not addressing things when in fact I do address them and you just turn around and use tactics to gain superiority instead of arguing on facts.</p>

<p>here is the picture I meant when I said crepuscular rays. The rays you show dont even dismiss either model.
<a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-42e57d7eed17d447c7a07e883ba110ca-c">https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-42e57d7eed17d447c7a07e883ba110ca-c</a></p>

<p>If you triangulate these rays you will come to find that the sun is much closer than what we&#39;ve been told.</p>

<p>Like I said. I address your rays with PERSPECTIVE. do you understand?</p>

<p>I also have nothing against your rays. I dont know why you keep showing me supporting evidence. I&#39;ve already agreed that your rays are possible on a flat earth model and ball earth model and you&#39;ve still never addressed the REAL issue of crepusculur rays and the fact that I brought it up and you just keep on dodging MY rays to propose your theory.</p>

<p>What you wrote also dont answer why the bottoms of the clouds are illuminated or explain how ranier is casting that shadow. If you believe the sun acts like a spot light and is several thousand miles above us then there is no way to reconcile the images Ive shown you with your reality. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>I did multiple times. Its perspective. Those rays are far away and appear to converge. </p>

<p>I gave you multiple examples showing that this phenomena happens all the time. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obviously stone buildings, ceilings and such can create crepuscular rays but not clouds.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wait... Why? Think about what youre saying. The principles are the same. If you trace the rays back from the building windows does that mean the sun is right outside the window? </p>

<p>No, those lines are parallel, right? </p>

<p>That is exactly what is happening on a larger scale with clouds. </p>

<p>Explain how it works in windows on buildings but not with clouds? The principles are exactly the same. </p>

<p>You are basically saying two different things... You say parallel lines can create crepuscular rays but at the same time claiming clouds cant. </p>

<p>The sun can also not be below the horizon on a FE... It never goes below the horizon on a FE... FEers believe the sun orbits us like a spotlight.... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>So... you gonna explain my picture or what.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have explained it multiple times. </p>

<p>Either refute what Ive said or concede the point. </p>

<p>Explain why you believe crepuscular rays but at the same time think they cant happen on clouds. </p>

<p>Your picture is a picture of parallel lines that appear to converge. Just like in the pics of the buildings I provided, those are parallel lines that appear to converge. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That first link was a joke, right? </p>

<p>I posted a picture of Mount Rainier being lit by the sun and casting a shadow almost 90 degrees to the surface... </p>

<p>There is no way to explain that on a FE model. Roll however many flashlights you want over table tops the physics simply doesnt work. </p>

<p>It illuminates the bottoms of clouds! If you believe the FE model then you believe the sun is several thousand miles away, there is no way to reconcile those ideas. </p>

<p>The second video is even more laughable.... </p>

<p>I really think youre trolling here buddy. </p>

<p>That was the sun setting, there is a reason its only 18 seconds long and you dont watch the whole sun dip below the horizon lol. </p>

<p>You are either purposely posting nonsense or youve been tricked by grade school science. </p>

<p>The sun goes below the horizon on a flat earth because of perspective. It goes beyond the ability of human&#39;s eyes to see, and thus appears as though it goes below the horizon. It&#39;s JUST like if you&#39;re at the end of a really long hallway.</p>

<p>The sun illuminates the bottom of clouds because once the sun is at any decent amount of distance, the clouds and the earth are no different in terms of distance from the suns light source. </p>

<p>The reason I linked the flashlight is because I thought once you saw it, you would realize the implications of the physics and nature of the sun. You do realize science is things that are observable and repeatable right? You laugh at a real scientific formula further showing how you are unable to think for yourself. </p>

<p>The sun was going below the horizon.. as in a part of it was no longer visible and then the zoom brought the bottom of the sun back into picture. And you say it didn&#39;t do that.. I mean really, the video is right there.</p>

<p>I am funny, because you don&#39;t know how to think for yourself. All you can do is resort to little tricks that make you think you&#39;re superior to your opponent. But guess what, in a real debate the only thing that matters is the truth.</p>

<p>You do realize that the only reason we are at an impasse is because you don&#39;t know how to 3d image inside your head? </p>

<p>Well thats not a great way to prove a point to you. </p>

<p>Alright, visualize the 3D image in my head... </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sun goes below the horizon on a flat earth because of perspective. It goes beyond the ability of human&#39;s eyes to see, and thus appears as though it goes below the horizon. It&#39;s JUST like if you&#39;re at the end of a really long hallway.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right, you saying that is fine but it doesnt answer a few basic questions. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Why will the rising sun cause mountains to cast a 90 degree shadow?</p></li>
<li><p>Why can we see the sun go below the horizon and have the horizon cut the sun in half as it does so?</p></li>
<li><p>how can the sun illuminate the bottoms of the clouds as it rises? </p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The sun illuminates the bottom of clouds because once the sun is at any decent amount of distance, the clouds and the earth are no different in terms of distance from the suns light source.</p>

<p>No one is stopping a FE &quot;scientist&quot; from offering up an alternative. </p>

<p>So where is it? Where are the technical papers quantifying the FE belief? Why is it always youtube videos and blog posts? There is no conspiracy stopping people from doing their own research and releasing their own findings but you will never ever see it. Why?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Regarding perspective, if you performed a simple experiment, you would realise that objects disappear over long distances when viewed over a flat surface. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I get it. You dont know what a test is or means. </p>

<p>You do realize you havent explained anything lol. You just keep rewriting the same thing over and over without proofs or exposition. If objects disappear because of the vanishing point that vanishing point doesnt change because of elevation, try to prove me wrong, try to find any kind of source that says elevation and vanishing point are intrinsically tied together. You wont, because you just made that up. </p>

<p>Im serious, you just said it is because it is. Thats not an acceptable answer. </p>

<p>Even if it did work like that it in no way explains why objects disappear bottom first. Here are a few examples(See Ill provide evidence not just assumptions).</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/ALMeuTV">https://imgur.com/ALMeuTV</a></p>

<p>The above shows that distance forces the bottom of those ships to disappear. Why is that? Its not perspective. </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/jbABfkG">https://imgur.com/jbABfkG</a></p>

<p>Heres another where increasing your elevation by 10 meters increases how much can be seen, thats not perspective. </p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/j6sbpkR">https://imgur.com/j6sbpkR</a></p>

<p>And one final example of height increasing the amount to be seen. </p>

<p>Regarding perspective, yes absolutely, an object higher in the sky can be seen further away. At ground level standing on a beach, a boat disappear at the horizon vanishing point at approx 3 miles.

<p>Liquids wont separate in zero gravity... You cant have density or buoyancy without an attractive force... </p>

<p>Lets do a very simple thought game. </p>

<p>Lets put an object into a vacuum sealed container and suck all of the air out. </p>

<p>What happens to the object inside? There is nothing for it to be buoyant against, does it float? I think common sense would say not only does it stay put on the bottom of the vacuum it still weights the same if you put the vacuum sealed box on a scale. </p>

<p>So that means there must be another force penetrating the box and causing the brick to be pulled down, right? We call that gravity. </p>

<p>Okay we will revisit your vanishing point problems in a minute. </p>

<p>Im really curious to hear your answer as to why the images I showed you are missing their bottoms until elevation is raised. </p>

<p>You completely ignored them as if I never posted them. </p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>The reason boats disappear from the bottom, is due to a mirroring effect. This can be seen during a sunset. The bottom of the sun is mirrored upwards. It&#39;s hard to explain in words. In any case this can also be seen on flat long straight roads, where the car tires &quot;melt into the road&quot; at much less distance then the 3 mile horizon. Very easily shown on film. </p>

<p>I guess youre missing the point... </p>

<p>A vacuum is not zero gravity but to have things like buoyancy you need an attracting force, otherwise things with different densities wont separate. </p>

<p>You get it? Your argument is precluded by the idea that you need a force to be pulling all the matter down to have it separate. </p>

<p>The point I was making was that if you believe that density is the only reason things fall down, like a brick is heavier than air so it goes to the bottom, right? If you beleive that then what happens to an object in a vacuum? There is nothing in there for it to fall against, again if you dont believe in gravity. </p>

<p>You get the idea? Its a two fold question. How can things separate by density if there is no attractive force like gravity? Secondly what happens to items in a box with no vacuum? Do they weigh a different amount since there is nothing for them to separate against? </p>

<p>But why? You see the issue with your logic? If it is strictly density then how does the object know to go &quot;down&quot; in a vacuum? Doesnt that imply there is another force at work pulling everything &quot;down&quot;?</p>

Truly one can believe more than one thing even it the multiple beliefs contradidicte each other, belief is quite a mystery too i.e. Someone sees a car accident or something horrible, they say to themselves or out loud &quot;I can&#39;t believe this&quot; of course this would be a figure of speech but doesn&#39;t it make you wonder what belief actually means to us. Is seeing believing, how about hearing, reading? This is where science should be able to come in and debunk beliefs, but even if it does people will cling to their faith and belief systems. Which takes us back to flat earth needing tons of evidence to convince people, but not just that. Officials and persons of Authority would have to present this evidence, no matter how much we go back and forth no one will believe anything different from reading our comments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, to continue, the Big Bang Theory gives people some answers to why they exist: meaningless nothingness, a &quot;it doesn&#39;t matter because in the grand scheme of things we are just tiny bits of stardust&quot;. Flat earth theory brings the creation aspect of &quot;why am I here?&quot;, if you go from there to any biblical reference it would be a more Christian view of the world. If the debate picks up some steam, it shouldn&#39;t be if it&#39;s either spherical or flat, this is a black/white statement. This is more of a gray area subject in my opinion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good question.</p>

<p>One benefit would be the trillions of dollars spent on &quot;space stuffs&quot;. Another scam, funded for by taxpayers.</p>

<p>Another would be to convince people there is no God, that the Earth really isn&#39;t flat like the Bible says it is. That it&#39;s actually a globe, spinning a thousand miles an hour while orbiting the sun while the sun hurtles through space. So we&#39;re really nobodies on a speck of dirt. Just live your life out by going to school getting good grades and getting a good job. Accept your slavery, while at the same time watch us promote a bunch of sin so you think its normal and boom. Atheist. ;P</p>

<p>Look buddy, just because you can&#39;t 3d image inside your artistic head doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m wrong.</p>

<p>I literally gave you a 3D rendering that explains how youre wrong... No imagination needed. </p>

<p>I cant imagine it because its not possible and you cant explain it further proving how its not possible. If you cant explain your idea then its a shit idea. </p>

<p>Farther than the perspective that you have at the time that shows the horizon. If you take a nikon 900 you can zoom into the sun and it will bring it right back into view and show that it didnt go beyond the horizon. One more time buddy. INFINITE PLANE.</p>

<p>Youre doing that thing again where you make unsubstantiated claims as though they are facts. </p>

<p>You cannot bring the sun into view before it rises over the horizon. Seriously? </p>

<p>You are going to have to back that one up lol. It makes no sense and I have never seen any evidence of that in my life. I think youre making it up, again... </p>

<p>What you wrote also dont answer why the bottoms of the clouds are illuminated or explain how ranier is casting that shadow. If you believe the sun acts like a spot light and is several thousand miles above us then there is no way to reconcile the images Ive shown you with your reality. </p>

<p>Is that why you refuse to address them? </p>

<p>Can you answer those? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The crepuscular rays you show can be possible on both models but this type is impossible on a ball earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What? You just linked to a google image search for &quot;crepuscular rays&quot;. I proved to you multiple times how crepuscular rays work and you ignore the evidence. You straight up dont even bother to talk about it. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also you&#39;re so sneaky, all you do is talk as if your intellectually superior and accuse me of not addressing things when in fact I do address them and you just turn around and use tactics to gain superiority instead of arguing on facts.</p>
