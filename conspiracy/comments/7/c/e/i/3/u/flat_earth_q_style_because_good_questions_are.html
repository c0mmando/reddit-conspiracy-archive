    <div class="md"><p>Cognitive Dissonance is a weekly podcast recorded live from Glory Hole Studios in Chicago. Every episode they blast anyone who gets in their way. They bring critical thinking, skepticism and irreverence to any topic that makes the news, makes it big or makes them mad. It&#39;s skeptical, it&#39;s political, and there is no welcome mat. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the field of psychology, cognitive dissonance is the mental discomfort experienced by a person who simultaneously holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values. The occurrence of cognitive dissonance is a consequence of a person&#39;s performing an action that contradicts personal beliefs, ideals, and values; and also occurs when confronted with new information that contradicts said beliefs, ideals, and values</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem here is that you are assuming the horizon that you are seeing with your own eyes is is actually the curvature of the earth.</p>

<p>When you are sitting in an Airliner at 30,000 feet, how can you possibly see the curvature out of the left and right windows at the same time when you are flying over a sphere? </p>

<p>The curvature is supposed to be down and away from you way under where you are seeing the horizon.</p>

<p>So you should not be able to see any curvature if you were flying over a ball.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, if you are flying over a ball, as we are when flying in an airplane on Earth, the curvature is most notable at the horizon.</p>

<p>Your word salad trying to make the point by distorting reality doesn&#39;t make sense. You don&#39;t have to see our of both windows of the airplane at the same time. Looking at the horizon from one window is sufficient. There is still a horizon in sight BECAUSE THERE IS A HORIZON ALL AROUND THE AIRPLANE. THE EARTH IS A SPHERE.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/te9Nar5.jpg">For Example </a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that the guy in the picture is viewing the sphere he&#39;s looking at from about the same perspective as an airplane would be on Earth. Scale is of course different since the Earth is much larger. Don&#39;t you think that the curvature of the Earth could be seen from every direction?</p>

<p>No surprise that Dishonest Donald is trying to bring back coal use in America and sabotage our efforts to reduce the effect of Global Warming by making America the only country on Earth that didn&#39;t sign the Paris Agreement. Even Russia signed it.</p>

<p>Sunrise on an airplane looks very much like it does when viewed from the surface of the planet. Only thing is that you can see for a much farther distance when viewing it from high altitude.</p>

<p>If the Sun is, as you say, at a constant altitude above the Flat Earth then don&#39;t you think that a sunrise would look much different? Wouldn&#39;t a sunrise from an airplane look very different when viewed from an airplane on Flat Earth?</p>

<p>Since sunrise/sunset always happens at the horizon but at vastly different distance depending on the altitude of the observer it&#39;s pretty obvious that FLAT EARTH IS BULLSHIT. </p>

<p>Why would you want to pollute people&#39;s minds with bullshit? What benefit is there to you?</p>

<p>Yes because your field of view increases the higher you go, flat or globe. Moot point.</p>

<p>The sun, a very bright and energetic object, cannot be seen directly until it comes into view from over the horizon. It&#39;s the same regardless of your altitude.</p>

<p>Yes, it shows that the Moon and Earth are brighter than the surrounding area, which is dark.  Nice work.</p>

<p>This is impossible as according to the Flat Earth model the Sun would disappear due to perspective, which would mean that at the position at ~21 seconds it would appear smaller in South America than it does in the Northern Hemisphere.  Which is does not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actual footage of Venus</p>

<p>1) The Belt of Venus doesn&#39;t deal with the planet Venus, it&#39;s something we see on Earth.  </p>

<p>2) You are posting a video of somebody who doesn&#39;t know how to properly focus a camera as evidence.  This is what Venus looks like when a camera is properly focused:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/dqfNerf">https://imgur.com/dqfNerf</a></p>

<p>Why are you posting such intentionally misleading evidence?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The sun does get smaller</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, you are posting intentionally misleading evidence.  This is a result of overexposure of the Sun.  If you use a solar filter with a camera, you will see it doesn&#39;t change over the course of the day.  Again, an experiment you can conduct yourself, but you would rather post misleading videos?  Very odd.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They don&#39;t. 40 second clip watch to the end</p>

<p>Yes they do, you are again posting misleading evidence:</p>

<p><a href="https://imgur.com/a/LPafX">https://imgur.com/a/LPafX</a></p>

<p>Perhaps you could try answering the questions again, without posting deliberately incorrect evidence?</p>

<p>Why doesn&#39;t this reverse half the year? It&#39;s tilted and pointing toward Polaris, right? That would mean in the afternoom, it&#39;s in the southern sky in the northern hemisphere, as we observe, but would be in the northern sky 6 months later, which we do not observe.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When you look at this picture of the earth going around the sun throughout the year, you can quickly see the problem:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/mclass/Glossary_axis.html">https://www.learner.org/jnorth/tm/mclass/Glossary_axis.html</a></p>

<p>In winter, the sun will follow a path in the southern sky as you can see earth is tilted away from the sun, toward Polaris. This makes sense. But 6 months later, in summer, the earth is still tilted toward Polaris, which means you should see the sun arc in the <em>northern</em> sky throughout the day, as you can see in the picture above. We don&#39;t see that in reality. </p>

<p>In the northern hemisphere, the Sun will stay in the southern sky throughout the whole year. How can this be?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is an incorrect assumption.  The sun doesn&#39;t &quot;stay in the southern sky throughout the whole year&quot;.  In the Northern Hemisphere, in the summer the Sun rises in the northeast, then moves to the south for ~noon, then back north and sets in the northwest.  In the winter, it rises in the southeast, then moves to the south for ~noon, and sets in the southwest.</p>

<p>This is the difference you are looking for, not that the sun would magically change directions.</p>

<p>Look at the picture again. It would take magic for the noontime Sun to be in the southern sky in summer when you can see you would be looking to the north to look toward the sun in the sky. The earth would tilting down and toward the sun, so in the northern hemisphere the sun should be in the northern sky. In reality, it is, as you said, always in the southern sky throughout the year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The video is just an animation version of the graphic I posted above, but with the same problem: during summer, the Sun should be in the northern sky, but in reality you will always observe the Sun in the southern sky. Anyone can observe this for themselves in the sky.</p>

<p>Just like the graphic, the animation shows the Earth tilting 66.6 degrees away from the elliptical, and since Polaris never moves in the sky, and the stars spin around it, this means the earth is <em>always</em> pointing toward it as it goes around the Sun (unlike how it is shown in the animation.) This is impossible, because the Sun always travels in the same arc in the sky, in the south in the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p>The Sun <strong>is</strong> in the northern sky in the summer, it rises in the northeast and sets in the southwest.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Except that it isn&#39;t.  It rises and sets in the north.  You are dismissing actual observation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Sun doesn&#39;t always travel in the same arc, the arc changes over the course of the year.  This is why analemma exist:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma</a></p>

<p>Seriously, you need to model this yourself in a 3d program or with a set of tennis balls.  You are both dismissing observational evidence as well as making false claims, hopefully if you model it yourself you will see what you are saying is wrong.</p>

<p>Maybe this will also help:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1) Im confused, I didnt think I was disagreeing with you, but you seem to be on the defensive... 2)?</p>

<p>3) Most of my stellar parallax post was quoted from <a href="http://www.scientus.org/Copernicus-Stellar-Parallax.html">here</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax#Early_theory_and_attempts">maybe here</a>, so you should practice some patience to have the reading comprehension needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stellar parallax is so small (as to be unobservable until the 19th century) that its apparent absence was used as a scientific argument against heliocentrism during the early modern age. It is clear from Euclid&#39;s geometry that the effect would be undetectable if the stars were far enough away, but for various reasons such gigantic distances involved seemed entirely implausible: it was one of Tycho Brahe&#39;s principal objections to Copernican heliocentrism that in order for it to be compatible with the lack of observable stellar parallax, there would have to be an enormous and unlikely void between the orbit of Saturn and the eighth sphere (the fixed stars).[5]</p>

<p>James Bradley first tried to measure stellar parallaxes in 1729. The stellar movement proved too insignificant for his telescope, but he instead discovered the aberration of light[6] and the nutation of Earth’s axis, and catalogued 3222 stars.</p>

<p>Regardless, proof of the earth&#39;s motion was not available in the seventeenth century and those arguing for it&#39;s motion had no answer for why stellar parallax could not be observed. It is a huge problem when a consequence of a theory is expected and it cannot be observed. It is enough to keep a hypothesis from being accepted as a proven theory, regardless of the number of positive arguments in its favor. This applies as much today as it did in the seventeeth century.</p>

<p>These scientists were correct that a moving earth required that there must be stellar parallax. They were also correct that this parallax could not be observed. However, their rejection of the hypothesis was based on more than this; it was also based on the assumption that the stars were millions of miles away. These stars were billions of miles away. Given the instrumentation of the day, one could expect to detect stellar parallax if the stars were millions of miles away but not if they were billions of miles away. </p>

<p>4) I dont have many long version videos of Solar Eclipses (talking about 3-4 hours long), but judging from double dozen of smaller eclipse videos, its either never visible or the cameras fail to record it due to brightness exposure.</p>

<p>The Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Airy&#39;s Failure and Sagnac experiments scientifically proved Geocentrism and nearly crushed the dying Heliocentric theory until Mr. Einstein came through with his Special Relativity mathematical denial of the proven Aether and philosophically (not scientifically) banished the Aether from study ever since. </p>

<p>These studies and peer reviewed experiments are never covered in any university courses. These conclusive peer-reviewed and repeated scientific results are nowhere debated or denied, merely suppressed and ignored. The fact of the matter is that Geocentrism has been conclusively proven for over a century.</p>

<p>In 1913 Sagnac conducted an experiment to test the speed and constancy of light and proved the existence of the Aether (Disproves relativity) Therefore, The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted using an interferometer clearly demonstrated that the Earth was motionless. The Michelson-Gale experiment detected the Aether/Firmament passing over the surface of the motionless Earth. Airy&#39;s Failure, demonstrated that it is the stars moving relative to a stationary Earth, and not the fast orbiting Earth moving relative to comparatively stationary stars. </p>

Generally speaking, Stockholm syndrome consists of &quot;strong emotional ties that develop between two persons where one person intermittently harasses, beats, threatens, abuses, or intimidates the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m actually sympathetic to FE, so you need not be hostile.  My comment is only my takeaway from my study of FE. Things like airplane flight (not having to account for Earth spinning below it, not having to dip it&#39;s nose to maintain altitude) are explained much easier on a flat plane. The Globe answers are very complex to get you to the same place. But Globers will use the complexity of their answers to try to make you feel uneducated.  Their model is simply much more complicated. </p>

<p>Nope, <a href="/u/JoBloggs1">/u/JoBloggs1</a> was unable to answer the following questions without posting misleading videos, then scurried away from the discussion.  Maybe you can try?</p>

<p>How do you explain the Sun rising east and going south -&gt; southwest in the Northern Hemisphere and rising east then going north - northwest in the Southern Hemisphere?</p>

<p>How do you explain the Belt of Venus?</p>

<p>How do you explain Lunar Eclipses?</p>

<p>How do you explain the fact that the Sun doesn&#39;t change in size over the course of the day if it disappears due to &quot;perspective&quot;?</p>

<p>How do you reconcile the fact that other planets and the Moon appear spherical, but the Earth isn&#39;t spherical?</p>

<p>How do you explain boats disappearing over the horizon from the bottom up when sailing away?</p>

 at your fourth question.  The moon definitely appears spherical, you can even see curved lines on it,  I don&#39;t know that that necessarily means we&#39;re also spherical.  Also it&#39;s curious we only ever see one side of it.  The boats over the horizon I believe is indeed perspective.  Even in the Globe model, I think the distance would be to great for a person watching a boat to mean anything one way or the other. </p>

<p>Take a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft. Park it in Akaka. Take off and fly to the Equator.  Hover without ever touching the ground.  See if the Earth actually rotates slower than the aircraft, causing it to drift noticeably even though it&#39;s hovering relatively stationary.  According to the Coriolis effect, it should.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, no, they wouldn&#39;t work.  Or hot air balloon.  You see,  the Coriolis effect supposedly happens because the Earth has more of a circumference at the Equator and gets shorter towards either pole.  So the land supposedly spins faster the higher the latitude.  The reason a hot air balloon will stay with the earth, according to the Globe model,  is because it retains the motion it experienced before taking off. The Coriols effect only happens when one traverses latitude while airborne</p>

<p>Your word salad trying to make the point by distorting reality doesn&#39;t make sense. You don&#39;t have to see our of both windows of the airplane at the same time. Looking at the horizon from one window is sufficient. There is still a horizon in sight BECAUSE THERE IS A HORIZON ALL AROUND THE AIRPLANE. THE EARTH IS A SPHERE.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/te9Nar5.jpg">For Example </a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s say that the guy in the picture is viewing the sphere he&#39;s looking at from about the same perspective as an airplane would be on Earth. Scale is of course different since the Earth is much larger. Don&#39;t you think that the curvature of the Earth could be seen from every direction?</p>
