       This came up in another thread &amp; I thought it'd make a fun post.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to a documentary linked below, Elvis faked his death in 1977 and lived the rest of his days as Elvis impersonator Johnny Harra. The theory goes like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       The first Elvis impersonator was Johnny Harra. He was Elvis' biological brother, given up for adoption soon after he was born. He and Elvis reunited in the 70's. By all accounts, people couldn't tell them apart. In fact, after Elvis' death, Johnny
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/MQamNuB.jpg">
        signed a $2 million deal
       </a>
       with (iirc) a Vegas casino to perform as Elvis, exactly because no one could tell the difference. Johnny died of cancer in 1977. Elvis chose to fake his death and live the rest of his life as Johnny. It's Johnny Harra who is buried at Graceland, not Elvis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Johnny Harra began performing as an Elvis impersonator in 1975, before Elvis died, no one suspected a thing. Elvis could finally walk around in public, as himself, and not be mobbed. He performed at many weddings &amp; other events as Johnny. The people had no idea he was the real deal. And Elvis loved every minute of it. Above all else, Elvis loved making people happy. Once, he came in third place in an Elvis look-alike contest. He died in 2011.

       Cool OP. Not seen any of this, just obviously know its a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       That Lisa Marie interview was a bit weird. Like Jemaine Jackson telling some radio he took his bro to the
       <del>
        hospital
       </del>
       airport after his death but quickly corrected himself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Isn't it also weird that 2 brothers sound exactly the same? Liam doesn't sound like Noel, Jackson's don't really sound like MJ. Got no other examples. Were they twins? Jonas Brothers! They don't sound the same do they?

       Your last note about brothers sounding the same is not weird.  My brother and I, although four years apart, look the same, sound the same, walk through same, have similar mannerisms, and are usually confused on the phone and at family reunions.  Our own parents and friends have mixed us up before in person.  So no, that isnt entirely unheard of

       Well not really relevant then is it?

       lol Sorry. Dont mean to be a dick, cant remember what movie I saw that in. Been waiting for the opportunity to set that up.

       Anyway, you know of any mother ever gave birth to two sons that both have the same unique amazing singing voice?
      </p>
      <p>
       Its never happened mate. No mother is that lucky. God always gives one brother the other brothers singing skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Saying this as a brother who was robbed. Its bullshit and its the main reason I dont like God.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah sure siblings can all sing but they cant all sing like Elvis or Mj that'd be silly.

       The three of them all had an amazing falsetto. I'm sure one could impersonate the other if they wanted to.

       If you watch Barry, when he was really young, he sounds so much like another Gibb - Andy.

       Andy, had Barry's voice, so similar (at that young age). As time went on, Barry's voice really matured. (look up a later version of the above song.)

       Yeah I have a 1st cousin and we lived together growing up, you can look at us and tell we're related but we don't look
       <em>
        that much
       </em>
       alike (at least I don't think so), but we sound nearly identical and even my mom can't tell us apart.
      </p>
      <p>
       So anyway, I'm away for school and one time I was on the phone with him and my mom called so I merged the calls and she was getting confused because he kept asking questions about a story she already told me in depth about something my grandma did that made her mad. I told her my cousin was on the line but she thought I hung up with him when she called and thought I was just saying random stuff. She was saying stuff like "I just told you all that I'm not repeating it" "did you not listen when I told you all this yesterday?" and he was like no you didn't and made a joke and we both laughed at the same time and then she was like wtf when did B get on the phone? My own mom can't tell us apart over the phone unless she really really listens or unless we somehow identify who is who. So I can believe this.

       My sister and I are the same. I don't think we look all that much alike, but it has happened like 20 times that random complete strangers think I'm her. I've had people run up and hug me and start talking to me and I have no idea what's going on, then I realize they think I'm her. I've started just playing it off and then I'll text her like "you ran into so-and-so today and..."

       OP Did you notice about 0.57 seconds in on the 1992 TV video. Johnny Harra is asked if he's ever mistaken for Elvis by press, paparazzi and what not.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says something like yeah this one time I was with one of my doctors. Then quickly changes to I was with one of Elvis' doctors. The interviews like Yeah that doctor was Elvis' so why you saying yours?

       I am a bit rusty on Elvis but didn't he steel all his material, then marry a 14 year old, then was a propaganda tool of military industrial complex and I'm sure he had run ins with aliens at some point . I was just glad for a change from Trump Clinton reposts tbh.

       We visited Graceland a couple years ago. While most of the estate is a tourist trap the upstairs is still off limits to the general public, and the family owns the property outright still hosting private Christmas dinner there annually. We were joking that it would be crazy if he was still alive if he was creeping around upstairs while people were visiting his house.

       There used to be an old man in Missouri who ran an “Elvis is Alive” museum. I got to visit once before he turned it into a mission for homeless men. This guy had collected a ton of artifacts and made a pretty decent case. Too bad it isn’t around anymore.

       This is bullshit. Everyone knows Elvis died on a hill near a nursing home somewhere in east Texas around 2002,but not before he rid the world of “some sort of Bubba ho-tep” threatening human existence. He was rumored to have a “growth on his pecker” that caused problems with his gyrations later in life.
