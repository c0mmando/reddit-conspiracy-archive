       At least in China or Russia you know the propaganda is coming from the state, party or leader. In America our minds are molded, our tastes are formed and our ideas suggested by men and groups we have never heard of before.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US government doesn't have to rely on conventional propaganda. The invisible government, which is the true ruling power of our country, can masquerade as independent media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it not possible to control and regiment the masses according to the will of the hidden hand without the people knowing about it?  The practice of modern propaganda has proven that is is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't be fooled. We are dominated by the relatively small number of persons who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind without you even knowing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is the conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. The engineering of consent is the very essence of the democratic process, the freedom to persuade and suggest. Propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state.
      </p>
      <p>
       So just remember, the next time you read an article from NYT, Washington post, Fox news, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, Time, USA Today, CBS etc. you are getting the cream of the crop in terms of propaganda.

       Edward Bernays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people, even in the "conspiracy" and "woke AF" circles, don't understand the specifics of how our society is run.  We know it is run by
       <em>
        someone.
       </em>
       Some have a pretty good idea of
       <em>
        who runs the show.
       </em>
       But vanishingly few understand the specifics of how it all works.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edward Bernays is key to understanding how our society is run.  He figured out how to use a free press to engineer the consent of a democratic society.  His work is what allowed fascism to bloom in America, not only successfully, but with the full and wholehearted support of the American people,

       And remember Bernay's 'Propaganda' was written in 1928. When the primary media tool was still print. The radio was still in it's infancy. The tools and methods to manipulate us are MUCH more sophisticated and pervasive today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Highly recommend 'Propaganda', it's a relatively short read and you can find it for free online.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they can use 'advertising' to influence people to buy a product, which they can and do, then they can use propaganda to manipulate us to believe in an idea or cause. At lease with advertising you know what they are trying to do. But much of the propaganda in the US is hidden within media. But it does seem it is getting more and more blatant, and more are recognizing it for what it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       One last point. In Propaganda Bernay's elaborates on how they could manipulate a target audience to buy a product without EVER mentioning the product. Specifically it was a campaign to sell pianos. And it was all done in print. And the campaign was successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       A better and more accurate phrase for propaganda is 'mind control'. For whatever (whomever) controls your mind controls you.

       All good points.  I cannot stress enough the importance of the fact that Edward Bernays did NOT require complicity by the media.  The press is always free to print whatever they want, free of any knowing influence.  Bernaysian propaganda works by engineering seemingly-spontaneous events which are then reported as factually spontaneous in order to influence public opinion (or get people to buy things).

       Yes 'Popular' mechanics, popular science. propaganda mags for corporations and government agencies. 'Popular' is a buzzword as it fools the dummies to think everybody likes it , so it's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Propaganda was first done through written word. Tv adds the audio and visual element ,and then you have hypnosis. Governments purpose is mind control. Democracy is a concept in the mind control scheme. It allows you to justify the participation in being controlled, when we are really just slaves stamped with the mark of the beast, a social security number. Actually, I think the whole point of propaganda is to convince you that you can't break free from government and you need to be controlled. You need a president to choose for you, a police state to protect you, and agencies to control what you are allowed to know.
      </p>
      <p>
       When in reality we don't, we only think we do , we think the world is chaos . But it is government making it that way.

       Konstantin Pobedesostev would agree. He lays out the way in which democracies are cleverly subverted in
       <em>
        The Manifesto of Unshakeable Autocracy
       </em>
       . It’s very interesting to read a guy critiquing democracy from the standpoint of autocratic system = best system.

       It has its pros and cons. In America, no one is likely coming to blackbag you in the middle of the night for saying something contrary to the party/state narrative.

       The US has had a great propaganda machine since WW2.
      </p>
      <p>
       However I think you are ignoring recent history and it is no longer accurate to say we are ‘far beyond’ ‘any other country’.
      </p>
      <p>
       You now have people in the US who, after being exposed to the sources you say are the most advanced, now say that sources like RT and Infowars are more truthful. This is despite the more obvious nature of those outlets as you mention.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also social media manipulation also demonstrates an advanced tactic by another country that by all accounts was more successful than any domestically state run attempt.
      </p>
      <p>
       So while the US had a dominant position in the old media you cite other players appear to have evolved faster in the new media world.

       When you're the first player to get so high up on the tech tree others will make their gains to catch up easier because the techniques and technology have already been researched and implemented.

       Russia used America’s own social media infrastructure against it. This is an advanced propaganda technique in the asymmetrical battleground for the mind of the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you view it as just another realm of warfare, it would be like hijacking an advanced military system and turning it against its own side. This point is even more salient if you believe social media and mainstream media are tools of US propaganda because they were themselves hijacked in some cases.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given the actual recent results, I think you would have to grant the current superiority of propaganda that is not our own.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note things are moving quickly now and the effects of social manipulation plays out over years, what is going on now may be more obvious down the road.

       Hitler praised American and British WWI wartime propaganda in chapter 6 of
       <em>
        Mein Kampf
       </em>
       :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        On the other hand, British and American war propaganda was psychologically efficient. By picturing the Germans to their own people as Barbarians and Huns, they were preparing their soldiers for the horrors of war and safeguarding them against illusions. The most terrific weapons which those soldiers encountered in the field merely confirmed the information that they had already received and their belief in the truth of the assertions made by their respective governments was accordingly reinforced. Thus their rage and hatred against the infamous foe was increased. The terrible havoc caused by the German weapons of war was only another illustration of the Hunnish brutality of those barbarians; whereas on the side of the Entente no time was left the soldiers to meditate on the similar havoc which their own weapons were capable of. Thus the British soldier was never allowed to feel that the information which he received at home was untrue. Unfortunately the opposite was the case with the Germans, who finally wound up by rejecting everything from home as pure swindle and humbug. This result was made possible because at home they thought that the work of propaganda could be entrusted to the first ass that came along, braying of his own special talents, and they had no conception of the fact that propaganda demands the most skilled brains that can be found.

       <p>
        CHAPTER I
ORGANIZING CHAOS
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       &gt;THE conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. 
      We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. 
      Our invisible governors are, in many cases, unaware of the identity of their fellow members in the inner cabinet. 
      They govern us by their qualities of natural leadership, their ability to supply needed ideas and by their key position in the social structure. Whatever attitude one chooses to take toward this condition, it remains a fact that in almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons—a trifling fraction of our hundred and twenty million—who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind, who harness old social forces and contrive new ways to bind and guide the world.

       The Noam Chomsky quote (for people who don't/can't click links)
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        [The] American business community was also very impressed with the propaganda effort. They had a problem at that time. The country was becoming formally more democratic. A lot more people were able to vote and that sort of thing. The country was becoming wealthier and more people could participate and a lot of new immigrants were coming in, and so on.
       </p>
       <p>
        So what do you do? It's going to be harder to run things as a private club. Therefore, obviously, you have to control what people think. There had been public relation specialists but there was never a public relations industry. There was a guy hired to make Rockefeller's image look prettier and that sort of thing. But this huge public relations industry, which is a U.S. invention and a monstrous industry, came out of the first World War. The leading figures were people in the Creel Commission. In fact, the main one, Edward Bernays, comes right out of the Creel Commission. He has a book that came out right afterwards called Propaganda. The term "propaganda," incidentally, did not have negative connotations in those days. It was during the second World War that the term became taboo because it was connected with Germany, and all those bad things. But in this period, the term propaganda just meant information or something like that. So he wrote a book called Propaganda around 1925, and it starts off by saying he is applying the lessons of the first World War. The propaganda system of the first World War and this commission that he was part of showed, he says, it is possible to "regiment the public mind every bit as much as an army regiments their bodies." These new techniques of regimentation of minds, he said, had to be used by the intelligent minorities in order to make sure that the slobs stay on the right course. We can do it now because we have these new techniques.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the main manual of the public relations industry. Bernays is kind of the guru. He was an authentic Roosevelt/Kennedy liberal. He also engineered the public relations effort behind the U.S.-backed coup which overthrew the democratic government of Guatemala.
       </p>
       <p>
        His major coup, the one that really propelled him into fame in the late 1920s, was getting women to smoke. Women didn't smoke in those days and he ran huge campaigns for Chesterfield. You know all the techniques—models and movie stars with cigarettes coming out of their mouths and that kind of thing. He got enormous praise for that. So he became a leading figure of the industry, and his book was the real manual.

       The trick is that only about 5% (a small amount) of the shit they spew is true propaganda, lies and persuasion.

        So just remember, the next time you read an article from NYT, Washington Post....you are getting the cream of the crop in terms of propaganda.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So right, the Washington Post is a CIA rag, and has been since at least the late 1950s when Phil Graham bought the paper with his wife Katharine Graham's money.  Folks can read Deborah Davis' book from the 1980s about this called "Katharine The Great: Katharine Graham and the Washington Post Empire" -- be sure to pick up the 2nd or 3rd edition, not the 1st.
      </p>
      <p>
       Libertarian Lew Rockwell calls the Washington Post the "house organ of the CIA," and it's been like that since at least the 1950s on through Executive Editor Benjamin Bradlee's reign and up to today.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Post is just one example.  The CIA's tentacles are so thoroughly wrapped around all "mainstream" media that it should be called the CIAstream Media.  See journalist Carl Bernstein's highly regarded article about this called "The CIA and the Media":

        But the Post is just one example. The CIA's tentacles are so thoroughly wrapped around all "mainstream" media that it should be called the CIAstream Media. See journalist Carl Bernstein's highly regarded article about this called "The CIA and the Media":
        <a href="http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php">
         http://www.carlbernstein.com/magazine_cia_and_media.php

        Carl Bernstein (of "Woodward and Bernstein" fame) worked for the Washington Post in the 1970s.

       and that's just where the wilderness of mirrors begins:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The CIA has been unable to determine whether Bob Woodward
was employed by tbe Agency. The Agency claims to be having
difficulty checking personnel files. Thompson says that he
believes the delay merely means that they don't want to admit
that Woodward was in the Agency. Thompson wrote a lengthy memo to Baker last week complaining about the Cla's non-cooperation, the fact that they were supplying material piecemeal and had been very uncooperative. The memo went into the CIA relationship with the press, specifically Woodward. Senator Baker sent the memo directly to Colby with a cover note and within a matter of a few hours, Woodward called Baker and was incensed over the memo. It had been immediately leaked to him.

       “click-bait” articles and misleading headlines are no accident.  they know the perfect balance of lies to dish out and how much time the average person devotes to researching a story.  they aren’t concerned about the intelligent consumer because they are outliers.  they’re only concerned with molding the minds of those that don’t care enough to read into anything

       Good post. I much prefer thoughts of this sub's users in text posts than the left and right spam of article links and videos with clickbait titles that most users skip anyway and jump straight to comments with strong preconceptions. Of course, since the former takes more effort to write and people would actually have to read the post to be able to comment, these kind of posts, sometimes with original thoughts, are usually ignored and do not see the light of "hot" section.
      </p>

       Back to the subject, I'm going to contradict what I've said above, and as some others have already mentioned Bernays in the thread, leave a link for a popular documentary on mass propaganda by Adam Curtis:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ3RzGoQC4s">
        The Century of the Self
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       One other of his later work that had more focus on politics with some elements of propaganda is
       <em>
        the Power of the Nightmares
       </em>
       .

       I think I'll add a disclaimer to my post because I'm not trying to plagiarize or steal karma away from bernay or make myself sound smart. I just wanted to use the extremely brilliant wording of bernay without directly quoting him.

       Advertising and marketing is propaganda. Verizon vs AT&amp;T, Apple vs Microsoft, Ford vs GM. They all use marketing tactics to bolster their brand and discredit Another. We saw how far these manipulation strategies can go with what we've learned about big tobacco. With all the tech and data today, one can only assume the manipulation has advanced exponentially. Advertising and marketing make up the fabric of our consumer driven economy-- a form of propaganda is and has always been a part of our lives.
