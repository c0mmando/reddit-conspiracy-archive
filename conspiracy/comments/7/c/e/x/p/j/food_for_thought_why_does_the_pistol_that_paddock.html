       Hi guys.  It's 5:30am on a Sunday and I'm bored.  Lol.  Was looking at Paddocks suicide picture and something doesn't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the picture above.  Notice how there's blood on the pistol?  That means that most likely, the pistol was laying in that pool under his head, soaking it up.  Most likely, as is standard practice, when law enforcement first encounters a scene like this, the officer would have kicked the gun away from the suspect just in case he's still alive, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Ok, so 2 questions for ya:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the gun was kicked away, why is the path of the blood trail curved?  Unless the kicker put an "english" on the gun (lulz), why would it travel in a curve?
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         If the gun was kicked away, why are there no blood footprints anywhere near the blood pool?  Are they saying that the person who kicked the pistol away had such an accurate kick that not one drop of blood splashed on his sole and left even a partial print?
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Highly unlikely!  Which leads me to believe the following:  Someone took the pistol, soaked it in the blood, then picked it up and moved it away from his body, staging the narrative for the scene.  An error was made because instead of taking a straight line to the destination, he kinda changed his mind half way and put it more above Paddocks head thereby inadvertently causing a curve to form.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do we have any Detective Conans here?   Can you solve the case of the Banana Kick Pistol?
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.  Also, look how close the gun is to his head.  What is that?  Like 2 1/2 feet?  If Paddock was still alive, it is within reaching distance.  Who kicks a gun away just 2 1/2 feet?  Blah, I dunno.  I'm going to the gym.  See ya later.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.S.  The blood trail is MUCH TOO NARROW, for it to have been kicked.  A kick would have much force and the blood trail would be significantly wider.  Only conclusion I can think of is that someone picked up the gun and carefully moved it above his head, dripping the blood along the way.

       A kick may have made the gun tumble, not slide. That could cause it to go on a curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       It may have been near his hand. Then kicked through the fresh puddle of blood.

       Guns - metal - doesn't soak up anything. It's metal.

       Nope.  That's a revolver.  The bullet chambers would have been filled up with the blood.  The barrel would be filled with blood.  Maybe soaked wasn't the best description, but you get what I mean.

       Look at the pic.  The blood trail confirms that the gun was soaked.  Also, the blood pool under his head is very deep.  How else do can you explain the trail of blood from his head to the final resting spot of the pistol?

       I haven't seen any statements in this thread causing me to question reality, with the exception of your inexplicable hostility towards another user over a simple question. Why did the conversation escalate from you calmly explaining things as if you have all the answers to the point where you're now responding in a condescending tone? Why was this comment of yours warranted?

       The evidence for it NOT being kicked from his body - the drip marks indicate it was in the air moving over the carpet .
      </p>
      <p>
       It's entirely possible that 1000 rounds with a bump stock in a 64 year old unfit man's shoulder blew it out and left him in pain and unable to continue firing, hence the weird slow down of firerate in the last volley then the 2 shots
      </p>

       This would explain why he never put up a fight against Swat team/breach team

        The gun trail is curved because whoever kicked it stood on the left side of paddocked and scooted the gun with their left foot. If you did this yourself you would see the way your leg would curve.

       Instead of just attacking me, take a close look at the picture.  Do you see how the trail lead directly from the blood pool under his head to the pistol?  That means the pistol was resting in the blood when the police barged in.  Now, why would anyone move the pistol at all?  Only one reason, you can't take the risk that the suspect is still alive, so you move it out of his reach.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, which scenario is more likely?  An officer approaching the subject and kicking the pistol away a good distance?  Or the scenario, where the office approaches, carefully picks up the pistol, not to disturb the blood pool in anyway, and places it just 2 1/2 feet north of where it originally lay?  2 1/2 feet?  Is that a safe distance to move a weapon?

       I didn't attack you. A cop kicks away a gun from a mas murder suspect?  Whaaaaaat that's crazy huh?  Youre way overthinking this trying to be like Columbo. Its 100% sense the cop came in and used his foot to scoot the gun away. It also totally explains your mysterious curve theory.

       So, you're a cop.  Your team bashes through the door and there lies a man who just killed 58 people and injured almost 500.  And there's a gun right by his head.  You don't know for sure if he's really dead or not.  It could just be a trick to get you close, so that he can kill you.  Are you just gonna stroll up to him, carefully pick up the pistol and place it just 2 feet away from where it originally was?  How does that make any sense to you?

Yes 100% a cop with many other cops pointing their guns at the body would definitely walk over and carefully SCOOT THE GUN WITH HIS FOOT.

       Look at the blood trail.  It's not move a little, move a little, move a little pattern, as you would expect from you schoot the gun with his foot theory.  It's a consistent drip of evenly spaced drops which can only mean that the gun traveled through the air at a consistent speed.

       Why would they even say that?  Im not so sure they ever got that specific about anything. From what I've seen/know it would be standard procedure to move the gun from a body/suspect.

       Well first, it's definitely not out of his hands.  Look at the trail.  It starts at the blood pool under his head and ends at the current location of the pistol.  Which even by itself, doesn't really fit the police narrative.  If a person shot himself, why would the gun be neatly lying  next to his head in a pool of blood?  Wouldn't you expect the gun to be near his hand, or, if went to a convulsion, be somewhere a little further than 4 inches from his head?

       It couldve ended up there randomly. Maybe he was sitting down when he shot himself. Who really knows. But I do find it interesting that the gun on the bipod above his foot isnt knocked over. When a gun is sitting on a bipod like that they fall over pretty easily.

       If the gun were kicked off his chest as claimed then the blood spots leading to the pistol would be angled and sprayed out in all directions . The blood drops should be tear-drop shapes at the very least, flying off the gun as it flew through the air... instead we have a single neat trail of circular drips.

       Exactly.  The blood trail is extremely neat and orderly.  Someone picked up that gun, and purposely moved it just 2 feet above the puddle it was laying in.   It wasn't kicked away.   Why?

       I haven't seen any statements in this thread causing me to question reality, with the exception of your inexplicable hostility towards another user over a simple question. Why did the conversation escalate from you calmly explaining things as if you have all the answers to the point where you're now responding in a condescending tone? Why was this comment of yours warranted?

       Your right about that, but they certainly do change the impact on your shoulder from 'as fast as you can pull the trigger -to- that insane rate of fire we hear at the concert
