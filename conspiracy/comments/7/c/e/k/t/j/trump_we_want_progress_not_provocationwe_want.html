Half the US in is in poverty, 30% more people on foodstamps at the end of Obama&#39;s term, and so many of the brave soldiers not given the care that is needed and are living on the streets that fought for your freedoms. </p>

<p>AND WE STILL AS HUMANKIND NOT SOLVED GLOBAL HUNGER IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES. STILL!!!</p>

<p>Please see your thinking is kidlike, transgender bathrooms DO NOT MATTER, one scoop or two scoops of ice cream DOES NOT MATTER, whether Melania wear heels or not DOES NOT MATTER.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t vote for Trump but from what I can see, you&#39;ve never gave him a chance to do what he said he needs to do. Knock it off. Sick of hearing BS for the whole year. </p>

But I digress. Did you ignore the nuclear threats from Trump? He has literally said over and over again he doesn&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t use the nuclear option more often, and just today he called kim short and fat. The man is not a leader, he&#39;s put anti science anti climate change people in charge. The head of the EPA is the same fucking dude who said he would cut it during his presidential run.

    <div class="md"><p>King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud has arrested people like this in the past, although never to this scale, the guy is literally rounding up any opposition to him or his son the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.

    <div class="md"><p>Only as much as his own psychotic Twitter rantings. Seriously, the only thing preventing him from passing his idiotic &#39;policies&#39; (a term I use loosely) is a robust system of checks and balances preventing him from enacting laws that the majority of his own constituents don&#39;t agree with. That&#39;s basically the point of our entire Constitution. If you don&#39;t like it get out and form the Trump dictatorship you want so bad. If he want to enact real change he should try to come up with a plan people actually agree with. That&#39;ll be tough since he&#39;s so deep in the pockets of he benefactors. He&#39;ll just keep playing the part of the helpless baby who &quot;can&#39;t get anything done because of the mean ol&#39; Democrats but also the republicans.&quot; Maybe if nobody likes his policies then they shouldn&#39;t become law? Just a thought. The only positive thing this presidency has done is shown me that our system of checks and balances is more effective than I thought. Thank God.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Id say the media reporting on his terrible behavior definitely prevented him from enacting policies, thank god. And I think that&#39;s the point. Unfortunately for Donald Trump his own behavior is constantly on display for all to see. Forget the MSM, he himself posts rude, sexist, racist, provocative tweets everyday. You seem to think we should let him do whatever he wants, listen to whatever he says and just wait and see what happens. That&#39;s not how any of this works. Nobody likes his ideas, not even his own party and especially not the average American. Again, he&#39;s not a dictator. Hes a civil servant hired to work closely with other representatives for the good of the American people. He clearly has no idea how to compromise or work with others. Now here&#39;s a question for you: Despite the fact that he called Kim &quot;short and fat&quot;, insults veterans and their families, calls Mexicans rapists, and considers the KKK and people protesting the KKK the same, why do you believe him when he claims to want peace instead of provocation? Doesn&#39;t his actual behavior mean otherwise? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, obviously not everyone because he won the election. It was only recently his approval rating dropped below 40% so he definitely had support going in. High profile republicans like Paul Ryan and John McCain and Chris Christy endorsed him until he crossed some line (McCain withdrew support when the &#39;grab em by the pussy&#39; tape was released). Personally, I think his proposals border on useless/stupid to outright dangerous. I, like almost every other American conservatives included, think it&#39;s idiotic to repeal Obamacare without some kind of replacement, which is what Trump proposes. I hope the congressmen I voted for will represent the interests of the American people instead of the interests of Donald Trump by voting against repealing the ACA, which they have. Same with building a multi-billion dollar wall along the southern border or banning Muslims from entering the US. If he ever proposed anything that aligned with my interests, like when he signed the EO withdrawing the US from the TTP, I&#39;d be more supportive. But it&#39;s hard to tell where his interests lie because he contradicts himself so often. That&#39;s how the presidency works. Obligatory: you didn&#39;t answer my question.</p>

Which part of that don&#39;t you agree with? Just two days ago he posted a tweet calling Kim &quot;short and fat&quot;. Do you not consider that provocative? Even of everyone is against him, surely insulting world leaders every day on social media isn&#39;t helping. You don&#39;t have to agree with my assessment to answer that. Why do you believe anything he says when he so often does the opposite of what he says he will. In September he backed a deal pushed by Democrats to raise the debt ceiling despite &#39;promising&#39; he wouldn&#39;t do that. He didn&#39;t negotiate. He didn&#39;t offer a compromise. He just agreed to everything the Dems wanted. This, obviously, pissed off his own voter base and the Republicans who had been negotiating the deal and alienated him like crazy. That&#39;s not the MSMs fault for reporting it or the GOPs fault for not trusting him anymore. Its Trump&#39;s fault for deliberately fucking over and lying to his own constituents. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do agree, he won&#39;t ever accomplish anything because he&#39;s completely alienated the people who he NEEDS to accomplish those things. That&#39;s part of what makes him so incompetent is his inability to play nice with others. He&#39;s alienated his supporters by deceiving them on multiple occasions so I really don&#39;t blame his former supporters for hating him now. Technically he can&#39;t get anything done because everyone is now against him. But it&#39;s not that black and white. Everyone is against him because he&#39;s demonstrated that he&#39;s corrupt and can&#39;t be trusted to follow through on his promises. Personally, I think that&#39;s a great reason to fight against someone. If Hillary had been elected wouldn&#39;t you want your representatives to prevent here from enacting corrupt policies, even if it meant she got nothing done for a year? Im using the same talking point because you keep avoiding the question.(why do you believe him when he says he wants peace, not provocation when he constantly provokes opponents on social media. Just answer me that question. That&#39;s all I&#39;m asking. Don&#39;t his actions speak louder than words?) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What about the things he tweets himself? In another comment you say he tweets because the media is full of fake news. But his own tweets alienated people. If I didn&#39;t pay attention to the news and only to what he tweets I&#39;d have the same opinion of him. For fucks sake, he tweeted that McCain was a loser for being a POW. That&#39;s more than enough for any self respecting veteren to never support him again. Are you claiming the only reason everyone is against him is because the MSM reports fake news? Just watch one of his speeches unedited. Either during the campaign or during the presidency you&#39;ll see he calls women ugly, Mexicans rapists, and blames Puerto Rico for the hurricane they suffered. How is that progress? You don&#39;t need to watch the news or like Hillary or give a fuck about Russia to know Trump&#39;s a liar and corrupt. All you need to do is read his tweets and watch his speeches. He&#39;s a moron. He can&#39;t talk about the same topic for more than 5 seconds.</p>

Lol dude, he&#39;s not some psychic writing horoscopes. He&#39;s president of the United States and he&#39;s speaking in plain English. This isn&#39;t some art appreciation class. How many ways are their to interpret tweets like </p>

<p>&quot;How can a dummy dope like Harry Hurt, who wrote a failed book about me but doesn’t know me or anything about me, be on TV discussing Trump?&quot;</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Lightweight Senator @RandPaul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him.&quot;</p>

<p>Or</p>

<p>&quot;Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!&quot;</p>

<p>But you&#39;re right. Those aren&#39;t really provocative. That&#39;s just how I&#39;m &#39;interpreting&#39; them lol I&#39;m sure you see a mature, coherent policy discussion in all those tweets.</p>
