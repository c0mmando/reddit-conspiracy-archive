       Ummm so for the whole year, all I've been hearing is Trump is a danger to the entire world from a "certain" side of the political divide.
       <strong>
        So can you please acknowledge you are wrong now?
       </strong>
       Because you are wasting everyone's time with your nonsense. Half the US in is in poverty, 30% more people on foodstamps at the end of Obama's term, and so many of the brave soldiers not given the care that is needed and are living on the streets that fought for your freedoms.
      </p>
      <p>
       AND WE STILL AS HUMANKIND NOT SOLVED GLOBAL HUNGER IN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES. STILL!!!
      </p>
      <p>
       Please see your thinking is kidlike, transgender bathrooms DO NOT MATTER, one scoop or two scoops of ice cream DOES NOT MATTER, whether Melania wear heels or not DOES NOT MATTER.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't vote for Trump but from what I can see, you've never gave him a chance to do what he said he needs to do. Knock it off. Sick of hearing BS for the whole year.

       Jesus for someone on conspiracy you do not do much research or critical thinking. Food stamp percentages are irrelevant when you still qualify for them even when working full time at the minimum wage. Only so many people can move up, everyone else is going to be stuck on entitlements even tho they work all week. Until we push automation, then half of the lower class is on entitlements. But I digress. Did you ignore the nuclear threats from Trump? He has literally said over and over again he doesn't understand why we don't use the nuclear option more often, and just today he called kim short and fat. The man is not a leader, he's put anti science anti climate change people in charge. The head of the EPA is the same fucking dude who said he would cut it during his presidential run. Either you're a russian shill or you haven't had your eyes open.

Either you're a russian shill or you haven't had your eyes open. He is cutting Medicaid subsidies, gutting education, and his republican buddies are pushing to never raise the min wage. The masses will be sick, dumb, and poor and ripe for the exact sort of fucked up dystopia most of this sub is trying to circumvent

       Okay so then i'll ask, if trump is soooo against provocation and is all about pease then why has he made multi-billion dollar weapons deals with Saudi Arabia? And why has he okay'd more troops to go to the middle east? And why has he made so many public comments about the possibility of using nukes? Plus he literally told police to rough up suspects that they were taking into custody.

       The arrests of the princes were already in the works long before donald dump visited or was probably even President. The arm's were for the continued supply of oil. Its seriously not any more complicated than that. But go ahead and avoid answering like you always do.

       King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud has arrested people like this in the past, although never to this scale, the guy is literally rounding up any opposition to him or his son the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. I understand that a stable SA is good for oil relations but giving that country Billions in arms so they can do some in house cleaning that will ultimately just benifit themselves doesn't seem like a great deal for America.

       And even if this was the case it all leads back to America wanting their oil.

       Yes, dude. You're swallowing the narrative that Trump tweets for "free agency", when his administration has tried to get him to stop, when it is OBVIOUSLY a distraction technique and when his tweets are mental fodder anyway.

       Donald Trump works with a republican majority house and Senate and hasn't done anything he's promised in over a year (although he regularly contradicts himself so 'promise' probably isn't the right word). I don't care if he says he hates provocation every day for the rest of his presidency, his actions speak much louder. Literally yesterday he underhandedly called Kim Jong Un "short and fat" yet he doesn't wants "progress, not provocation". If you believe that I've got a condo to sell you. But he was right during his campaign. He could shoot someone in the middle of fifth avenue and you'd still beg for his cum.

       I have nothing to do with him not enacting his policies. That's because he's incompetent. His own party controls every branch of our government. Why, besides his inability to be an effective legislature, is he unable to enact his stupid policies?

       Only as much as his own psychotic Twitter rantings. Seriously, the only thing preventing him from passing his idiotic 'policies' (a term I use loosely) is a robust system of checks and balances preventing him from enacting laws that the majority of his own constituents don't agree with. That's basically the point of our entire Constitution. If you don't like it get out and form the Trump dictatorship you want so bad. If he want to enact real change he should try to come up with a plan people actually agree with. That'll be tough since he's so deep in the pockets of he benefactors. He'll just keep playing the part of the helpless baby who "can't get anything done because of the mean ol' Democrats but also the republicans." Maybe if nobody likes his policies then they shouldn't become law? Just a thought. The only positive thing this presidency has done is shown me that our system of checks and balances is more effective than I thought. Thank God.

       Id say the media reporting on his terrible behavior definitely prevented him from enacting policies, thank god. And I think that's the point. Unfortunately for Donald Trump his own behavior is constantly on display for all to see. Forget the MSM, he himself posts rude, sexist, racist, provocative tweets everyday. You seem to think we should let him do whatever he wants, listen to whatever he says and just wait and see what happens. That's not how any of this works. Nobody likes his ideas, not even his own party and especially not the average American. Again, he's not a dictator. Hes a civil servant hired to work closely with other representatives for the good of the American people. He clearly has no idea how to compromise or work with others. Now here's a question for you: Despite the fact that he called Kim "short and fat", insults veterans and their families, calls Mexicans rapists, and considers the KKK and people protesting the KKK the same, why do you believe him when he claims to want peace instead of provocation? Doesn't his actual behavior mean otherwise?

       Well, obviously not everyone because he won the election. It was only recently his approval rating dropped below 40% so he definitely had support going in. High profile republicans like Paul Ryan and John McCain and Chris Christy endorsed him until he crossed some line (McCain withdrew support when the 'grab em by the pussy' tape was released). Personally, I think his proposals border on useless/stupid to outright dangerous. I, like almost every other American conservatives included, think it's idiotic to repeal Obamacare without some kind of replacement, which is what Trump proposes. I hope the congressmen I voted for will represent the interests of the American people instead of the interests of Donald Trump by voting against repealing the ACA, which they have. Same with building a multi-billion dollar wall along the southern border or banning Muslims from entering the US. If he ever proposed anything that aligned with my interests, like when he signed the EO withdrawing the US from the TTP, I'd be more supportive. But it's hard to tell where his interests lie because he contradicts himself so often. That's how the presidency works. Obligatory: you didn't answer my question.

       Lol keep blaming Hillary no matter how irrelevent she is. don't expect you to respond to this since it seems like you're out of sound bites to use, but you still didn't answer my question. Also, if you're so upset that the president has to work WITH other representatives in order to pass legislation, move to the Philippines or Turkey where the president has complete power. You won't even have to worry about those pesky Democrats or republicans voting them out of office since theyre president for life!

       Weird... That's not an answer to my question.... It's almost like... You're deflecting because you don't have an answer? No couldn't be... You clearly know so much more than me... So why wouldn't you answer the question?

       The point being I will not answer because I disagree with your assessment. Your statement says that he is incompetent, I said EVERYONE was against him so he cannot solve the problem. And remember it has only been one year.

       My question is why do you believe him when he says he wants peace, not provocation even though he tweets and says provocative things? Which part of that don't you agree with? Just two days ago he posted a tweet calling Kim "short and fat". Do you not consider that provocative? Even of everyone is against him, surely insulting world leaders every day on social media isn't helping. You don't have to agree with my assessment to answer that. Why do you believe anything he says when he so often does the opposite of what he says he will. In September he backed a deal pushed by Democrats to raise the debt ceiling despite 'promising' he wouldn't do that. He didn't negotiate. He didn't offer a compromise. He just agreed to everything the Dems wanted. This, obviously, pissed off his own voter base and the Republicans who had been negotiating the deal and alienated him like crazy. That's not the MSMs fault for reporting it or the GOPs fault for not trusting him anymore. Its Trump's fault for deliberately fucking over and lying to his own constituents.

       I do agree, he won't ever accomplish anything because he's completely alienated the people who he NEEDS to accomplish those things. That's part of what makes him so incompetent is his inability to play nice with others. He's alienated his supporters by deceiving them on multiple occasions so I really don't blame his former supporters for hating him now. Technically he can't get anything done because everyone is now against him. But it's not that black and white. Everyone is against him because he's demonstrated that he's corrupt and can't be trusted to follow through on his promises. Personally, I think that's a great reason to fight against someone. If Hillary had been elected wouldn't you want your representatives to prevent here from enacting corrupt policies, even if it meant she got nothing done for a year? Im using the same talking point because you keep avoiding the question.(why do you believe him when he says he wants peace, not provocation when he constantly provokes opponents on social media. Just answer me that question. That's all I'm asking. Don't his actions speak louder than words?)

       What about the things he tweets himself? In another comment you say he tweets because the media is full of fake news. But his own tweets alienated people. If I didn't pay attention to the news and only to what he tweets I'd have the same opinion of him. For fucks sake, he tweeted that McCain was a loser for being a POW. That's more than enough for any self respecting veteren to never support him again. Are you claiming the only reason everyone is against him is because the MSM reports fake news? Just watch one of his speeches unedited. Either during the campaign or during the presidency you'll see he calls women ugly, Mexicans rapists, and blames Puerto Rico for the hurricane they suffered. How is that progress? You don't need to watch the news or like Hillary or give a fuck about Russia to know Trump's a liar and corrupt. All you need to do is read his tweets and watch his speeches. He's a moron. He can't talk about the same topic for more than 5 seconds.

Lol dude, he's not some psychic writing horoscopes. He's president of the United States and he's speaking in plain English. This isn't some art appreciation class. How many ways are their to interpret tweets like

       ""Lightweight Senator @RandPaul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him."
      </p>
      <p>
       Or
      </p>
      <p>
       "Truly weird Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky reminds me of a spoiled brat without a properly functioning brain. He was terrible at DEBATE!"
      </p>

       But you're right. Those aren't really provocative. That's just how I'm 'interpreting' them lol I'm sure you see a mature, coherent policy discussion in all those tweets.

       Trump is POTUS. Like his tweeting or not,, that is your problem. My advice? When he tweets, read it objectively, like an adult, from his perceptive, think not feel the problem, that's the problem with your side. Don't think at all.

       “Ariana Huffington is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man – he made a good decision.”

       I give a fuck. I'm genuinely curious as to how you interpret those tweets. I know he's president. I'm not crying. I'm just curious. Do you have an interpretation or do you just support him blindly? I've asked at least three specific questions and you couldn't answer even one of them. Maybe you just want to call me names and shit, but I'm genuinely interested in what you really think. If you really have no interpretation of what he says then just admit it and I'll try to find someone who's willing to explain it to me.

       Does NOT MEAN everyone agrees with your INTERPRETATION mister high and mighty. Because you see them as NEGATIVE, his side DOES NOT and many with a brain does not. Do you get it????

       I don't. How could you possibly interpret those tweets as anything but inflammatory? What could he possibly mean when he calls someone a dope or unattractive that you consider positive?

       Obviously not all of them are. But if SOME of them are racist, sexist, and inflammatory then that's the problem. I'm sick of you people acting will fully blind to his actions. If Obama or Hillary posted ONE tweet like the ones I posted you people would have a shit fit. But he does it every day and he gets a pass because I'm just "making a big deal out of nothing". Hypocrites.

       So already you admit it was SOME. Now if it is some, then YOU interpret them as racist, sexist, and inflammatory.

       I don't think they're funny, but that is definitely up for interpretation. But hes the one who said "we want progress, not provocation'" and he's the one who tweeter 2 days ago "Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me "old," when I would NEVER call him "short and fat?" Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!" He's a hypocrite. That's not really up for interpretation. And that's just one, small, insignificant example compared to the millions of other times he's been a hypocrite. Just because he says he wants peace and progress, etc... Doesn't mean I'm just gonna believe him. Let's see some action

       I interpretted it as funny. But because you have hate in your heart, you see it differently. Sorry, you are in the minority.

       Already he dined in the Forbidden Palace, in Chinese culture, that is a BIG DEAL. Then you saw him with with Putin in recent meetings. All happy and smiling together.

       So America can keep getting oil from SA, and SA gets supplies for the continued bombing of Yemenis civilians. Simple as that.

       The arrests of the princes were already in the works long before donald dump visited or was probably even President. The arm's were for the continued supply of oil. Its seriously not any more complicated than that. But go ahead and avoid answering like you always do.
