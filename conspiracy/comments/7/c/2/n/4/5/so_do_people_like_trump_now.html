       On a lot of posts I've seen an increasing amount of people speaking about Trump in a positive light. Like the declassification of the JFK documents and now his comments about Scientology. 
Are people starting to warm to him now as he seems to be more transparent than past Presidents and wants to tackle issues that others haven't touched.

       I'm a Brit by the way so not too sure of all the ratings systems etc. that a President faces

       I've seen quite a lot of rape apologists over the last couple of days. Oh and you might want to consider every pizzagate article comment section ever. this would, dumb as it is, probably not even make my top 500. Hell, just a few days ago, I heard someone say Sarah Sanders Huckabee was a clinton plant, with the reason to smear Bernie Sanders' name.

       it's completely true, he talks on twitter and speaks his real mind, not normal political commentary. Also if AF1 really is behind q-anon there's another reason he's not transparent, he's helping us.

       two questions- why do we believe the first pic is from q anon? and if q anon is the WH director of social media, that would make q anon firmly in the territory of "shameless propaganda", no?

       Even if you don't believe the first pic was from Q-Anon (it was posted by his ID in his thread), the location does match up identically with the time frame of the flight of AF1 and the location of the picture that was taken. I think personally it's from AF1, but who knows who it is. Also Q-Anon has probably been multiple people, so it's important that we first distinguish what THIS Q-Anon(the important one obviously) has had to say in the past, or will have to say in the future. Do you not agree with that?

       Again, maybe different Q-Anon. It's hard to discern what's what though and maybe it's best we require pics like this on all future Q-Anon threads.

       we dont care about what he says, but what he does. hes the first president to not release his tax returns. hes removed visitor logs to the white house. his admin has repeatedly been caught not disclosing connections and investments.

       I understand that, but reading through this sub, it seems like more and more people are actually starting to talk positively about Trump rather than bashing him at every turn. I just wanted to know if people think he's actually getting this shit done of his own accord or is he just being given credit for the likes of the JFK files to garner support for his Presidency.

       We are free thinking, but you will inevitably get some noise circulating in the results that don't come from the real user base. In my opinion Trump has been supported by the majority of the country all along but network media and social media create a different picture.

       I support Trump. Fuck the haters. And if they are the majority, then fuck the majority. The majority opinion is the reason why people like Kim Kardashian gets tv deals and why idiots like Justin Beiber are mainstream music icons by time they’re 21.

       This same majority are the same fucking morons who didn’t want to talk politics 2 to 20 years ago because it was “boring”.

       I think it's mostly being orchestrated to make him appear as a victim to the right and as a Russian agent, when really and truly, he's neither, in order to shield him from actual criticism for basically doing the exact kind of shady stuff that Obama, Bush, and Clinton did.
      </p>
      <p>
       We're still bombing Secular Shi'a for Fascist Sunni rapist royals. We're still pouring money into the Israel time-bomb. We are still waiting for justice against the elites of the world who have betrayed us.
      </p>
      <p>
       His corrupt ties aren't to Russia, though. The left would realize that if they actually examined Hillary's modus operandi for dealing with scandals: she always accuses her opponents of doing the exact thing that she was guilty of doing. The whole opposition is looking at the wrong hand, and being led to do so by the same media that lied their asses off to get them to relinquish their right to vote in exchange for the rule of Queen Hillary, meanwhile Trump and the Saudis and Israel continue to further their legacy for criminal acts against humanity without a single given fuck.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump-Russia = Obama Birtherism
      </p>
      <p>
       It's fake news for controlled opposition almost certainly, and even if there's any truth to it, it's not the smoking gun scandal that's really going to cause any change.
