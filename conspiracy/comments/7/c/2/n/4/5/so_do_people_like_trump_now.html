Are people starting to warm to him now as he seems to be more transparent than past Presidents and wants to tackle issues that others haven&#39;t touched.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Brit by the way so not too sure of all the ratings systems etc. that a President faces </p>

    <div class="md"><p>two questions- why do we believe the first pic is from q anon? and if q anon is the WH director of social media, that would make q anon firmly in the territory of &quot;shameless propaganda&quot;, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you don&#39;t believe the first pic was from Q-Anon (it was posted by his ID in his thread), the location does match up identically with the time frame of the flight of AF1 and the location of the picture that was taken. I think personally it&#39;s from AF1, but who knows who it is. Also Q-Anon has probably been multiple people, so it&#39;s important that we first distinguish what THIS Q-Anon(the important one obviously) has had to say in the past, or will have to say in the future. Do you not agree with that?</p>

<p>Absolutely. They want people to think that barely anyone supports him or that we regret our vote. Its really transparent and couldn&#39;t be further from the truth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s mostly being orchestrated to make him appear as a victim to the right and as a Russian agent, when really and truly, he&#39;s neither, in order to shield him from actual criticism for basically doing the exact kind of shady stuff that Obama, Bush, and Clinton did. </p>

<p>We&#39;re still bombing Secular Shi&#39;a for Fascist Sunni rapist royals. We&#39;re still pouring money into the Israel time-bomb. We are still waiting for justice against the elites of the world who have betrayed us. </p>

<p>His corrupt ties aren&#39;t to Russia, though. The left would realize that if they actually examined Hillary&#39;s modus operandi for dealing with scandals: she always accuses her opponents of doing the exact thing that she was guilty of doing. The whole opposition is looking at the wrong hand, and being led to do so by the same media that lied their asses off to get them to relinquish their right to vote in exchange for the rule of Queen Hillary, meanwhile Trump and the Saudis and Israel continue to further their legacy for criminal acts against humanity without a single given fuck. </p>

<p>Trump-Russia = Obama Birtherism</p>

<p>It&#39;s fake news for controlled opposition almost certainly, and even if there&#39;s any truth to it, it&#39;s not the smoking gun scandal that&#39;s really going to cause any change.  </p>
