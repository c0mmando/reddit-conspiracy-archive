       Aliester Crowley, aka the Beast 666, came up with this when he was alive. It's designed to ruin the minds of the children who listen to it. They wanted to push humanity onto Satanism so they used music to do it.
      </p>

       Wikipedia Description:
      </p>
      <p>
       In the 1973 film The Exorcist, a tape of noises from the possessed victim was discovered to contain a message when the tape was played backwards. This scene might have inspired subsequent copycat musical effects. Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly classic rock songs, whose authors denied any intent to promote Satanism, backmasking has been used by heavy metal bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery. Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons.[37] For example, thrash metal band Slayer included at the start of the band's 1985 album Hell Awaits a deep backmasked voice chanting "Join Us" over and over. (About this sound listen).[38] However, Slayer vocalist Tom Araya states that the band's use of Satanic imagery was "solely for effect".[39] Cradle of Filth, another band that has employed Satanic imagery, released a song entitled "Dinner at Deviant's Palace", consisting almost entirely of unusual sounds and a reversed reading of the Lord's Prayer[40] (a backwards reading of the Lord's Prayer is reportedly a major part of the Black Mass).[19][41] Seattle-based grunge band Soundgarden parodied the phenomenon of Satanic backmasking on their 1989 album Ultramega OK. When played backwards, the songs "665" and "667" reveal a song about Santa Claus. Marilyn Manson used this technique. For example, in the beginning of his song "Tourniquet" when played backwards, his voice is heard saying "This is my lowest point of vulnerability" as explained in his book The Long Hard Road Out of Hell.

       Jay Z's song "Lucifer" (kinda like your name, buddy), includes a sample of backmasking. Something along the lines of "murder murder jesus, 666"

       This one is a clear example, probably just done to be edgy, but still an example nonetheless

       Well, first of all, I would never reduce myself to the status of a Luciferian. That's worst than joining a street gang and I'm not that stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       2nd, if Lucifer's name was "Light-Bringer" before he became a rebel, it would make sense because light refers to goodness, knowledge, and sight. Lucifer's philosophy post rebellion is "do as thou wilt" which is in itself a VERY broken philosophy because it would cause so much confusion, chaos, and bring in so many enemies. Lucifer thought this was correct so in HIS mind, he is the light-bearer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Light = Sight, clarity, transparency, a directional guide, knowledge, goodness, and peace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Darkness = Confusion, evil, and chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is the big difference between the 2. My name, light bringer, refers to me being a person who brings in transparency into the minds of others so that we can see what the hell is going on in our surroundings. If we can't see what's truly happening around us, it means we live in darkness. Hence, the name fits perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to also remember, truth is relative. Just because one word means something in one context doesn't mean it means something in all other settings. The only way to translate what one sees is to look at the whole picture. In this case, I am speaking out against Satanism so that may suggest that I don't believe in it which I don't.

       I'm not in agreement that truth is reletive since truth is the only thing that's real. There is only one right answer to every question. Just pointing out that your name would cause most people to believe you're on board with lucifer. As with my name. I'm just a student therefore always half light and half dark. Like gandalf the grey wizard. Still trying to find my darkness and only have light in the end.

       Truth is in fact relative though. You might weight 175 pounds now which is true but that may not be true in a year from now. You may weight 170 in a year from now.

       Woah!  I was simply giving you the answer you were seeking as to why your Reddit handle was being connected to Lucifer in the pervious comment. No one called you out on being a 'Luciferian'. Although, even if you did practice Luciferianism I don't really think anyone in this sub is going to have a stroke about. I do, however, appreciate the explanation and insight you lent behind your /u/ name from your point of view.

       Totally. No way its an accident, man. The song is called Lucifer. Again, I think it was producers just trying to get some buzz and acting cool. Dont think its some kind of ritual/dedication to Satan or anything.

       How is the back masking done?  Do they just record the message, reverse it, and bury it in the mix?  I would think that would be audible and conspicuous with normal listening. Can't imagine the headache of trying to record a song so that when reversed, the audio has a message, just not practical.

       It seems weird to me, cause I know a bit about audio, and I can tell you, if I was to record some stupid phrase right now, reverse it, and try to fit it into a mix of music, it's likely gonna sound like shit and muddy things and not sync up well. The only thing I can think of is that they must write the song around the reversed track so it fits.

       As a metalhead, I can assure you that metalheads are basically all just dorks who like horror movies and scary stuff. We are not evil Satan worshippers any more than a horror movie directors are evil. It’s just an aesthetic for people who like heavy music and creepy imagery. We’ve been persecuted by ‘satanic panic’ whack jobs for years and it’s really just religious nuts misunderstanding what metal is really about. Part of the purpose behind these kind of lyrics like Slayer and CoF is to offend hypocritical Jesus freaks who have no problem with the massive amount of violence and gory imagery in the Bible and even hang statues of a bloody crucified corpse everywhere, but freak out that a black metal band plays a prayer in reverse.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to find the genuine Satan worshippers, look at illuminati puppets like Katy Perry. Leave the metalheads alone.

       I agree. Most metalheads are just trying to have fun although, in my opinion, the evil imagery can end up brainwashing people in the long run.

      <p>
       However, some of those metal heads eventually degenerated into Illuminati shills just like some people who listened to gangster rap degenerated into becoming gang members.

       I have studied it and it’s bullshit. Heavy metal does not have any effect on the “masses” because the masses do not listen to it. That’s at least part of the appeal, that it’s not driven by monetary goals. There is absolutely zero causal relationship between listening to morbid/violent music and violent crime.

       You are talking to someone who spent years studying this in university. There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that violent media destroys the fabric of both the mind and society.
      </p>
      <p>
       A small group listens to violent heavy metal but another group listens to violent rap while another group watches violent movies, ect.., What do the masses have in common? They are mostly all ingesting violent media regardless of what type of media delivers it. It can be metal, hip hop, a comedy, a children’s show, video games, or whatever.

       Oh, so you mixed variables and came up with statistical significance? 
To be fair, I don’t even know how you be able to collect enough data to form correlation between a certain genre of music and violent crime.  But that didn’t stop you with coming up with a conclusion.

       Your mind is like a void of probability. You can put anything you want into and it will have a higher chance of appearing in your reality. You might imagine a glass of water when you feel thirsty so you get water. Getting water is your choice but the thought pushes you toward getting water.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you insert violent ideas into your head, you are greatly increasing the chance of it occurring in real life. Considering heavy metal sounds like the anger emotion, it will increase the probability of you getting angry at other people throughout the day which will eventually disrupt your relationships and possibly burn some bridges.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s just one example. Mental poisons come in all shapes and sizes. They hook you in using using “candy”, aka something appealing for you, and they put the poison in the candy so that you eat the candy without realizing there is poison in there. Overtime, you entire mind becomes poisoned.
      </p>

       The only real answer is staying away from MSM. Try it for a few months and you will see how much better you feel. It works for everyone that does it.

       What are you basing that on? You mentioned thousands of studies. I’ve been listening to heavy metal for 20+ years and I’ve never had any sort of violent incident. I personally know others who also have no violent tendencies and are obsessed with metal. 
Heavy metal is not MSM so I don’t understand your point. You can’t just group all forms of media together to support your conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is an article on an actual study which demonstrates that listening to heavy metal can actually calm people that are angry.
       <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/22/listening-heavy-metal-punk-extreme-music-makes-you-calmer-not-angrier-study">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I can corroborate this with my personal experience. Listening to aggressive or violent music makes me less angry and violent, since it’s a form of stress relief in the same way that punching a bag or squeezing a bag might release anger. I’m surprised you haven’t considered this in your studies.

       Woah!  I was simply giving you the answer you were seeking as to why your Reddit handle was being connected to Lucifer in the pervious comment. No one called you out on being a 'Luciferian'. Although, even if you did practice Luciferianism I don't really think anyone in this sub is going to have a stroke about. I do, however, appreciate the explanation and insight you lent behind your /u/ name from your point of view.

       Totally. No way its an accident, man. The song is called Lucifer. Again, I think it was producers just trying to get some buzz and acting cool. Dont think its some kind of ritual/dedication to Satan or anything.
