        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Absolutely fascinating documentary.  Combined with the recently released JFK Files I think it&#39;s quite clear that Hitler somehow made it to South America.  It&#39;s quite clear there was a Nazi colony at Villa Baviera.  </p>

<p>When I first started watching this I thought it would be a fascinating thought to think Hitler kicked back under the sun in retirement in South America.  As the series went on, I find out that really he wasn&#39;t retired at all and was planning on attacking New York.  WHAT THE FUCK.</p>

<p>So... if all that is true... then what happened to stop this?  From what they&#39;ve found, they were VERY serious and VERY organized and VERY connected.  So what stopped them?</p>

<p>...........or were they stopped?....where are they today?</p>

<p>The ramifications are actually kindof chilling</p>

<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Some people seem confused about what I&#39;m talking about, here&#39;s a few clips from the series:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah... Through operation paperclip... Hitler kicks back in SA with a load of his henchmen to plot and scheme while the rest of the world believes the Reich is over, meanwhile keeping in contact with those few Nazis he allowed to be taken in by the American government to gain more influence within the states, such as the cooperation of the Bush&#39;s who have been known to collaborate with Nazis throughout history. The attack on the twin towers may well have been that attack on New York you were referring to considering a lot of evidence points towards the Bush&#39;s being the ones to carry out, secretly being commanded by Hitler from SA. His protÃ©gÃ© Nazi&#39;s may very well be the real power behind the scenes in America responsible for all these false flag attacks and other tyranny in recent years. Who knows though, just a theory.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The JFK files exposed Hitler fled to Argentina! Or wherever he was according to different stories...</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way to prove Hitler fled Germany at the end of the war, but if you look at what happened in WW2, rather than believing some document produced by the CIA (suddenly they&#39;re telling the truth apparently); it seems highly unlikely.</p>

<p>It&#39;s said Hitler was some evil dicatator, but if you look at the facts:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIo8rIyo68E">Here&#39;s what life was like in Hitler&#39;s Germany</a></p>

<p>Anyways, Hitler loved his people. Also many take joy in saying Wall Street and jewish bankers &quot;financed Hitler.&quot; There is plenty of documented evidence that Wall Street and jewish bankers did indeed help finance Hitler at first, partly because it allowed the bankers to get rich and partly in order to control Stalin. However, when Germany broke free from the bankers, the bankers declared a world war against Germany. When we look at all the facts, the charge that &quot;jews financed Hitler&quot; becomes irrelevant. When Hitler came to power, Germany was hopelessly broke. The Treaty of Versailles had imposed crushing reparations on the German people, demanding that Germans repay every nation&#39;s costs of the war. These costs totaled three times the value of all the property in Germany. Private currency speculators caused the German mark to plummet, precipitating the worst hyper inflation of their time. A wheelbarrow full of 500,000 marks could not buy a loaf of bread. The national treasury was empty. Countless homes and farms were lost to speculators and to private jewish controlled banks. Germans lived in hovels. They were starving. Nothing like this had ever happened before, the total destruction of the national currency, plus the wiping out of people&#39;s savings and businesses. On top of this came a global depression. Germany had no choice but to succumb to debt slavery under international jewish bankers until 1933, when the National Socialists came to power. At that point the German government thwarted the international banking cartels by issuing its own money. World jewry responded by declaring a global boycott against Germany. Hitler began a national credit program by devising a plan of public works that included flood control, repair of public buildings and private residences, and construction of new roads, bridges, canals and port facilities. All these were paid for with money that no longer came from the private international bankers. The projected cost of these various programs was fixed at one billion units of the national currency. To pay for this, the German government, and not the international bankers, issued bills of exchange called Labor Treasury Certificates. In this way, the National Socialists put millions of people to work, and payed them with Treasury Certificates. Under the National Socialists Germany&#39;s money wasn&#39;t backed by gold, which was owned by the international bankers. It was essentially a receipt for labor and materials delivered to the government. Hitler said, &quot;For every mark issued, we required the equivalent of a mark&#39;s worth of work done, or goods produced.&quot; The government payed workers in Certificates. Workers spent those Certificates on other goods and services, thus creating more jobs for more people. In this way the German people climbed out of the crushing debt imposed on them by the international bankers. Within two years, the unemployment problem of 7 million was cut in half, and Germany was back on its feet. It had a solid, stable currency with no debt and no inflation, at a time when millions of people in the United States and other Western countries controlled by international bankers were still out of work. Within five years, Germany went from the poorest nation in Europe to the richest. Germany even managed to restore foreign trade, despite the international bankers&#39; denial of foreign credit to Germany, and despite the global boycott by jewish owned industries. Germany succeeded in this by exchanging equipment and commodities directly with other countries, using a barter system that cut the bankers out of the picture. Germany flourished, since barter eliminates national debt and trade deficits. Germany&#39;s economic freedom was as short-lived as Adolf Hitler&#39;s rule, but it left several monuments, including the famous Autobahn, the world&#39;s first extensive superhighway. This economic freedom made Hitler extremely popular with the German people. Germany was rescued from English economic theory, which says that all currency must be borrowed against the gold owned by a private and secretive banking cartel, such as the Federal Reserve or the Central Bank of Europe, rather than issued by the government for the benefit of the people. The main reason why the bankers arranged for a world war against Germany was that Hitler sidestepped the bankers by creating his own money, thereby freeing the German people. Worse, this freedom and prosperity threatened to spread to other nations. Hitler had to be stopped.</p>

<p>On his death, while there&#39;s nothing to confirm, it&#39;s said Hitler took a cyanide pill along with his wife Eva Braun shortly before Berlin had fallen. With the last bit of fuel they could find, he&#39;d be &#39;cremated&#39; in Berlin.</p>

<p>Watch the following video (including Hitler&#39;s own words) and tell me what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously you haven&#39;t watched this series.  I&#39;d highly advise you to watch it (you can get it online, if you know how <em>wink</em>).  </p>

<p>They make it VERY plausable that Hitler faked his death and FLEW out of the middle of Berlin, headed to Spain, and came to Argentina.  They even come across a photograph of Hitler (not the JFK one) still alive in South America.  </p>

<p>I think you&#39;d really enjoy this series, especially if you don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>THE LEGEND OF THE NAZI TUNNELS IN BLUMENAU Blumenau is a city in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina, south of the country. It was founded by German immigrants in September 1850. There, mysterious underground galleries guard the secret from a legend according to which the tunnels were built to server the strategic purposes of Adolf Hitler and his followers, when the Third Reich, finally, would made â€‹â€‹his foray in Latin America, expanding its domain overseas to the west, conquering Brazil</p>

<p>Despite being a chapter of history that Blumenau, wants to forget, there is evidence of the involvement of the population with nazist ideology, as photographs showing parades of supporters in wich the swastika appears prominently.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s true, but it&#39;s interesting to think about.</p>
