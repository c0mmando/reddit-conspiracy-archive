        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Last night I was looking into some of the elsagate stuff and I was led to a video where a Man was speaking about ohmcoin. In short he spoke about the possibility that some of these videos could be linked to a new crypto currency (ohmcoin) where actors are incentivised to participate in said videos by being paid with these coins. I&#39;ll link to video here, the minute mark where he starts talking about it is about 32 mins in: <a href="https://youtu.be/WQY8DTC4ErI">https://youtu.be/WQY8DTC4ErI</a></p>

<p>I decided to look up Ohmcoin and on their site : <a href="http://www.ohmwallet.com">www.ohmwallet.com</a> I came across a section that says &quot;incorporate Sodalitas Vulturis Volantis&quot;</p>

<p>Now when I looked into Sodalitas Vulturis Volantis (or SVV for short) I came across some sort of ARG cryptic and somewhat satanic stuff. Specifically I was led to this website: <a href="https://infantes.humanisbeing.com/splash-screen?back_uri=">https://infantes.humanisbeing.com/splash-screen?back_uri=</a></p>

<p>I have no idea what all of this is but it&#39;s quite interesting, and if anyone has any info I would love to hear about it! I&#39;m not necessarily a conspiracy guy but I do enjoy a good mystery so this really piqued my interest.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right, I actually signed up for that many months ago They kicked me out when I didn&#39;t do anything they asked. I just wanted the coin.</p>

<p>Personally I think it&#39;s all a LARP - in the literal sense. I think it is live action role playing. But the other option is that it is a cult.</p>

<p>Basically it comes down to them saying this. I&#39;m entirely paraphrasing here.</p>

<p>&quot;You know why you are here and don&#39;t need us to explain it. You have come here of your own volition. We will tell you to do things and you can do them if you choose to. If you do them you will remain part of our group. If you do not you will leave the group. We don&#39;t care if you join or not, it is up to you.&quot;</p>

<p>The first thing they want you to do is to draw a symbol somewhere in the world and take a photo of it to prove you did it. I didn&#39;t do that so after a few weeks they said sayanara. </p>

<p>I really think it&#39;s a game, but they don&#39;t want you to think it&#39;s a game. It could be a mixture of LARP and real in that sense that a lot of delusional people will think it is real, and in a way that makes it real.</p>

<p>Question for you: When you say you were &quot;led to a video&quot; what do you mean? Youtube suggestions, or was there an actual connection to Elsagate? You might actually be on to something. That group was super skeevy and I can easily believe they would be behind something like those videos. On the other hand you need some kind of evidence or else it&#39;s pure baseless speculation.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very strange, I can o my imagine the types of things they ask people to do after being a part of it for a long period of time... And as for being led to the video, I went down a rabbit hole of really disturbing childrens videos (I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware of what they entail) and at some point the suggestions turned to YouTube channels theorizing about elsagate. This video was one of the ones I happened to click on which in turn took me down the ohmcoin/svv road </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only question is if this is just a very intricate LARP, what would be the point of having it linked to a crypto currency and why would they only be looking for certain people who are able to solve such crazy puzzles? I mean I get that some people enjoy this stuff but no one in their right mind would go through such time consuming (and dark) things just for fun, would they? What&#39;s the point? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The currency is purely a way to pay people. The project (Ohm) isn&#39;t particularly interesting. It&#39;s just another coin. If the value shoots up then the early adopters will make a lot of money. Partnering with this weird group is a way of increasing interest in the coin.</p>

<p>So from that point of view this can be seen as just another crypto moneygrab. No better or worse than DogeCoin or KanyeCoin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From what I&#39;ve heard, the people who completed the final task have never actually talked about what or who was waiting for them and the creator of cicada has never been revealed. Like my other comment above, it totally could be an elaborate game for smart people to participate in. But WHY would whoever is making these games put so much effort into the intricacy just to give other people something to do? It really seems like the person responsible is looking for people with very specific mental capabilities and skills to be a part of something bigger, but what that is is something that I don&#39;t think any of us will ever know </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, I think it <em>could</em> be just for fun and profit. Or it <em>could</em> be for actual social engineering reasons. Finally it <em>could</em> be that the people behind the group genuinely believe they are &#39;special&#39;.</p>

<p>We can&#39;t really know, and it is a mistake to jump to conclusions. But it would be cool to get more info. </p>
