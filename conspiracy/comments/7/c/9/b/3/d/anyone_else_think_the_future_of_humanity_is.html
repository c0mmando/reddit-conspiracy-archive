       All the signs point to us being permanently enslaved in a rigged economy, mass surveillance state, perpetual state of war, blurred lines between gender (and age by says things are going), poisoned by our food and water supply, fed propaganda from all sides, with online censorship getting worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA, NSA, federal reserve, bilderbergers, military industrial complex, Hollywood, MSM and Silicon Valley are obviously part of this problem. But who else do you think are part of the ruling elite? Not just in the US but other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think their endgame is? What do you think we can do to stop them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Anytime I bring up topics like this to people I know they tend to not be that interested, or don't believe what I'm saying. Or they think I sound crazy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like I can't talk to anyone about things like this. Nobody gets it. I've learned things this past year that have changed my worldview completely. All the "social issues" most people talk about seem trivial in comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else feel like this?

       It has all morphed and shifted around and TPTB now is divided, that makes it harder to identify and excise.
      </p>
      <p>
       That division is also slowing down that total control of the masses sought in different ways by the two or three systems fighting for control.

       a large portion of the country either loses their jobs, or access to food, or both. That's the only way there'd be enough people to do something.. and even then.. well, the current and unknown weapons technology scares me.

       If they manage to continually keep most of us fed and working, I really don't know what we could do or how we could ever do it. At that point, we just have to pray for an asteroid or alien invasion.

       We would need a new MLK-like orator, organizer, public speaker. That's why he was killed to begin with. TPTB saw he was rallying way too many people to his cause. That sort of unity is the Achilles heel of those in power.

       So they can swap out one puppet for another? The real people pulling the strings aren't even being mentioned right now. Those are the ones who should be focused on. The people hiding in the shadows, no the people in the spotlight. That's just a distraction

       It will NOT be effective to go for the top dogs before you get the puppets. Do you think telling people about 9/11 or vaccines first is easier to get people to wake up? Rather than telling them that Rockefeller's and Rothschild's control ever single person in this world basically? You have to start somewhere to get to the real intense truths that regular people in a slumber would never believe.

       How do we take down the puppet masters then? Id love to hear how we do it other than making the populous aware so we have the numbers to say no more. We'd need militaries, we'd need money, we'd need numbers.

       No we don't. They need public support to exist. If the public turns on them, no army will save them, for the army is made of the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key to destroying them is to unify against them in culture by exposing the truth of their misdeeds. The hierarchy will then fall apart from simple lack of support. It's not easy, but that's the appropriate vector as far as I can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need a military or money (per se) but we DO need people power. That's our own strength, is to unify in numbers through culture and ideology. To wake up to the truth, and wake everyone else up. I firmly believe that.

       Okay that was exactly my point. We need people to wake up. 3/4 of the world population doesn't even know they exist. I don't see how you can expect people to wake up by telling them 2 families run the whole world. In my awakening process it probably took me a year until I was able to comprehend that. I awoke by learning 9/11 was an inside job and gradually went down the rabbit hole. Most people are going to need something of a smaller magnitude before they're willing to comprehend the hierarchy that controls the world.

       Sure, but that path of upward understanding will be made up of people who are currently traversing that path.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's best to document the highest aspects that we're aware of, so that we can stand on each other's shoulders and see the farthest. In my mind, this is like a giant mystery that almost no one has solved, and it's our job to solve it, and tell others what we found. If they're not receptive to well-presented info, then maybe they will be later. The important thing is getting the quality info out, rather than convincing people who don't want to know. Because you can never convince them anyway. Like you, and me, they have to awaken to small bits at their own pace. But the important pieces at the top should be the focus, because that's where the real meat of the solution is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like they say, you can lead a horse to water, but you cannot make it drink. It's good to package things in a way that's digestible for others, but that can only go so far, because some people just don't want to know. So you have to talk to the people who are receptive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like when they wrote Seinfeld, they wrote a comedy
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       thought was funny, instead of trying to focus group it. And then they had this surprise worldwide success at around the 3rd season. People didn't "get" it at first, especially the network execs. But by the time they were in the 7th season, everyone was aboard the Seinfeld train. People "got" it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think it's good to hit the highest quality and depth you can, while balancing it a bit so it's appealing to those who are interested. But if you start to try and pander to save everyone, it's a recipe for failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ten people tuned in to the deepest truth is more valuable then a thousand turned on to a shallow truth. And yes, you have to build up the understanding to comprehend the deep truth, but all that literature and media is already out there! There's no need to re-create it and re-invent the wheel. So focusing on the newer and deeper stuff is a more effective route in the long run, because it's adding new media to the chain that people go up when they begin digesting all these true conspiracies.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would rather tell 5 people about the rothschilds than have address a crowd of 100 about 9/11. People have already made up their minds on most stuff, but few people have heard of the rothschilds at all. It's fertile ground, if you present it the right way and avoid emotional trigger words.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, that's a lot of text, but this is something I can tell you've though about a lot, and I have too, so I'm glad we're talking about it.

       Or let me put it this way... maybe it's more about building something so good that it makes their system obsolete, rather than fighting them directly.

       It seems to stem from Britain Bankers. The reason I say this is because at the end of WW1, Great Britain owned Palestine, they were the ones who allowed confiscation of Palestinian Land, and has been expanding every since.
      </p>
      <p>
       This tells me the Jews/Zionists/Mars aliens/whatever the hell you want to call them/refer to them as, are not the ones in control. The people who had power before them, was British Bankers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States went to war with these Bankers 200 years ago?, the United States exist as a living example of the power to fight the bankers, and it has literally been ripped from the inside, and everyone keeps touching the shell and keeps seeing whats wrong with it, but they don't know what to do or how to act.

       Yeah the City of London is the original London. The other London (that most people would recognise as such) is built around it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CoL is very interesting. There are only around 9k official residents and voting is actually done by corporations (the larger the company, the more votes you get too). They aren't voting for the Prime Minister or Members of Parliament, they are voting for the Mayor of London. Famously the Queen apparently has to ask for permission to enter the City. So it has a totally different head of state that is neither the monarchy or parliament. Confusion comes from the owners/head of state in the CoL being called The Crown, but this isn't anything to do with the royal family, The Crown is the name of the corporation who controls the CoL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bear in mind how small the City of London is too, it's a square mile, but within its boundaries pretty much every major bank and finance company has some form of presence there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CoL also has its own police force that's separate from the Metropolitan police (I've asked police before why the City has different police and the only answer I got was "tradition").
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a place called Temple in the CoL which is where most of the customs of law in the West come from (like lawyers passing the Bar exam). I think Temple also has links to the Knights Templar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, the City of London stayed the same while everything else around it changed. That's why the voting is done by corporations/merchants as it's who controlled London when it first came about as a leading city for commerce.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the long post, but I looked into the City of London for a little while as I live in London (not the City, but general London) and always thought it was weird they had a separate police force. The history is really fascinating and so many major events have happened there.

       I don't know much about US history but I've been listening to a podcast from Vyzygoth and The Informer about the history of the US constitution (I'm on a phone so it's tough to find and link to but it's on YouTube).
      </p>
      <p>
       They've both looked into the actual laws and clauses etc and suggest that from their research Britain essentially controls the US. They said that the treaty between the US and GB was drawn up and signed by the British king. When in history has the loser ever drawn up the terms?
      </p>
      <p>
       I seem to remember another show with them where they explained how The Informer got out of paying income tax and how it was related to ecclesiastical law and that the confirmation came from a letter from the Vatican. The guy said it wasn't worth all the hassle he had to go through to get it though.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also explains why when the so-called patriots try to use the constitution as a defence in federal court (and all the "freeman of the land" arguments ) that those people usually lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       I highly recommend whatever material is still left from their podcast as they go into the actual laws and is free from the unsourced bullshit usually found on most conspiracy shows. They go into how corrupt the founding fathers were and how some people at the time said the constitution would hurt the country and citizens and generally only benefit the rich and powerful.
      </p>
      <p>
       A good introduction if anybody is interested can be found on The Higher Side Chat (THC) podcast just search for Vyzygoth. I don't think he does shows anymore which is a big shame as I found him to be one of the best and most honest of the conspiracy related  podcasts.

       Why do we shift our problems onto others? Perhaps there is a group of people trying to control this world and they are shaping it according to their will. We merely need to respond by enacting our own will into society.  We are part of the problem. Every single soul on this planet is part of the problem and part of the solution. No matter what supposed side they think they are on.

List all the reasons as to why you aren't living the life you want.

       I think that's a poor excuse. People just don't have a strong enough will, that's why the elite are the way they are? Maybe from your perspective or mine. Remember that the power structure has been in place alot longer than most realize. The deceivers have been deceiving and distracting the public away from the problems. This is an intricate system with deception coming from many different angles.

       It isn't an excuse it is what "TPTB" are most afraid of. If people started to realize they have control of their own actions and truly understood that no matter the circumstance in life we can live happy. It isn't a big idea that will undo the "TPTB" it is a simple one that can be embraced by all.
      </p>
      <p>
       The power resides in each and every individual on this lovely planet. I don't mind if you dismiss my claim as being a poor excuse. It is essentially the primary problem though. So it matters not if it is an excuse it needs to be addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is simply that easy. Now to do away with all the brainwashing, and to reclaim control we so easily give "TPTB" is the bigger problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to be able to understand that they can make a difference in their life if they put their mind there. To many of us are stuck in a situation in which we perceive the illusion of no control. We accept what is willed upon us, we examine the lives of those around us, our parents and their parents and accept that this is just the way the world works.
      </p>
      <p>
       It can be changed in an instance if people embraced that they are in control of their own destiny. If they pursued their passions rather than subscribe to a JOB.  The thing is from what I can surmount is most people want to live  their lives in peace. They don't wish to cause conflict. So they abide by the rules and regulations as best they can.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB have no power unless we give them power. The same with words.

Your will was to offer free energy to the world, but it's just never going to happen. The power structure that is in place now will not allow you free will.

       My argument isn't that people are lazy. Just ignorant and or numb to the idea of exerting that free will. Programmed to think that the power is too pervasive, that the power can't be overcome by simple ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
       It behooves those in power for us to talk about them in such definitive terms.

       All in all, I understand where you are coming from. I understand that the odds seemingly look stacked against us. For better or worse it is what it is. WE can keep talking about "TPTB" and the power that they hold or you and I can start discussing how to make changes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is my position that the most effective change one could hope to make is a change to themselves and by so doing it will directly change those around them. By highlighting our capabilities rather than what is perceived as incapable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our society needs some serious changes, but it wont happen unless we change the way we think. WE give power to "TPTB" just by announcing their power. I'm not saying turn a blind eye to it. No no, but recognize their power is only limited in scope. They BUY people, if we simple change how people think or you know program them to think for themselves. We will have a better society.

       I agree, WE can defeat TPTB and you're right, it'd be much better if we actually did it rather than talk about it! Unfortunately there's not enough of us awake yet. I guess that's our job in this present moment. To help our fellow humans open their eyes.

       Exactly. So I have hard time seeing how "my consciousness is limitless" and I can shape my world, when I'm basically being blackmailed for the goods I need to survive, as is nearly every person. Contribute to the machine, or die. That's the scenario they want to create, but thankfully some people still can find wiggle room to explore other options and help others out of this trap.

       I agree, it breeds passivity. I also think this is (partly) the reason Eastern governments accepted Buddhism and Taoism as national religions in the past. They promote this "go with the flow" attitude that can be very good spiritually, but can be counter-productive in a political sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree with your assessment though. It's like the "the secret" stuff, where if you just imagine it enough it will come to fruition. In some ways I can see it be freeing, but in other ways it also seems like a trap that traps you in your own mind.

       "their" end game is the complete take over of any humans left after some created "natural" events. "they" are trying this by means of creating a complete new digital matrix. This new matrix will use 5G, rfid chips the internet and other technologies to cut people completly off from nature's energy source, the unconsious self and the commen consiousnesss of humanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       The matrix we are now living in has some controll over people, but people are still able to get in contact with their unconsious self and the commen consiousness we are all part of. This is now difficult already, but with Love or some knowledge most people are able to get in contact. The new digital matrix will try to cut this contact completely, leaving humans even more "lost" and in chaos than we are now.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reasons? Well, it is not only controll over people, power and money. We humans are way more powerfull than we know now and if we ever find out what we are actually capable off "they" literary can't excist along us anymore. The reason for the matrix is to keep people and this "reality" in a low vibration state. "they" need it to be like this becouse they live of the negative energy of people. Once enough people wake up and resign their fear for "them" and start living according our natural state of Love "they" will soon run out of "food" and the artificial matrix will collaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       This also explains all the pushback against the truth in all area's of our life. "they" absolutely do not want us to start thinking and waking up, their existence in this "reality" is at stake and "they"are literary fighting for their lives here.

       No, I don't think humanity is doomed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hardship and trials allow us to embrace our full potential and overcome. When I think about the curcumstances of today I see a glaring flaw in the way TPTB run things. They underestimate human potential.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason why monarchies failed. Each person has potential that is not guaranteed by their environment alone. You can't rely on generations of wealth to lead to generations of capable heirs. A family in poverty can give birth to a genius at any time. It's a shame today's circumstances seem ripe for stifling any such potential, but those that survive and break through that filter will overthrow the current circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
       TPTB honestly feel like a vast disappointment compared to what you or I would have imagined of a shadow government or etc. In a way, TPTB are young and immature as well. The circumstances of the 2016 election reek of incompetence. The chaos in the media also appears like a temper tantrum of incompetent servants. I would have imagined a shadow government truly operating within the shadows. There would be no need to rig an election for a candidate one way or another because both candidates would be owned since birth. Both parties would be managed from within. There would not be leaks of secret agreements between governments because secretly there would not be multiple governments - just the one. We would not have candidates like HRC having a lackluster campaign during election season. If I were in power, do you think I would allow her to go a day without a press release or a rally? Would I let her have even a minute off the campaign trail? TPTB showed their weakness in 2016 - hubris, laziness, and general incompetence. They have the power still, but we're no longer controlled by TPTB that actually came into power. We're into second and third generations, the heirs, the people who got into power through connections and not competence, the trusted, but incapable. TPTB are quite weak and will
be only getting weaker at the rate they are going at.
      </p>
      <p>
       we likely will never have full transparency in government or people truly in control. I wouldn't even want that personally. The average person is quite incompetent and everyone having a say will only lead to chaos. Still, being in power isn't as simple as just taking power and passing it onto the next generation.

       Well I'm not going to explain the whole history of Wiemar Germany, but the main point is that things were very chaotic and awful, and this was created top down by war reparations after WW1, and that paved the way for hitler to rise to power because people had had enough.

       People got pushed to violence because they couldn't get any traction, then when they were violent the world stomped on them again. It's a lose/lose situation. Only way is to rise above the chaos as best is possible.

       I honestly think the whole thing is about the insane amount of pesticides that we are all exposed to. Glyphosate is a known endocrine disruptor and it is literally everywhere-- in the soil,  on organic produce,  in drinking water,  and disturbingly high levels are found in breast milk.
      </p>

       As for the gender categories and all that,  I think it's the culture's best attempt to make sense of it all.

       Thanks for this.  As both a conspirator and a non-binary transgender woman (hold your breath pal) I've been researching BPAs, atrazine, birth control pills etc. and it seems like such a glaring issue but has no conclusive research,  there's just like this whole shady phenomenon that is utterly ignored, you know? The skeptic in me has alarm bells going off, suffice to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day, I suffer from mild gender dysphoria that's hard for me to make sense of, and always have, and even though there's no science behind it yet, I hope people will extend some basic humanity towards trans people in the meantime.

       It is not only Glyphosate, it are also all the medication and birth controll stuff that is not used in the body that are getting into nature. The homons of he birthcontroll pill are already found in the drinking water in some places becouse we can't (or won't) filter them out. The same goes for the medication of ADHD and such, it is all going through the sewage treatment into nature and into all humans and animals and it is becomming part of the cycle of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       But this means we are now "treating" every human and animal i ways that are not studied or even known of in a large scale. I have a feeling this can not go on for a long time without any problems like we see emerging now.

       No human power will be able to remove the rot and corruption.  We have to face it and admit that the freemasons / globalists / satanists / TPTB have won.  They have all the money, power, technology, weapons, and resources because they bow down and worship the Lord of the World (i.e. the devil).  We would be kidding ourselves into thinking that some action hero or rebel alliance is going to save us.
      </p>
      <p>
       God has already guaranteed the victory and the head of the serpent has been crushed.  TPTB will lose, but it will be through the unmistakable divine intervention of God.  Nothing less than divine power will be able to wipe away the satanic powers of this world.  Unfortunately, because of the many sins of humanity (e.g. abortion, sodomy, fornication, political and economic oppression etc.) we must be punished and repay what we have taken through sin.  To paraphrase Lincoln, "
       <em>
        until every drop of blood drawn by the abortionist is repaid by blood drawn by the sword ...
       </em>
       "  IMHO, the only thing to do is to pray, grow in holiness/virtue, give-up sin, and grow in knowledge.  If we die, we die like men bearing witness to God.  If we live, we praise the Lord and rebuild, trusting in His divine providence every step of the way.

       You know if many of you God fearing individuals would collectively put all your efforts into resisting/fighting TPTB instead of just rolling over and saying "God has already guaranteed the victory and the head of the serpent has been crushed." or some combination of other bullshit, we would probably have a different world RIGHT NOW. but just completely shutting off and saying crap like gods in control and yady yada COMPLETELY dis empowers you as an individual. You're in the exact mind set TPTB want you in right now. Just go back to drinking your lemonade, watching your sports and working the 9-5 hoping Jesus will return to save a bunch of souls and people he hates already anyways for simply being themselves. Hate to break it to you but the world is in the same position its been for thousands of years. just a little different tech. Same types of wars, disease, turmoil, scenarios, etc. Nothing new under the sun here. If God was so dead set on coming back, i think he would of by now. Why wait around? dont we usualy say "no time like the present?" why as a creator wait around for more people to "fall from grace" when you could actively be fighting evil. To resist and fight TPTB instead of waiting for a night in shining armor or something to step in isn't showing ANY good virtue. I would think God Jesus or whatever the fuck would WANT you to be active and loud and inform others of whats going on . not just shutting your door and wiping your hands clean of the whole thing and saying "Welp! Gods in control!" what a fucking cop out.

       I did not intend to abridge human action, my apologies.  My main point is that whether through human action or no human action, it is the divine power that will ultimately prove victorious.  Human action in submission to the divine will is what will save the day.  Human action without reference to God is futility.

       sorry that's still a bunch of BS. If a person takes down say a pedo ring or group of banksters and doesn't believe in god or give any credit to him. I would still find them a hero regardless of their beliefs and their efforts where most certainly NOT futile since they potentially saved a bunch of kids.

         to Cyrus

        ,
    whose right hand I have grasped,
to subdue nations before him

“

       Cyrus was a non-Jew who did not worship the Lord, yet God explicitly states it is He who calls Cyrus, holds him by the hand, and goes before him to conquer ... even though Cyrus does not know the one true God.  So praise be to God for the pedo-rings that are taken down, but even though they may not know God or believe Him, it is through God that they win the victory.

       Whatever dude, you're literally just like my dad. Spewing a bunch of biblical garbage instead of trying to dig in and solve the current problems at hand all while ignoring new information and holding on to old. I know it probably gets annoying having to hear it from a random person on the internet but basking in biblical "research" and studies your whole live isnt doing anyone any favors except pleasing your own ego that "you're in the know" with god when in reality no body really cares and is trying to MAKE the world a better place not just wishing it where better. So you sit there and pray and hope and pray some more and hope that Jesus sweeps in on his white horse to slay all the evil devils but meanwhile they will be out there murdering and ruining YOUR children's lives and your childrens children and all future lineages to come all because you're holding out on an empty promise that will never be delivered. You can post as much bibilcal stuff as you want and we can all sit here on reddit and debate about whether god meant this or that or who was talking about what or "oh but hey no no he actually meant this right here" but its all not gonna do anything. You're basically commiting your life to having an extreme understanding to things that really only pertain to you. How would god have a hand in anything if a pedo ring is busted or if a burning building with its inhabitants are saved last minute. How did god have a helping hand in any of it? if anything god would be responsible for making fire burn and having it scorch human flesh upon contact. If anything, he's an enabler. If you break down a door and save me from some life threatening situation, you're my hero! not god. You can say "oh god put me here on this earth." or "god gave me great strength to beat doors down to save so and so" blah blah the bottom line is YOU saved a person. whether YOU want to say "god left the door unlocked for me" or whatever is up to you, just dont expect other people to live with the same way of understanding.
      </p>

       Feel free to ponder this quote though and give me some inside Jesus knowledge on why you think this quote wouldn't pertain to a monotheistic religion.

       Dude, I just said human action is important, but it is subordinate to God and prayer.  What makes you think I do nothing?  What makes you think I don't try to slip red pills here and there amongst my friends, family, and co-workers?  I'm not FBI or law enforcement, I don't bring down pedo rings and don't have the power to.  But in my own way small way I contribute to the greater good according to my state in life.

       The argument from evil is the one and only good argument against the existence of God ... it is also an easily answerable argument.  I will simply give Thomas Aquinas' answer from the Summa Theologiae for you to ponder.  Go tear down someone else, I'm done with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        St. Thomas Aquinas, 13th century
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It seems that God does not exist; because if one of two contraries be infinite, the other would be altogether destroyed. But the word "God" means that He is infinite goodness. If, therefore, God existed, there would be no evil discoverable; but there is evil in the world. Therefore God does not exist (ST.I-I, Q2, A3, obj.1).
       </p>
       <p>
        As Augustine says (Enchiridion xi): "Since God is the highest good, He would not allow any evil to exist in His works, unless His omnipotence and goodness were such as to bring good even out of evil." This is part of the infinite goodness of God, that He should allow evil to exist, and out of it produce good. (ST.I-I, Q2, A3, resp.1).

       Humanity no matter how you want to look at it is divided more so than class systems, but almost entirely different civilizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ultra ultra rich and privileged have access to entirely different aspects of living, medical advances, technological advances, and a much different view on how the world works for the individual and how the world works for the group.

       Globalism is coming. Maybe not now or tomorrow or the next day, but it will be more dense as time goes on.  Stockholm syndrome for the masses has already been present for generations and "biting the hand that feeds you" seems to be the defensive measure against the radicals.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of people are frustrated, angry, and don't know how to channel it. The younger crowd are pissed off and want to make a change, but are misdirected into distractions and traps that are going to make it worse for the free minded individual later on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everybody knows that something is deeply wrong, but most can't put their finger on it.  Is it the Left? Is it the Right? Is it Hollywood? Is it the mentally ill with access to guns? Is it ISIS? Is it whatever the easily accessible "sources" tell is wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       This time in the information age we have split-second access to forms of knowledge in every single subject known to man yet with that ability more people have been left in ignorance than ever.  The divide is more than ever now between the facade of taking sides like we're living in a movie where there is a black and white, good and evil, or some kind of illusion of duality.  The grey area is what matters and it's more complicated and complex than we take it for.
      </p>
      <p>
       It all comes down to what will be the epitome of being a human in the future and how much control do we have that as the common folk?

       Dunno. I feel things are actually slowly improving. Things that were absurd or prohibited ten years ago are now openly discussed and in some cases dealt with. We're on the right track I think, although I do agree there is still room for fatal error and it could all end up as bloody mess regardless. But somehow I feel that people are adjusting to the new reality faster than before and that's what those not up to date or in control find scary resulting in their actions being more aggressive and vocal. Those asleep are lost and those losing are desperate. Of course they'll be fighting back more than ever when their very existence is at stake. As long as those aware don't lower to their corrupt standards we should be fine. Hopefully.

       Time is getting tight, that's for sure. We have to wake everyone up and take the power back before its too late. Once technology is far enough along, there'll be no need for us anymore. The elite want this world to themselves, just like they need more money while they have billions already. They're selfish and greedy and they hate us.

       I'll play the other side to this. No, I don't think humanity is doomed. If we're to believe that the U.N.

       I don't think there will be a point after which they'll have complete control. Control always waxes and wanes throughout history as they perfect their control techniques, but also as the public learns how to counter these tricks. It's a constant back an forth, I do no believe there will be an "end" where we just lose forever after that.

       I agree with everything you said. To your question "What is their endgame?"

       We're already living it.

       THC is a great podcast. You may like this one too, about the central banking industry as it arose in Europe and Africa through the Rothschilds:
