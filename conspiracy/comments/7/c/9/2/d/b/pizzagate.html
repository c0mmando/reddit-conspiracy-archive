    <div class="md"><p>Reading what Wikipedia has to say about PG is probably the least informative thing you can do to develop a well-rounded understanding of what&#39;s been happening and deciding for yourself. </p>

<p>You can make it ONE of your research points, but I&#39;d put it pretty low on the list. </p>

<p>Look for the Ben Swann video that he did on TV before getting marginalized. That&#39;s a pretty straightforward introduction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Wikipedia link is not the right place to go, they include sentences saying it was debunked when it has never ever been debunked - you will never find any article anywhere that goes through all the evidence that was found and explains how and why it is actually innocent and nothing to do with pedophilia. You just find articles claimig it was debunked by this other article, which itself refers to another article, which itself refers to another, which may then refer to the DC police, who, an FOIA request determined had never actually investigated it despite them lying and saying they had - they then claimed they didn&#39;t need to investigate it because it had been debunked by the media, sending you back to all those articles with their claims of debunking that lead nowhere, and certainly not to any debunking.</p>

<p>Here is a run down on PG for you:</p>

<p>Wikileaks published the Podesta emails and within those emails were many bizarre references to &#39;pizza&#39; that did not seem to make sense in context. There were also references to a certain pizza restaurant in DC and several emails to and from the owner of that restaurant, JA, many of which seemed to involve Podesta (JP) appearing somewhat deferential to JA. It was then discovered that JA had been a lover of David Brock, had visited the WH and had been listed in GQ as one of the 50 most ifluential people in DC, which people thought was odd.</p>

<p>It emerged that pizza and cheese pizza in particular were words used to refer to child porn and children in a sexual context. It was also discovered that on the street where this pizza restaurant was based were sebveral other businesses and that thes ebusinesses each had a logo that was one of the symbols recognised by the FBI as being pedophile symbols - logos pedos use to identify each other and tosurreptitiously advertise pedo services etc. It was also discovered that these businesses were frequented by many politicians. One of the businesses, another pizza restaurant, quickly changed their logo ASAP after this revelation had occurred online.</p>

<p>The other pizza place, CPP, despite advertising itself as a family friendly restaurant, had an instagram account that was full of very odd and disturbing sexual imagery and disturbing images of children tied up, babies next to piles of money, weird inappropriate comments etc. The owner of the restaurant, JA, had a picture of a Greek statue as his profile picture - the statue was of a well known ancient Greek figure representative of pederasty. This network of people who owned these businesses and frequented them all had very strange and disturbing imagery on their various social media accounts, imagery that was very suggestive of child abuse and pedophilia, a video surfaced of an event at the restaurant in which the MC was openly talking and joking about pedophilia. It was discovered that JP had artwork depicting cannabalism on the wall of his office and his brother TP had artwork depicting dead children lying in the grass, and other odd disturbing artwork that depicted children in what appeared to be distress, dead, etc. A WaPo article about his weird artwork from several years earlier was quickly removed once it had been discovered and talked about among the people investigating all of this stuff, which raised suspicions further.</p>

<p>That was just the beginning of what started it all. There were other weird emails that involved parties that had children brought to them specifically for the entertainment of older adults that they were not related to, they involved talking about their old friend convicted pedo Denis Hastert and not in a way that suggested shock or disgust at what he had done. There were references to &#39;spirit cooking&#39; and other occult things. People started digging deeper and uncovering all sorts of things to do with pedophilia in Hollywood, whistleblowers who had come out to talk about these elite pedo rings in other countries. In November 2016 there was a huge pedo ring busted in Norway among their &#39;elites&#39; which got no mention in the MSM.</p>

<p>The MSM went all-out to shut this all down, the reddit PG sub was banned, they dragged JA on TV and didn&#39;t even ask him about the disturbing images and music and events that he had deliberately associated with his &#39;family friendly&#39; restaurant and instead pretended that the whole investigation was a right wing conspiracy that had been dreamt up out of nowhere and claimed that Hillary Clinton was selling children from a pizza restaurant basement, which was not what PG was about.</p>

<p>That&#39;s just the bare bones, there is tons of evidence over on the Voat PG sub, and by evidence I mean people found old articles, court records, company records showing odd real estate purchases and all kinds of odd behavior, social media posts, eye witness testimony, whistleblower testimony, just tons and tons of stuff that all points towards pedophilia and abuse of children as being a huge problem in DC and in elite and political circles the world over, often used for leverage/blackmail in order to control people who have power.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lies lies lies. It was not a political attack. People try to claim it is some &#39;right wing conspiracy&#39; when a huge proportion of the people  investigating it were actually left wing, and from all over the world. Because PG is a global thing, having started out with the pizza code words in wikileaks emails and the DC pizza restaurant and then moving on to discover evidence of a global &#39;elite&#39; (self-described, there is nothing actually elite about these people) pedophile and child trafficking organisation.</p>

<p>You really do not have a clue what you are talking about, or you are part of the effort to cover it up. If the former, then I really suggest you do some actual in depth research into it before you start defending pedophiles and attacking those who want to put a stop to child abuse. From someone left wing who initially looked at PG as a professional researcher in order to debunk it and instead ended up being traumatised by what she discovered to be true.</p>
