        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In wake of Trump (and Bernie Sanders to an extent) &quot;Anti-establishment&quot; is now the go-to for rebellious American political theater. It carries weight, it speaks to us-- it&#39;s also a brand, an advertising gimmick, seized upon by so called &quot;anti-establishment&quot; beacons like Breitbart and Steve Bannon, who have championed Moore since the start and continue to defend him, regardless of what&#39;s come out and what Moore is saying in interviews. </p>

<p>The appealing concept is also the crux of the burgeoning theory in which Moore is the victim of a political conspiracy. I would like to know exactly why Moore gets the anti-establishment branding...what values are really at the core of his support, even now? </p>

<p>If it&#39;s because he&#39;s a relative outsider to the DC scene, why is he considered an outsider? Is it because he is simply opposed or because he&#39;s an &quot;anti-globalist&quot; theocrat who opposes gay marriage and has been a controversy magnet for years now? Help me understand.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or is the cause much simpler that he is simply a republican. Just like WaPo, NYT, and many others pander to the &quot;left&quot;, Brietbart, Infowars, Bannon and many others pander to the &quot;right&quot;. Many times the bias of &quot;left&quot; media is pointed out while the &quot;right&quot; is characterized as unbiased and telling the &quot;truth&quot;. My opinion is they are just opposites of the same coin.</p>

<p>For instance, WaPo is constantly accused I having CIA ties due to project mockingbird. However that project was supposibly stopped decades ago and wikileaks leaks have not shown otherwise. Meanwhile Brietbart had an executive part of the National Security Council and frequently gets a pass here. At the end of the day all news has bias, and we must take that in to account and keep seperate from the credibility of a source. A WaPo article could try to sell a narative, but do WaPo soures have a good track record and is the meat credible?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think the NYT and WAPO pander to the left. They were both very anti bernie sanders and pro hillary. They also have both backed pretty much every war that the US has started/participate in. They may pander to the democratic establishment, but that&#39;s not &quot;the left&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I agree with you. I also find it funny how some people here think people are good guys because they are republicans and that the deep state is basically just democrats who are partisan and try to smear innocent republicans. As if the deep state would hate republicans who generally support every war, mass surveillence, less wall street regulation etc. They are very confused</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A generally liberal (more like socially liberal, centrist or further right otherwise) bias in the media, entertainment industry, advertising has allowed conservatives to play the overwhelmed victim card at length and to great effect...while covering up how the vast majority of GOP officials actually vote on the issues you mentioned, which should be primary concerns of conspiracy heads, and raise a million red flags. </p>

<p>Trump is different in many ways, the same old shit with a fake populist candy coating otherwise, but he was definitely an outlier in his direct appeals to the conspiracy community during the Birther era, the campaign, and now. Nat Enquirer, who&#39;s backed him for years, right now their cover is something like TRUMP RELEASES JFK FILES!, as if that wasn&#39;t planned and is something he&#39;s gone out of his way to force release or something. The campaigning continues. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great comment I completly agree. I just don&#39;t understand how you can be into conspiracies, know the history etc and still be fooled so easily just because the media is against them. For example my coworker defended pretty much everything Trump did including his massive increase of the military budget even though we had talked a lot and agreed about the many issues of the military industrial complex and 911 being an inside job etc</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think alot of it has to do with the right&#39;s embrace of conspiracy-everywhere thinking over time, which is now ubiquitous in their MSM outlets (and which Democrats have embraced with the Trump investigations). Also you have a generation of young skeptics who were nursed on Alex Jones, and look what he turned into-- the ultimate gatekeeping, fear-mongering conspiracy partisan. Currently blowing off all allegations against Roy Moore, not coincidentally.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I see it, since a senator race in Alabama is akin to a tomato and a strawberry arguing which one is redder, the &quot;establishment&quot; in that case is the republican one. In that sense, Moore&#39;s primary victory over Luther Strange was a major upset. Bannon&#39;s promise, made since, to primary every Rebuplican running in 2018 (where most republicans running for reelection do so in red states) is also pretty telling. </p>

<p>You can also say that this is a cynical attempt by Democrats to use this havoc to try and flip Alabama (good luck with that...). Could be true, but the risk vs. reward here would make it a rather silly move.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That all makes sense and is likely in a general sense, but what are the big &quot;anti-establishment&quot; values buoying Moore&#39;s appeal? Is it cause he wants to shrink the line between church and state? Cause he&#39;s an extremist? </p>

<p>Bannon&#39;s crusade has a &quot;by any means necessary&quot; undercurrent, where mass hatred by liberals, conservatives and centrists alike seems the main point. I&#39;m more interested in what actual values/potential policies the movement represents, as that&#39;s what will end up mattering if more Moore&#39;s succeed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think Moore&#39;s biggest appeal to Bannon is the fact that he&#39;s anti-McConnell (who Bannon <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/politics/steve-bannon.html">only yesterday</a> accused of hampering Trump&#39;s agenda)</p>

<p>Regarding the longer-term strategy/assets, that&#39;s a much more difficult question to answer. Without trying to put too many words in his mouth, it seems like Bannon foresees a great &quot;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/stratfor/2017/08/17/the-apocalyptic-vision-of-stephen-k-bannon/#2618c9e94682">turning</a>&quot; in US 
 history, with war and economic depression in the near horizon. He Attributes much of it to a warping of the capitalist concept, loss of &quot;Judeo-Christian values&quot;, and lack of guidance/drive among young people (specifically, white males). <a href="https://qz.com/898134/what-steve-bannon-really-wants/">This</a> article tries to break it down in so many words (this time his). </p>

<p>In that sense, there&#39;s a lot of &quot;creative destruction&quot; being attempted by Bannon (see Republican primaries, EPA, US state department...) that may or may not stave away his grave predictions. Obviously he&#39;ll be hard-pressed to find incumbent politicians who share his views, hence the &quot;by all means necessary&quot; part you mentioned.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting to look at the differences between Moore and the &quot;establishment&quot; candidate he defeated in the primaries (Strange). Here&#39;s a conservative link comparing their foreign policy platforms: <a href="https://www.conservativereview.com/articles/luther-strange-vs-roy-moore-on-national-security-foreign-policy">https://www.conservativereview.com/articles/luther-strange-vs-roy-moore-on-national-security-foreign-policy</a></p>

<p>By all accounts, their social platforms were the same too, just Moore is more specific on anti-gay and antiabortion stances. The most interesting to me is how both are huge Israel supporters. Doesn&#39;t seem anti-establishment to me. I think the Republican establishment backed Strange because he&#39;s less embarrassing or more polished, but their beliefs are virtually the same.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the article. You also have to wonder if there&#39;s a strict alliance to the Bannon/Trump worldview that guys like Strange want nothing to do with, even if their positions on things are carbon copyish. Bannon&#39;s definitely trying to take over the party but in reality not change much, except any semblance of cooperation with moderates or Democrats. And appeal moreso to extremists...who are crazed and horrible, but energetic as hell. He definitely recognizes the value in this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a really thought provoking book called Democracy in Chains by Nancy MacLean who&#39;s a historian and professor at Duke. A point that really stuck with me is that the same forces who have been pushing for smaller federal government also push to diminish local governments as well (county and city). These extremely rich forces see state government as the most easily manipulatable and susceptible to bribery and puppetry. All with the intention of maintaining an elite who call the shots, and increase their wealth thru less regulation and generous tax benefits, push wars, protect their interests and fund right extremism in Israel (Mercer and Sheldon Adelson). </p>

<p>I think when you look at the Mercer&#39;s and the &quot;interests&quot; they fund, including Bannon, there is an agenda to allow corporations and dark money to massively fund candidates and to indoctrinate us with spontaneous &quot;grassroots&quot; efforts that are amazing at pulling us into their agendas, by calling on our disdain for big government, the establishment, globalization, racial/sexual concerns, us versus them, nationalism, etc... They do a great job pulling in the crazies, as you mentioned, as well. Ultimately, none of their actual plans benefit us, it has no true political ideology other than to enforce Plutocracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read that book yet but was following the instant backlash it received...which was quick and died down, I don&#39;t think she had to make any retractions (unlike a book like Clinton Cash), which makes me think she was mostly correct. Seemed to be this focus on the idea that Koch-style libertarianism has weaponized Bircher era existential fear of government overreach, the appeal of total freedom and pure capitalism that libertarianism embraces...as tools to consolidate the corporate police state, essentially.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a skeptic at heart, it&#39;s not hard to see the tactics and agendas the figures you mentioned are pushing through but never really naming, deliberately. The same can be done with the billionaire Democrat donor subsystem, in which protecting the corporate model and big banks are paramount. I&#39;ll add the politicized media consolidation efforts of Sinclair Media as another facet of this, hoping to finally fulfill the opportunity Reagan presented when he snuffed the Fairness Doctrine, with Rush and Fox (and CNN, of course) following. </p>

<p>A good chunk of leftists will describe their system as finally allowing freedom to flourish, right wingers have the same message. There&#39;s all kinds of grey areas in between, and costs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you got it in regards to branding and marketing. It&#39;s rhetoric to further us versus them, similar to the Teaparty movement. People have picked up on a current flavor for populism, and this is the slogan. Get an angry person, who spouts America First and Traditional values, make sure they have a rough around the edges Teddy Roosevelt or Andrew Jackson persona, you know, say what&#39;s on their mind even if it&#39;s stupid and especially if its anti-pc because people will think they&#39;re real.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not from Alabama, but here are his various positions:

<p>The establishment R&#39;s and D&#39;s aren&#39;t really on different teams. They are both shit. Just one sells you blueberry flavored shit and one sells you strawberry flavored shit. They are both part of the corrupted system and want to stay in power for max bucks. How else do you think people like Pelosi end up with $100 mil in the bank off of $400k salaries?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All critiques against the extant parties are warranted...does this mean Moore is any better? Seems he picks and chooses which establishment conventions he follows. Being &quot;anti&quot; various things when such things are widely hated (usually with good reason) is a good way to sneak into power and mask your true self...which may be worse in different ways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alabamian here, you&#39;re right that the state is mostly rural, but there are huge numbers in cities, even Republicans, that are horrified by the effect Roy Moore will have on the state. </p>

<p>Take Huntsville for example, home to the largest NASA center in the country, and a rapidly growing hub for engineering for the entire South. Electing a guy who said 9/11 was god&#39;s punishment for gay marriage could seriously damage a potential future that would bring massive prosperity to the state. Remember what happened to North Carolina and their trans bill? He could literally take away thousands of great jobs from tech companies considering coming to our state. It&#39;s fucked man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the article. You also have to wonder if there&#39;s a strict alliance to the Bannon/Trump worldview that guys like Strange want nothing to do with, even if their positions on things are carbon copyish. Bannon&#39;s definitely trying to take over the party but in reality not change much, except any semblance of cooperation with moderates or Democrats. And appeal moreso to extremists...who are crazed and horrible, but energetic as hell. He definitely recognizes the value in this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think alot of it has to do with the right&#39;s embrace of conspiracy-everywhere thinking over time, which is now ubiquitous in their MSM outlets (and which Democrats have embraced with the Trump investigations). Also you have a generation of young skeptics who were nursed on Alex Jones, and look what he turned into-- the ultimate gatekeeping, fear-mongering conspiracy partisan. Currently blowing off all allegations against Roy Moore, not coincidentally.   </p>
