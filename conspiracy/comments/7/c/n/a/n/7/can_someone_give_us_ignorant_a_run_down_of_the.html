<p>I think this would be very beneficial to the sub because many of us are new, or work full time so its hard to put all of this in context. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At first, they tried to explain the timestamps by saying that Twitter shows all tweets in Pacific time, regardless of location. Not true. Then they tried to make up some lame daylight savings time excuse. That didn&#39;t last long. Now they&#39;re saying that Q tweeted it 12 hours earlier. They&#39;ve got a screenshot of a tweet, but no link. Of course they don&#39;t have a link, it&#39;s photoshopped. </p>

<p>I keep saying &quot;they&quot; because it&#39;s clear there&#39;s an organized effort to keep pushing this BS story. I was involved over on 4ch in the beginning. Dozens of anons are repeatedly manufacturing evidence &amp; collaborating to vouch for one another &amp; discredit anyone telling the truth. To what end, I can&#39;t say. It could just be a bunch of people who enjoy making others look silly. That&#39;s innocent enough, I suppose. Or there could be a more sinister explanation. </p>

<p>At the risk of sounding like a crazy person, I suspect it&#39;s the latter. This has all the hallmarks of a signature Clinton move. Most of the wild rumors about the Clintons were started by the Clintons themselves. They bait people into making ridiculous claims about them. They let the buzz build. They then disprove the wildest of the claims. The people making those claims now look like fools, and no one pays attention to any of the less-wild claims. No one pursues any of the lesser claims, some of which are probably true, because the whole thing ends up looking like a witch hunt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>on or about oct 29th an anon on 4chan calling himself q patriot started posting interesting questions to /pol. there also is another anon dubbed megaanon who was posting similar information. some of what both have said has panned out but other tidbits havent. 
most of it is related to world wide conspiracies and interconnections between political bad guys/gals and governments. IMHO there seems to be some credibility to the path both of these anons are taking us down. i purposely kept this description short i am sure others might elaborate more. or ask more questions for further info   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It begins with 4chan message boards.  It is a forum established by super smart computer people where you can supposedly post completely untraceable and anonymous.  Several people have used it since the election as whistleblowers, who clearly were high-ranking insiders.  The latest person &quot;Q&quot; stands for &quot;Q clearance.&quot;  Very high clearance. He began posting about a week and a half ago revealing secrets and misdirection.  Q is traveling with the president and has posted photos mentioned above and simultaneously posted specific sequenced characters Trump would also tweet.  This makes a large following believe he is legitimate. Each day he posts information alluding to the coming purge in America to free us from corruption. He claimed Saudi Arabia would be first, then the US.  He is recently posting lists of questions directing the narrative. It deals with the Mueller indictments, eliminating the CIA and Federal Reserve, rounding up Soros and Rothschilds, etc . The purge supposedly begins this week.  There are good videos explaining the situation by Tracy Beanz and Destroying the Illusion&#39;s Jordan Sather.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically,</p>

<p>There is ANON, A.K.A. &#39;Q&#39;; referencing a DOE top-security clearance.</p>

<p>&#39;Q&#39; attached to intelligence groups, generally means Counter-intelligence (CI) - it&#39;s up to you to decide the LARP</p>

<p>From this sense of authority, and mystery, a number of puzzles based both on sequence of association and analogy, give clues to a process within government taking place on a military/FBI level. </p>

<p>This is in-tune to the dismantlement of elites in foreign countries, who have ties to child-trafficking and old-power (arguably, one in the same).</p>

<p>SA has been purged of 800 billion USD worth of child-traffickers. </p>

<p>215 indictments wait to be handed over to LEO/FEDS for rounding up.</p>

<p>That being said,</p>

<p>justly it has been defined that the military, who had a bone to pick since 9/11 - pentagon attack, ONI/MI - is staging a patriotic action. To analogy, Old-Money is like picking a fight as Cesar and the senate with the praetorian guard. </p>

<p>Using MI and lateral-evidence from data collection agencies, a profile of old-money oligarchs and &#39;the swamp&#39;, related to treason and child-trafficking, seems about to be exposed.</p>

<p>The sidelines exist to be MI/FBI/NSA   Vs. Old-money, Politicians, the MSM, and the CIA</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It all sounds cryptic &amp; covert but frankly I believe it&#39;s nothing more than disinformation used to lather up Trumps base to detract from the investigation. Trump is definitely on this &quot;trip&quot; for one purpose, to meet with Putin.
There is a &quot;war &quot; taking place in US between the liberal/conservative elites. A &quot;tit for tat&quot; if you will. Each exposing the other hoping to win favor with the masses. They are playing chicken with each other in order to bring each other down. Who will win unsure but the collateral damage will be great and the &quot;American&quot; ideal will be turned on its head. To me this is what Bannon has wanted all along. A population of citizens who are confused, fearful and distrustful of everything. That&#39;s a prerequisite for a country who is vulnerable to an outsider to come in and appear to calm the masses, ensure safety, bring the country back in order only to begin their shell game all over again</p>

<p>I’ve seen 4chan pull off some truly incredible stuff but they are also amazing at taking people on ruse cruises. My fingers are crossed that Q Anon is real and realizes the potential of 4Chans “weaponized autism”.</p>
