<p>EDIT:
Their greed <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/financial-crisis-cost-gao_n_2687553">cost the US approx $22 Trillion</a>.  This is much bigger than Roger Ver &amp; some miners in China vs Bitcoin Core. What is at stake is the future of the global economy.</p>

<p>EDIT 2:</p>

<h3>TL;DR Bitcoin was created in response to the 2008/2009 Global Financial Crisis. Bitcoin (BTC) is now controlled by those who were instrumental in creating the crisis. (By &quot;crisis&quot; I mean theft of billions (trillions?!) of dollars)</h3>

    <div class="md"><p>Litecoin can handle the demand far more acceptably in my opinion. LTC was built &quot;4x&quot; outright and can easily handle current volume of BTC 4x over, at transaction times that are far more worthy of day to day operations. It was like that from block one. Never mind the fees being far less as well. Frankly, if people understood what LTC was designed to do, Bitcoin Cash wouldn&#39;t even exist. It wouldn&#39;t have needed to. There&#39;s already a fully functioning chain that does it better and is seeing its own improvements WITHOUT the risk of a fork. </p>

<p>Besides, you&#39;re pimping a single investment (or whatever you wish to call it) and that&#39;s foolish. Diversification is a far better choice financially, and what makes cryptocurrency so interesting as well. There&#39;s a lot of ideas to back, different ways of solving the same problem.</p>

<p>In the past years, many from the banking industry have made the switch to Bitcoin. Why? Because many of them see that cryptocurrency is the future and the old banking system is dying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would someone be able to hack an account and steal bitcoins?
They would need more processing power than the top 1000 supercomputers combined to take control of the network for a few minutes if that. Then the network will revert back to the pre-hack state.</p>

<p>What if the Internet were to stop working?
If the internet went down globablly you would probably have larger issues. </p>

<p>Or what would you do during a blackout?
Have some spare USD. Not a lot of shops would be open during a blackout.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fairly knowledgeable about bitcoin. </p>

<p>The first scenario would basically freeze bitcoin funds until the Internet came back up. </p>

<p>The second would be to not use bitcoin, though obviously credit cards would fail to work during a blackout too. </p>

<p>The third is impossible. Bitcoin is open source in all ways, so it would have to be hidden in plain sight.  Onyop of that a hacker could make himself a multimillionaire easily if he could hack bitcoin wallets now. You can hide things in plain sight from a few programmers, not tens of thousands with a million dollar reward.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bitcoin is stored in wallets, and wallets are long strings of numbers. So long that if you used every computer on earth you would be unlikely to stumble on one randomly before the heat death of the universe. If someone stores bitcoin in a wallet (and makes no backup), and then their harddrive dies or they delete their wallet, those coins are lost forever.</p>

<p>It&#39;s widely reported that the original creator of bitcoin lost his wallet for a large amount of the initial bitcoin that was created in the first few months that the network was running (largely off one machine he launched the network on). Also a lot of the early adopters of bitcoin deleted their clients after running it for a year or so, and their funds would have been lost forever as well. There&#39;s probably a harddrive in a landfill somewhere with ~10 million USD worth of bitcoin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Last week a coworker started ranting out loud to himself about how he had decided to buy a couple $k of bitcoin the night before and by the time he arrived in the office the next day he had lost almost 600$usd. </p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I think the intentions for the currency are noble (if what people repeat about it is actually true), but at the same time its strengths seem to also be its weakness. </p>

<p>I’m sure a lot of people have made a killing by trading in this thing. I’m just not sure those were the “little people” making a large profit. </p>

<p>Also, I don’t have a very good and clear understanding of how this stuff works (I’m a software engineer, not talking from a technology perspective, but rather from a finance/economic standpoint), but from a very far distance it would appear that you’re buying virtual money equivalency at a point in time, whose actual dollar amount fluctuates depending on supply and demand. If I were a very rich person, I could start buying to drive the price up and sell when the profit is high enough. How is this different than all the shenanigans on Wall Street currency exchange?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it’s not. I mined back when you could mine with a cpu (2009). And bitcoins were a fraction of a penny on the first markets. Bitcoin suffered a bunch of massive failures/disasters/hacks that set its development back. Banks freezing accounts, people shutting down sites and stealing the coins. It was a struggle. There’s no way in hell someone who wanted it to succeed, with a ton of money, was involved early on. If anything, the banks were constantly freezing/closing accounts that had anything to do with BTC. The community made it happen, slowly but surely. But man it was rough back in the day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Litecoin can handle the demand far more acceptably in my opinion. LTC was built &quot;4x&quot; outright and can easily handle current volume of BTC 4x over, at transaction times that are far more worthy of day to day operations. It was like that from block one. Never mind the fees being far less as well. Frankly, if people understood what LTC was designed to do, Bitcoin Cash wouldn&#39;t even exist. It wouldn&#39;t have needed to. There&#39;s already a fully functioning chain that does it better and is seeing its own improvements WITHOUT the risk of a fork. </p>

<p>Besides, you&#39;re pimping a single investment (or whatever you wish to call it) and that&#39;s foolish. Diversification is a far better choice financially, and what makes cryptocurrency so interesting as well. There&#39;s a lot of ideas to back, different ways of solving the same problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ethereum is moving to Proof of Stake. Don&#39;t ask me how, but long-term Proof-of-Stake does not work. Proof-of-work is necessary.</p>

<p>So while the Ethereum devs may be better technically (I actually know very little about them aside from Vitalik), they are making a monumental mistake by switching to PoS.</p>
