Kurt Cobain&#39;s Producer from Sub Pop who has been a subject of controversey regarding his death, it appears his relative or brother worked for Clinton/Obama in DoE and exports.</p>

<p>tl;dr2 - Poneman worked as Energy Secretary for Obama admin, then became CEO of the only domestic company that enriches uranium, then the centrifuge project in Ohio was defunded right after the Obama admin gave Iran the right to enrich uranium, then Poneman emailed and called Podesta to tell him decisions relating to the project before he notified the public, possibly contributing to insider trading.</p>

<p>Jon Poneman and Dan Poneman both played in bands when they were younger, in Toledo. Brothers in a band? </p>

<p>Dan plays in a band called &quot;Yellow-cake&quot; at DoE events.</p>

<p>Is this the response of his own? or is he telling a story about others?</p>

<p>Why does he attribute the origin of &quot;Grunge&quot; to Jon Poneman, yet there&#39;s no real definition to it outside of the music movement?</p>

<p>What connection does Poneman have?</p>

<p>Finding the histories of both Jon and Dan Poneman is not all clear on the net, but it appears they were born in Toldeo within years, like brothers would be.</p>

<p>Different mothers?</p>

<p>Dan Poneman just happens to work in DoE for exports. and worked with Clinton/Obama admin then went on to work for as a principal of The Scowcroft Group. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sub Pop is a record label founded in 1986 by Bruce Pavitt. In 1988, Sub Pop Records LLC was formed by Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in Seattle, Washington. Sub Pop achieved fame in the late 1980s for first signing Seattle bands such as <strong>Nirvana, Soundgarden,</strong> and Mudhoney, central players in the emerging grunge movement.[1]</p>

<p>Also in 1987, Jonathan Poneman provided $20,000 in funding for Sub Pop to release the debut Soundgarden single &quot;Hunted Down&quot;/&quot;Nothing to Say&quot; in July 1987, followed by the band&#39;s first EP Screaming Life that October.[6] Poneman soon became a full partner in the label. </p>

<p>Poneman and Pavitt had a disagreement about the direction the label should take, with Poneman wanting the label to become larger and make more money.[13] In 1996, unable to take the new corporate culture following the Warner partnership, Bruce Pavitt left the label and was able to spend more time with his family.[16] The split between Pavitt and Poneman was not amicable, and they did not speak for seven years.[16]

<p>He is a graduate of Whitmer High School in <strong>Toledo, Ohio.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Daniel B. Poneman was nominated by President Barack Obama to be United States Deputy Secretary of Energy on April 20, 2009, and was confirmed by the United States Senate on May 18, 2009. He also served as Chief Operating Officer of the Department of Energy.</strong> Poneman served as Acting Secretary of Energy following the resignation of Secretary Chu on April 22, 2013 until his successor, Ernest Moniz was confirmed by the Senate and was sworn in on May 21, 2013.
Poneman was a principal of The Scowcroft Group, a consulting firm in Washington, D.C., in the eight years prior to his appointment to the United States Department of Energy. Before his consulting role, Poneman was also a partner in the law firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson.[3] <strong>Between 1993 and 1996, Poneman served as Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Nonproliferation and Export Controls at the National Security Council.</strong> He joined the NSC staff in 1990 as the Director of Defense Policy and Arms Control after also serving as a White House Fellow in the United States Department of Energy.[3]</p>

<p>This email is from Dan Poneman. United States Deputy Secretary of Energy from 2009-2014.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Poneman">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Poneman</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s a bit of controversy surrounding Poneman after he left the Obama admin to take a revolving door position as CEO of Centrus Energy Corp.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/dan-poneman-centrus-116089">http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/dan-poneman-centrus-116089</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Congress created (Centrus) by privatizing DOE’s uranium enrichment operations in the 1990s, with visions of efficiency and cost savings, but instead Centrus has needed repeated infusions of federal aid to stay afloat in order to preserve U.S. military needs.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centrus&#39; biggest initiative is</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the American Centrifuge Project in Piketon, Ohio. That project received substantial federal aid, including complicated transfers of government uranium liabilities that the company essentially turned into cash.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Centrus has had difficulty securing funding for the Centrifuge project these last two years:</p>

<p>February 20, 2016</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Department of Energy announced in September that it would not pay for additional research at Piketon after Sept. 30, 2015. Centrus, the company that operated the plant, briefly explored other uses, but it has decided to shutter the plant.</p>

<p>“This is just wrong,&quot; said U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Cincinnati.</p>

<p>“I find it particularly troubling that on the heels of the administration&#39;s Iran deal that recognizes Iran&#39;s right to enrich, conduct research and maintain access to more than 6,000 centrifuges, it is also shutting down centrifuges and laying off workers at our only American-owned enrichment capability.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>HERE IS THE PAYOFF:</p>

<p>Centrus Energy Corp is a publicly held company.</p>

<p><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/leu?ltr=1">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/leu?ltr=1</a></p>

<p>Its share price in 2007 was over $6000.</p>

<p>In 2011 the share price was over $640.</p>

<p>Today the share price is $4.50</p>

<h1>I would like to know why Poneman called Podesta to give him inside information about decisions regarding the Ohio Centrifuge project before the public was notified, and whether any insider trading occurred based on that information.</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>[–]REDACTED 5 points an hour ago </p>

<p>Kurt Cobains wife, Courtney, was molested by Harvey Weinstein at a Hollywood party according to her comment on Access.</p>

<p>Courtney, as a result, had dirt on Hillary’s largest donor in Hollywood.</p>

<p>The Podesta brothers were part of the deal to get the Uranium out of the US via Canada so that it could be used to fund the DNC - which is the statement of Donna Brazile regarding the reason for the Hillary take over of the DNC.</p>

<p>But remember how the DNC went bankrupt?</p>

<p>That’s the lynchpin. Where did the money go and who used it?</p>

<p>It was either Obama or it was Kaine. Most likely Obama.</p>

<p>Weinstein knew and realized Courtney found out - remember she made her second album with Billy Corgan (from Chicago.) Billy is not a leftist. So, Courtney needed to be silenced. But she made the comment about Harvey on Access so she was too close.</p>

<p>So, they sent Courtney a message via her husband.</p>
