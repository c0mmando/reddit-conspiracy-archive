       Does any else see any possibility in the idea that Russia is playing both sides of America the same way they did in the Ukraine?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been playing with this idea that Russia did hack the DNC, killed Seth Rich, and then had the right and left try to argue it out from two separate point of views of who did what and what happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It makes me seem like I'm a grandpa raving about commies, but I can't stop feeling like this divide between Americans definitely exists, but is being provoked to a breaking point. Especially with all the alleged findings about Russian bots on both the far left and the far right.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don't confidently believe many of the theories on here, I've seen plenty of articles and pieces of information that shows me you guys have a more centered reaction to outrageous ideas. At this point, if we are fighting each other at the extra provocation of Russia, that's a uniting issue Americans can use to re-find common ground and facilitate reasonable debate instead of whatever the fuck is happening now.

       Ok. 1)  Do you think Russia influenced our election in a significant way? 2) Do  you think the Trump campaign conspired to help Russia?  3) What laws do you suspect the trump campaign broke in their potential collusion?

         Yes, not through changing votes or denying access but instead through the creation of a mindset and the use of certain topics on both sides to excite a specific reaction from both sides.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         I think Russia helped and hurt both Trump and Clinton separately, and now there are reports of maybe starting to roll back the strength of the Maginsky act.

       <li>
        <p>
         I'm not a lawyer and don't really know much about the specifics, but the way I view it is that if Russia did change the American cultural environment through subtle participation in pop culture (the internet mostly) then we are currently dealing with a serious international issue since my theory also implicates they killed Seth Rich for political purpose.

       The way culture has changed, the way in which we're told is dangerous, is that people are starting to massively distrust government and the mainstream media. That isn't because of Russians planting fake news, that's because there is plenty of evidence that the government and mainstream media has lied about so much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Always think about what there is evidence for, always think about who benefits. That leads you closer to the truth.

       What we know: Trump and his team denied all knowledge and since it has come to light that at least ten members of the campaign had Russian contracts. In the GP guilty plea we know the Trump campaign knew about the emails before they were released. There's a special council shaking stuff up headed for the top...     I don't understand how anybody who claims to relate to conspiracies can be utterly dismissive of a real conspiracy budding before our eyes. Can you imagine during Nixon's Watergate running around advocating that not a real story? Just because it doesn't fit your world view doesn't mean it doesn't belong

       There's a guy named Robert Mueller who's currently working on that stay tuned pal. The former campaign manager and his partner currently are facing charges already, while former cabinet member NSA director Michael Flynn is looking at charges from kidnapping to conspiracy. As I said,  there's currently a special council on the matter working their way to the top. Not speculation, not opinion. Literally people facing conspiracy charges while so called conspiracy fans barter the reality that's actually happening

       I could entertain this theory if there was evidence of a hack. Nearly 18 months in and we have:
      </p>
      <p>
       Evidence:
- Unnamed Russian may have bought 100k worth of Facebook ads
      </p>
      <p>
       Add in Donna Brazile book. Add in that the CIA had the ability to frame people for their own hacking. It just doesn't add up. If there was concrete evidence, it would have been used to take down Trump long ago.

       I'm arguing that Russia doesn't care for Trump, or Clinton. They looking to sow confusion and distrust among each other. Getting Trump elected is helpful because who else makes enough noise to distract from looking at the bigger picture.

       The Russians bought anti-Trump ads? Do you have a source for that? I know they bought ads for people like Stein but that goes with the thesis they were trying to get Trump elected and wanted to take votes away from Clinton.

       I don't think it's Russia doing it. I think that thinking in terms of nations is the wrong way to go about it. We should be thinking in terms of wealthy factions, global corporations etc. Nations are useful to these people for presenting us with enemies and things to fear.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people who really benefit from a divided America are not Russians. And the whole 'Russia did it' narrative is being pushed so hard in the mainstream that I think it's clear that's what TPTB want the masses to believe. If we learn anything, it should be that paying attention to the mainstream media and believing the things they say is a bad idea and will lead us down a path that benefits those that profit from our misery and division.

       Every advanced country in the world has agents and double agents. Are you really so naive to think the US hasn't influenced every single other government on the planet? The ones we can't infiltrate we simply over throw. Using propaganda and false flags, manipulating the general public who doesn't want to see anything but "The US is the greatest country in the world" is child's play. This is beyond obvious and straight up insulting to people who can see the geopolitical shenanigans from a neutral perspective.

         Yes, not through changing votes or denying access but instead through the creation of a mindset and the use of certain topics on both sides to excite a specific reaction from both sides.

         I'm not a lawyer and don't really know much about the specifics, but the way I view it is that if Russia did change the American cultural environment through subtle participation in pop culture (the internet mostly) then we are currently dealing with a serious international issue since my theory also implicates they killed Seth Rich for political purpose.

       What we know: Trump and his team denied all knowledge and since it has come to light that at least ten members of the campaign had Russian contracts. In the GP guilty plea we know the Trump campaign knew about the emails before they were released. There's a special council shaking stuff up headed for the top...     I don't understand how anybody who claims to relate to conspiracies can be utterly dismissive of a real conspiracy budding before our eyes. Can you imagine during Nixon's Watergate running around advocating that not a real story? Just because it doesn't fit your world view doesn't mean it doesn't belong
