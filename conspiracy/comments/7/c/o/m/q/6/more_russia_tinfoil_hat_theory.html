        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Does any else see any possibility in the idea that Russia is playing both sides of America the same way they did in the Ukraine?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been playing with this idea that Russia did hack the DNC, killed Seth Rich, and then had the right and left try to argue it out from two separate point of views of who did what and what happened.</p>

<p>It makes me seem like I&#39;m a grandpa raving about commies, but I can&#39;t stop feeling like this divide between Americans definitely exists, but is being provoked to a breaking point. Especially with all the alleged findings about Russian bots on both the far left and the far right.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t confidently believe many of the theories on here, I&#39;ve seen plenty of articles and pieces of information that shows me you guys have a more centered reaction to outrageous ideas. At this point, if we are fighting each other at the extra provocation of Russia, that&#39;s a uniting issue Americans can use to re-find common ground and facilitate reasonable debate instead of whatever the fuck is happening now.</p>

<li><p>Yes, not through changing votes or denying access but instead through the creation of a mindset and the use of certain topics on both sides to excite a specific reaction from both sides.</p></li>
<li><p>I think Russia helped and hurt both Trump and Clinton separately, and now there are reports of maybe starting to roll back the strength of the Maginsky act.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m not a lawyer and don&#39;t really know much about the specifics, but the way I view it is that if Russia did change the American cultural environment through subtle participation in pop culture (the internet mostly) then we are currently dealing with a serious international issue since my theory also implicates they killed Seth Rich for political purpose.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>What we know: Trump and his team denied all knowledge and since it has come to light that at least ten members of the campaign had Russian contracts. In the GP guilty plea we know the Trump campaign knew about the emails before they were released. There&#39;s a special council shaking stuff up headed for the top...     I don&#39;t understand how anybody who claims to relate to conspiracies can be utterly dismissive of a real conspiracy budding before our eyes. Can you imagine during Nixon&#39;s Watergate running around advocating that not a real story? Just because it doesn&#39;t fit your world view doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t belong</p>

<p>The people who really benefit from a divided America are not Russians.

    <div class="md"><p>Every advanced country in the world has agents and double agents. Are you really so naive to think the US hasn&#39;t influenced every single other government on the planet? The ones we can&#39;t infiltrate we simply over throw. Using propaganda and false flags, manipulating the general public who doesn&#39;t want to see anything but &quot;The US is the greatest country in the world&quot; is child&#39;s play. This is beyond obvious and straight up insulting to people who can see the geopolitical shenanigans from a neutral perspective. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a very fair perspective. </p>

<p>I really don&#39;t have special evidence or information, but to me these are dots that connect too well compared to everything I&#39;ve read this past year.</p>

<p>(I get my &quot;news&quot; by constantly browsing r/worldnews, r/news, r/the_donald, and r/politics if you can consider that as getting news I still can&#39;t decide)</p>

<li><p>Yes, not through changing votes or denying access but instead through the creation of a mindset and the use of certain topics on both sides to excite a specific reaction from both sides.</p></li>
<li><p>I think Russia helped and hurt both Trump and Clinton separately, and now there are reports of maybe starting to roll back the strength of the Maginsky act.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m not a lawyer and don&#39;t really know much about the specifics, but the way I view it is that if Russia did change the American cultural environment through subtle participation in pop culture (the internet mostly) then we are currently dealing with a serious international issue since my theory also implicates they killed Seth Rich for political purpose.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>What we know: Trump and his team denied all knowledge and since it has come to light that at least ten members of the campaign had Russian contracts. In the GP guilty plea we know the Trump campaign knew about the emails before they were released. There&#39;s a special council shaking stuff up headed for the top...     I don&#39;t understand how anybody who claims to relate to conspiracies can be utterly dismissive of a real conspiracy budding before our eyes. Can you imagine during Nixon&#39;s Watergate running around advocating that not a real story? Just because it doesn&#39;t fit your world view doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t belong</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t follow just the mainstream media. I&#39;ve been following all sources of news and have been treating them with as much unbiased understanding as possible. </p>

<p>There definitely are groups to think about like corporations or the wealthy elite, but that&#39;s not to say those groups are separate from Russia with different goals that could clash against each other.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know Russia&#39;s motive, but that&#39;s the point of conspiracies you don&#39;t have the whole picture but you work towards it.</p>
