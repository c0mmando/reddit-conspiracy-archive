    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sure. Maybe some crony capitalism. Some scam capitalism where corrupt people are in control of it. If you&#39;re fighting for actual freedom then you should be fighting for an actual capitalist country where people are actually free and corrupt owners and politicians are eliminated. You&#39;re absolutely 100% never free in socialism. Even in the worst capitalist systems if you don&#39;t like what a company does and the majority of a population agrees you can just not spend your money there resulting in a business shutting down. Or a person can capitalize on a business doing shitty business and start a similar business and compete. Capitalism comes with flaws of course but in every case scenario capitalism absolutely shits on socialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you&#39;ve described is definitely not how our version of capitalism works, though. Can I start a pharmaceutical company to compete with the shitty practices currently in place in &quot;medicine&quot; and succeed? How about an energy company? These corporations have so much power that they control most things. So while I agree that a true capitalist system would be much better than the oligarchy we have now, it&#39;s a pretty low bar to set. Capitalism vs Communism is as much a false dichotomy as left vs. right is, in my opinion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My family and I were low income before Obamacare, and what we did (and still do in some cases) was negotiate with the doctors directly and only had cheap high deductible insurance.  A check up at the doctors might be a $25 co-pay, but the insurance was paying $150 or so, so the cost with insurance was $175 for a 20 minute checkup.   We only paid like $40 out of pocket by talking to the doctors directly.  Even now, our deductible is 6 or 7k, my son needs speech therapy and was diagnoses, so Insurance has to pay, but since we are a young family, we don&#39;t use insurance enough to meet the deductible.  If we used our insurance for speech, we&#39;d have to pay $200 a season, twice a week, 50 or so weeks a year, we&#39;d have to pay out $1,600 a month for 4 or 5 months before insurance would kick in.  Instead we negotiated and pay $60 a session and by the end of the year, it will be close to what our deductible would be and we can still write it off on taxes.  It&#39;s a no brainer imo, $480 in cost a month vs $1,600, If I wanted to be homeless, there are a lot of easier ways to go about doing it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not very deep in regards to what &quot;free market capitalism&quot;, &quot;socialism&quot; and &quot;conspiracy&quot; mean. Do you push for regulatory capitalism, which is not true &quot;free market&quot;? If so, many of the most fundamental regulations were put in place so the &quot;State&quot; can intervene so corporations provide socially beneficial outcomes. Are you aware why antitrust, anti monopoly, liability and worker safety/wage regulations were put in place? </p>

<p>There&#39;s a wide range of forms of Socialism, and America certainly uses a mixed economy, which is also associated with Social Democratic countries and various forms of scoialism. Mainly thru distribution of taxes, inflation price freezing and examples of natural resource payments like in Alaska, we lean into market socialism here.</p>

<p>Lastly, subscribing to conspiracies has nothing to do with political, economic or policy affiliations. There&#39;s a significant amount if anarchists in this sub. Are they not allowed either. I&#39;ve seen a lot of self-proclaimed Nazi&#39;s too (most likely larpers), should they be banned by you? Maybe you should start your own sub, where you don&#39;t have yo fear other&#39;s thoughts or opinions. Echochambers and safe spaces are what you are looking for</p>

Public education being funded by government and being free for citizens is halfway socialist. People have the option to send their kids to private schools and other schools correct? If it were fully socialist you&#39;d have to go to that public school and would have no options. Health care for all doesn&#39;t work and I&#39;m not advocating that we should have a health care for all. I&#39;d much rather pay 100 extra dollars every month so I can get better medicine and better medical attention. </p>

<p>Half socialist is all most want, with options for private ventures to coexist. Just that it benefits the masses more than the masters. A basic healthcare system NOT based on profit( this is one of the absolute most important parts with that) and a UBi would only improve the capitalistic aspects of American life, create even more jobs,  and help innovation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Taxes never help capitalism. JFK and Reagan knew that. Healthcare for all would be paid for by taxes no? Also, did free market healthcare not still have options for low income families to get insurance? My health insurance wasn&#39;t 100 dollars either. I was going to get on Medicare but I got another job so I would&#39;ve been making too much and I would&#39;ve been paying 100 dollars less for generic knock off medicine of the meds I need every month and would&#39;ve had to change doctors. With the free market insurance I paid around 200 dollars, it covered absolutely everything and every doctor in my state took the insurance, and I&#39;d be able to get the medicine I prefer. Are you saying Obamacare is good healthcare? I gotta log off, continue discussion later?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trickle up economics actually works. While I actually see why taxation can be seen as theft, so can the origin of most land and other “personal property” My view is taxes support the military and police and a bunch of other stuff that is already corrupted by capitalism. Some things should NOT be for profit. Justice and defense should be concerned with efficiency and truth, not funding through forfeiture. Capitalism in these fields creates an artificial demand for opponents. Empty jails create criminals. Unfired tanks start wars. As for those taxes, They’re not going away as long as this country is a thing. If you can’t beat em, make sure they’re no longer beating you either. </p>

<p>Obamacare isn’t socialism. It’s insurance life support, but I DO like some of the protections it gives the already ill, while there are surely things I don’t like about it, and it does need to evolve. I don’t like the mandate, although I understand it, I would not have issue if it wasn’t all $ for insurance companies. It def fucked over a lot of people, but it may well have saved just as many.  The Aca, flawed as it is, was already too much of a compromise and could have been much better, but not likely enough even then. Baby steps was the idea. There are very valid reasons to not go full socialistic, but unregulated capitalism will wreck the entire globe’s future for greenbacks now. I legitimately don’t think there’s as many hard socialists as you think, here least of all. Even most who bitch about capitalism want to retain some aspects of it, like small businesss ownership and freedom of choice. NO ISM alone is the solution. They can coexist on some levels. </p>

<p>They would disagree with you. The lower taxes each brought were either rescinded in a few years or had actually closed loopholes that brought back much of the lost revenue back to the government. It wasn&#39;t until Bush that tax cuts were real permanent tax cuts. We saw the effects of that first hand at the end of his reign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is Orwell in Homage to Catalonia, articulating very eloquently what attracts us to socialism. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I had dropped more or less by chance into the only community of any size in Western Europe where political consciousness and disbelief in capitalism were more normal than their opposites. Up here in Aragon one was among tens of thousands of people, mainly though not entirely of working-class origin, all living at the same level and mingling on terms of equality. In theory it was perfect equality, and even in practice it was not far from it. There is a sense in which it would be true to say that one was experiencing a foretaste of Socialism, by which I mean that the prevailing mental atmosphere was that of Socialism. Many of the normal motives of civilized life — snobbishness, money-grubbing, fear of the boss, etc. — had simply ceased to exist. The ordinary class-division of society had disappeared to an extent that is almost unthinkable in the money-tainted air of England; there was no one there except the peasants and ourselves, and no one owned anyone else as his master. Of course such a state of affairs could not last. It was simply a temporary and local phase in an enormous game that is being played over the whole surface of the earth. But it lasted long enough to have its effect upon anyone who experienced it. However much one cursed at the time, one realized afterwards that one had been in contact with something strange and valuable. One had been in a community where hope was more normal than apathy or cynicism, where the word ‘comrade’ stood for comradeship and not, as in most countries, for humbug. One had breathed the air of equality. I am well aware that it is now the fashion to deny that Socialism has anything to do with equality. In every country in the world a huge tribe of party-hacks and sleek little professors are busy ‘proving’ that Socialism means no more than a planned state-capitalism with the grab-motive left intact. But fortunately there also exists a vision of Socialism quite different from this. The thing that attracts ordinary men to Socialism and makes them willing to risk their skins for it, the ‘mystique’ of Socialism, is the idea of equality; to the vast majority of people Socialism means a classless society, or it means nothing at all. And it was here that those few months in the militia were valuable to me. For the Spanish militias, while they lasted, were a sort of microcosm of a classless society. In that community where no one was on the make, where there was a shortage of everything but no privilege and no boot-licking, one got, perhaps, a crude forecast of what the opening stages of Socialism might be like. And, after all, instead of disillusioning me it deeply attracted me. The effect was to make my desire to see Socialism established much more actual than it had been before. Partly, perhaps, this was due to the good luck of being among Spaniards, who, with their innate decency and their ever-present Anarchist tinge, would make even the opening stages of Socialism tolerable if they had the chance.</p>
