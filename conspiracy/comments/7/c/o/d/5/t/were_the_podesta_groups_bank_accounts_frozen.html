       It is quite strange that the Podesta Group is suddenly shutting down and employees were told NOT to expect another paycheck. While it is understandably that Tony Podesta would have to leave, why wouldn't the firm continue to operate through the end of 2017 and slowly figure out where it goes from here? The abrupt closure and "no paychecks" is very, very suspicious for a very wealthy company and the only thing that makes sense is that the Podesta group's bank accounts were FROZEN by the U.S. Gov't.

       I found that intriguing as well. Why would you just stop paying all employees right before the holidays? As fucked up as these people are, I would hope that they would atleast stick beside the people who have helped run their organization. Telling them "don't expect a paycheck after next week" is pretty abrupt. They have to still have cash in the bank, they were pulling in tens of millions of dollars. Unless, as you stated, their accounts have been frozen. Interesting times.

       I don't think they are frozen. They are just shutting down the Podesta Group. Kimberly Fritts (the current CEO of the Podesta Group) already opened her new company and took most of the employees and clients with her.

       Now i just did some more researching and other theories are:  Tony Podesta wanted Frittes to pay a whole lot to "buy" his shares of the firm and they could not reach an agreement...so she decided to just walk away and have the clients sign up with her (so no need to pay Tony anything.)

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        <strong>
         Chief Executive Officer Kimberly Fritts
        </strong>
        told employees Thursday afternoon she
        <strong>
         is working on launching a new firm that would take many of Podesta’s staff and clients with her
        </strong>
        , said two people familiar with the meeting. She told employees they
        <strong>
         shouldn’t expect a paycheck past Nov. 15
        </strong>
        , the people said.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So Podesta steps down, and the CEO is taking the employees and clients and starting her own firm. In that same breath, she explains that Podesta group will not pay salaries beyond this week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me like the business is crumbling and they are starting a new one (just read the article).

       Yes but originally, she announced she was going to just stay at the Podesta Group and re-name it.  Now, she is doing something slightly different - starting a new group.

       Yep.

      <p>
       I don't see how starting a new firm means the Podesta groups accounts are frozen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your questions:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is quite strange that the Podesta Group is suddenly shutting down and employees were told NOT to expect another paycheck.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       It isn't that strange if they are starting a new firm...
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The abrupt closure and "no paychecks" is very, very suspicious for a very wealthy company and the only thing that makes sense is that the Podesta group's bank accounts were FROZEN by the U.S. Gov't.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Or they are starting a new firm. Maybe Podesta
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       going down, in which case you probably don't want to keep running "The Podesta Group". Shut it down and start again.

       That's what literally happens whenever a company gets destroyed, it doesn't change anything? Some of the old employees leave and make a new unrelated company. From gaming: Gamespot's employees left after a scandal and made Giant Bomb. Capcom's employees left and made Arika Inc. and Platinum Games Inc.

       So I have a little different theory. We all believe the Podesta Group is going to get subpoenaed at some point. If the company no longer exists who will provide the documents? Who would be held accountable for lack of compliance? Now imagine as you are closing it is time to archive documents and shred old documents and accidentally you shred some that are to be retained, who would you have to hold accountable? Lastly if no subpoena of documents has been issued, the violation for incorrect shredding would be very small compared to say conspiracy or fraud. Point is the faster they can get closed and accidentally shred files the safer Podesta is. It also allows clients to enter into new agreements that comply with the law and blame bad actors at Podesta for any lawlessness and again no proof and nobody to hold accountable makes for a shitty case. This all smells of a defense lawyer idea of how to mitigate liability/criminal offenses available for a prosecuting attorney.

       it is almost always the REGISTERED AGENT for a company. Typically a lawyer but these guys use shell companies so you have to cross reference all companies registered on a given Registered Agent.  FOund on Secretary of State websites.
