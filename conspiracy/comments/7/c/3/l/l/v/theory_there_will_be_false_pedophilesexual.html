       The AL judge is claiming these claims are fake and politically motivated.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I guarantee some of the Hollywood circle is going to have some opportunistic victims. I'm in no way saying there are innocent predators, but ARE going to be some people who are simply seeking $$$ or their name in print.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think there will be "innocent" folks swept up in this recent trend, and the technology exists to fake evidence. And more alarming still, a large allegation that will be proven false and malicious, thereby creating the "need" for discretion or private trials. (Or someone will attack a perpetrator, and they will get increased protections).

       The problem with the Hollywood cases is that a lot of the kids' parents consented. As much as manmade law will be cited in rebuttal to this, it appears there is a more powerful form of law that governs the realm. Sins of the father so to speak.

       False allegations against whistle-blowers has been a topic of discussion for the 4 years I've been here. Stop trying to make this post and this sub political. We're beyond the party lines when we discuss cultural shaping.  And FFS, spend 2 minutes reading my profile. I'm no conservative.

       You don't even have to fake evidence, the current cultural shift will do the rest. Some middle age man now in a position of power, that in his youth mooned a group of sorority girls, may now be viewed as a sexual predators in the right light.

       Every "moon", "flash", "Tune into Tokyo", and "Titty Twister" from one's past is all now fair game.

       Alex Jones is just a journalist. Rarely does he break anything. Most of what he reports is already in the public domain. These conspiracy theories aren’t his. That’s just a tactic used to discredit them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump talked plenty about draining the swamp and crooked Hillary. With everything that was out there people thought he’d be doing more. Tbf, if a satanic cult is really in charge of the deep state of every powerful nation it’d be pretty fucking hard to take them down along with the central bank. But if That was the case and Trump was actually trying to do that, he’d have been JFK’d by now.

       I agree.  I'm finding all of this very weird actually.  Not the fact that all of this happened, because it was all pretty much well known that pedophiles and sick fuck's were involved in the entertainment industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why all of the sudden is shit hitting the fan?  EVERYONE who's anyone is throwing out accusations about some pretty powerful people.  Things that happened years ago.  I feel like it's to either distract people or I don't know.  It all feels weird and planned.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like, "oK we outed Weinstein... who's up next"??  I'm sure somebody will read this and think "how are you supporting pedophilia asshole"?  Ya, that's not what I'm saying.

       just a prediction- he seems like the obvious next choice given the recent trend.  And it seems like the media is ramping up the anti-scientology rhetoric, especially once leah remini starts bringing up molestation in the next few weeks.

       yes- i think they deserve scrutiny. but i think travolta is probably gay and being blackmailed by the church, and I don't think we need to be scrutinizing the sex lives of celebrities unless they're actually victimizing people.  And i think we should question how the media and certain advocacy groups are labeling sexual victimization.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd also put out there that setting up a system which sexually represses people promotes predatory behavior.  you see this in all sorts of religious/ hyper-conservative contexts.  Sexual repression drives a neurosis where people are uncomfortable with their sexuality and act out in extreme ways.  Then they blame the culture for being too liberal with sexuality, and they push even more modesty.

       I don't think you're thinking too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       As an actual physical/sexual assualt survivor, I want to physically hurt the "activists" who claim being offended/offering a counterpoint is an assault. Yes, I can feel assaulted by a gaze, a gesture, a sexual comment, but I can't claim an alternative perspective is an assualt, no matter how narrowminded. A guy hitting on me is not on the same level as the guy who attempted to rape me, vs the guys who actually DID. Painting it all with the same brush hurts people who need genuine help.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I'm probably a prude, when it comes to the LGBTQ community, because I don't like porn, have mixed feelings about drag and from other women, because my sexuality isn't my currency. I dress modestly, even when going out. I'll show shoulder or back before I show cleavage. I've had partners that LOVE that I'm limited in my PDA and let my partner wander at an event, not clinging like an accessory or submissive wench. And I don't get Instagram, selfies, Tinder etc, because intimacy is for my home, not the gawddamn internet!

      <p>
       Incel deserved the ban. I had joined both that sub and /foreveralone, thinking it was ok that I was chaste/abstinent. It never occurred to either sub that their attitudes are what make them so unattractive. I've fucked the "unfuckable", based purely on personality and wit. There's a tall piece of pock-mocked, momma-livin ginger on my block that could possibly get a piece of he could make eye contact...

       From the first months they tore down bill cosby, bill orielly, tried to get Shaun hanitty, then tried to get trump but that backfired during the election, fast forward and anthony wiener gets locked up had a laptop you all know had questionable shit on it possibly alluding to the whole ring of pedos now hollywoods dropping left and right HUGE famous actors go from loved to hated in an instant after a unproven allegation said to a media journalist.. theres an agenda i believe its all to eventually turn women on men and to take trump out. I predict a handful of women will come out of the woodwork and claim against trump again now that the media is gaining steam and public attention. Or this is the public distraction while the cia starts another war at the moment.

       No just that all this bs is to brainwash the masses into accepting an allegation and to condemn the one being accused. With an end goal to make people care about any and all accusations so the next time a woman comes out that trump raped her people will care this time around since we've been groomed.

       If you really think about it with all these allegations of sexual abuse flying around everywhere one can conceivably create a campaign to destroy someone's life quite easily now. All you need is a few people to lie for you and let social media do the rest of the work in ruining a person's life.

       I've thought this for a while. Pedophilia will be weaponized. Let's say you dissent from the government. They seize your pc and there is some thumbnail or pic you briefly looked at on Reddit. NSFW is impossible to police for age except by eyeballing it. You can't really know what you are about to see just based on the thumbnail. What if it's true that the typical redditor simply surfing
