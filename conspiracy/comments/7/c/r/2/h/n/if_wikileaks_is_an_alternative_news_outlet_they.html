       I know the first response I'm going to get is that WikiLeaks pride themselves on being impartial, and yes this is true. But doesn't every media outlet claim to be impartial? Isn't that essentially the goal of journalism anyways, even though it's not really the case anymore?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it's too much of a stretch to assume that Assange was adamantly opposed to a Clinton presidency, seeing as how she thinks he should be killed via drone strike and her winning would probably be a greater threat to his freedom and life than a Trump win. But the content of the messages that were released today don't indicate to me that there was anything nefarious going on between WikiLeaks and the Trump campaign. If anything, it proves that they weren't in contact as much as the MSM has insinuated over the past year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm just missing something but this doesn't seem like the bombshell people are making it out to be.

       Nice try but Trump's CIA appointee has declared Wikileaks a hostile foreign intelligence service. That's a far cry from some mainstream news outlet.

       Lolol I don't need to be saved bc Mueller isn't investigating me and I'm not deflecting. You are because that was a genuine question. If you honestly expect me to believe that WikiLeaks is a "hostile foreign intelligence agency" because the CIA said so, you must not be very informed on the CIA and their history of being a hostile intel agency themselves.

       I don't know about that, then it's an actual attack and the Goverment has a much easier case to physically go after them.  Especially with the laws passed since 9/11.

       He's already released emails proving he was directly colluding with Russia. So yeah, that's not a stretch at all.  You can't really deny the emails the HE published on his own, can you?

       Your comparison is faulty since it is Fox News who is the PR arm of the Republican Party that is who you should be comparing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks, made themselves too obviously anti-democratic and anti-Democratic during the Obama administration for you to claim they are "fair and balanced."
      </p>
      <p>
       Wikileaks,   hasn't leaked anything against the Republicans since the Manning document dump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except when they leaked the Snowden documents and blamed Obama for the law that created the domestic spy program that was signed by G. W. Bush in 2008.  Not by Obama.
      </p>
      <p>
       That law no one told the U.S. public about, until the Washington Post did an in depth revelation in 2010, called:  Top Secret America.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/">
        http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That should have completely discredited the Snowden/Wikileaks claims that it was created by Obama.
