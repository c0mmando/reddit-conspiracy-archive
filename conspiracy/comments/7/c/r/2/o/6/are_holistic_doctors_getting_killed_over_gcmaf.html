    <div class="md"><p>The GCMAF has to be activated from what I’ve learned so not just and GCMAF will work.  From my own extensive research he was not killed because of the GCMAF but because of what he discovered while treating cancer and more specifically autism.  He made so much progress with the cancer patients the he looked into helping parents with autistic children and found that autistic children showed same high levels of an enzyme called nagalase which is the same enzyme that cancer patients are tested for to see how developed their cancer is.  He could not understand why the autistic kids had high levels of this same nagalase enzyme that cancer patients have but with no cancer.   Nagalase is made by a cancer cell and viruses in order shut down the bodies natural immunity attack against the Cancer Cell or virus and thus to protect itself from the immune system defenses.  Nagalase basically turns off the GCMAF that is made by the immune system.  This Dr discovered a way to activate the GCMAF which would eliminate the cancer and it also reversed the autism in 850 of 1000 kids and made a case study of it.  Of course we will never see this study because it was removed during the raid.  During the Dr’s research he discovered that the enzyme was being put in vaccines on purpose to compromise the immune system resulting in chronic illnesses and cancer galore.  This is guaranteed money for big pharma and also a way to control population of people they look upon as just cattle.  Of course naturally upon this alarming discovery he told his colleagues via email which was a huge mistake for he and those other Drs because like him they are no longer with us either via accidents and suicides.  He also made the mistake of confronting the cdc about it and apparently they just played dumb and acted like it was some type of accident claiming that viruses make nagalase so they must have developed in the vaccine when it was in storage since vaccines are a weakened virus.  He probably messed up and told them about his research and that’s why he was raided and later killed.  They also had to kill like 12 other Drs that he shared this info with.  I️ read a screen shot a long time ago from an email he sent to another holistic dr that was posted revealing the above confrontation with cdc when all of this first happened but can’t find it anywhere.  Nevertheless he was killed because he discovered them purposefully contaminating vaccines making us and our children sick.  </p>
