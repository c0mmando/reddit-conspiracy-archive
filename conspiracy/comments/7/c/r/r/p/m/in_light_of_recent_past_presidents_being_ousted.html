<p><strong>Did Donald Trump and Jeffery Epstein rape a 13 year old girl?</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/436890/did-donald-trump-and-jeffrey-epstein-rape-13-year-old-girl">http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/436890/did-donald-trump-and-jeffrey-epstein-rape-13-year-old-girl</a></p>

<p><strong>Trump to face rape charges in court</strong></p>

<p><strong>Several photos of Trump hanging out with Epstein</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://postimg.org/image/apax92k7f/">https://postimg.org/image/apax92k7f/</a></p>

<p><strong>Last but not least, some photos of Trump and the Clintons enjoying each other&#39;s company</strong> </p>

<p>Anybody on this sub who thinks that only one party is abusing kids is deluded or has a party bias. And anyone who thinks trump and the clintons are actual real life enemies is just as lost...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally, to me it always made sense that if trump was an &quot;undercover puppet&quot; that is being promoted as a populist president by TPTB, they would use their shills to prop him up on these subs, not bring him down. They want us to take the bait and follow this guy as our &quot;God&quot;. Not to say every trump supporter is a shill, some are just confused on how TPTB operate and control the electoral process. </p>

<p>He&#39;s a Trojan horse dude. I think you severely underestimate the intelligence of the social engineers, and their reverse psychology tactics, control of the media...these people know what they are doing. </p>

<p>But to assume, on a conspiracy sub that hates government, that I&#39;m a shill for calling it a corrupt billionaire establishment pawn is so ass backwards...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imagine a classic behaviorism experiment. </p>

<p>You ring a bell and provide food. You ring a bell and provide food. You ring a bell and provide food. For months you ring a bell and provide food. Eventually, you ring a bell and observe that the test subject begins salivating regardless of whether food is presented or not. The subject has learned to associate the sound of a bell with food.</p>

<p>Now relate it to our current world. Trump is a Nazi no evidence. Trump is a sexist no evidence. Trump wears Melania&#39;s underwear no evidence. Trump hacked the election no evidence. Trump is a Russian communist no evidence. Trump is a racist no evidence. Trump steals candy from small children no evidence. You run a salacious headline for months, that never pans out and is never substantiated by anything more than hear-say. Eventually, you run the headline and observe that the test subject is no longer paying attention regardless of whether story is true or not. The subject has learned to associate the salacious stories with the temper tantrum of a small child and no longer pays any attention.</p>

<p>Put another way. This is exactly the moral of The Boy Who Cried Wolf. You cannot run around at night screaming about wolves in the pen waking people up, unless there are some wolves in the pen. After a few times of this people will blow it off and go back to sleep. When wolves actually show up in the night no one believes you anymore. Running hundreds of headlines with transparent political advantage for establishment figures who have found themselves on the unaccustomed position of losing power has a tendency to lose the attention of the public.</p>

<p>In short, a little-less-bullshit and a lot-of-more journalist ethics.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps they understand the odds of an outsider gaining this position. Thereby giving some leeway. I do. I&#39;ve also seen the mostly left leaning media really going out of their way to bring him down. Seems that &quot;bullying&quot; him is now the story and not reporting news. The fish feeding thing showed how stupid they are being. Gish I hate talking heads!  That&#39;s just how I see it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mark Twain said, &quot;Support your country always, and your government when it deserves it...&quot;</p>

<p>And so I laughed so hard when I realized that big wind bag was elected President.  </p>

<p>To me Trump is the ultimate Trolling of everybody in our government with dreams and ambitions to student body government, who we had to listen drone on at HS Graduation.  And indeed Michael Moore likened Trump to a Molotov Cocktail that Americans were throwing at Washington... And that was exactly how my vote felt.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t care if Trump effects anything good, I just want him to continue to make people miserable.  Like that Trashcan in a Pant Suit who lost.  I hope it gets worse and more American Institutions fail.</p>
