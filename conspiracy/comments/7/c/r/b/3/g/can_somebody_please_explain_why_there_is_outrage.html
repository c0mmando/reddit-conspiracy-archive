       very likely this is a pre-emptive strike. clinton co. has a.. way of finding out what stories or issues are going to come out about them and before it does come out they try and start their spin, it's classic clinton.

       I think they caught wind of something through sources and dropped this to try and further push the narrative Trump/Wiki/Russia

       Its hilarious to watch them scramble after this. Its been a year, SHUT THE FUCK UP about Hillary! This story has NOTHING to do with her, its about your idol, the "impartial" Assange, proved to be a LIAR who leaked documents in exchange for future favors from the Trump administration. Yeah the Democrats are fucked up, yeah they're corrupt but lil ol' Donny isn't the angel you love to imagine him as.

       The outrage is because Wikileaks was preaching about impartiality and turned out it didn't care about it at all.

       To answer your second part, of course its not a crime. But Hillary asking if they could drone Assange is also not a crime.

       People lose their shit because they like to get passionate about things they don't really understand. The only thing that this new "leak" proves is that Wikileaks is less trustworthy than what it appears and should be held to higher scrutiny when next release something.
      </p>
      <p>
       The few articles I read on the subject paint Trump Jr. as totally neutral on this few replies back to Wikileaks requests. It's just a further burden on his credibility. He has been caught lying a number of times and talking with another dishonest party doesn't help his case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regarding the DNC fiasco, all courts that heard the case ruled that it's a private organisation making its own decisions. Since money was donated instead of given on a contract (even a verbal one), there is nothing the public can do legaly. The only person that might have a chance to sue the DNC successfully is Sanders himself , and only if he manages to prove that when he joined the party a fair election was promised to him.

       Well, did you donate them directly to Bernie, through his campaign website or did you give them to the DNC?

       If you did the second part, you are shit out of luck. Donations are "as-is", and can be used for whatever they (the DNC higher ups, read Hilary) want. If you gave them directly to Sanders, he received your money.

       At the surface it looks like there is no crime. The big question is when and where did Wikileaks get the data. Did T Jr or others coordinate timing of the release for political impact, know about or coordinate the passing of the information (ie Russia approaches Trump and they elect to “launder” the data through Wikileaks), and/or use overt signaling to pass information between parties. If there is it could be trouble for the whole campaign.

       But in this case that action consists of publishing documents that are negative to the Trump campaign.    The very act of underlying this was a commitment to neutrality.   It just follows that it would help them be viewed as impartial, which is true, and that more people would be reading the Podesta emails, which is also true.

       The problem is that they ACTIVELY engaged in an action and solicited the cooperation of one of the two parties. It wasn't an anonymous source that decided to leak information because of morals.

       To obtain tax returns and other negative information to publish.  It just so happens that publishing this information, would have helped wikileaks counter Clinton campaign smears, and it would have helped the Trump campaign because more people would read the Podesta emails, and it would have helped the electorate, as they would have had more information about a candidate.  Who knows what those documents would have shown.  Too bad they were not leaked.

       They solicited information from the 3rd person in charge of his campaign. If you think this is functionally different from talking to a candidate directly, I don't know what to say to you to change your mind. And why did they sent a message to Trump Jr anyway? Did they sent one to the IRS chief or anyone else who might have had access to the tax returns about the same topic?

       * Wikileaks was trying to curate leaks to influence public perception.
       <br/>
       * Julian Assange was trying to earn an Ambassadorship from his leaks.

       This is not supported.  They were actively trying to address the charge that they are accused most often, of not leaking anything from the Trump campaign.  If anything it shows their willingness to address the charge, and rebuffs the accusation that they received stuff they sat on.

      <p>
       This is confirmed to have come from Wikileaks twitter account.  Whether they are attempting to “address the charge” is irrelevant.  It still amounts to curating leaks.  They don’t ask for the tax returns, they ask for the tax returns that were already reported on.  They’re not on a fact-finding mission, rather trying to cater to a Presidential candidate to earn favors.

        If we publish them it will dramatically improve the perception of our impartiality.   That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.”

      <p>
       There is no lie, it is an attempt to get negative information from a son of a presidential candidate.    It just so happens that, the Clinton campaign is smearing them as impartial, and publishing this type of information would counteract the smear.   That is true. It is also true that more people would go through the Podesta emails, and this would be helpful.  What is not known is the outcome that those leaked documents would have had.

       To suggest WikiLeaks wasn't anti-hillary is absurd, but it doesn't point to actual criminal conduct, just opposition research by Trump's campaign and WikiLeaks excercising their rights to free speech.

       and
       <a href="/r/conservative">

       and many other places are censoring and trying to bury this? Why do you think that is? Because it's not a big deal? This is huge because wikileaks was treated by many as just an impartial organization that would leak anything they got. This threatens there very credibility. If they were communicating with Trump Jr. showing they were determined to help the Trump campaign, who's to say they also wouldn't bury any dirt from the Trump campaign as well?
