       "The embassy's power and internet were cut. It wasn't restored for nearly a month and a half.
       <a href="/r/WikiLeaks">
        /r/WikiLeaks
       </a>
       mods all simultaneously disappeared and were replaced by new mods who ban anyone who suggests Wikileaks could be compromised. Many other normal Wikileaks activities have ceased since that date. Assange's lawyer has been barred from entering the embassy. Wikileaks has stopped PGP signing anything. The hashes of the encrypted insurance file have stopped. Wikileaks has become uncharacteristically polarized in its politics. To top it all off, Assange hasn't made a public appearance."

       Wikileaks exposed corruption in the American political system by revealing the podesta emails (he's a lobbyist 1st and campaign chair 2nd and also lobbied Bill and Obama successfully) and DNC rigging the primary. These as facts should not matter where they come from.

       Not saying I agree just trying to help interpret. I think he’s saying that even if the communicating happened earlier (like the one guy said, I think he said the first message was September 30), it still happened after JA supposedly lost internet, plus other sketchy stuff that happened on the same day. So it should have stopped there I guess, since JA didn’t have internet. But it continued, which he is suggesting is from a source other than JA since he didn’t have internet.  Maybe I’m wrong though lol but I think two questions are important here.
      </p>
      <p>
       First: was JA actually without internet on Oct 3rd (I think that’s the date op said)? I’m having a brain fart. How long was he without it for?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second: is him communicating with Wikileaks actually him communicating with JA? Is it supposed to be? Who runs Wikileaks social media stuff? I didn’t think JA ran the stuff 100% by himself but I have absolutely no idea so.

       Not directly (see above tweet), but it would be hard to believe that WL was acting without his consent/guidance. His internet was cut off, but not all his communications (e.g. phone).

       There hasn't been any, and he hasn't appeared on his balcony daily as proof of life like he did every day at the same time. All we've seen of him is a TV interview that looks really glitchy and digitized, hinting at CGI facial bullshittery (used in Hollywood movies to improve actors' facial performance for example - even in simple dramas that look totally naturally filmed). That last part is NOT bullshit, it's totally normal in Hollywood and has been for a decade.

       IMO, the whole thing was a PsyOp from the good guys. Assange’s life was in danger if he stayed in the embassy, so he was escorted out by the good guys (remember the airport conveniently closed that day?). They wanted to create confusion as to whether WikiLeaks had been compromised or not, for reasons that we may soon come to fully understand (especially with all the draining of the swamp that’s been going on recently... e.g. the Saudi arrests/helicopter crash).
      </p>
      <p>
       Some WikiLeaks communications may have actually been compromised as part of the PsyOp... which would explain the change of tone in the messages after Assange supposedly left the embassy... and also why Trump Jr had zero interest in responding at that time.

       So much hate for wikileaks always. Asssange is not dead, but compromised is up for argument. I personally believe he had to back off the pedo shit or die along with his whole family.

       mods all simultaneously disappeared and were replaced by new mods who ban anyone who suggests Wikileaks could be compromised. Many other normal Wikileaks activities have ceased since that date. Assange's lawyer has been barred from entering the embassy. Wikileaks has stopped PGP signing anything.
