       Wait so you are just gonna not prove your point then? You're moving on from the "he worked with both sides" bullshit? Assange didn't like republicans before Trump. Who cares. He still worked day and night to get Trump elected. He was hoping he could get something out of it.

       Where's this agenda to help Trump? All I see is a news outlet trying to get information to publish. Once, they ask for a mention. That is how all news outlets operate. You can see literally dozens of journalists doing the exact same thing in the Podesta emails &amp; the DNC leaks. Worse, in fact, because there they talk openly about "friendly" journalists and outlets.

       First, that's not at all what it says. They don't say they're working together and they don't plot to pretend they aren't working together. They are asking for information and are giving reasons why it might be in the campaign's interest to provide that information. It's negotiation/sales, and, again, it happens regularly. I can't even tell you the number of times a journo has made a similar pitch to me. It's what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, and more importantly, the Trump campaign didn't even respond to that message, nor did they provide any of the requested material. It takes two to work together.
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, even if they did "work together," which they didn't, but if they did:
       <em>
        it ain't illegal.
       </em>
       Jesus Christ, you've got at least 100 emails from the DNC side talking about this-or-that reporter will write things favorable to them, you've got some journos regularly sending advice on campaign strategy, etc. It happens ALL THE TIME.

       Why does wikileaks need to pretend to be impartial? And I really fuckin wonder if they sent these negotiation emails to the Clinton campaign. "Hillary, we want to help you but we don't want people to find out. Send me something I can leak so nobody can tell I want you to win."
      </p>
      <p>
       Give me a fuckin break.
      </p>

       Nobody as of now is saying this is illegal. The entire point is Julian Assange is a liar and he's been working on behalf of Russia and the Trump campaign this entire time.

         Guess why they're asking for info on Trump...........because they didn't have any! They are impartial. They publish what they have.

       If you read the god damn message, they wanted something inconsequential to release so they could pretend they were impartial. They didn't want people to know they were working for Trump and Russia. You've gotta be fucking kidding me.  You still think they are impartial. Unfuckinbelievable.

       I don't think he's portrayed that at all, it's been prerry clear he has an axe to grind against Hillary, but the info he's released has been 100% accurate, regardless of the bias he has.

       Well I'd be biased about it if I were him, I mean the whole "can't we just drone him?" was pretty fucked up, not to mention her foreign policy in general.  And she absolutely must have suggested the droning, whether in a joking manner or not, or her response when asked about it would have been something more assertive than "I don't recall."

       That was historically my impression.  And she embodied establishment power. I don't really see a problem with it if he is biased.  Being biased doesn't make it lies.  And they just release everything, so it's not as though their information is editorialized like MSM.

       So they don't show the DMs, they say that they have been given to the grand jury and also "obtained by the Atlantic". The final paragraph says that Don Jr published the emails on his twitter, but those aren't the emails from Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       The main issue is that Wikileaks encrypts their messages and signs with their private key. If they publish the DMs it will be simple to prove they are real.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying they aren't real, or that wikileaks isn't possibly doing something scummy. I'm saying that we are being told something is true without being shown evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without evidence it is worthless. Publish the DMs. Prove that they came from Wikileaks. Then we can talk. Until that happens we are being asked to
       <em>
        trust
       </em>
       them and I'm not going to do that.

       Sure why not? If we're dealing on gradients, they're a fuckuva lot better than we (the US) are. Just bein' honest. Did Russia kill 1 MILLION (that's a lot of people) in Iraq? Nope - we're the scourge of this world - you gotta come to grips with that if you want to change it.

       Ohhh.. shit you're right man. Did you find out that the DKIM verification process was false and definitively proved that the emails were faked?? Oh.. you didn't?
      </p>
      <p>
       So the emails and many millions of documents on all political parties and many countries that WL has released throughout the years are legit and you're just mad because this one instance doesn't validate you're ridiculous loyalty to a political party that is essentially the same as the other political party in the US? Hmmmm.

       Again, you should have context of the US as a power to destroy the world. In that context, any truth that comes out is beneficial to the people. Let the truth on all sides come out and let the people decide how to move. Assange had real reasons to not want the standard oligarchy to continue (direct calls for his droning by HRC notwithstanding). I'd love to see any of us endure what JA has without snapping.

       More than anything, I implore you - please stop looking at things through this faux right/left lens. It's not real - the "left" of the US is as far right as any horrid conservative regime worldwide. Picking who would be better between GOP and DNC is splitting hairs.

       That is absurd. Yes, the Democrats are right-wing compared to much of the developed world (except in certain positions on social issues in which they can be fairly progressive), but there is an extreme split between the Democrats and Republicans on most everything. Why do you think Trump has gotten so little done?

       Aw well we have to agree to disagree. Obama was a tool of the state like those before him. His job was to expand the empire and he did, so in that sense I guess he was competent. Who knows whether Trump is part of the plan or not. I'm a pacifist so I'm not going to think very highly of any of these politicians. But cheers and g'nite.

       I don't know but it became obvious when they began releasing the emails.  Emails they claim didn't come from the Russians, but there are now records that the Russians offered them to the Trump campaign earlier than it was know that Wikileaks had them

       Who reported that the emails were offered to the Trump Campaign, before Wikileaks began releasing them to everyone.

       I think they were offered to Don Jr in June Wikileaks first release was late in July.

       There are no rules that say Wikileaks is an unbiased entity. With that said, nothing has ever been proven to be false.

       What is dropped is Wikileaks decision. Maybe he just doesn’t like Hillary and he was in a position to fuck her the best way he could.

       Jesus Christ, I feel like so many here are utterly incapable of recognizing sarcasm or humor and only take words completely literally. That's why Pizzagate is a thing. Cutting a pizza slice into smaller pieces becomes a reference to child porn instead of realizing that he's most likely making a joke about how they don't have very much pizza.

       That was historically my impression.  And she embodied establishment power. I don't really see a problem with it if he is biased.  Being biased doesn't make it lies.  And they just release everything, so it's not as though their information is editorialized like MSM.
