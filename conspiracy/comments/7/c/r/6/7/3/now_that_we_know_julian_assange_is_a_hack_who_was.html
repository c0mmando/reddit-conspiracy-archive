    <div class="md"><p>Where&#39;s this agenda to help Trump? All I see is a news outlet trying to get information to publish. Once, they ask for a mention. That is how all news outlets operate.

Worse, in fact, because there they talk openly about &quot;friendly&quot; journalists and outlets. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, that&#39;s not at all what it says. They don&#39;t say they&#39;re working together and they don&#39;t plot to pretend they aren&#39;t working together. They are asking for information and are giving reasons why it might be in the campaign&#39;s interest to provide that information. It&#39;s negotiation/sales, and, again, it happens regularly. I can&#39;t even tell you the number of times a journo has made a similar pitch to me. It&#39;s what they do. </p>

<p>Second, and more importantly, the Trump campaign didn&#39;t even respond to that message, nor did they provide any of the requested material. It takes two to work together. </p>

<p>Third, even if they did &quot;work together,&quot; which they didn&#39;t, but if they did: <em>it ain&#39;t illegal.</em> Jesus Christ, you&#39;ve got at least 100 emails from the DNC side talking about this-or-that reporter will write things favorable to them, you&#39;ve got some journos regularly sending advice on campaign strategy, etc. It happens ALL THE TIME. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does wikileaks need to pretend to be impartial?

    <div class="md"><p>So they don&#39;t show the DMs, they say that they have been given to the grand jury and also &quot;obtained by the Atlantic&quot;. The final paragraph says that Don Jr published the emails on his twitter, but those aren&#39;t the emails from Wikileaks.</p>

<p>The main issue is that Wikileaks encrypts their messages and signs with their private key. If they publish the DMs it will be simple to prove they are real. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying they aren&#39;t real, or that wikileaks isn&#39;t possibly doing something scummy. I&#39;m saying that we are being told something is true without being shown evidence. </p>

<p>Without evidence it is worthless. Publish the DMs. Prove that they came from Wikileaks. Then we can talk. Until that happens we are being asked to <em>trust</em> them and I&#39;m not going to do that.</p>

<p>That is absurd. Yes, the Democrats are right-wing compared to much of the developed world (except in certain positions on social issues in which they can be fairly progressive), but there is an extreme split between the Democrats and Republicans on most everything.
