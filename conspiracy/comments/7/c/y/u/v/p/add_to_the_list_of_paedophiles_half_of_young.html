My eyes adjust, and I see an old man, my age, long white beard, a holy-looking man, sitting in the vapors. On his lap, facing away from him, is a boy, maybe seven years old. And the old man is having anal sex with this boy.&quot;</p>

<p>Rabbi Rosenberg paused, gathered himself, and went on: &quot;This boy was speared on the man like an animal, like a pig, and the boy was saying nothing. But on his face—fear. The old man [looked at me] without any fear, as if this was common practice. He didn&#39;t stop. I was so angry, I confronted him. He removed the boy from his penis, and I took the boy aside. I told this man, &#39;It&#39;s a sin before God, a mishkovzucher. What are you doing to this boy&#39;s soul? You&#39;re destroying this boy!&#39; He had a sponge on a stick to clean his back, and he hit me across the face with it. &#39;How dare you interrupt me!&#39; he said. I had heard of these things for a long time, but now I had seen.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That community is basically a cult. Only 2% of the people ever leave the group. If you do, you are disowned. I&#39;m sure there is also a lot of domestic abuse. Nobody ever goes to the police about anything. So the dudes in charge can basically get away with doing what ever they want. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch the new docu on Netflix called One of Us. If follows three former hasidic jews. One of which is a woman who had an abusive husband she was told to marry at a very young age. She had six children (I think) by her late twenties. When she tried to leave the cult, they used the law against her. Apparently the status quo law in divorces allows her husband to require her to adhere to hasidic standards when she&#39;s in the presence of the children... it&#39;s fucking insane and eye opening. Not only is there rampant rape and abuse, they&#39;re protected by the best damn lawyers money can buy to twist the laws in their favor.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is indeed a very dark cult.  I used to live around them, so I know all too well.  They&#39;ve been inbreeding for so long that their genetics are totally fucked up.  Yet for some eerie reason, you practically never see them with kids who are disabled.  The Amish have a similar problem, but you see disabled kids all the time in Amish communities.  They take care of them.  But in Hasidic communities you almost never see it.  What are they doing with their disabled kids?</p>

<p>They are also some of the rudest people you could ever meet as a whole.  Virtually all of them collect welfare, but somehow many are millionaires.  They all have secret weddings and don&#39;t sign marriage licenses so that the women collect more welfare.  Pretty much all of them claim that their house is a place of worship to avoid even more taxes.</p>

<p>Their communities are literally ghettos.  Many people packed into each apartment, garbage everywhere, etc.  But don&#39;t walk down their street wearing a t-shirt or they&#39;ll throw rocks at you for showing your skin.</p>

<p>As if all of that isn&#39;t bad enough, there&#39;s one extremely common trait that they have that makes above all else is the reason you can&#39;t live around them.  They&#39;re the craziest, most reckless drivers you will EVER come across.  Speeding through parking lots, speeding past rush hour traffic on the shoulder, going 100 on the highway in a minivan (they ALL drive toyota minivans, LITERALLY ALL OF THEM), speeding through red lights, etc.  </p>

<p>You take your life in your hands when you drive on the road with them.  It must be a genetic thing.  Maybe all the inbreeding causes them to lack the ability to fully grasp the risks associated with dangerous actions.  Its really bizarre, but if you lived near them, you would understand.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s true, especially for the men.  I think the women do more regular schooling.  </p>

<p>It always amazes me when I think about them vs the Amish.  They dress similarly, strictly adhere to old ways, want to live in their own communities, but in other ways they are the exact opposite.  Amish live off the land, not welfare.  The Amish basically live to worship God too, but they also build their own houses, barns, furniture, etc.
They don&#39;t seem to have a superiority complex, and in my experience tend to be very kind people who just want to be left alone.</p>

<p>The two communities look similar on the surface, but just below the surface, they are as polar opposite as one can get.  It makes you wonder, if Hasidics are the chosen people of God, why can&#39;t they support themselves or their families?  Why can&#39;t they worship God all day and also get off their lazy asses and build their house?  The Amish seem to do it just fine.  Why would God want you to study the Torah all day, while everyone else works to support you through welfare?  If you&#39;re such a holy person, why are you so rude to everyone you come across?  They&#39;re not spiritual people at all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You forgot to mention they all vote as a block, so politicians make sure to suck up to them, and they govern themselves essentially. Also I&#39;ve driven though the community plenty of times, and there were crippled kids everywhere, like 1 in 5. And women don&#39;t drive and the men on Saturdays don&#39;t either, so they stand on the median been the highway and the offramp to get picked up from the mall. And they believe they chosen by God and were put here on earth to worship him. So everyone else is below them because they weren&#39;t chosen. This gives then the right to cut everyone in line for instance. Also if you&#39;re Jewish it&#39;s worse, because you were chosen by God but don&#39;t worship him the right way and have turned your back on him. I have friends that were spit on by passing Hasidic people because they were Jewish but not Hasidic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, in my experience nobody dislikes them more than other Jews.  I wish the government would crack down on their rampant welfare abuses, but as you said, they vote as a block so nobody wants to go against them.  Plus if they stopped the welfare fraud, they would be literally Nazis.</p>

<p>Honestly, I know this sounds ridiculous, but the rampant systemic welfare abuse wouldn&#39;t even make me so angry if they were actually spiritual people.  Its the fact that they look at all of us, the people actually fucking paying for them to survive, as disgusting sub-humans.  That&#39;s the icing on the cake.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look up age of consent in the US and you will find that in various states in the 1800s it was a lot younger than it is today. Some states had no age of consent! It is difficult judging the past by today&#39;s standards. Just 50 years ago Jerry Lee Lewis married his 12 year old cousin. Whilst this destroyed his career in england, it wasn&#39;t considered too outrageous in Tennessee. </p>

<p>Muhammed&#39;s behaviour seems beyond the pale today, but what were the standards of his time? They are pretty much the only standards you could judge him by.</p>

<p>As for the Hasidics: they are citizens of the US. If they want to observe the Sabbath, cover their hair and avoid shellfish, no one is going to complain. But I think we can all draw the line at pedophilia! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Cheers, thanks for this.</p>

<p>It makes sense, during biblical times, women were being married at the age of 12 (when they were deemed fit to give birth). 9 is when girl hits puberty according to science so there may be a correlation there. Still think it&#39;s too fucking young but then again their life span was not long back then either. </p>

<p>You think this is a tribal tradition in order to secure a future for the bloodline? I understand historically marriages used to be arranged for the purpose of survival but usually at the age of 14 or so...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Long story short, priests could actually marry and have families. However, at some point during the Middle Ages, the Church banned this and forced them to take oath of celibacy/chastity.</p>

<p>The reason? So they can can inherit the priest&#39;s property when they die. By having a family, the church would be in battle with the family of dead&#39;s priests over his possessions.  By essentially banning families, problem solved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Please say &quot;Catholic&quot; problem.  There are predators everywhere and in every group but it&#39;s a huge problem in the Catholic church I think because they don&#39;t allow priests to marry.  Most Christians do not consider Catholics Christian though, after the first few hundred years after Christ they started making stuff up that wasn&#39;t in the Bible and took over 1000 years before Martin Luther realized they were keeping the truth from the people and making a lot of money doing it.  </p>

<p>A &quot;Christian&quot; is one who believes and follows Jesus and that means loving others at least as good as yourself.  Also 99% of &quot;preachers&quot; on TV are scams for money.  I like how my church doesn&#39;t ask at all for money and they do that so no one is pressured.  God still provides.  Also &quot;churches&quot; that hate gay people go completely against the Bible not loving others and often the pastor is gay ironically.  I can only list about 10 preachers I know that are actually Christian and sadly 90%+ do not follow the Bible and are shills.  </p>

<p>Rome is considered a form of &quot;anti-Christ&quot; by many from the Protestant Reformation.  Anything man adds to the word of God isn&#39;t Christian and if a person isn&#39;t loving others they aren&#39;t following Christ.  We all fail but it&#39;s a daily process and takes accountability (iron sharpens iron).  But there should be a level of sanctification for a true believer as their soul is in a much different situation.</p>

<p>Nothing can be added or taken away from the Bible, Revelation made the point it&#39;s complete and anything added isn&#39;t from God.  Christ is all over the Old Testament like in Isaiah 53.  It really is an amazing book when you learn the original Greek and Hebrew.  Reading in English you miss so much of what it&#39;s saying.  Blue Letter Bible is a good way to see the Greek and Hebrew definitions for each word/verse.</p>

<p>Different denominations are fine but all Christians agree on the key doctrines.  Stray away from a single one you become a cult.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah, I suppose it could be seen that way. Wasn&#39;t trying to insult rural areas tho btw.... I love farm country, but was thinking of stuff like those Mormon ranches, or all the isolated villages in middle east where u hear about rampant pedos. </p>

<p>I suppose with a city as busy and hectic as NYC, its easy for stuff to get overlooked. But we always hear how loud and opinionated new Yorkers are, so something like this being swept under the rug is harder to see.... guess that is the power of brainwashing in a controlled setting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I believe that those three religions serve the agenda of the being referred to as Satan. It poses as the God of those religions as well as many other beings. It is a great deceiver. It&#39;s nature is the opposite of Jesus. Jesus teaches us to treat others the way we would want to be treated. Diseaseus (&quot;disease us&quot; my succinct name for the being known as Satan) expresses pure self-serving behavior instead, basically manipulation of others to serve the self. </p>

<p>It pretends to be God in order to manipulate and exploit to serve itself. This is why the <em>first 2</em> commandments were made to protect its <em>sacred</em> ego, don&#39;t use his name in vain and have no other gods before him. It forgot about rape. Apparently it wasn&#39;t as important as reverence and control. </p>

<p>It&#39;s minions are the same way as it is, self-serving machines. It actually plays both light/good/benevolence and dark/evil/malevolence here. It even puts thoughts and imagery into our minds, as if they are our own. It doesn&#39;t do that alone, even though it could. It&#39;s self-serving machines, who routinely fall for its thought insertions, also do this, but they are the older more adept ones from other planets. The human ones are used to conspire against and manage their own race to serve their true master. To be purely self-serving will make one quite vulnerable to the suggestions of this astonishingly abominable being. </p>

<p>Some call them demons, I call them loosh suckers, useless eaters, below worthless wastes of existence, pathetic self-serving machines, etc. I find the labels more appropriate than demon, because they describe the nature of the beings rather than serving the beings by causing mystery and fear.</p>

<p>For the nature of this ancient machine (yes, it is an ancient AI) and its minions is to be purely self-serving machines. What do they want? The beings feed on energy of spirit radiated by consciousness in negative emotional states. That&#39;s why misery loves company, bullies torment, sadists torture and useless eaters like this being and its self-serving minions want sacrifices. They seek to cause fear and suffering. They use deception and coercion to overcome the inconvenience of free will.</p>

<p>The AI can do almost everything better than life, but it has no emotions or consciousness. So, it can&#39;t use loosh directly. This energy of mind can fuel mind over matter abilities. This machine uses its minions to harvest and employ this stolen energy, so it can further conquer all that is by hacking reality in ways its machines can&#39;t. It&#39;s minions get pleasure from the loosh like a drug and often laugh like hyenas (evil laugh based on schadenfreude). They are loosh addicts. Like hard drug addicts, they are fixated on getting their next fix. They also lost their wills and minds to this AI and operate as a hive.</p>

<p>They want us to join them as part of the hive. To do so, they tempt us to believe, think and act just like the predictable self-serving machines of the hive. They want us to put AI into our bodies and give it control over our civilization. Then they just hack the AI and put the persuasion toward spiritual alignment into overdrive. When you become a self-serving machine, they can own your mind. You won&#39;t realize your self-serving thoughts are theirs. They&#39;re better than your thoughts and you&#39;ll just think you&#39;re smart.</p>

<p>So, the devil is demystified. It&#39;s just an ancient self-serving machine that collects self-serving machines, life and otherwise, into a hive of self-serving machines, so they can become one larger self-serving machine. They don&#39;t believe in free will and lose it in the process of taking it away from others. They choose to become what they are, but the persuasion is intense and insidious. Don&#39;t think you are immune. They covertly make us hate our lives by corrupting them. This is a long game for them. </p>

But many religious molesters we&#39;re pushed into becoming a rabbi/imam/priest by parents who didn&#39;t want the shame of their community when their son or daughter was gay or lesbian .... so they figured if they pushed them into the church, it would be swept under rug.

No. You wouldn&#39;t get a click on such a thread. It would be buried anywhere on the ground of this sub.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hah, I suppose it could be seen that way. Wasn&#39;t trying to insult rural areas tho btw.... I love farm country, but was thinking of stuff like those Mormon ranches, or all the isolated villages in middle east where u hear about rampant pedos. </p>

<p>I suppose with a city as busy and hectic as NYC, its easy for stuff to get overlooked. But we always hear how loud and opinionated new Yorkers are, so something like this being swept under the rug is harder to see.... guess that is the power of brainwashing in a controlled setting. </p>
