       I'm not sure why this doesn't have more views, but you can see the blood stains at 1:16 and 4:20.
      </p>
      <p>
       The red car at 4:20 is seen in the video below at 15:11 where it looks like they are trying to help someone on the ground in that exact spot:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen a lot of comments that no one was shot so I can't wait to read what those stains on the ground actually are.

       Research them? That was the biggest wast of time. Lol. Especially after seeing the video of the hospital entrance without a spot of blood. You would have to be damn near retarded to think the biggest mass shooting in American history just look place near this hospital.

       Yea, to stop the bleeding. Lol. You know? The bleeding that didn't get a single drop of blood anywhere in the hospital. 😉 Tourniquets, impossible to put on without a wound.

       Let's not ignore how compressed this footage is and every time she pans the spots on the floor disappear. Or that there appears to be blood between the two entrance doors when she starts filming. And that there are going to be more people coming. And so on.

       Yes, I will deny it's Blood. I'll leave the possibility of fake blood on the table. It could be ketchup from a rogue fry. But it's definitely not blood. The lack of blood is laughable. If you have to convince yourself that tiny little smudge that too small to even identify is blood, well that's you. I know better.

       Tiny smudge? It's drops that follow a person being carried. Weren't there before he came by, then they were. What else is it? There's a shiny maybe 3-4" spot on the carpet inbetween the doors.

       Also, I don't think this is sunrise hospital, so who knows what their floors looked like.

       I doubt that it's blood. The guy a 2:00 said he came from the music festival a block down. Over 500 injured. A lot of high caliber gunshot wounds. People so injured that they need to be carried. It doesn't add up. You and I both know that there would be a lot of blood. Just look at the guy in front of the security desk. He had to be lifted up of the ground but no blood left behind. Why is he incapacitated if he didn't even lose enough blood to leak onto the floor?

       I didn't say the video was fake. I'm saying the whole thing is a staged hoax. And by your logic, the case is closed because I have said the same thing about all the videos from night. What do you think this video is? lol. Or are you just going to act like a child and quit your little game?

       Sounded to me like the first guy said "Where did this Happen - on the strip" and the other guy says at the music festival - it's all blocked over there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whatever hospital it was at, it wasn't a block from the music festival.  There's a sign to the left of the red alarm looking thing on the wall and when I zoomed in it says Valley Health System.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are only two Valley Health System hospitals anywhere near the strip - one is Desert Springs and the other is Spring Valley Hospital.

       Well if people had been trampled on during the escape, or sprained their ankle, or perhaps broke a leg trying to scale the fence, or fell while runing and busted a knee, they'd probably have to be lifted up.

       So since you didn't see blood from a two minute clip from ONE hospital, then the whole thing must be fake.

      <p>
       All those various police officers and EMTs who radioed in that they were at a certain location with a gunshot victim must have been in on the hoax, too.  Right?  And I guess the doctors and nurses and the spokespersons from the various hospitals who would give daily updates on the death toll and injuries being treated at their facilities were in on the hoax too, right?

      <p>
       And all those obituaries that were publisheded?

       Heard all that before. Check YouTube comments. You'll see all the lame excuses as to why high caliber rifles don't cause bleeding. It's dumb. Nobody that believes their should be blood all over the place is going to be convinced people were shot. I said why I believe it's a hoax. I need to see blood. No excuse is possible for me to consider that I shouldn't be seeing more blood.

       What is the updated death toll from the shooting?
      </p>
      <p>
       Last I heard it was still 60 dead. Meaning not one died from injuries in the hospital's after they day of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not once have I seen a news story saying so and so who was shot has died.

       Yes, high caliber rifles cause bleeding, but you're missing the point.
       <strong>
        Not all the injuries were from people who got shot.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Your entire premise that no one died or was even shot is based on a 2:23 video at ONE hospital showing a grand total of FIVE patients that were either brought in on stretchers, or were carried in and placed on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       FIVE patients.  That's one percent of the injured.

       Yea. I watched all the videos when they came out. I can't unsee them. Showing me late entry pics and videos of an event I believe is a hoax, based on what I have already seen, just makes it look like they took a little more time preparing for the latter show. I couldn't understand why I seen no blood. I believe that fucked up on a couple seems. I'm not saying that they forgot that blood should be on the scene. How had would it be to smear fake blood around. When I said I needed to see blood, I was referring to the video I posted. Other videos have different things that don't seem right. I'm beyond the point being duped. I seen what I seen.

       Because I believe it was a staged hoax. I don't know why you think showing me footage of the staged hoax is proof. That's my whole point. It's a staged hoax with actors and makeup. Lol. That's like if you robed a bank, and said look, all this money I have isn't in a bank. This is proof I didn't rob it.

       Why would it be random for me to open an account after I found out I knew someone in the attack?  Do you think it's unreasonable for me to believe there is a cover up because the FBI story has never made sense and I like reading theories on what actually happened?

       Imagine what an actual mass shooting would look like and the mountain of evidence that would be inherent therein.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since we are assuming the Alphabet is withholding shooter info and pics/video of that evidence for investigation reasons, I will only list SOME of the evidence I would expect to be released on the other end.

      <ol>
       <li>
        With something like 100+ victims at a 1000+ concert this with at least 50+ hotel room vantage points - you do the math. Have you seen enough evidence? My numbers are conservative here. EVERYONE has a phone cell phone these days.

      </ol>
      <p>
       I don't know what happened in Vegas. But I am definitely not going to declare that I know for sure anyone or anywho died,  because I definitely for sure have not seen enough blurry video to declare any such thing.

       Yes. But don't get such a big head. Other people went and they took pictures so they can show them to other people as proof. No wonder you think it's impossible. You think it was all made to fool just you.

       Do I really want to wade into this shit storm?
      </p>

       I'll say this about the hospital footage.  When I looked at it, there was a sign on the wall near the entrance door.  I zoomed in on it ad it said Valley Health System.
      </p>
      <p>
       Valley Health System has 6 hospitals serving Las Vegas and Southern Nevada.  The two closest Valley Health System Hospitals to Las Vegas Village are Desert Springs Hospital and Spring Valley Hospital.

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Gretchen Papez, a spokeswoman for the Valley Hospital System, said the network of hospitals received a total of 228 patients, eight of whom died. She provided this breakdown by individual hospital:
        <strong>
         Desert Springs, 105 patients treated; Spring Valley, 53;
        </strong>
        Henderson, 32; Valley, 29; Summerlin, six; and Centennial Hills, three.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Desert Spring Hospital is a Level 1 Trauma Hospital - probably where the eight patients who died were taken to.  Spring Valley Hospital is a Level 2 Trauma Hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no way of proving it, but I suspect that the hospital footage we're seeing is from Spring Valley Hospital and the injuries there probably weren't as severe as at Desert Springs Hospital.
      </p>
      <p>
       People keep thinking 500+ injuries means 500+ people shot and that's just not the case.  There were scrapes, busted knees, sprained ankles, perhaps some broken limbs from people scaling the fences, people injured by trampling, or if they fell while running, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not all the injuries are going to be people gushing blood as some people would have us believe.

       Yea, to stop the bleeding. Lol. You know? The bleeding that didn't get a single drop of blood anywhere in the hospital. 😉 Tourniquets, impossible to put on without a wound.

       Curious to know your thoughts on the officer who was killed. Was his funeral fake? Is his family fake? Did that officer ever even exist? Is the entire 2,000 officer Las Vegas police force in on the hoax?
