        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>2 Weeks ago I made an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79y2tj/the_rconspiracy_conspiracy/">extensive post</a>
 after following a trail of strange behavior starting with the user, Sineseta. By tracking their comments on one another’s posts I was able to find a seeming network of 11 users who either had 18 day old accounts or 3 month old accounts at the time. They seemed to almost exclusively post to conspiracy, and always copy not only their posts/titles but comments directly from random users from the_donald. They also rarely engaged with other users but would occasionally comment on one another’s posts.  </p>

<p>Initially, when I saw Sineseta’s copied comment (with slight edits) I thought I may had just found a t_d alt, but instead I found that ALL of their posts and top comments were taken from various users of the donald. I then found the same behaviors in several other accounts and documented them <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/79y2tj/the_rconspiracy_conspiracy/">here</a>. </p>

<p>They then went dormant for about 2 weeks, with the exception of Jborg007, who I also called out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7cn2jb/busted_judge_in_fusion_gps_case_has_a_good/dpr9i2d/?context=3">yesterday</a>
 for coming out of dormancy with 2 posts with the exact same behaviors. S/he tried to claim they were just innocently x-posting and they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7cn2jb/busted_judge_in_fusion_gps_case_has_a_good/dpr9do0/">failed to explain</a>
 why they were copying comments.</p>

<p>I wondered if the other users would wake up too, and it seems they did last night. Currently 9 of them have posts in the top 3 pages of the sub, but I will commend them on their efforts to change up some of the wording of things they copied. They really broke out the thesaurus. Wonder what happened yesterday that what would’ve roused them from their digital slumber...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I called out Jborg007 yesterday i was kicking myself because I was afraid the others would stay dormant too. But when I saw the WL news late last night I wondered if they&#39;d be able to resist. The answer was no. But like I pointed out, they really did try to improve their copying methods.</p>

<p>Here are the posts from 5 months ago for those interested in this. It&#39;s happened before and will probably happen again. Especially since no one&#39;s getting banned.

<p>Also here are some things of note I found when looking through those threads:  </p>

<p>Was reading back through the posts from 5 months ago and saw <a href="https://archive.is/66VuV">this comment</a> regarding the [conspiracy] mods&#39; feelings about this matter. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We vote of most things, the vote is split. I&#39;ll leave it at that. - Flytape</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I also found <a href="https://archive.is/kFwDW">this exchange</a> about one of the copy/paste accounts from that round. Here is a link to ScorpTele&#39;s <a href="https://archive.is/f5Jgu">post</a>.</p>

<p>Wow! BTFO!!!!! Two!!!</p>

<p>So by your figure of 10:1 that means there&#39;s 0.2 Trump accounts then? </p>
