<p>The changing narrative, the complete lack of any information, the body, the room, the sounds of possible multiple gun shots, reports of shooters in other hotels, the missing hard drive, the spec ops cell charger in the room, the break in of his house, the list goes on and there are more questions than answer&#39;s everyday. </p>

<p>Agreed. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Yep that was weird. </p>

<p>And why did he shoot himself in the first place, minutes before police even arrived on the floor? Why the two single shots heard on the audio?</p>

<p>Also, why did he need to break open the window in 32-134? He had the exact same vantage point one pane over in 32-135. </p>

<p>And why was the adjoining door closed and locked from the 134 side? Did the wind blow it shut? Was he ever even in there? Was it booked under his name? Why did he need the extra room in the first place?</p>

<p>How were police &quot;100% confident that there were no other people in the room during the shooting&quot; within just 48 hours of the incident, when the shooting stopped before police arrived and there are no hallway cameras?</p>

<p>Did he really drive back and forth to Mesquite <em>5 times</em> (for a minimum of 10 hours of drive time) on the day of the shooting? </p>

<p>Why did this antisocial loner have multiple cellphones? </p>

<p>I could go on all day. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also why was there room service for two? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Someone on an LVA forum theorized that 32-134 was booked under Marilou Danley&#39;s name, and that he ordered for two in order to make it seem less strange that one person would be occupying two rooms alone. That would fit with early housekeeping reports that claimed he was in there talking to himself/pretending to talk to someone else.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lets not forget the Ellen interview with Jesus Campos and how fucking staged that was. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Oh don&#39;t even get me started on that. Beyond bizarre. I still can&#39;t get past how Campos and Sheriff Lombardo have two completely conflicting versions of the pre-shooting timeline (with Lombardo&#39;s obviously fake version being the better of the two). </p>

<p>So yeah, something is 100% screwy with Vegas. I&#39;ve spent <del>hours</del> days of my life researching, transcribing, discussing, etc., hoping to make sense of it, but it just doesn&#39;t make sense. That said, I&#39;m not yet willing to converge on it being a &quot;false flag.&quot; There are still lots of other possibilities in play. </p>

<p>If someone asks we know the main points. That a helicopter, and footage a full gunfight occurring the hotel exist. Both facts prove the american public was lied too. Not to mention Campos etc. </p>

You can try, but it be like you discussing any other topic, pointless. You have no use to this cause. You make it worse by muddying the already muddy waters. The majority of people on this subreddit understand that Vegas was dirty(metaphorically speaking) (please tell me i don&#39;t have to explain metaphors to you). Point is unless some more evidence comes out that is tangible everything is hear say. Which we already went threw when the shooting happened over a month ago. </p>
