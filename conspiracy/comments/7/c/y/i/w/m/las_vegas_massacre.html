       It's been a month and a half since the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. Why has this sub been so quiet about it? There has to be some new information on Campos, Stephen Paddock, his personal life (Brother, family, why he was off the grid for so long), etc. We cannot go quiet, there is so much more information to uncover.

       Its been here as new things come up. Last week there was the flight tracker for the helicopter flights out of McCarren. LV will not be forgotten here, along with 9/11, Sandy Hook and any other false flag we have witnessed

       The changing narrative, the complete lack of any information, the body, the room, the sounds of possible multiple gun shots, reports of shooters in other hotels, the missing hard drive, the spec ops cell charger in the room, the break in of his house, the list goes on and there are more questions than answer's everyday.

       But how does any of that translate to "false flag"? It definitely points to negligence, cover-up and possible conspiracy. But aren't false flags supposed to have a purpose? What purpose did this shooting serve? Who are the beneficiaries?

       I think it was supposed to be bigger than it was but something didn't go according to plan. The whole thing just seems off.
      </p>
      <p>
       The biggest thing for me to think it was a set up was paddocks body and how a rifle with its bipod extended was over one of his legs. How would that happen. Also why was there room service for two? Lets not forget the Ellen interview with Jesus Campos and how fucking staged that was.

       I have to agree. Something was suppose to go down but didnt happen and now theres this big mess and their story had to change. Except with so little time they made huge mistakes with their alternate story that would have been. So no more questions and no more answers(horseshit).

       Yep that was weird.

       And why did he shoot himself in the first place, minutes before police even arrived on the floor? Why the two single shots heard on the audio?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, why did he need to break open the window in 32-134? He had the exact same vantage point one pane over in 32-135.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why was the adjoining door closed and locked from the 134 side? Did the wind blow it shut? Was he ever even in there? Was it booked under his name? Why did he need the extra room in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       How were police "100% confident that there were no other people in the room during the shooting" within just 48 hours of the incident, when the shooting stopped before police arrived and there are no hallway cameras?
      </p>
      <p>
       Did he really drive back and forth to Mesquite
       <em>
        5 times
       </em>
       (for a minimum of 10 hours of drive time) on the day of the shooting?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did this antisocial loner have multiple cellphones?
      </p>
      <p>
       I could go on all day.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Someone on an LVA forum theorized that 32-134 was booked under Marilou Danley's name, and that he ordered for two in order to make it seem less strange that one person would be occupying two rooms alone. That would fit with early housekeeping reports that claimed he was in there talking to himself/pretending to talk to someone else.

      <p>
       Oh don't even get me started on that. Beyond bizarre. I still can't get past how Campos and Sheriff Lombardo have two completely conflicting versions of the pre-shooting timeline (with Lombardo's obviously fake version being the better of the two).
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah, something is 100% screwy with Vegas. I've spent
       <del>
        hours
       </del>
       days of my life researching, transcribing, discussing, etc., hoping to make sense of it, but it just doesn't make sense. That said, I'm not yet willing to converge on it being a "false flag." There are still lots of other possibilities in play.

       Isn't a false flag when the narrative attributes the act to someone other than the group responsible? It could simply be a distraction, and it would still qualify as a false flag if the "lone shooter" thing isn't actually true.

       The narrative is supposed to create fear. The benefactors are the defense and weapons industry.

       Sandy Hook, 9/11, Florida, and all the other ones were so clearly inaccurate that it is hard to keep caring. I mean it sucks, but the reality is it doesn't matter. We have no power over those who do these things. WE barely have power to keep ourselves sane. In the end we pick and choose our battles. Right now we can't discuss vegas, because even if the truth came out it wouldn't matter.

       It's hard to disagree with this but, at the same time, the constant pursuit of the truth and attempting to spread that knowledge among others is the only attempt we have to maybe one day not be living in a dystopian state.

       Oh yea for sure I am not saying believe the lie. I am just saying all we need to know is they lied to us. AT the point the details are useless. It is like the JFK papers. Even with a full release I would never for a single second believe a document held for so long.
      </p>
      <p>
       If someone asks we know the main points. That a helicopter, and footage a full gunfight occurring the hotel exist. Both facts prove the american public was lied too. Not to mention Campos etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The majority of the american public probably doesn't believe the official Vegas narrative as is. In my book thats progress.

       Oldmoldy your point is carried by ignorance. You answer Why with how. Which shows that you can't discuss Vegas. You can try, but it be like you discussing any other topic, pointless. You have no use to this cause. You make it worse by muddying the already muddy waters. The majority of people on this subreddit understand that Vegas was dirty(metaphorically speaking) (please tell me i don't have to explain metaphors to you). Point is unless some more evidence comes out that is tangible everything is hear say. Which we already went threw when the shooting happened over a month ago.
      </p>

       WE know we were lied too, and we aren't happy about. Now keep you ignorant tiny shitty thoughts to yourself.
