I really, really wonder what is making all these people pop out now and accuse these people after all these years.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a HUGE Howard Stern fan (or I used to be, he&#39;s terrible anymore) and so I&#39;m a huge George fan because of his involvement on the show.  I just can&#39;t see him doing any of that kind of thing... do I know him personally.  No, but he just doesn&#39;t seem like the type.  </p>

<p>BTW George is denying the allegations, and says he&#39;s taking them very seriously (sue the accuser if it ain&#39;t true).</p>

<p>Something is up.  People piggy backing off one another.</p>

<p>lol... dude, it was on howard stern. It was his gay bachelor party that howard threw for him. The guy he&#39;s groping is jonah falcon... he has the largest penis. George was in the studio the whole week like he usually is, they brought that guy in FOR George to grope.
I&#39;ve listened to every Howard Stern show since like 2000... know what you&#39;re talking about before posting something stupid. You&#39;re trying to insinuate it wasn&#39;t some mutual thing. He&#39;s a gay guy who likes dick, so he grabbed a guy&#39;s dick willingly. Wow.</p>

<p>Plus, isn&#39;t George the one that described his first sexual experience as a child, with an adult man mind you, as a wonderful thing? On the Howard Stern show? Dude is a sick fuck that thinks there&#39;s nothing wrong with men touching boys. Period.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He never said there&#39;s nothing wrong with men touching boys.  Stop saying shit that ain&#39;t true.  He was speaking in terms of his PERSONAL experience... not yours or anyone else&#39;s.</p>

<p>Nobody is defending him, did you even read my comment?  I don&#39;t know him personally.  But, you sure as shit are judging him with absolutely no proof of anything.</p>

<p>This country used to be guilty after facts and testimony were given.  Not accusations made over twitter or some other bullshit social media platform.  I&#39;m tired of shit like this.  I think it&#39;s the younger generation just being completely razed on knowing nothing else but every god damn thing that celebrities post.  Everyone wants to believe that bad in people, but when you come to the defense of somebody, nobody wants to believe that.</p>

<p>So sick of the ignorance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t give a fuck about HIS personal experience. Either men touching boys is wrong, or it&#39;s not. This is not a situation where &quot;context matters.&quot; There is no context where men touching boys is okay.</p>

<p>When Stern asked if he had been molested, Takai responded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No, no. Cause I was kind of, you know — well, I thought he was pretty attractive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And yes he did say it was a wonderful thing. During that interview he went on to say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was both wonderful and scary and kind of intimidating, and delightful. I mean, all those opposites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does that sound like a man condemning child molesters? No. It sounds to me that he&#39;s making excuses for them, and implying the context matters. Just because he, as a 13 yr old, enjoyed being touched by an adult does not make it ok.</p>

<p>CONTEXT DOES NOT MATTER WHEN IT COMES TO MEN TOUCHING BOYS. PERIOD. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are often miscommunications while dating that lead to awkward or unexpected situations. That&#39;s a pretty mild story for something that happened 35 years ago. If you&#39;ve actively dated you have probably experience unwanted advances or given them. They are usually chalked up to &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I misread your interest&quot;.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Christ, this site is filled with out of touch, judgemental people.  Kind of feel sorry for just how not tolerant, the people who claim to be, are.  An Asian man who felt up a gay guy on a radio show, is being judged for doing so, willingly.  Wow.  You can&#39;t even defend somebody who might be innocent.  Because he had somebody say something about him, in your minds, he&#39;s already guilty... Antifa and reddit user accounts are something I&#39;ve noticed share a varied amount of different topics.  Judge, judge, judge... I reserve that for guilty, people proven guilty... not through twitter or the internet, in a court of law.</p>

<p>Do you think that when Donald Trump shaved Vince Vaughn, it was a unscripted display of emotion?</p>
