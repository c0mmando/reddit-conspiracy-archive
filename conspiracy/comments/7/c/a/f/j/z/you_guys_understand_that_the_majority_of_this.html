<p>They&#39;re trying to sow confusion within our society to turn us against each other.  Ever wonder why the majority of the &quot;conspiracies&quot; have a pro conservative slant to them?  </p>

<p>A good way to spot one is if they only have posts in here and The_Donald.  The main focus is to push a pro-white/conservative agenda on this forum, as it&#39;s mostly susceptible Americans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t Russians that want to do that, or at least it&#39;s not only Russians, it&#39;s not even mainly Russians. The global elite want us divided because if we focus on the things that divide us we ignore that the ills we face are mostly brought upon us by this small group of ridiculously wealthy sociopaths - sociopaths who have no national loyalty whatsoever. We all need to realise that at heart all of us, or the vast majority of us ordinary human beings want the same things and what stands in our way of having them - peace, friendship, health, happiness and purpose - is this elite group, who create conflict and problems that we are fooled into believing truly exist and therefore we give our time and our labor over to them in the form of money to pay for the military and the surveillance and the medicines and security equipment etc, all of which truly only benefits them, while we continue to suffer.</p>

<p>If we all understood these simple facts and acted upon them the world would be a different and more wonderful place.</p>

One newspaper in particular that I don&#39;t trust for reporting on political events is The New York Times.  Another is the Washington Post.  I do read Russia Today daily and I see absolutely nothing there which even remotely could be construed as &quot;trying to sow confusion within our society to turn us against each other&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Before I was Dhylan I was Ahbraham but I had to stop using that because somebody figured out who I am.  Before that I was Sailer and every body thought I was Steve Sailer, but that&#39;s not me, and one day I ended up getting shadowbanned because I helped somebody find someone who was lost and I posted something that I should have put in a PM.  Under both of those names I had several tens of thousands of karma for my efforts.  Hell, I have often stated personal info, such as my age (69), where I live (Eugene, Oregon), and much more.  I have even disclosed my identity to a handful of others in a PM because I did something very special once in software and automation which changed the world in a major way and I wanted them to know about it.  So, yes, I appreciate it when someone like you pays me a little respect, and I try to pay it forward, too. thanks for the comment - I really appreciate it.  I do care about the Russians and the Palestinians getting a better shake from the West.  There are people who don&#39;t like that.  Too fucking bad, I say.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. I appreciate where you&#39;re coming from and what you&#39;re doing. Also great to be able to learn a little bit about you as a fellow open source  advocate and developer. I work for McAfee myself as an architect focused on Federal and do some coding on the side; but I&#39;m still 30 years you&#39;re junior so you provide a unique perspective to my thinking. Risky business trusting random strangers on the Internet, but you are correct that I&#39;ll will keep it safe. </p>

<p>Keep fighting the good fight. I&#39;ve never seen it ramp up to this level before, it can&#39;t last forever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>r/Politics and r/The_Donald both have shill armies (paid and brainwashed types alike).</p>

<p>American Liberal/Conservative ideologies are 100% a scam of massive proportions, (both are nearly the same ideology with tweaks to make it look different and appeal to difference fan bases)</p>

<p>pure corporate marketting. DNC/GOP have not been even near centrist for decades.
Both are NEOliberal and NEOconservative.
Not even moderate right, but EXTREME right, and EXTREME authoritarian.</p>

<p>There may also be other types of shills in here like corporate
ones like Moooonsanto pro-GEE MO shills.</p>

<p>&quot;SJWs vs racists&quot; is one of the dumbest techniques the elites
have used to divide and conquer us lol.
Absolutely retarded, but some people still fall for it.
SJW/racist are neither left or right wing, just idiotic stuff the establishment
pushes to cause outrage across the spectrum.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as the left or the right.
Two boxes will NEVER EVER represent the whole spectrum.
Only a corporate media-worshipping retard thinks there&#39;s
only Dems and Repub ideology available lol.
Sadly, many are brainwashed and fluoridated, medicated with big pharma drugs, lack
good nutrition, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This place is a battleground for your mind. Obviously everyone has their political leanings but there are clearly users who come here with an agenda. Russian, Zionist, Left, Right, Corporate PR, you name it.</p>

<p>The good news is that most of these trolls can&#39;t stand up against real objective reasoning. They might try to trigger your ego by calling you names but as long as one doesn&#39;t stoop to their level, they will eventually mass downvote you with their bots and stop responding to you. That&#39;s why I encourage all the readers here not to take the top comments, the # of up/downvotes seriously and actually put in your due diligence to read through all the conversations.</p>

<p>The main reason why trolls and shills can get away with their shenanigans is because most people are lazy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol.  Who has the agenda here? I like Putin. I enjoyed his interview with Oliver Stone.  When he came to power, Russia was a shell of a country, having been completely looted by Oligarchs, and considered a global basket case.  He brought them back economically, put the oligarchs in their place, reestablished the church, national pride, and reasserted Russia as a global power. He gets re-elected in internationally monitored elections regularly.  I think the South Ossetia and Crimea incidents are misportrayed in western media.  The Globalists underestimated him in 2000, gave him some time to evaluate in the eally 2000s, and by mid 2000s he had become their arch enemy.  When he intervened in Syria they basically declared war on him.  Not saying he&#39;s without faults, but there&#39;s no doubt in my mind that he&#39;s one of the good guys. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No that&#39;s a load of crap. I&#39;m left wing and it&#39;s not the case that most conspiracies have a conservative slant to them. Most conspiracy theories are just about what evidence suggests is the case, and is nothing to do with left or right. Both Democrats and Republicans are involved in terrible stuff. The past 8 years before Trump Democrats had more opportunity to do bad things so that&#39;s why more recent conspiracy theories focus on crimes of those people. Before that the conspiracy theories focused on the Bush administration and 9/11 and PNAC and Cheney and Rumsfeld and what they were up to etc. Back then conspiracy theorists were considered left leaning by those who didn&#39;t understand that they weren&#39;t political in that way, because they were about what is true.</p>
