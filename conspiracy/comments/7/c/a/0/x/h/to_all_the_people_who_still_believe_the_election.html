       The most common argument supporting it I saw was, "The evidence will be released soon trust me it's an investigation it's still ongoing". That ship has sailed. A what point will you begin to say maybe there is nothing there? Or will you continue to change the goalposts from "hacking" to meddling, to paying for ads?

       No I am not refusing anything your question clearly implied that you believe either a) there is already evidence out there that I do not see as evidence or b) Any evidence that would be released I wouldn't accept to be true which I am telling you right now is false as am perfectly okay with admitting I am wront and need not be addressed.

       If the answer is a on the other hand, you should show me what you believe to be the evidence I am overlooking.

       The reason I'm asking before hand is because I strongly suspect you will categorically deny anything I refer to.  I want to know what you consider evidence

       I understand that you are trying to fit your answer to my definition of evidence. But the problem with that is that my definition of evidence does not matter. Evidence is simply a fact that supports a certain claim. Like I said before I am okay with being wrong so to take only a small subset of what you claim as evidence would be a disservice to proving your own point.

       If I asked you to provide me "hard verifiable information that has 0 disclaimers about it's vericity and clearly shows both that OJ Simpson killed his wife and why it was OJ Simpson that killed his ex-wife," you couldn't do it.  There is no piece of evidence that proves conclusively that OJ killed his wife.  And a lot of that evidence is based on trust of government experts -- you
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       blood with OJ's DNA was found at the scene, but maybe the cops or the crime lab is lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Would you therefore say, "there is no evidence OJ Simpson killed his ex-wife"?

       Do note evidence is not proof. All these facets(and more we don't know) will be examined by Mueller and he will determine if this evidence implies guilt or not and the courts will decide if this is proof.

       Really id love to see some cold documentation. First hand sources; something like leaked emails between trump and his team; maybe showing them colluding with Russian media icons to push certain news and Russian media asking trump if certain news is good to publish. Possibly some kind of money trail from middle eastern government; that'd surely be evidence.

       There's really no way to prove it.  Wikileaks won't give up their source.  FBI never got access to the DNC server.  You'd need to prove that ATP29 was the hacking group somehow. Then you'd need to prove they work for Putin.

       Equally it is hard to prove it wasn't a Russian hack as evidenced by the forensicators report. He makes two assumptions which invalidate it as proof and just evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       The dates of transfer complete are the last transfer before zipping, so if the files were hacked over the internet, than transfered to/from a USB drive and than zipped it the result would be the same. Asked about this, his response was why would try do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       His second assumption is that each file transfer began when the last ended. There were minutes of no transfer before the file immediately before the multiple GB file that is used for calculation. If a hacker performed multiple downloads, getting the earlier smaller file while the large one was already transferring it could duplicate the resulting dates.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really is difficult to pin the culprit without wikileaks providing evidence.

       What are they supposed to do? When the Seth Rich thing comes out it will be really bad for them. The kid was murdered, irrespective of what happened people will believe it was the DNC.

       The CIA director just met former NSA guy William Binney, on the President's behest. He will have presented him the evidence that the official story is a technical impossibility. Meaning the intelligence agencies have fabricated this story to unseat a President. The implications here are enormous.

       I dunno... the ambiguous usage of constantly saying "Russia hacked our elections" really took it's toll then... cause when polled 59% of Democrats believed that the tallies were changed by Russia.

       That's a different thing -- if you're saying voters got confused by headlines saying "Russia hacked the elections," that wouldn't surprise me.  But that's different form saying the MSM claimed Russia manipulated vote totals.  I never saw that.

       There was some intentional misleading with the hacking. Intentionally poorly worded "Russian hacking influenced election" so people would run with it. They don't need to worry about clarifying it. They know people won't read there articles anyway,  instead they go to comment sections to scream "Russian hackers/trolls/nazi" and that's all people will see.

        Correction: September 14, 2017
An article on Sept. 2 about investigations into election tampering in several states referred incorrectly to problems with voter rolls in three North Carolina counties that included the cities of Raleigh, Winston-Salem and Charlotte. The problems involved paper rolls, not e-poll books.

       I don't get how you didn't see the massive backtrack on that claim in the week following, when the states that DHS said were hacked said that DHS was wrong and they hadn't been hacked. Talk about living in a filter bubble!
      </p>
      <p>
       This whole thing then quickly fell out of the media spotlight. So ask yourself what's really going on here? DHS put this out deliberately knowing it would make people think Russians hacked the election, knowing the media would sensationalise it and report in such a way that people would assume Russia hacked the election and that when the truth was revealed most mainsream outlets would barely cover that error. Why? Because they want you to think the election was illegitimate, they want you to be primed to believe that any news that they don't want you to believe  is actually false and planted by Russians. It's all lies. Have a look at your own echo chamber and ensure you are getting your information from multiple diverse sources.

       Scam would imply that the attackers were simply trying to scam him out of his payment information. It most certainly was an attack intended to grant them access to his device. I suppose this is all just semantics but, button line, it's important to note that it indeed was a hack.

       Why do you assume it is support of Trump and not simply support of believing things only on the basis of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have a read of this Atlantic article, maybe it will explain for you why people are finding it difficult to believe all this Russia hacked the election hysteria, not because they support Trump, but because they don't believe in jumping on bandwagons without any evidence just because 'the authorities' told them to:

       Nice play on words. Nobody is saying that the election was hacked. It was influenced. There were some hacked emails though that conveniently got released on Wikileaks.

       Is this report from the top intelligence agencies  CIA FBI and NSA not enough with a 25 page declassified report? There's probably tons of more pages classified!

       I dunno what else can be considered hard evidence right now.

       Mueller needs up to a full year or more to do his investigation. He only started in May of 2017. Probably by that time in 2018 or a couple months after will his investigation conclude. It's thorough as hell, and it's exciting! Look at Trumps team already going down for shit unrelated and related to the Trump campaign. Literally hilarious!

       I've noticed that people only bring up the fact that the investigation isn't complete yet, urging us all to just wait and see, in response to people calling out the lack of evidence -- never in response to people jumping to conclusions based on imaginary evidence.

       If the investigation started in May, they've had six months. Everyone got excited about the 30+ sealed indictments thinking Podesta or Hillary went down, but we won't know until there's a conviction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then there's the guy who worked on the Trump campaign that plead guilty to lying about meeting with multiple Russian agents trying to setup a meeting between Trump and Putin

       I would hardly call that imaginary.
      </p>
      <p>
       The investigation isn't about Russian hacking, it's looking into Russia's involvement, and one head has already rolled for lying about their attempts to bring Trump and Putin together, in less than
       <em>
        6 months
       </em>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, I say let's wait to see what all those sealed indictments will reveal. I don't care what side gets shafted, I just want to see criminals go to jail.

       Anyone notice it's strange the media isn't trying to interview Julian Assange, who was the guy who actually released all the emails that this whole investigation revolves around? They know what we all know, and he has stated it wasn't the Russians. He's done more to hint at Seth Rich than anything, and it seems the evidence is pointing to the info being leaked more than hacking by Russians.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus there was this that came out before the election. This is interesting if you haven't seen it, CIA guy talking about how military intel community was releasing info to wikileaks to prevent Clinton from becoming president:

       What are they supposed to do? When the Seth Rich thing comes out it will be really bad for them. The kid was murdered, irrespective of what happened people will believe it was the DNC.
      </p>
      <p>
       The CIA director just met former NSA guy William Binney, on the President's behest. He will have presented him the evidence that the official story is a technical impossibility. Meaning the intelligence agencies have fabricated this story to unseat a President. The implications here are enormous.
