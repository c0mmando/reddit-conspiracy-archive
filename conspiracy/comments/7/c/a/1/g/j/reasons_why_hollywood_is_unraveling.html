        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The reason Hollywood is unraveling is simple. The hush money has dried up. All these years, people in Hollywood kept their mouth shut because the money was good for everyone. </p>

<p>You keep quiet, and I&#39;ll pay you an absurd amount of money on behalf of my client. This is all unraveling because the money is no longer there. The actors aren&#39;t getting jobs. There&#39;s no money to pay people for spying, PR plants, or character assassinations. </p>

<p>As everyone knows, people are no longer going to movies the way they use to, for the most part this Summer&#39;s Box office was a complete flop. And while network and streaming projects are becoming more popular the money isn&#39;t nearly as long. </p>

<p>Many of these victims aren&#39;t brave. They&#39;re exposing their &quot;abusers&quot; because of broken &quot;contracts&quot; and &quot;agreements.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To me, this makes so much sense. I was thinking, ‘why now?’ Why expose them now after the Cosby saga. Now I get it. Its for the same reason.</p>

<p>The Cosby women exposed him when their dreams of stardom were folded-no money. These women are exposing these men for the same reason, the money has dried up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats overly simplistic, and a very negative attitude to the accusers.</p>

<p>Many people have made accusations for decades. Not all of them took hush money. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies">Harvey Weinstein hired ex-Mossad agents to spy on accusers, to harass and intimidate them.</a></p>

<p>Yes, some, probably quite a few made their accusations when &quot;<em>their dreams of stardom were folded-no money</em>&quot;, but another way to phrase that is they were to afraid and intimidated of having the dreams and careers ruined to come forward, and for very good reason, if the story i linked to is true (or others like it). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I cut the cable years ago, I only stream what I watch. And clearly you missed the part of my comment where I mentioned the issue of him appointing a bunch of Goldman Sachs people to positions of power.. </p>

<p>Then there&#39;s all the deregulating he&#39;s doing, most of which just makes the rich, richer.. while harming the people the regulations are intended to protect.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen plenty of articles that did deep analysis of the proposed tax cuts, and they seem to say that no one making under 100k a year will see any actual benefit. That&#39;s by financial analysts and people working in economics, not the mainstream media.</p>

<p>But sure, go ahead and make assumptions and blame the media. That really doesn&#39;t work well in this sub that rarely believes the media.</p>

    <div class="md"><h1>Great fucking post!</h1>

<p>This really got me thinking. Because Hollywood felt like a coordinated effort but I couldn&#39;t figure out how someone coughCIAcough could pull this off. &quot;Under New Management&quot; &quot;Follow the Money&quot; is what happened</p>

<p>Things that that are losing their strength.
ISIS. When was the last time you saw another &quot;hero&quot; photo shoot of the Oscar award winning branch of ISIS/CIA in the news?</p>

<p>Antifa. They lost all of the wind in their sails on the 4th. It was so bad that they resorted to &quot;it was a prank bro&quot; </p>

<p>Hollywood is falling faster than WTC 7. And it seems to coincide with Soros dumping everything into Open Society.</p>

<p>Reddit even seems to slowly be awakening with the recent posts in showerthoughts about not idolizing Hollywood and the other I forget where about dark secrets no one talks about that was loaded with red pills the MSM will not cover. Hell, the top post in pics right now is a virtue signal about deported Mexican US vets saluting the US flag in mexico today. Thing is, OP swiped the pic from an article about them being deported for felonies like shooting into a car full of people. And the most upvoted posts are pointing this out.</p>

<p>Thanks OP! You really just tied a lot of shit together for me!!!</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, it&#39;s fucking obvious, just like it&#39;s manufactured that there&#39;s a ton of alt right people. Wasn&#39;t the group in Charlottesville actually being led by some liberal?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I really hate how much of these conspiracies involve Jews. I was raised Jewish and come from a long line of really amazing Jews who started businesses, worked in government, they made insane wealth during the depression from starting metal forging businesses which BOOMED during the war. My father&#39;s side was even involved in Jewish mafias - so I guess we&#39;d be prime targets for being involved in these sorts of nasty things. But we aren&#39;t. We don&#39;t even practice anymore and my father works at a Christian church to aid the homeless. My grandfather spent his retirement aiding the homeless as well through Habitat for Humanity. They&#39;re deeply spiritual, smart, moral people. They&#39;re not complete Zionists and I&#39;ve even heard my question Israel as potentially engaging in genocide against the Palestinians and simply wants peace.</p>

<p>They are solid 100% American men who believe deeply in American values, democracy, and question official narratives just like people here. My father has been privately very open to the conspiracies I&#39;ve shown him even though he works for a major Government agency. He voted for H but said he felt really bad about it because she simply seemed to be the &quot;lesser of two evils&quot;. Crazy shit. Sometimes I wonder if some of this is just in our genetics? We&#39;re all very intelligent, professional, powerful people who have made major changes in our communities for the better. I know that is a really dangerous thought these days. I just hope when the hammer drops it&#39;s not another tribalist based race war. Some of us are very good people who are on the good side. We should be very careful of blaming an entire religion.</p>

<p>Everyone with a HD video camera is producing content now. Makes the money pretty thin.</p>

<p>They&#39;re exposing their &quot;abusers&quot; because of broken &quot;contracts&quot; and &quot;agreements.&quot;</p>

<p>That would explain it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for the most part this Summer&#39;s Box office was a complete flop.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It sure seems that way. I don&#39;t track the numbers for this, but I&#39;ve seen several summer films quickly move to DVD.</p>

<p>I know for some time they were courting Chinese investors; I have to wonder if that funding source dried up at some point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate to break it to you, but as far as antifa goes, it really looks like a fabricated enemy created by the right. Multiple groups on Facebook confirmed to be run by conservative trolls.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the thing, it&#39;s fucking obvious, just like it&#39;s manufactured that there&#39;s a ton of alt right people. Wasn&#39;t the group in Charlottesville actually being led by some liberal?</p>

<p>Divide and distract, that&#39;s all it was. It doesn&#39;t help us that so many just accepted actual propaganda because it opposes their ideology. The powers that be are far too successful with this kind of bullshit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not only that, but hollywood and all the fake forced culture of these media corporations is cliche and really just fake culture. I&#39;ve disconnected from it 99% and left the plantation. Now I watch mostly videos being created by people on youtube talking about everything you don&#39;t get to see on the mainstream media. Plenty of content that is much more interesting.</p>
