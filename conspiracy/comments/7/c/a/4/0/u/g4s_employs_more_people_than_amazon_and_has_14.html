        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G4S">G4S</a> hires 585,000 people.</p>

<p>By comparison Amazon is the 2nd largest employer in the U.S. according to this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers_in_the_United_States">list of largest employers in the United States</a> at 541,900 people.</p>

<p>G4S should be number eight on this list of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers">largest private employers in the world</a> but I guess Forbes didn&#39;t do their research.</p>

<p>You would think G4S would be a household name, but it&#39;s mainly only talked about by conspiracy theorists because of its relation to several mass shootings.</p>

<p>It is the world&#39;s largest security company measured by revenues and has operations in around 125 countries.</p>

<p>The company offers a range of services, including the supply of security personnel, monitoring equipment, response units and secure prisoner transportation. G4S also works with governments overseas to deliver security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like Black Cube, I never heard about G4S until recently. I guess this means that they are good at what they do. </p>

<p>Like Black Cube, I would bet that G4S is filled with ex-israeli intelligence and military operatives. The fact that they were hardly mentioned in the media following Orlando proves that they are very powerful players. </p>
