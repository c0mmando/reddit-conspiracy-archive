        G4S
       </a>
       hires 585,000 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       By comparison Amazon is the 2nd largest employer in the U.S. according to this

       </a>
       at 541,900 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       G4S should be number eight on this list of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_employers">
        largest private employers in the world
       </a>
       but I guess Forbes didn't do their research.
      </p>
      <p>
       You would think G4S would be a household name, but it's mainly only talked about by conspiracy theorists because of its relation to several mass shootings.

       Iâ€™m waiting too.  It seems a bit contradictory to say how many fucking people they employ and then say there is something fishy about one (maybe another ?) employee doing a mass shooting.

       According to Wikipedia:
      </p>
      <p>
       It is the world's largest security company measured by revenues and has operations in around 125 countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The company offers a range of services, including the supply of security personnel, monitoring equipment, response units and secure prisoner transportation. G4S also works with governments overseas to deliver security.

       They're not evil, just very sizeable due to the nature of their services portfolio. Look at the other large employers like Kelly Services and Accenture.

       Like Black Cube, I never heard about G4S until recently. I guess this means that they are good at what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like Black Cube, I would bet that G4S is filled with ex-israeli intelligence and military operatives. The fact that they were hardly mentioned in the media following Orlando proves that they are very powerful players.
