       Trump is not on the people's side and this Russian/Wikileaks/Trump conspiracy is blown WAY out of proportion by the mind manipulative MSM. I weep for those who can't see this.
      </p>
      <p>
       If trump was truly for the people his voice would have been silenced a long time ago. His negative coverage by the msm is still coverage. If he was a true threat to the establishment he would have had hardly any coverage from the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
       And this Russian/Wikileaks/Trump conspiracy is pretty much bullshit. The executive branch has been controlled by the hidden hand for a long time now. A real conspiracy is the average American taxpayer spending $23,386 on death and destruction which has brought millions of people to a violent demise based on a LIE (which the lie itself killed thousands on 9/11 including the deadly air which rescue workers were told was safe to breathe).
      </p>
      <p>
       The true ruling cliques in this world are limiting the debate to a certain spectrum of acceptable opinion so you don't see through the bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's one big fucking mind game to them and they are playing the fuck out of us.
      </p>

       The quote is by Gatekeeper Chomsky.

       But you’re okay w/ Al Jazeera Propaganda?

      <p>
       I have another theory on why the media would still want to give Trump extremely negative coverage. $$$ and ratings have went way up while the rally up their base to assassinate the elected President’s character and whoever voted or supports him.

       And as an extension of the "conspiracy", the media keeps telling people that they have to choose one of these lies or the other. Everyone must belong either to the Trump-is-our-saviour camp or the Trump/Assange/Putin-stole-the-election camp. They just pretend that those of us who see that
       <em>
        both

       are lies don't even exist.

       What I have noticed this week on NPR is a lively debate about sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. Very little/none about pedophilia. They are trying hard to shape it as dirty and a few bad apples but not evil and pervasive blackmail network that it is.

       The media covered Trump from the start because they thought he would be easy for Hillary to beat.  They were expecting a McGovern or Goldwater type of defeat...
      </p>
      <p>
       Podesta emails showed that they believed Trump to be a Pied Piper candidate and they urged their friends in the media to push him.
      </p>
      <p>
       When Bill Clinton finished 2nd in New Hampshire, he was the comeback kid and got covered like he had won and not Paul Tsongas.
      </p>
      <p>
       When John Kasich, who was polling best v HRC, finished second in New Hampshire, the media declared it a three man race between Trump, Cruz and Rubio.....Rubio was already down 20+ in Fla, his home state, so they knew Rubio would soon be gone.
