        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Trump is not on the people&#39;s side and this Russian/Wikileaks/Trump conspiracy is blown WAY out of proportion by the mind manipulative MSM. I weep for those who can&#39;t see this. </p>

<p>If trump was truly for the people his voice would have been silenced a long time ago. His negative coverage by the msm is still coverage. If he was a true threat to the establishment he would have had hardly any coverage from the beginning.</p>

<p>And this Russian/Wikileaks/Trump conspiracy is pretty much bullshit. The executive branch has been controlled by the hidden hand for a long time now. A real conspiracy is the average American taxpayer spending $23,386 on death and destruction which has brought millions of people to a violent demise based on a LIE (which the lie itself killed thousands on 9/11 including the deadly air which rescue workers were told was safe to breathe).</p>

<p>The true ruling cliques in this world are limiting the debate to a certain spectrum of acceptable opinion so you don&#39;t see through the bullshit.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one big fucking mind game to them and they are playing the fuck out of us.</p>

<p>The quote is by Gatekeeper Chomsky.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But you’re okay w/ Al Jazeera Propaganda?</p>

<p>I have another theory on why the media would still want to give Trump extremely negative coverage. $$$ and ratings have went way up while the rally up their base to assassinate the elected President’s character and whoever voted or supports him.</p>

<p>Go walk around with a MAGA cap on in Hollywood and see what happens...</p>

<p>And as an extension of the &quot;conspiracy&quot;, the media keeps telling people that they have to choose one of these lies or the other. Everyone must belong either to the Trump-is-our-saviour camp or the Trump/Assange/Putin-stole-the-election camp. They just pretend that those of us who see that <em>both</em> are lies don&#39;t even exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The media covered Trump from the start because they thought he would be easy for Hillary to beat.  They were expecting a McGovern or Goldwater type of defeat...</p>

<p>Podesta emails showed that they believed Trump to be a Pied Piper candidate and they urged their friends in the media to push him.</p>

<p>When Bill Clinton finished 2nd in New Hampshire, he was the comeback kid and got covered like he had won and not Paul Tsongas.</p>

<p>When John Kasich, who was polling best v HRC, finished second in New Hampshire, the media declared it a three man race between Trump, Cruz and Rubio.....Rubio was already down 20+ in Fla, his home state, so they knew Rubio would soon be gone.</p>
