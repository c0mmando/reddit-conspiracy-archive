<p>BUT! Check this: they chose to have a self-incriminating collusion conversation on TWITTER- of all places.</p>

<p>Its too easy. Its too stupid. They wouldn&#39;t have had this interaction unless they wanted it to be discovered and released. There has to be more to this.</p>

<p>The only thing that could make sense is that Wikileaks/Trump WANTED people to find out about their direct contact. </p>

He&#39;s hyper aware of his own farts because his head is up his ass.

<p>From The Atlantic article,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to a source familiar with the congressional investigations into Russian interference with the 2016 campaign, who requested anonymity because the investigation is ongoing, on the same day that Trump Jr. received the first message from WikiLeaks, he emailed other senior officials with the Trump campaign, including Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale, and Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, telling them WikiLeaks had made contact. </p>

Wikileaks abandoning impartiality and Trump using wikileaks as a fake impartial source for attacking their opponent.

<p>This makes total sense but completely defies the logic of them using TWITTER DMs to communicate. What certainty would they have had that those DMs wouldn&#39;t have leaked before election day, proving that Wikileaks was in fact not impartial and giving credence the narrative that Assange was helping rig it for Trump?? This is what makes zero sense and tells me there&#39;s more to this- and that this exchange was intentional with the foresight that it would be monitored and leaked </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is a completely false and unfounded statement. In other words you are completely wrong.  Wikileaks is an independently run organization. How could Trump have “used” them? He just got lucky that Wikileaks were given his opponents emails; lucky that the DNC emails revealed so much corruption within the Democratic Party. You should be grateful that Wikileaks exposes this corruption. People died trying to bring it to light. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Haha, wow. Wikileaks has never abandoned impartiality and none of the documents they have released HAVE EVER BEEN PROVEN TO BE FALSE. So no, it’s not a fake source. It’s a very real source. Once again, you are wrong.</p>

<p>And you can call it impartial all you want, but releasing the DNC emails was a fair thing to do. If anything, it leveled the playing field between Trump and Clinton. She had they entire mainstream media and Hollywood behind her. Basically all of the MSM coverage of Trump was negative, and they spent collectively 92% of their entire election coverage on Trump.</p>

<p>So if you want to be mad about our current situation, then you should be blaming the DNC for rigging the primary against Bernie, and for running the most dishonest, pathetic presidential campaign this country has ever seen.</p>

<p>Im also sure it was assumed that those messages would be instantly monitored and eventually released.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t seem like people are thinking rationally about this news at all. The conspiracy within the conspiracy lol</p>

<p>If he thought that was true, why lie (or at least not admit to it) until now?  Why not bring it up to the press when it happened?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe there was/is some foreseen benefit of having it released as a &quot;leak&quot;- make it look like it&#39;s explosive/damning/secret messages that they did not want leaked.</p>

<p>I get the impression the Trump camp wanted the media/public reaction that we are seeing today.</p>

<p>Another honeypot?? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no crime. There&#39;s no proof of Wikileaks&#39; pro-Trump bias or pro-Russian bias. The entire convo clearly indicated that Wikileaks had no Trump information and was soliciting Trump info to leak. This was so it could counter the Hillary campaign&#39;s claims that it was pro-Trump. &quot;You&#39;re attacking Hillary because you&#39;re pro-Trump, you&#39;re pro-Trump because you&#39;re attacking Hillary.&quot; It&#39;s a standard PR issue, doesn&#39;t prove Wikileaks is systemically biased, and is quite frankly underwhelming and mundane. </p>

<p>I wrote about it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ctf0n/my_quick_interp_of_the_wikileakstrump_mails_is/">here</a>, it&#39;s been downvoted by hysteric shills however. Who strangely also refuse to comment on my logical points. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The oddest of bedfellows.   But these are the times we live in.   Wikileaks lives on the edge of secrecy and disclosure though,  there are no accidents when it comes to how Julian choses between.   On the other hand,   the bull in a china shop reality tv star casino mobster we have as president,  has a single redeeming feature:  talking shit to the deep state at odd intervals.    To have a US president do this for the first time since 1963,  no matter the flaws,  is enough.   Especially when the alternative is Hillary or anything mainstream Democratic Party.   The Democratic Party sold out so          wholeheartedly,   became such a shill for Wall Street,  such an enemy of the people,   that strange bedfellows is all we have left.</p>

<p>So, what are the consequences of this? Assange forced to disclose the entirety WL communicatios under subpoena. Which gets Assange off the hook for his stated imperative to not reveal sources. But under the legal demands of a subpoena, he has &quot;no choice&quot;.</p>

<p>And what are they gonna find in WL correspondences?</p>
