        Faults respond by type.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Faults that's plates 'expand' typically exhibit growth post event. During a 4-10 hr holding period.
      </p>
      <p>
       Faults that contrast / subduct typically exhibit symptoms on gain. 4-6 hours into storm conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strike slips are mid storm. +/-
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Findings:
       </strong>
       If we are at a holding speed for a prolonged time. Quakes typically come sooner then expected.
      </p>
      <p>
       If winds remain elevated for a long duration the estimated size will diminish during that time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cme's typically enduce more seismic activity then coronal wind streams. 'Likely' due to their high proton mass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Coronal holes near sunspots are also more complex. The larger either region is, the more likely the data will work over.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>

       **Thank you for ignoring the post, and the data provided in this post, which clearly shows (yet again), the "PATTERN", which I feel humans can use to their advantage- Via earthquake prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note the velocity changes in those prior flares did not indicate an earthquake as I was expecting would surface (had earth been hit by a glancing blow at that time).
      </p>
      <p>
       But the data still stands for this recent quake series, as well as the past Mexico City Earthquakes, as well as all other quakes I assessed this year, (and last year).

       Most users I collaborate with share a common understanding from an introspective position, that the theory has supporting evidence in becoming a sufficient mean of earthquake prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please stop assessing my next move, based on your personal position- There are many things I am finding you "comfortable with" which I find "unusual"...

      <ul>
       <li>
        <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/grl.50211/full">
         ...some advocates of hypotheses in which solar-terrestrial interaction does actually trigger earthquakes have reported the identification of different types of correlations of possible relevance. Before such claims can be regarded as valid, advocates need to demonstrate the statistical significance of their correlations in objectively chosen historical data sets. To guard against inspection and selection biases, advocates of solar-terrestrial triggering of earthquakes also need to demonstrate the persistence and statistical significance of their claimed correlations against future data. This has not been done. And until it is, the hypothesis that solar-terrestrial interaction can trigger earthquakes must be regarded with significant skepticism.

       I think its electric fluid dynamics. very similar to thermo dynamic principal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its an electric pulsation and wave which overrides a harmonious system. Very similar to an engine which shudders. Although I feel the root cause is an electric override and I also believe that is why we detect an electric charge sub surface prior to a given seismic event.
      </p>
      <p>
       The influencing of earths flux tubes, and their dynamics of accelerating under outside charging atoms lead me to believe I identified the system. (this could be far off) (I fully admit that).
      </p>
      <p>
       However it appears that humans can easily refute the cause for now, and simply incorporate the data assessments to provide a basic warning system. (using the most common circumstances to begin shaping a predictive model)...
      </p>
      <p>
       I really am beginning to think its impossible to ignore how irrelevant the "science is". Here we have a scenario, where it appears situation A. Will dictate the outcome of Situation B. (A basic pitch regulator) which gauges the outcome of a seismic event, based on the given solar Live data?

       Why the hell are we "Not" Using this to our advantage?

       Why the hell does everyone have a problem with me suggesting it, when I've done some pretty compelling shit with this very same data which is available to all of you, to cross reference?

       I agree. Here is how life is like a computer and ferrofluids and electricity work. Magma and metallic fluid react to magnetism and electricity as they relate to each other. Here are a few links about spinning hard drives, like the solar system, central power and harmony. Might help you out? I get lost in this problem a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our earths magnetosphere acts as a faraday cage containing or molten metal core. When the outside force over powers this, it pulls the inner core fluids out. This causes the tectonic plates to flex... Ferrofluidd act this way.
      </p>

       Im sure their is much more to micro and macrosystems on this exchange but I'm being basic.

       is as far as i've explored the theory (by hypothesis). It needs an experienced user to provide many corrections I am sure. Yet I think If you cared you would have some important insights, into the mechanical structure if you hadn't read it yet (the link).

       I see your idea of atmospheric interaction working in conjunction of high energy particles and magnetism. You bring up animals and migratory birds vs earthquake incidences may be worth layering to compare vs atmospheric conditions.

       Of all users ifrikkenr, You are one of the few that I found most capable of assessing this data, and cause effect scenario.

       Thanks for reading my posts.

       I fully give you my permission to expand on anything I have done. 
Your a good person, and I think its users like you that will carry this to the next level of both exposure, and crafting. Getting us one unique step closer to finally solving the argument of this "too be or not to be". 
Thanks for sticking around, and its sad to say we lost earthsmith because the top minds "parsingsol's" a 'scammer' brigade.

       Thanks man. You've inspired me a bit the past year to look in to the relationship much closer and develop my own theories and methods.

       and again, my monitoring equipment wasn't logging data for that day and the the two days prior - though it had been for the 11 days prior to that - terrible luck. I've now missed logging three quakes over the past 6 months

       On the upside, I have one the thing many people don't: access to frequent earthquakes. It's just a game of patience.

      <p>
       Once I've got my setup refined and reliably monitoring three or so data points, I plan to install a second monitoring station at my parents house ~100km to the North-East of here and a third at my partners parents house about 50km to the North. If any of my theories hold any validity, pre-quake data should appear at all stations more-or-less simultaneously and if patterns begin to emerge, triangulation of locations and magnitudes of future quakes could become possible. e.g a magnitude 4 in Wellington causes x,y,z data readout 1 hour prior at stations 1, 2, and 3. So logically if we see that pattern ever again, a similar quake should be expected in the same location.

       Theory is all about adaptation, and explaining your failures as they are identified.
      </p>
      <p>
       My biggest mistake early on was concluding the high velocity shifts (to japan only). This because the main 9.0 in 2011 had multiple aftershocks (following the solar weather pattern / sequences). It only occurred to me it worked for all major quakes when I was predicting the scale correct yet missing the location data. (i.e. proposal Japan. 7.3, Event 7.3 Mexico).
      </p>
      <p>
       I caught on to the quakes following the bz componet breaches from the 2011 3/11 9.0 itself. After several (non reddit) posts, on various posts it came to my attention that a predictive model could likely be devised. (everything you've read here since is my chasing that dream). 
It may always be a dream, but I am glad that the significant work I have left is also inspiring others to make their own systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I just hope we are successful in terms of it helping others. (although it would be cool to have a reputation our families could be proud of in the end). (should we ever be credited at all)&gt;?

       **Thank you for ignoring the post, and the data provided in this post, which clearly shows (yet again), the "PATTERN", which I feel humans can use to their advantage- Via earthquake prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also note the velocity changes in those prior flares did not indicate an earthquake as I was expecting would surface (had earth been hit by a glancing blow at that time).
      </p>
      <p>
       But the data still stands for this recent quake series, as well as the past Mexico City Earthquakes, as well as all other quakes I assessed this year, (and last year).
