    <div class="md"><p>Because Wikileaks was fishing for info. Trying to get Trump to leak info to them. Ya know. Journalism. CNN was sucking Hillarys lady dick. Ooo yea, and there&#39;s that thing where Hillary wanted to kill JA. I kinda think he doesn&#39;t like her. Anyways, CNN is a US MSM network and Wikileaks isn&#39;t. We are talking about a US election right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I view them both as publishers. I hated CNN for helping a side. </p>

<p>And yes Clinton wanted to kill him, she should be jailed for conspiring murder through hire. </p>

<p>This still doesn&#39;t excuse trump and Wikileaks for working to have impact together which Clinton did with 90% of us media. </p>

<p>We must separate bias or this won&#39;t end. I&#39;m on your side and attacked everyone earlier over it. Upon reflecting I see that both are wrong. Equality should be the goal for publishers.</p>

It didn&#39;t work because Trump did not leak it with JA. He leaked it himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t leak it through WL. Did WL want him to? Obviously. That&#39;s what they do. It sounds like WL was trying to convince Trump that he should give them what they wanted. Kinda like a network channel trying to get the broadcasting rights to the Super Bowl. Don&#39;t you think CNN also wanted to be the publisher of the leaks? What actually happened with Hillary and CNN is totally different. She had journalists checking in with her and asking her permission to publish certain things. I don&#39;t believe in party lines and think both the Bushes and Clintons should be tried for treason but if you can&#39;t see the difference between what Hillary did and this twitter conversation then all hope is lost for you in a sub like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me enlighten you on trump and Clinton being terrible...</p>

<p>B Clinton redid the regulations on the community reinvestment act of 77. Trump Giuliani Bloomberg Silverstein. Lefrank/Blackstone and the biggest property owners lobbied to get this. Trump smoozed the Clinton&#39;s to get this. </p>

<p>Trump and other feudal lords gave predatory loans through mega banks and financial holdings to people who owned property but couldn&#39;t manage the loan if the market dropped.</p>

<p>Once the signed enough people up, they devalued their properties. This caused the loanees to default and the lords and barons got the properties for pennies because of fractional reserve lending. They then devalued high. They flushed this nit real gains into the market. (Keep in mind they stole mom and pops retirement and Homes). They then killed all business and used that gashed gains to fix things up. This directly caused gentrification and the destruction of Americana global heritage neighborhoods and buroughs. </p>

<p>In 2008, this collapsed the housing market. Now we see mega inflation, skyrocketing rent, corporations taking over ethnic heritage restraunts and business, and distributional crime and an explosion of jail population.</p>

<p>Trump is a cronies capitalist.</p>

<p>Sooo... Podesta group... Hillarys campaign manager was the founder, John Podesta. Jeb Bush&#39;s campaign manager was the podesta CEO. Trumps campaign had 3 podesta contributors... </p>

<p>How can you slam the others while over looking your own candidates connections? They are all fucked. </p>
