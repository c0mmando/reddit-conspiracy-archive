        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><h1>WHY gay teens increased 900% since 1980: ILLUMINATI DRUGS agenda to advance HOMO / PEDO agenda</h1>

<p><strong>ILLUMINATI DRUGS AGENDA - TYPOLOGY</strong><br/>
ILLUMINATI DRUGS agenda has two main subtypes: hidden or not.</p>

<p><strong>Not Hidden</strong><br/>
The not hidden agenda has two main subtypes:<br/>
- &quot;Black is White&quot;. Example: doping conspiracy agenda, pretending to fight drugs to market drugs.<br/>
- Straight. Examples: psychotropics agenda, ultimate example for children: RITALIN marketed by prime news packaged as &quot;news&quot;; doctors prescribing it to kids; water fluoridation agenda.<br/>
- Mixed. Example: marijuana agenda. Transition from mix to straight subtype is almost completed.  </p>

<p><strong>Hidden</strong><br/>
As in all other illuminati fake wars, theater is staged to suggest that the war to &quot;protect consumers&quot; is real.<br/>
The FDA plays the &quot;enforce standards&quot; role by pretending to label products but in fact not declaring the hidden chemical weapons.<br/>
There are two basic hidden types: drugs added while the product is manufactured or not.</p>

<p><strong>Hidden, drugs added while the product is manufactured</strong><br/>
The trick here is basically labeling the product.<br/>
An example about milk, cream, and 17 other dairy products like yogurt, sweetened condensed milk, sour cream, and others:<br/>
&quot;<em>the petitioners [two illuminati controlled dairy organizations] state that milk flavored with non-nutritive sweeteners should be labeled as milk without further claims</em>&quot; (1).<br/>
This is nothing but the technique of upscaling the contents level while keeping the package.<br/>
The technique of downscaling the package while keeping or even upsacaling the contents is also used: new regulations that will no longer require to label certain drugs.</p>

<p><strong>Hidden, drugs NOT added while the product is manufactured - ULTIMATE weapon is BPA</strong><br/>
BPA the ultimate weapon to advance several agendas, including the pedophilia and gay agendas.<br/>
The KEY use of BPA is in containers.  </p>

<p>There are two basic techniques for passing the drug:<br/>
1&amp;#46; Passive, slow pace:<br/>
- Canned foods.<br/>
- PET water bottles now the most important container in some areas. Amount of BPA passed to water depends on storage time, sunlight and ever increasingly BPA quantity added to PET.</p>

<p>2&amp;#46; Active, fast to nuclear pace:<br/>
- from receipts (2), with BPA added to ink entering through the skin of consumers ...<br/>
- to the BPA atomic bomb: baby bottles, possible after illuminati brainwashed mothers to &quot;disarm&quot;, by not feed breasting their babies.</p>

<p><strong>BPA, ULTIMATE weapon to advance the androgynous / homosexual / pedophilia agenda</strong><br/>
No other illuminati weapon has contributed as much to the gay teens increase of astronomical 900% since 1980 than the chemical weapon BPA (3).<br/>
It starts from the very beginning, even before baby bottles, the mini-nukes of the gay/pedophilia agenda: BPA during Gestation Changes Sexual Development of Children.  </p>

<p>Last Prophet&#39;s words from 2009:<br/>
<em>&quot;People&quot; are being irradiated with energy saving lamps (Illuminati have now prohibited the sale of normal bulb lamps), that change the hormonal (endocrine) system of &quot;humans&quot; and devastating for children (The Homogay Agenda and the Androgynous child ).</em>
<em>The same agenda that is advanced also with PET bottles (bisphenol A), as there are now hardly any glass bottles in the &quot;market&quot;</em> (4).  </p>

<p><strong>BPA and the Beasts</strong><br/>
Once citizens accepted voting machines thus formally becoming beasts, the illuminati are able to openly tell how they use BPA, accordingly to one of the principle of the illuminati religion: to mock the human cattle.<br/>
With voting machines, at the end of the day, the illuminati will always have the last word, as bizarre as that last word might be (5).   </p>

<p>Example of all this, from illuminati controlled Wikipedia (6):<br/>
<em>In April 2011, the Maine legislature passed a bill to ban the use of BPA in baby bottles, sippy cups, and other reusable food and beverage containers, effective 1 January 2012.</em><br/>
<em>Governor LePage refused to sign the bill.</em><br/>
<em>LePage added: &quot;The only thing that I&#39;ve heard is if you take a plastic bottle and put it in the microwave and you heat it up, it gives off a chemical similar to estrogen.
So the worst case is some women may have little beards.&quot;</em></p>

<p><strong><em>Notes</em></strong><br/>
(1) The International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF), are petitioning the Food and Drug Administration<br/>

<p>(2) In some cases a receipt from a cash register can contain 100 milligrams of free BPA:<br/>

<p>(3) Angelic google returns Last Prophet&#39;s words about the weapon of mass destruction BPA:<br/>

<p>(4) Advance the androgynous agenda implies that BPA is also an important weapon to advance the Global Genocide agenda.<br/>
WATER BREAKING NEWS: illuminati OFFICIALLY reveal HOW they have been poisoning the populace<br/>

<p>(5) November 6, 2012 - Gay Day: pedophilia, GMO, marijuana, colonialism, taxes, ethnic civil war &amp; Co. - all approved by voting machines.<br/>
On this day, illuminati totally controlled voting machines programmed to decide that &quot;people&quot; want:<br/>
- to be poisoned by GMO &quot;food&quot;, the key to achieve the goal of almost instantaneous cancer;<br/>
- to be officially a colony alias Puerto Rico &quot;votes&quot; to become the 51st state of the US;<br/>
- to pay even more taxes alias &quot;California approves Prop 30&quot;;<br/>
- to legalize &quot;full&quot; &quot;homosexual marriage&quot;, the main goal being &quot;adoption&quot;, the code used for legalizing pedophilia, putting partly an end to the fake war on pedophiles;<br/>
- to legalize the process of having their children become drug addicted robots alias legalize marijuana for recreational use, putting partly an end to the fake war on drugs.</p>

<p>(6) In 2011, 26 states proposed legislation that would ban certain uses of BPA. Many bills died in committee however, some are moving forward.<br/>
In August 2010, the Maine Board of Environmental Protection voted unanimously to ban the sale of baby bottles and other reusable food and beverage containers made with bisphenol A as of January 2012.<br/>
In February 2011, the newly elected governor of Maine, Paul LePage, gained national attention when he spoke on a local TV news show saying he hoped to repeal the ban because, &quot;There hasn&#39;t been any science that identifies that there is a problem&quot; ...<br/>

<p>&quot;Acceptance of &#39;coming out&#39;&quot; is not a bad observation.<br/>
Although that is not the explicit reason for the increase in homosexuals since 1980, rather it&#39;s the chemical weapon BPA. </p>

<p>Note that the illuminati propagating the acceptance of gays is part of setting the stage for one of the extreme inversions in the BIG BANG script:<br/>
&quot;Gay marriage legalized&quot; will become manhunt for homosexuals.<br/>
Same as how the illuminati &quot;legalize drugs&quot; agenda sets the stage for the coming execution of drug addicts.<br/>
The BIG BANG means the official proclamation of Global Slavery, a world where there&#39;s no place for human cattle on drugs.  </p>

<p>Remember the illuminati modus operandi problem, reaction, solution?
In this case, the coming FINAL SOLUTION will not be limited to Jews.<br/>

<p>Again, that&#39;s not what I&#39;ve written.  Read:<br/>
<em>to legalize &quot;full&quot; &quot;homosexual marriage&quot;, the main goal being &quot;adoption&quot;, the code used for legalizing pedophilia, putting partly an end to the fake war on pedophiles</em>
In other words: since legalizing &quot;homosexual marriage&quot;, illuminati have effectively advanced the &quot;legalize pedophilia&quot; to the point where pedophiles need only to legally &quot;adopt&quot; their victims.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>child trafficking rings getting busted left and right</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Please see the example I gave in my previous reply.  </p>

<p>The totally controlled illuminati media repeats the script line that &quot;child trafficking rings are being jailed&quot;, but in fact are NOT.<br/>
It&#39;s nothing but illuminati theater with actors (real or virtual identities, it does not matter) playing the role of being jailed.<br/>
Yes, the same media that claims that there are people in jail for denying the Jewish Holocaust.<br/>
Nobody was ever jailed for denying the Holocaust, it&#39;s part of a &quot;Black is White&quot; type of psy-op, where the agenda is to suggest that the Holocaust was a lie.  </p>

<p>Note that fake jailing illuminati members or agents is only a small fraction of the type of illuminati theater &quot;fake arrests&quot;.<br/>
Reminder: illuminati media constantly reports fake arrests in operations linked to illuminati fake wars.<br/>
Examples: a few among those reportedly arrested on the War on Drugs; almost all reportedly arrested on the War on Pedophiles or the War on Terror.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>everyone feeling more free to speak out about abuse</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Everyone&quot; = totally controlled mass and &quot;alternative&quot; media fulfilling the illuminati religion&#39;s commandment of hiding the truth in plain sight.<br/>
In this case, announcing the prevalence of pedophilia and child trafficking.</p>

<p>Can anyone explain?</p>

<p>As the first section in the article states with examples, the not hidden agenda has two main subtypes: &quot;Black is White&quot; and Straight.<br/>
&quot;Mixed&quot; is obviously a combination of both subtypes.</p>

<p>If you are genuinely confused then just ask a question about the first thing you don&#39;t get.</p>

<p>The first section of the OP article identifies the hidden subtypes of the illuminati drugs agenda, which I specified for you in my previous reply.<br/>
There is no simpler way to explain it.<br/>
Read OP and comprehend again slowly, EACH word counts.</p>

<p>Yes, OP, I understand how words work, I just don&#39;t understand your minimalistic approach. Can you please elaborate? What are TPTB doing to the weed? What is this weed agenda?</p>

Why, while selling the drugs agenda, the illuminati use the trick of comparing marijuana with alcohol<br/>

<p>False.<br/>
I answered the only logical question you posed by linking to a relevant article explaining &quot;What is this weed agenda?&quot;.<br/>
What don&#39;t you get about the marijuana agenda to mutate teenagers to cattle?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what you are talking about</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You present no evidence to support this &quot;argument&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I almost gave your post some serious thought. </p>

<p>You never seriously read the article to begin with or you would not ask nonsense questions such as &quot;What are TPTB doing to the weed?&quot; and &quot;Is it turning people gay?&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a teenager, so is weed cool for me? How about my grandma, can she toke-up and blaze on into her golden years?</p>

<p>Dude, again, there is no article, there is only your post. Maybe you think you linked an article, but you didn&#39;t. Are you seeing things that aren&#39;t there?</p>

<p>Ok, so weed is not going to turn us gay like the frogs, but instead, I got to be worried about being mutated into a cow?!? What kind of cow? Is it one of the holy cows in India? Honestly, I think I might be fine with that. Anymore details on that one? If I stop smoking, do I then turn into a frog? If a boy kisses me, do I then turn into a prince? I&#39;m confused, I don&#39;t get how this works. </p>

<p>Either you are provoking (&quot;Are you seeing things that aren&#39;t there?, ...&quot;&#39;) or you really believe the OPs I present are not articles by definition, despite using formatting more formal than 99.9% Reddit posts and including basic article structure:<br/>
- Introduction and concluding sections to the article;<br/>
- The article&#39;s body, separated into relevant sections con6aining su evidence;<br/>
- Notes section, the &quot;information&quot; served by the illuminati matrix that is referenced in the article&#39;s body;<br/>
- CONTEXT and BASICS sections, links to other Last Prophet&#39;s articles required to clarify statements you are not yet aware of.<br/>
So, which of those two reasons best explains why you refuse to use the word &quot;article&quot;.</p>

<p>The KEYWORD: ADDICTION.<br/>
Again, the process of having children become drug addicted robots slegalize marijuana for recreational use, putting partly an end to the fake war on drugs.</p>

<p>No, &quot;human cattle&quot; is what illuminati call their &quot;untermensch&quot;.<br/>
