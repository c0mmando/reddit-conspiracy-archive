       WHY gay teens increased 900% since 1980: ILLUMINATI DRUGS agenda to advance HOMO / PEDO agenda
      </h1>
      <p>
       <strong>
        ILLUMINATI DRUGS AGENDA - TYPOLOGY
       </strong>
       <br/>
       ILLUMINATI DRUGS agenda has two main subtypes: hidden or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Not Hidden
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The not hidden agenda has two main subtypes:
       <br/>
       - "Black is White". Example: doping conspiracy agenda, pretending to fight drugs to market drugs.
       <br/>
       - Straight. Examples: psychotropics agenda, ultimate example for children: RITALIN marketed by prime news packaged as "news"; doctors prescribing it to kids; water fluoridation agenda.
       <br/>
       - Mixed. Example: marijuana agenda. Transition from mix to straight subtype is almost completed.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Hidden
       </strong>
       <br/>
       As in all other illuminati fake wars, theater is staged to suggest that the war to "protect consumers" is real.
       <br/>
       The FDA plays the "enforce standards" role by pretending to label products but in fact not declaring the hidden chemical weapons.
       <br/>
       There are two basic hidden types: drugs added while the product is manufactured or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Hidden, drugs added while the product is manufactured
       </strong>
       <br/>
       The trick here is basically labeling the product.
       <br/>
       An example about milk, cream, and 17 other dairy products like yogurt, sweetened condensed milk, sour cream, and others:
       <br/>
       "
       <em>
        the petitioners [two illuminati controlled dairy organizations] state that milk flavored with non-nutritive sweeteners should be labeled as milk without further claims
       </em>
       " (1).
       <br/>
       This is nothing but the technique of upscaling the contents level while keeping the package.
       <br/>
       The technique of downscaling the package while keeping or even upsacaling the contents is also used: new regulations that will no longer require to label certain drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Hidden, drugs NOT added while the product is manufactured - ULTIMATE weapon is BPA
       </strong>
       <br/>
       BPA the ultimate weapon to advance several agendas, including the pedophilia and gay agendas.
       <br/>
       The KEY use of BPA is in containers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are two basic techniques for passing the drug:
       <br/>
       1&amp;#46; Passive, slow pace:
       <br/>
       - Canned foods.
       <br/>
       - PET water bottles now the most important container in some areas. Amount of BPA passed to water depends on storage time, sunlight and ever increasingly BPA quantity added to PET.
      </p>
      <p>
       2&amp;#46; Active, fast to nuclear pace:
       <br/>
       - from receipts (2), with BPA added to ink entering through the skin of consumers ...
       <br/>
       - to the BPA atomic bomb: baby bottles, possible after illuminati brainwashed mothers to "disarm", by not feed breasting their babies.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        BPA, ULTIMATE weapon to advance the androgynous / homosexual / pedophilia agenda
       </strong>
       <br/>
       No other illuminati weapon has contributed as much to the gay teens increase of astronomical 900% since 1980 than the chemical weapon BPA (3).
       <br/>
       It starts from the very beginning, even before baby bottles, the mini-nukes of the gay/pedophilia agenda: BPA during Gestation Changes Sexual Development of Children.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last Prophet's words from 2009:
       <br/>
       <em>
        "People" are being irradiated with energy saving lamps (Illuminati have now prohibited the sale of normal bulb lamps), that change the hormonal (endocrine) system of "humans" and devastating for children (The Homogay Agenda and the Androgynous child ).
       </em>
       <em>
        The same agenda that is advanced also with PET bottles (bisphenol A), as there are now hardly any glass bottles in the "market"
       </em>
       (4).
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        BPA and the Beasts
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Once citizens accepted voting machines thus formally becoming beasts, the illuminati are able to openly tell how they use BPA, accordingly to one of the principle of the illuminati religion: to mock the human cattle.
       <br/>
       With voting machines, at the end of the day, the illuminati will always have the last word, as bizarre as that last word might be (5).
      </p>
      <p>
       Example of all this, from illuminati controlled Wikipedia (6):
       <br/>
       <em>
        In April 2011, the Maine legislature passed a bill to ban the use of BPA in baby bottles, sippy cups, and other reusable food and beverage containers, effective 1 January 2012.
       </em>
       <br/>
       <em>
        Governor LePage refused to sign the bill.
       </em>
       <br/>
       <em>
        LePage added: "The only thing that I've heard is if you take a plastic bottle and put it in the microwave and you heat it up, it gives off a chemical similar to estrogen.
So the worst case is some women may have little beards."
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       (4) Advance the androgynous agenda implies that BPA is also an important weapon to advance the Global Genocide agenda.

      </p>
      <p>
       (5) November 6, 2012 - Gay Day: pedophilia, GMO, marijuana, colonialism, taxes, ethnic civil war &amp; Co. - all approved by voting machines.
       <br/>
       On this day, illuminati totally controlled voting machines programmed to decide that "people" want:
       <br/>
       - to be poisoned by GMO "food", the key to achieve the goal of almost instantaneous cancer;
       <br/>
       - to be officially a colony alias Puerto Rico "votes" to become the 51st state of the US;
       <br/>
       - to pay even more taxes alias "California approves Prop 30";
       <br/>
       - to legalize "full" "homosexual marriage", the main goal being "adoption", the code used for legalizing pedophilia, putting partly an end to the fake war on pedophiles;
       <br/>
       - to legalize the process of having their children become drug addicted robots alias legalize marijuana for recreational use, putting partly an end to the fake war on drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       (6) In 2011, 26 states proposed legislation that would ban certain uses of BPA. Many bills died in committee however, some are moving forward.
       <br/>
       In August 2010, the Maine Board of Environmental Protection voted unanimously to ban the sale of baby bottles and other reusable food and beverage containers made with bisphenol A as of January 2012.
       <br/>
       In February 2011, the newly elected governor of Maine, Paul LePage, gained national attention when he spoke on a local TV news show saying he hoped to repeal the ban because, "There hasn't been any science that identifies that there is a problem" ...

      <p>
       "Acceptance of 'coming out'" is not a bad observation.
       <br/>
       Although that is not the explicit reason for the increase in homosexuals since 1980, rather it's the chemical weapon BPA.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that the illuminati propagating the acceptance of gays is part of setting the stage for one of the extreme inversions in the BIG BANG script:
       <br/>
       "Gay marriage legalized" will become manhunt for homosexuals.
       <br/>
       Same as how the illuminati "legalize drugs" agenda sets the stage for the coming execution of drug addicts.
       <br/>
       The BIG BANG means the official proclamation of Global Slavery, a world where there's no place for human cattle on drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember the illuminati modus operandi problem, reaction, solution?
In this case, the coming FINAL SOLUTION will not be limited to Jews.
       <br/>
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/71bhnh/global_genocide_illuminati_agenda_virtually_every/">
        Virtually EVERY mall, stadium and large school built since 2000 designed as FEMA Concentration Camp in the reduced version, the EXTERMINATION camp
       </a>
       This time it's meant not only for Christians, Muslims, non-whites, gays, and dissidents but also for drug addicts.

       The only "bleak" thing are the human cattle who ACCEPTED the Mark of the Beast. Or in other words: who ACCEPTED to be slaughtered.

       Again, that's not what I've written.  Read:
       <br/>
       <em>
        to legalize "full" "homosexual marriage", the main goal being "adoption", the code used for legalizing pedophilia, putting partly an end to the fake war on pedophiles
       </em>
       In other words: since legalizing "homosexual marriage", illuminati have effectively advanced the "legalize pedophilia" to the point where pedophiles need only to legally "adopt" their victims.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        child trafficking rings getting busted left and right
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Please see the example I gave in my previous reply.
      </p>
      <p>
       The totally controlled illuminati media repeats the script line that "child trafficking rings are being jailed", but in fact are NOT.
       <br/>
       It's nothing but illuminati theater with actors (real or virtual identities, it does not matter) playing the role of being jailed.
       <br/>
       Yes, the same media that claims that there are people in jail for denying the Jewish Holocaust.
       <br/>
       Nobody was ever jailed for denying the Holocaust, it's part of a "Black is White" type of psy-op, where the agenda is to suggest that the Holocaust was a lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note that fake jailing illuminati members or agents is only a small fraction of the type of illuminati theater "fake arrests".
       <br/>
       Reminder: illuminati media constantly reports fake arrests in operations linked to illuminati fake wars.
       <br/>
       Examples: a few among those reportedly arrested on the War on Drugs; almost all reportedly arrested on the War on Pedophiles or the War on Terror.

      <blockquote>
       <p>

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "Everyone" = totally controlled mass and "alternative" media fulfilling the illuminati religion's commandment of hiding the truth in plain sight.
       <br/>
       In this case, announcing the prevalence of pedophilia and child trafficking.

       "Mixed" is obviously a combination of both subtypes.

       The first section of the OP article identifies the hidden subtypes of the illuminati drugs agenda, which I specified for you in my previous reply.

       Ok, so weed is not going to turn us gay like the frogs, but instead, I got to be worried about being mutated into a cow?!? What kind of cow? Is it one of the holy cows in India? Honestly, I think I might be fine with that. Anymore details on that one? If I stop smoking, do I then turn into a frog? If a boy kisses me, do I then turn into a prince? I'm confused, I don't get how this works.

       Either you are provoking ("Are you seeing things that aren't there?, ..."') or you really believe the OPs I present are not articles by definition, despite using formatting more formal than 99.9% Reddit posts and including basic article structure:
       <br/>
       - Introduction and concluding sections to the article;
       <br/>
       - The article's body, separated into relevant sections con6aining su evidence;
       <br/>
       - Notes section, the "information" served by the illuminati matrix that is referenced in the article's body;
       <br/>
       - CONTEXT and BASICS sections, links to other Last Prophet's articles required to clarify statements you are not yet aware of.
       <br/>
       So, which of those two reasons best explains why you refuse to use the word "article".

       Again, the process of having children become drug addicted robots slegalize marijuana for recreational use, putting partly an end to the fake war on drugs.

       No, "human cattle" is what illuminati call their "untermensch".

       BTW, weed isn't addicting. People can start and stop without any mental/physical consequences.

       Don't be discouraged. I understand the discussion you're encouraging here and the ideas being presented. Unfortunately this sub has gone from a place where theories can be discussed to a place where no evidence means no discussion. Keep at it. This is all interesting stuff. Unfortunately joe public reacts exactly how they have been programmed to. They see words like "homo, pedophilia, etc" and they blow a gasket and derail the convo. How far you accuse the gays of this or that!! It's not about that, but general public doesn't see it.
