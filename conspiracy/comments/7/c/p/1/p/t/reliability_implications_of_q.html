     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       As I expect is the case with most of you, my perception of Q has progressed as something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)Fun fictional read
      </p>
      <p>
       2)Possibly true
      </p>
      <p>
       3)The real deal
      </p>
      <p>
       4)Complete LARP
      </p>
      <p>
       5)Getting annoyed
      </p>
      <p>
       6)Wait, maybe it is true
      </p>
      <p>
       7)The world is about to be saved
      </p>
      <p>
       8)I have no idea anymore
      </p>
      <p>
       So I thought I'd give a brief overview of where Q has seemed reliable and times they seemed unreliable:
      </p>
      <p>
       Total Larp:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)People who were supposed to be arrested/"taken down" appear in public
      </p>
      <p>
       2)A few statements far too extreme (99% in hospital) + ALL conspiracies come together as one
      </p>
      <p>
       3)"+++" was not posted 7 minutes in advance--it was 53 minutes after
      </p>
      <p>
       4)Why use 4chan? How could this even help?
      </p>
      <p>
       The real deal:
      </p>
      <p>
       1)842 sealed indictments including 80+ under Mueller
      </p>
      <p>
       2)Saudi Arrests
      </p>
      <p>
       3)Snow White = 7 CIA computer names
      </p>
      <p>
       4)Flight coordinates (reach?)
      </p>
      <p>
       5)Saudi story on newspaper in front of Trump (reach?)
      </p>
      <p>
       6)Disinformation might be necessary, canceling out concerns about Q
      </p>
      <p>
       7)Hillary/McCain "walking boots", eyebrow not shaved (reach?)
      </p>
      <p>
       8)Several conspiracies have been obvious of late to anyone honest (Uranium one, Spygate, IRS targeting, fast and furious, Benghazi, ISIS creation, Vegas, MSM censoring, DNC fixed, etc)
      </p>
      <p>
       This is either one of the greatest, if not the greatest LARP of all-time, or a disinformation campaign to make us look like idiots, or it is the real deal. If the third, here are some of the many implications that would combined be a bigger than the worldwide shock of WW2, 9/11, Titanic, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       1)Saudi princes did Vegas and 9/11
      </p>
      <p>
       2)ISIS, Boko Haram, Cartles funded by deep state
      </p>
      <p>
       3)CIA is the mafia + blackmails politicians
      </p>
      <p>
       4)Elitist child trafficking rampant + adrenochrome
      </p>
      <p>
       5)Titanic done by deep state to install central banking
      </p>
      <p>
       6)North Korea is Disney's puppet
      </p>
      <p>
       7)Hitler was a puppet for deep state
      </p>
      <p>
       8)The courts are corrupted by the deep state
      </p>
      <p>
       9)Nikola Tesla's free energy was halted by deep state
      </p>
      <p>
       10)MSM controlled by CIA
      </p>
      <p>
       11)Pope and/or the Queen involved in money laundering for Deep State
      </p>
      <p>
       12)Electrical grid will be taken out to install martial law so we can try scumbags in military court
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of this is clear to most of us here, but just think for a second about if it was all revealed to the American public--30% of them would reject it and claim Trump was a nutjob who was targeting his enemies, the rest would be in total panic.
      </p>
      <p>
       What all else am I missing here? Please don't be a disrespectful internet tough guy--I'm trying to have a reasonable conversation and whether you are certain Q is a total larp or the real deal, please weigh each listed point.

       Good write up, i'm pretty similar.  I'm so torn between the "too good to be true" thing and the fact the posts Q makes indicates a vast knowledge of a ton of conspiracies, the inner workings of government and so many other things.  This is either TCBS or the mother of all larps (MOAL)

       The way the LARP is written makes it easy for the reader to project their views and biases onto the material.  It's written by someone intimate with the conspiracy and political environments. It's success lies in the fact that it seemingly addresses a lot of conspiracies while not making any concrete statements or very few. It's a LARP and a very good one.

       Similar to how fortune tellers will learn about their client and then make vague assertions that the reciever will fill in their own answeres with. As a former missionary, i too was instructed to indoctrinate not by giving answeres but providing leading questions. Its quite effective really.

       I feel like I am in the same boat as you. Part of me believes it just because the world has gone SO insane since 2016, it feels like everything is crumbling, lies are becoming more and more obvious. People who would never think of conspiracy theories or quesiton the media are suddenly completely baffled and open to anything being true. But then perhaps this Q person is playing on that. I just hope it is true that these evil fuckers are being taken down. The 800+ indictments do indicate something is coming. I'm a bit concerned that the MSM will play it off as Trump taking down his political enemies or something but I'm guessing that's why they got Mueller to do it, so they couldn't argue that.

       Great idea to kind of summarize where we can interpret Q as having been "right" and wrong.

       I think Trump's twitter takedown should definitely be in here. Although, we need to look at the timestamps and determine whether or not Q's post came first.

       Conspiracy theorists ( follow the white rabbit- follow little known fact to find the huge hidden secret being hidden by ( usually ) the goverment. It is supposedly used in numerous pc/ consol games, but I was unable to find examples. 
The anti- semitic movement use it to explain the Jewish Master plan to rule the world (bizarre!) Supposedly jews allow the non jews to see the hole, but not follow it down, where their connections to the illuminati and freemasons are used in the plan for world domination.

       Here is my post from another thread. This Q stuff has become silly and I guess it is up to those of us that that have been into conspiracies for a long time to speak up.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Q anon is a LARPer that borrowed his "Q" from a story Michael Ruppert fabricated about his father. The person making the 4chan posts is clearly familiar with Michael's story (as well as many other popular conspiracies) and knows most conspiracy theory fans have forgotten him or aren't even familiar with his work. It reeks of being a psyop that people are falling for hook, line, and sinker. The real conspiracy is why people aren't mentioning the obvious connection to Ruppert's story more.

       Ruppert claimed to have high level security clearance from childhood because his father had it. He told people it was given to him and members of his family in case his father brought work home and left out papers containing classified or secret information. Ruppert called this special clearance that was given to him Q.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since you might new to conspiracies Michael Ruppert is famous in conspiracy communities for calling out government agencies dealing drugs in the Los Angeles area during the 80s and 90s. His remarks were made live on C-SPAN which caused a stir.

       The Q level clearance was bullshit. Nothing like that exists. Like I said I think Michael said that stuff to make himself seem more important. However, US government agencies procuring, distributing and selling drugs during 80s and 90s is very real and it is still going on today. Instead of the bad drug being crack cocaine it is heroine (the opium comes in from Afghanistan to Vermont just the same way cocaine came from Columbia to states like Florida and Arkansas).
      </p>
      <p>
       Michael Ruppert eventually killed himself due to depression. He was very worried about peak oil and the environment at the end.

       Interesting. I think Q is one of the more interesting things that's happened in the conspiracy world recently and I really enjoy the narratives he's pushing us to open. But I do think it might be psyop or just someone with a lot of free time who is a great social engineer and wants to take this as an opportunity to push us towards the narrative he believes.

       By causing this uncertainty whether they're a larper or not, those that want to dismiss them will, and they will likely be allowed to operate because they will sound just like a kook.

       They probably confused Q clearance and Ruppert's Q clearance. The former may exist, but the latter did not.

       If that's the first you've heard of it, the fact that the latter was false may cause you to assume the former is false as well.

       Additionally, there is an admitted disinfo campaign in the posts, there is no question when Q explicitly states this. The conundrum lies in attempting to determine exactly WHAT is meant as disinfo and WHO the PsyOp intended to benefit, if anyone at all.

       Now, I may be wrong, but doesn't he say in one post that the deep state tried to "attack the command in chief and the POTUS was notified" or something like that? Because I've found everything up until this point totally enthralling, but I saw that on a recap post awhile back and I haven't been able to get it out of my mind, because that's such a fundamental misunderstanding of government.

       It was worse than that, the post said "Command and Chief". So the poster not only didn't realize that "Commander in Chief" is a person, who happens to also be POTUS, they had likely not seen that phrase in writing before, only heard it spoken.

       of the specific items occurred (Podesta to be publicly arrested on 11/3, followed by riots and martial law, big announcement by Trump before leaving the US, important that there are carrier groups in Asia, etc etc), it was basically a confirmed LARP. Not surprisingly they stopped making specific predictions not long after that, only leading questions.

       I may have been projecting too much on to it, but I got the impression that it meant the non-existent (No Such) agency, which handles all sigint, intercepted communication by a certain individual agency to do
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       that was sharp enough to cause Trump to start actively relying on a different individual agency and caused a schism between loyalist and resistance camps in the intelligence community.
      </p>
      <p>
       Frankly, I was extremely hopeful that something like this could happen, and the suggestions that the different individual and the non-existent camps had actually recruited and been shadow grass roots for Trump (the pepe mockery and manipulation of the knee-jerk media was
       <em>
        very
       </em>
       effective in discrediting the media for common people) actually fit with how things played out to me in the face of conventional wisdom and prior expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if this isn't the first time 4chan was used to discredit the media and work against the mockingbird-strung media? What if Trump was the first gambit and it succeeded beyond anyone's imagination?

       Yeah, you definitely bring up good points, and it's definitely plausible. It's hard to say. In reference to your greater detail part, I found it disheartening that Q, who is considered to be a government insider essentially, would not even be able to properly say the President's title, which is Commander in chief. Now, I can understand that due to phone's autocorrecting, etc., that it could've been a simple typo. But the part that really bugged me was that the Q post was said in a way that it separated the "Command and Chief" from the POTUS (I believe the post said that the 'Command and Chief' was attacked by unknown intelligence agency, and that the POTUS was notified about it.) It's understandable to type out Commander in chief wrong, but if you're considering the POTUS and Commander in chief to be two different people, that's just totally wrong.

       I'd read that, too, and I thought it was just using a different title so as to not be repetitive.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're correct, it would definitely be a telling error, but I was also wondering wondering if they were using Commander and Chief to talk about two separate people, like, say, the head of a different individual agency and the chief/pres.

       You have public access to government websites just like everyone else. We know that Mueller is over Grand Jurys in D.C. and Eastern Virginia (includes Northern Virginia): We also know that the sealed indictment totals in their areas are typically between 0 and 4 with 6 or more being extreme. 80+ has to make you think Mueller immediately, no? Watergate "only" had 40.

       Q is the evolution of  CTR’s plan.  Distraction, disinfo, wild goose chases, narrative domination, and conspiracy peddling (All the classics) and adding in a few true things so that by the end the taint of generic conspiracy and “the alt-right” taints the entire thing and people participating that are actually finding things are followed to ensure all relevant evidence is located and removed.

       I will say Vegas alone is the most telling.  If I read posts on here or watch YT videos I would get a bunch of info and disinfo or far fetching info.  Q as well as Mega has painted the best picture of what likely happened.  That alone tells me this person has solid intel.  Also the funding of the dark cabal.  Always wondered but never knew where it came from exactly - thanks to Q I get it.

       So I haven't seen this 800 pound gorilla discussed much: Why doesn't the Trump administration immediately deny the Q story and say they have no more clue than we do about it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more, why doesn't whats left of the Establishment and MSM force them to deny?
      </p>
      <p>
       Think please - wouldn't something like that have happened by now in a normal world?

       No it would not happen, if Q is a LARP then Trump doesn't know about it at all.

       The MSM probably doesn't believe any of it in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       We may be debating whether or not Q's real, but as far as the MSM is concerned, it's all just kooky conspiracy horseshit and not worth looking into or paying attention to.
      </p>
      <p>
       By not even discussing it, Trump admin(if they are behind it) keeps it below MSM radar.

       The Q level clearance was bullshit. Nothing like that exists. Like I said I think Michael said that stuff to make himself seem more important. However, US government agencies procuring, distributing and selling drugs during 80s and 90s is very real and it is still going on today. Instead of the bad drug being crack cocaine it is heroine (the opium comes in from Afghanistan to Vermont just the same way cocaine came from Columbia to states like Florida and Arkansas).

       Michael Ruppert eventually killed himself due to depression. He was very worried about peak oil and the environment at the end.
