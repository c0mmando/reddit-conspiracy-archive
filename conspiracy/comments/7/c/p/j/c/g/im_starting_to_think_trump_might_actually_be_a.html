    <div class="md"><p>Well it wasn&#39;t so much a change of mind as much of it was...let me see if I can narrate. </p>

<p>Trump is running for president? Yeah right!</p>

<p>No he&#39;s really running...</p>

<p>Another pos in DC.</p>

<p>Drain the swamp...that&#39;ll be the day</p>

<p>He&#39;s never gonna get elected...</p>

<p>He&#39;s POTUS? Those dems tears on election night were a tiny teeny bit sweet...</p>

<p>But still, theatre...</p>

<p>Oh wait he&#39;s being linked with Putin....a guy I always thought was against the nwo...</p>

<p>He&#39;s surrounding himself with military....I&#39;m a vet soooooo....</p>

<p><em>read his comments</em> this guy really doesn&#39;t give a flying fuck who he&#39;s offending.</p>

<p>Wow this guy is either honest and stupid or crazy deceptive like a fox...I prefer honest and stupid..</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>.....</p>

<p>Fast-forward....he&#39;s really pissing off the msm and yeah it may be a reverse chess move to make me think he&#39;s a good guy but still I can hope...</p>

<p>These anon drops are really encouraging... and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s true, that while there are evil satanic pos&#39;s in DC there&#39;s gotta be some true Americans left as well....and they&#39;re seemingly backing trump.  </p>

<p>Wow this guy is really moving under his own rudder</p>

<p>...fast forward....again</p>

<p>Rothschild don&#39;t like him...I like him! </p>

<p>It&#39;s much deeper and more detailed than that hope I gave some insight into my thoughts....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I went through the same thing.  I did not vote for him, in fact I warned against voting for him because of some misunderstandings I had on his China relations, but I did help with getting the emails from the DNC leak and Podesta leak. I already knew Hillary was beyond bad news. </p>

<p>AS time goes on I am coming to realize Trump is not who I thought, but is actually playing one persona to the public and living his real persona in the background and actually doing exactly what he said he was going to. I have mostly done a 180 on him. </p>

<p>People should just look back to the example of classic Mafia which had a certain code of honour setting limits, a group of &quot;gentlemen&quot; following quid pro quo.</p>

<p>Then I watched some of his videos from the 80&#39;s &amp; 90&#39;s and realized he was saying the same things back then as now,  it made me look more.  Watched some of his campaign events calling out the swamp and the elite class before him for selling us out. . Watched him bury the TPP...  Watched him reach out to foreign leaders to repair damage done from Bush/Obama era...  But this video really made me pay attention way back,  I almost couldn&#39;t believe the topics he raised. </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/b9n7g8rTiaY">https://youtu.be/b9n7g8rTiaY</a></p>

<p>He basically walks into the lions den and rips Hillary a new one...  The looks on people&#39;s faces made me realize he was cutting close to the bone and did not give a Fuc.  He may surprise me and do a 180... But the fact the Dems/Rhinos and MSM are still trying to deligitimize his presidency makes me think he&#39;s on our side. </p>

<p>The President is not a good guy! I can&#39;t believe there&#39;s people on r/conspiracy actually espousing beliefs that the President is a &quot;good guy&quot; who&#39;s doing this for them. He&#39;s not! They never are! </p>

<p>None of them care about you, none of them want to make your life better or easier. They want money and power. When Trump gets rid of the CIA and the NSA, or gets rid of domestic spying, or gets rid of civil asset forfeiture, or scales back the militarization of the police, or gets America out of useless conflicts in the Middle East.... then maybe I&#39;ll start to believe he&#39;s a good guy.
