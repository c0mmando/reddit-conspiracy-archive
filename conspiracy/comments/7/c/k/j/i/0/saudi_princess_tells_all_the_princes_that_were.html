        Orgies with underage girls, heavy drug and alcohol abuse

      <p>
       She mentioned one of the most repulsive things: buying and renting the children, especially the orphans, from countries like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Djibouti, Somalia, Nigeria, Romania and Bulgaria.
According to Aidan, the ex-wife of the Saudi Prince Al Waleed bin Talal, who was recently arrested in scope of the anti-corruption purges in the country, those who accuse others of corruption and money laundering, are in fact highly corrupted themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...The children become the property of those who buy them and are not allowed to leave without permission.
Even the Asian maids who come to work often find themselves in a kind of slave-like position. Young girls are divided into smaller groups and exploited for immoral acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trafficking of white women and exploiting them for sexual practices is also relatively common.

       This, I remember working in a hotel and they had some sort of trade/climate summit, billionaire CEOS, foreign dignitaries and politicians of both political party were the guests.  I think the Clintons and Gores were there as well.  The food there, they had veal and lobster in huge platters.  When they were done they ordered the food to be thrown out, all of that lobster and veal could have gone into my stomach a starving college student.  Or to a food back ffs.

       It's gross that that much premium food is thrown away, but really no system exists to get it safely to people who could use it.

       Definitely. If I was working at a restaurant, saw the food prepared and knew how fresh it was, I'd grab myself a bunch of untouched leftovers and bring them home for everyone to enjoy.

       You aren't allowed to eat it, for the sake that it might make you sick.  I went to a culinary school.  We weren't allowed to take the food home that we made ourselves.  It had to e eaten there, or thrown out.

       So, I've gone to their website and read through all their initiatives, I can't find any mention of a program like that. I read through their newsletter that seems to come out every few years. It just talks about what the website talks about, a foodbank, donation drives, and food education.

       Speaking of elitists, it's been brought to my awareness that the old royal bloodlines may be quite alive and well - and fully functioning - just hidden from view. It would make sense that these elitists are royalty of some sort since royalty has traditionally seen themselves as superior to and apart from the common man.

       So dumb though, why would you want a bunch of inbreds running around. It flies in the face of science and common sense unless it's a full blown breeding program like racehorses, and these arseholes moght be rich and lucky, but they aren't our best and brightest, it's not like theyre breeding with nobel prize winners and athletes. I don't buy it.

       None of that matters.  Their power, real or not, stems from their bloodlines.  While any additions to the bloodline are/would be elite humans, any genes they bring in are a bonus. Too many outside genes, and the bloodline isn't pure enough to justify their power.

       Plus, a top athlete is merely the strongest/fastest/toughest beast of burden.  Why bother mating with that?  From the POV of the elites, of course.

       I wonder if there's some secret eugenics program where the elites breed their best "beasts" to create strategists, scientists, even private soldiers. They're probably already trafficking kids and women...so why not?

       MK Ultra handles the finishing of those products, er... beasts, but yea I do think so.  If anything, the studies showing trauma is encoded in DNA and passed down the generations may be a clue to how they operate.
      </p>
      <p>
       While not exactly test-tube breeding of elite soldiers, it's very similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where the secret eugenics breeding thing comes in is the desire to have genetically compatible donors.  So they test-tube baby, tweak the genes, and see if they can create the genes they want to (harvest, propogate, whatevs).  The Columbo eye-thing comes to mind (spelling?).
      </p>
      <p>
       I think they use these breeding programs to test for genes that stop cell death.  Then traffic parent-less child.

       Part of the pgate stuff included a lot of genetic and biotech and related businesses.  I think part of the human trafficking includes live human research subjects.  The eye-thing Madeline McCann had was linked to an RNA sequence that halts cell death, for example.  I'd guess they're looking into all sorts of other stuff.

       Makes sense. And why wouldn't they do such things? I used to work in a research hospital, and I remember that the primate research wing was always kept under wraps...most people never went in there, and they were careful that it didn't attract too much attention.

       I'd imagine human experimentation would be even more secretive. And if you're willing to rape a kid, I'm pretty sure experimentation on them wouldn't be out of the question.

       I love how it's not based on anything but the money they were born into. Put me in a room with any of them, and we'll see who the superior being is. It's dog eat dog and they're a bunch of pathetic, inbred puppies. Without the money to pay mindless goons to do their dirty work, they would wither and die.

       It's funny you bring this up, they've done all kinds of studies on the more wealth people have, the less empathy they have towards others. You see it in games like monopoly as well (not the same things, but you get the I love how it's not based on anything but the money they were born point).

       Yes. As soon as they reach sexual maturity (12-15 years old) is when they would be impregnated. The whole "save the children" thing is relatively new, because we're able to study the mind and understand the effects this has on children.
      </p>

       As it stands, the legal age of consent is still around 13-15 years old in most of the world with only Africa, South Australia, and some states in the western US putting it higher.

       The mortality rate was pretty fucking high back then, so I guess it would make sense to have kids as early as possible. Nowadays it's horrifying to think, especially since so many people are waiting later to have children. We don't have to worry about half the population dying before 30. And with the help of science, people who have a hard time having kids can ge treatments and adopt.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why I'm glad I'm alive when I am. Every time I hear some little shit say "I was born in the wrong era" and pine over the Colonial or Victorian eras I really just want to punch them. Yeah, the fashion was pretty, but you would have been married off at 14, given birth to 12 kids, be lucky if you survived all those kids and if half of those kids survived their first year alive.

       Extremely. While searching an old cemetery for unusual headstones, I found a super heartbreaking one from the early to mid 1800s. The girl was only 13. The headstone read "beloved wife and mother." Meaning she probably had at least one other kid and died in childbirth. And now I can't help but wonder how many other headstones I saw that had similar ages that I just never noticed.

       At least at 12-15 the person can be sexually mature and nature pretty much says they're ready for sex. A lot of these pedo stories include infants and children well before the age where sexual development happens.

       Not from what I've seen.  Link on 4chan last night led to dozens of yutube vids about pedos being caught by groups of guys who film and name the pedos.  And in not one instance, the pedos had groomed what they believed were child victims online. In actuality, the child victims were actually members of vigilante groups who would arrange (as the child) to meet with the perp. The vigilantes turned up, filmed them, handed them to police.  None of the victims were known beforehand to the perps.  I now believe that for years, a myth has been doing the rounds about pedos being mainly family members or friends, as cover for widespread pedo activity consisting of stranger pedos targeting random victims. The extent of the problem is massive.  I believe pedos should be put to death. No cure.  One of the pedos in a vid was 92 years of age, turned up in a taxi thinking he was going to meet a twelve year old

       It had to have started out like that imo. We have changed from the animal-like behavior of our ancestors into what society is now, the same thing but now we all wear sheeps clothing. Let me put it this way, the very first humans probably had to figure out what sex was and thus many of our fetishes(some criminal) today could be a result of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a side note, I think both guys and girls joke about being "too loose" as an insult. But then the implications of that is "tighter the better". I would assume that our early ancestors being pleasure seekers would also seek out the same thing, even if it meant having their way with their own.

       Tldr;; Caveman find hole. Caveman stick penis in hole. Now Caveman wants to try every hole. Caveman baby born at the wrong time and now thinks the behavior is normal.

       were children used back in the cave days?  probably not.  Children get used over there with all those sick fuck muslims... Bacha boys.  They've made it so men can't even interact with women that aren't their wives or immediate family.  That whole region over there needs to be wiped off the face of the Earth.  They're disgusting if you've ever seen the doc on bach boys.

       I mean, high end escorts have their shit pretty much on lock. The risk / reward is worth it by any metric, so long as the job itself doesn't destroy you. Street walking is another story. International sex work sounds risky as hell but if you're accommodated, getting paid well, and you're allowed to leave at your own volition - well, that sounds like a pretty good job, as far as sex work goes.

       As far as sex work goes, yes.

       If, I dunno, 2% of saudi sex slaves or western "models" have freedom of movement, I'll be shocked.

       Yeah but that probably has more to do with your biases than any real basis in reality. For every horror story about women being abused in SA, there are probably a hundred girls that cycle through more or less without incident.

       If they cycle through more or less without incident, they're an exalted breed of slave/worker to the Saudis.  Those who are domestic (non sex) slaves and workers, the construction guys from SE Asia, etc, and other imported workers have some harrowing tales.  Like dozens of men sleeping in a room, no pay, women trapped.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also stories floating around form western sex workers/models/slaves about their time(s) in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those def form a bias.  If the ratio is 1:100s, I'll be shocked.  Not saying you're right or wrong, just my hunch is much less optimistic.

       One of my siblings friends ex girlfriend is a model. Western girl, very pretty. Had lots of rich male friends in Dubai who she would go and visit. They actually bought her a 100k sports car to drive around at home. She's now mid 30s and the cheques have stopped coming. Lots of young girls leverage their youth through prostitution and 'companionship' and but those avenues fade with age and they are usually left with nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will say this model girl is fucking crazy. Multiple restraining orders had to be take out against her and she was violent

       This reminds me of John Perkins book, Confessions of an Economic Hitman, where he is trying to get the Saudi Royal Princes to sign on for some deal and he ends up basically selling a prostitute to the guy who will fly over and live in his mansion for a predetermined amount of time.

       I don't see a single link in this thread to the Le Monde interview of Amira Bint Aidan Bin Nayef.
      </p>
      <p>
       dhakatribune.com says the source is Fort Russ:
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Fort Russ doesn't link to any source. If you go to the website of Le Monde and search for the name of the princess, you won't find a single article.
      </p>
      <p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Also her name is spelled differently and the article on Fort Russ (a Russian propaganda outlet) is riddled with typos.

       Such sad excuses for men. That entire region has literally the worst form of human male ever. Muslim men are such unbelievable pussies that, because they are so scared of female sexually, they dress their women up in trash bags. They are so scared of not measuring up that they only want virgins, and kill any women who think otherwise. That entire region has absolutely nothing to offer humanity with the exception of the oil they sit on. After it is gone, watch how their horseshit countries return to the dark ages from whence they came. I'm sorry I sound so angry, it's just that I had to live there for a few months recently and I now understand what they are truly like. The more I interact with these pieces of shit the more respect I have for legitimate regions of the world.

       No that's a moral panic. Where are the victims? Who are they? Someone must have escaped. If it's "common" I want to see proof. A report from Amnesty, or a news story about a trafficked white woman.

       North America and Europe have all sorts of white women and children being pimped out, that is confirmed. Doesn't fit the narrative I guess. When it's just African's or South Asians or some other none white people all of a sudden it's not as important anymore, we need to suggest white girls are slaves to if we want outrage.

       Yeah but that probably has more to do with your biases than any real basis in reality. For every horror story about women being abused in SA, there are probably a hundred girls that cycle through more or less without incident.

       Part of the pgate stuff included a lot of genetic and biotech and related businesses.  I think part of the human trafficking includes live human research subjects.  The eye-thing Madeline McCann had was linked to an RNA sequence that halts cell death, for example.  I'd guess they're looking into all sorts of other stuff.
