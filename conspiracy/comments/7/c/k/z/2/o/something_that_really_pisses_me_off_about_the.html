        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There is a huge debate in the comments about the thermite vs fire vs whatever, but it&#39;s all noise. Here&#39;s why:</p>

<p>Three buildings sustained &quot;random&quot; damage on 9/11. I don&#39;t see how anyone can dispute that. With the plane impacts and fires, not all parts of the buildings were impacted equally, not even all parts of a single floor were impacted equally.</p>

<p>And yet, due to this &quot;random&quot; damage, <strong>all three buildings neatly collapsed into their own footprints.</strong></p>

<p>That is simply impossible. You could go into a laboratory and inflict random damage on a building model over, and over, and over, and <em>never</em> get it to collapse into it&#39;s own footprint. Maybe one in a million, if you were lucky.</p>

<p>But it happened 3 times on 9/11.</p>

<p>But, wait a second, sure there was dust, but there were also beams and papers and all sorts of debris.  Even the core columns for WTC 1 stayed up a few seconds, after the exterior collapsed. </p>

<p>What radiogenic cancers?  I am aware that there the dust was filled with asbestos and other toxic chemicals, but I would like a source on the claim that the cancers were radiogenic. </p>

<p>You can watch the clean up of WTC debris where lots of stuff is identified, and it is not microscopic dust. </p>

<p>Video 1 of 52 by Kurt Sonnenfield, go through all of them. </p>

<p>What craters are you talking about? Underneath the WTC complex there were 6 stories.  You can watch them go underneath the rubble in the videos by Sonnenfield. </p>

<p>Concerning the claim that molten metal was present 3 months after, where is the source for this claim? </p>

<blockquote>

<p>But the WTC 1 and 2 are clearly demolished from the top down.  </p>

<p><a href="https://vgy.me/NiTnPC.jpg">https://vgy.me/NiTnPC.jpg</a></p>

<p>Popular theories about what destroyed the World Trade Center towers on September 11, 2001 are:</p>

<p>1 Fires from jet fuel and office materials weakened steel in the upper floors and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>2 Conventional controlled demolition blew out supports at the base and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>3 Thermite cut steel columns on virtually every floor and the buildings collapsed</p>

<p>4 Conventional explosives blew the buildings up</p>

<p>5 Mini-nukes blew the buildings up</p>

<p>Theories 1, 2 and 3 rely on gravity to bring the buildings down while the last two blow them up. Popular theories, yes, and dead wrong.
Five facts scientifically documented in Ph.D. engineer Judy Wood’s comprehensive textbook (Where Did The Towers Go?) prove the popular theories false beyond any doubt whatsoever. Yes, I know it’s amazing. Who’d a thunk it’d be this easy?</p>

<p>THE FACTS:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>DEBRIS: What debris? There was so little debris from each 110-story building that there was no “pile” or “stack.” Rubble totaled less than a story. It was a football field as a survivor who emerged from Stairwell B, North Tower, exclaimed. No computers, toilets, and only one small piece from one Steelcase file cabinet were found. Some steel and mostly dust remained. Lack of debris on the ground from quarter-mile-high twin towers whispers “no collapse.” See Chapter 9.</p></li>
<li><p>BATHTUB: A bathtub or slurry wall surrounded 70 feet of WTC subbasements to prevent the Hudson River from flooding the WTC and downtown. If each 500,000-ton tower had slammed into the bathtub in 10 seconds or less, the protective wall would collapse. Did not happen. Upshot? Collapses did not happen. See Chapter 5.</p></li>
<li><p>SEISMIC IMPACT: “Had the towers collapsed, foundation bedrock would have experienced tremendous force hammering on it throughout the ‘collapse,’” writes Dr. Wood. Seismic instruments registered disturbances far too short in duration and far too small to record tower collapses. This was true of both the twin towers and 47-story WTC7. Again, no evidence of collapses. See Chapter 6.</p></li>
<li><p>SOUND: There were no loud explosions, as established by videos, witnesses, and the official report of NIST. Nor were there loud screeches and screams from massive metal falling, colliding, scraping and collapsing on metal. See Chapter 6.</p></li>
<li><p>DUST: Photos, videos and witness testimony show the towers turned to powder in mid-air. Tim McGinn, NYPD, said, “I was standing there for a couple of seconds thinking where the f**k is the tower? I simply couldn’t comprehend it.” The dust rollout was so enormous and thick it blocked out sunlight and left an inch or more of dust covering downtown. Much of it wafted into the upper atmosphere. The volume was incredible. Particles from dust samples were smaller than red blood cells and about the size of DNA. As for toxicity, researchers said the dust “recorded the highest levels we have ever seen in over 7,000 measurements we have made of very fine air pollution throughout the world, including Kuwait and China.” See Chapters 8, 9, 14-16.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>My take: This was a very predictable aspect of the demolition -- I mean, if you thought of it now, they could think of it beforehand. It&#39;d be easy to fake the data. Indeed, there were many reports of ground shaking, which indicates a 5.5-6.5 event. If the data doesn&#39;t show this, we know it&#39;s faked. (Or the people were lying for some reason -- have to consider that as a possibility.)</p>

<p>3 separate <strong>subterranean</strong> thermonuclear </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t know about thermonuclear... but the subterranean part must be wrong. Why?</p>

<p>Explode something below ground level and you destroy the support below ground level. Go look at any demolition and watch to see where the charges go off. </p>

<p>It&#39;s usually just above ground level. When the building begins to collapse, the collapse initiates at the level where the charges were placed.</p>

<p>Now go look at what happened on 9/11. Both towers began to collapse at or near the level where the planes hit. If &quot;thermonuclear charges&quot; had been placed in the basement, the towers would not have started collapsing seventy or eighty floors up.</p>

<p>Building 7 went down in classic demolition style, where the collapse appeared to originate at ground level. I&#39;ll buy op&#39;s theory for building 7, but not for WTC 1 and 2. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The key is the seismic signatures recorded on 9/11.</p>

<p>They are <em>significantly</em> lacking, as in completely incompatible with the utter destruction of 3 massive buildings. </p>

<p>The sheer force of those buildings hitting the ground should have resulted in some serious seismic effects, especially if explosives/nukes were used.</p>

<p>The records do not support this.</p>

<p>The evidence implies that much of the material in the towers simply &quot;went away.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an interesting theory and makes a lot of sense. My only question would be: wouldn&#39;t the building collapse from the bottom up in that case? In other words the entire building would drop as one block into the cavity and then start pancaking from the bottom up. Videos of the collapse seem to show a pancaking from the top down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can&#39;t it be both? It&#39;s hard to imagine a subterranean explosion causing a skyscraper to turn to dust from the top down. Also, surviving girders ended in a 45 degree angle as if cut by a thermite charge. To support the thermonuclear bomb theory, pools of molten metal were found under the wreckage. So I believe it&#39;s reasonable to assume that thermite AND bombs were used.</p>

<p>The steel below the impact levels was fine. No one claims otherwise.</p>

<p>My argument is the official story is bs because it is just physically impossible. You have no argument and you have not denied my arguments, you have not proven anything wrong, you&#39;re not even addressing anything at all.

<p>Just because the South tower led by the east side by &quot;five floors&quot; doesn&#39;t discredit anything; you&#39;re just saying that the east side was damaged in such a way that it caused it to collapse before the opposite side. So what is your explanation?  Why would one side go first?</p>

<p>If the floors held the loads &quot;mostly fine&quot; then the towers wouldn&#39;t have collapsed because THEY CAN HOLD UP THE BUILDING&#39;S WEIGHT ABOVE THE DAMAGED FLOORS. You are not refuting anything. </p>

<p>If the steel below the impact was fine, then the portion of the buildings below the impact sites would have held up the top of the building. </p>

<p>Look at any skyscraper fire, all that remains is the steel. They do not crumble demolition style. </p>

<p>Yes, it would. It&#39;s called the buildings need floors to support loads. Without floors, they can&#39;t support their own weight.</p>

<p>Because of cascading floor failures. Which only makes sense in a collapse.</p>

<p>You might want to work on some basic terminology here. The floors only transfer loads to the columns. They don&#39;t support the weight of the floors above. The columns carry loads down.</p>

<p>What report? There&#39;s multiple.</p>

<p>Obviously a failure starts somewhere. Have you never heard a chain is is only as strong as it&#39;s weakest link? It&#39;s the act of the massive section above impacting the floors below that causes progressive failures.</p>

<p>Yeah, you&#39;re displaying your lack of understanding here.</p>

<p>The floors don&#39;t support the floors above. They act as bracing while transferring loads. That&#39;s not a contradiction. </p>

<p>No idea what you&#39;re trying to convey here. Yes, water is wet. Yes, a collapsed building collapsed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What damaged the floors and columns then? In such a way as to collapse them?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Heat damaged the floors. Damaged floors put lateral loads on the columns. Buckled columns can&#39;t support loads.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The floors are built after the skeleton of the building. The idea that just the individual floors are required to make the building stand is ridiculous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, it&#39;s not. It&#39;s called bracing. Most structures don&#39;t use 60 foot floor trusses. These buildings were not conventional and had some unique characteristics that made them very lightweight and space efficient. That&#39;s what tube-in-frame construction is. If you think a steel column can stand free for 1000 feet I have news for you. <a href="http://www.sharpprintinginc.com/911/images/photoalbum/10/WTCdesign.jpg">The floors are built immediately.</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>. If the columns support the floors, the columns can withstand a plane impact and the heat from the fire.</p>

<p>That argument doesn&#39;t even make the slightest bit of sense. </p>

<p>Eventually, I am going to have a huge pile of sixes. All of which were 6 by random chance. But my pile isn&#39;t going to look random at all. However, if you were to pay attention, you would see that I have thrown out a lot more than I&#39;ve kept.</p>

<p>Evolution works the same way. There are far more failures than successes, it&#39;s just that the successful mutations stick around and reproduce themselves, while the failures are removed from the population.</p>

<p>So you are partially right, if randomness were the <em>only</em> force, it would simply be a failure. However, it is not the only thing in play.</p>

<p>Besides, people are far from perfect, there are all kinds of shortcomings in our &quot;design&quot; that are well explained by evolution, but would mean our creator was ridiculously bad engineer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evolution doesn&#39;t work that way. </p>

<p>Take as many dice as you want, and roll out the number of base pairs for DNA successively. If you get one out of order you throw all the dice away. </p>

<p>Now there&#39;s no more dice, because they failed to form into anything and they died. Nothing more can happen with those dice.</p>

<p>Start with more dice that randomly came from nothing, roll, throw them all away.</p>

<p>If you ever do somehow manage to get a living single celled organism to grow, it dies because it has no partner to mate with. Then two grow, but unfortunately they still can&#39;t mate because neither of them grew in the same place or with compatible DNA, so they die. Than miraculously you finally get two single celled organism to grow in the same place and in the same way and they have offspring. Unfortunately their offspring have a pothole genetic defect due to evolution that makes them incompatible and cannot procreate, so they all die.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how evolution works. The main problem with all of this of course is 1 time, and since you never have enough you keep making a bigger timeline, and 2 no designer. Nothing can form into something without a designer. And cells cannot design themselves because they don&#39;t know how or why. </p>

<p>Evolution is an impossibility that has been foisted on the despairing. Try God, he is much easier to believe in and has more evidence for his case.</p>

<p>Wow. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve met someone with <em>this</em> extreme of a view. Even the most ridiculous of creationists are forced to admit that animals evolve, but claim that it is only &quot;microevolution.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>There are no single-cell organism that have differentiated sex. Although, we do have organisms that have evolved different sexes, but can reproduce asexually, we have some that have evolved different sexes and lost them. But this is a good point, because it is not fully understood why sex differentiation happened, however, we do see a lot of evidence of fluidity between sexual and asexual reproduction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try God, he is much easier to believe in and has more evidence for his case.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The funny thing about this is that even if god did it, he put so much evidence around to make it look like evolution is the real deal, that by rejecting the evidence he has left for us, you are actually being incredibly insulting to him.</p>

<p>That being said, the God belief is incredibly hard to believe because it requires us to believe that this all knowing and powerful being that could create life is also an absolutely terrible engineer. Seriously, there are all kinds of short-comings in humans biology that make sense if we accept evolution, but would be downright stupid for someone designing us to have done. <a href="https://thehumanevolutionblog.com/2015/01/12/the-poor-design-of-the-human-eye/">The eye being a perfect example.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for posting that article. It clearly highlights the ignorance of the scientific community behind evolution. Btw, if it&#39;s in the genes already then sure I believe in that form of adaptive evolution. A flower has all the genes to be blue or red. Based on certain conditions you could find that it&#39;s always blue, or it&#39;s always red. </p>

<p>Back to that article. To believe that all life evolved and then to know that we all have different eyes, that suit us for different functions is design not chance. To know that many pieces have to all work at the same time or it doesn&#39;t work as a whole, and make the conclusion that the entire thing changed at once, is not even in line with your own theory. An entire eye changed in one generation! That&#39;s ridiculous.</p>

<p>Listen God has given you everything to see him in. The entire universe shouts that it was created. Rules don&#39;t exist from random chance and explosions. The universe has rules, they were designed. Animals are uniquely gifted for their purpose, not due to randomness and selection.</p>

<p>Lastly if God was such a bad engineer explain how you came to that conclusion. Our eyes may not be as good at night vision or seeing the earth magnetism, but that have served us well enough to have the best hunters in all the animal species,and to have the best artists. We have the best mind that although isn&#39;t quite as protected as a woodpeckers, allows for the creation of the most amazing things in the world. Nature is constantly learned from. Our best designs for structures, from nature. The best glues, from nature. God is a great designer, and his design is always what&#39;s best.</p>

<p>So you are denying that successful mutations occur? Wow. That&#39;s really far out there. We have seen this happen and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutagenesis">we even take advantage of it.</a> I can&#39;t believe you are actually making this argument. We <em>literally</em> use this idea to create new characteristics in organisms, and you are denying that it happens at all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To believe that all life evolved and then to know that we all have different eyes, that suit us for different functions is design not chance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This isn&#39;t addressing the article at all. Did you even read it? The article is about how many poor &quot;design decisions&quot; were made in just our eyes, that make sense if you consider them from an evolutionary perspective.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To know that many pieces have to all work at the same time or it doesn&#39;t work as a whole, and make the conclusion that the entire thing changed at once, is not even in line with your own theory.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wow. Irreducible complexity? I thought this argument died out probably 15 years ago. I haven&#39;t heard this one for a while. You have to realize that there wasn&#39;t a human, and then evolution put a whole eye in there. The parts of the eye were added slowly over time and developed slowly over time. Most creationists realized how terrible this argument was over 10 years ago. I can&#39;t believe someone is still trotting it out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Rules don&#39;t exist from random chance and explosions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well then, where did your god come from? Random chance and explosions? Or is he exempt from this &quot;rule?&quot; If he is exempt, why can&#39;t the universe also be exempt?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lastly if God was such a bad engineer explain how you came to that conclusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FFS, this is what the article I posted to you was about.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Our eyes may not be as good at night vision or seeing the earth magnetism, but that have served us well enough to have the best hunters in all the animal species,and to have the best artists.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, they&#39;ve served us well, but our eyes could easily be significantly better. Why did your god give all these advantages to birds eye, but not to us? He could have easily added the translucent eye lids so we could look directly at the sun. Why give them a broader range wavelength reception than us? Why give them further vision than us? If he made us in his form, why on earth does he not have the best eyes of any creature? As the article notes, this is easily explained by evolution, but basically requires us to accept that the creator could easily make us with much better eyes, but decided not to. You have to make up some ridiculous excuse and jump through a bunch of hoops why he decided to screw us when it came to our eyes, but evolution provides a very simple explanation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>God is a great designer, and his design is always what&#39;s best.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simply not true. Why put the cable for the eye on upside down? Why install the sensors backwards? Why put the cable right in the middle causing a blind spot, when we can see that the &quot;designer&quot; was able to successfully create a very similar eye in other creatures that don&#39;t have this short coming? If your designer designed our eyes, he is an idiot for not avoiding some of the short-comings in our eyes that he obviously avoided in other creatures. Why did that happen? Makes sense if we accept the reality of evolution and that sometimes mistakes stick around if they aren&#39;t strongly selected for. Doesn&#39;t make sense if the same designer made both creatures, nailing it very well in one, but totally fucking it up in &quot;the most advanced&quot; one.</p>

<p>You can believe that God is the designer all you want. But trying to pretend that he didn&#39;t unnecessarily screw us in many, many ways is a ridiculous position to hold.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;d like to point out that the first tower did not fall straight down. It tipped over significantly, and in the direction of the impact as one might expect.</p>

<p>Go to 2:32 of this video to see it pitched over at a significant angle. I say significant, because for a structure so massive, with such a huge footprint, it was never going to tip over like a broken palm tree </p>

<p>One thing that I always found curious was Silverstein&#39;s comments about &quot;pulling the building.&quot; In Europe for a long time during the cold war many bridges had predefined placements for explosive charges and supposedly explosives were set during heightened threat levels. </p>

<p>This leads to wonder if there might be some kind of contingency plan in place in major US cities for terror attacks like this. Could it be possible that they had foreknowledge of a <em>possible</em> terror attack and set explosives &quot;just in case&quot; there was a terror attack? </p>

Also interesting to note the &quot;planes&quot; were flying beyond their envelope at the speed and altitude we&#39;re told...

We&#39;re pretty far away and it&#39;s a decently wide shot and you see a plane enter frame. The people in the foreground of the shot watching the smoking tower - and they do not react At All! to the plane entering frame. They only react to the fireball. </p>

<p>They were not turned to dust in midair, much of the steel core was still standing and had to be cut away.  We can see the floor impacts which cause debris to spread out and can hear the waves of each floor.  Note what you don’t hear are explosions like in a demolition </p>

<p>WTC7 collapses because it was hit by the falling building, causing a gash and fires on several floors, When The N and S towers collapsed they disrupted the water supply that would be used to fight fires.  With the collapse damage and uncontrolled  fires burning for hours the tower collapsed.  Again, no demolition explosions are heard or recorded at the time of any collapse.  In no way does lack of plane in regards to WTC7 prove your absurd no plane theory.  The fact that you believe that is illogical and borderline delusional  </p>

<p>Ever play a game of Jenga?  Did you ever have a game of Jenga crash down neatly into a pile of bricks?  Nope.  Never.  What does happen is that it breaks at it&#39;s weakest point and topples to one side.</p>

<p>This would exactly simulate what happened at the WTC.  Random damage,  random stress points, random fires, random cracks in the steel beams.  It should have toppled to one side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And if this is so obvious and scientific, why would the &quot;demolition&quot; not have been done in such a way as to cover it up? The government was willing to fly two planes into a building, blow up three buildings, kill thousands, but making the building topple properly was a bridge too far. No motive, no real evidence, no agreement on what &quot;really happened&quot;, ridiculous bullshit in this thread like the planes being cgi, and people in this thread don&#39;t understand why the &quot;sheep&quot; don&#39;t want to hear from them?</p>

<p>Maybe instead of telling everyone how stupid they are while dabbling in completely ludicrous theories, we could get actual scientific proof of how &quot;impossible&quot; it was if it&#39;s so obvious and indisputable. No one is going to take &quot;it was three nuclear bombs&quot; or &quot;there were no planes&quot; seriously because those ideas are clearly not true. So prove your more reasonable theories instead of just circle jerking over how obvious it is that you&#39;re right.

    <div class="md"><p>It all goes back to my original comment about &quot;random&quot; damage. The perpetrators could not rely upon the fact that random damage would achieve their goal, which was to bring down the towers. There could have been partial collapses, or just the top sections falling over, or no collapses at all. Too random. Therefore, some failsafe method of bringing down the towers had to be enacted. It&#39;s mostly irrelevant what this method actually was. </p>

<p>And the <em>only</em> way to reliably collapse the entire building is inside it&#39;s own footprint. There was no way around this for the perpetrators. The third building (WTC7) is the most glaring example, and it either shows how bold they were or something went wrong there (flight 93 perhaps).</p>

<p>Also, the goal was not to destroy a big portion of New York (and thus financially cripple the U.S.). The goal was to provide &quot;shock and awe&quot; but still be relatively easy to contain and clean up. </p>

<p>They also appeared to want to minimize the casualties. The towers were not full that day. Many were warned off and stayed home. Again, I think the people behind it were not trying to maximize death but to maximize the psychological impact to the nation and the world. </p>

<p>There was no real need to &quot;hide&quot; the collapse into the footprints because they correctly knew that 90% of Americans would believe whatever they were told. </p>

<p>I believe what we saw was some sort of top secret weaponry. A combination of some sort of charges planted on/in the beams themselves during those ‘maintenance works’ in the weeks prior, and some sort of remote field generating weapon that targeted the buildings. </p>

<p>I don’t think the Hutchinson effect has much merit to it, but it hasn’t really been explained to me succinctly. My theories tend towards antimatter weaponry, Tesla and/or HAARP related energy fields, microwave fields (paper didn’t burn), or some other unrevealed tech. Something almost completely deleted the buildings, there clearly wasn’t enough wreckage in the aftermath - and way too much dust. </p>

<p>No footage of Pentagon strike, hijacker passport making it to the ground untouched, extremely under trained pilots able to manually fly into not only both towers, but the Pentagon, a giant engine component that came to rest in a street and was later determined to be the wrong type (can&#39;t seem to find a link these days), the collapse of both the North and South towers, thermite evidence, FDNY firefighters accounts of demolition type explosions, it&#39;s early and I know I am forgetting more oddities. I will ignore every one of those, if someone can explain the following:</p>

<p>How a 47 story building can collapse at free fall speed into it&#39;s own footprint from having only been struck by debris on the exterior of the building. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>wtc north &amp; south did not sustain &quot;random&quot; damage. They were hit by both identical airplanes which lead to the same type of catastrophic damage. In fact, we know from simple logic that the design and weight of the building had something to do with the collapse. why?  because Wtc north was hit first into the northern facade of the North Tower at 8:46 am, impacting between the 93rd and 99th floors. Seventeen minutes later, South Tower&#39;s southern facade got hit at 9:03 am between the 77th and 85th floors. Now, the south tower fell first after only 56 minutes after being struck. yet the north tower which was hit first fell 102 minutes after being struck. Those 20 floors prove that the design and weight of the building was the contributing factor!! Meaning, the south tower fell first even though it was hit last because there was more unsupported weight. and the north tower, which was hit first, but at a higher floor level stood an extra 46 minutes because there was less unsupported weight.  Further, those buildings were not built like normal steel buildings that everyone keeps comparing them to, the floors were suspended to columns. Also, you had molten aluminum reacting with water causing random powerful explosions. read this for that explanation. <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/358754743/The-Chemistry-of-How-the-World-Trade-Center-Disaster">https://www.scribd.com/document/358754743/The-Chemistry-of-How-the-World-Trade-Center-Disaster</a></p>

<p>Newton&#39;s laws suggest that those buildings were loaded with potential energy wanting to go straight down. Unless they are acted on with a force sufficient to deviate them from straight down, they will go straight down and continue going straight down until receiving a force that stops them doing that. </p>

<p>I have no idea why I see this parroted all the time. Its not impossible. Its likely with buildings of that size.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you stupid? If the steel below the impact levels was fine then it wouldn&#39;t collapse. If what you say is true then the outer shell wouldn&#39;t have collapsed but it did. Somehow the steel superstructure was damaged and it wasn&#39;t the plane, it wasn&#39;t the fire. WHAT was it that caused it to fall? </p>

<p>My argument is the official story is bs because it is just physically impossible. You have no argument and you have not denied my arguments, you have not proven anything wrong, you&#39;re not even addressing anything at all. Everything I say is mentioned in the official report, from superstructure, the planes weight, the kerosene, and none of it makes sense. What are YOU saying, that the plane did in fact cause it to collapse? Because what I am saying, is that that is impossible. </p>

<p>Just because the South tower led by the east side by &quot;five floors&quot; doesn&#39;t discredit anything; you&#39;re just saying that the east side was damaged in such a way that it caused it to collapse before the opposite side. So what is your explanation?  Why would one side go first?</p>

<p>If the floors held the loads &quot;mostly fine&quot; then the towers wouldn&#39;t have collapsed because THEY CAN HOLD UP THE BUILDING&#39;S WEIGHT ABOVE THE DAMAGED FLOORS. You are not refuting anything. </p>

<p>Every adherent to the official story claims the added weight of the planes is relevant. Because the report says so. </p>

<p>If the steel below the impact was fine, then the portion of the buildings below the impact sites would have held up the top of the building. </p>

<p>Look at any skyscraper fire, all that remains is the steel. They do not crumble demolition style. </p>
