      <p>
       Sexual harassment and assault have been in the news.  It's a good thing victims are able and comfortable enough to come forward but the volume and pace has pushed the spotlight off some of the most disturbing aspects of the original story. Let's walk back.
      </p>
      <p>
       This began with allegations against Harvey  Weinstein.  The original scandal as I recall it was more about the fact he got away with it for so long not just the acts themselves.  There was extensive reporting both the power he had over actress (a Weinstein film could and did jump start many careers) and that it was essentially an open secret in his industry.  It's fucking uncomfortable that Hollywood felt okay openly joking about it (30 rock, Seth McFarland etc). Great start but then the focus starts to shift.  We never quite got past "lots of people" to who really enabled him by protecting him and "handling" the more troublesome cases.  Why, the spacey story dropped.  That was clearly organic because it followed the same themes:
       <strong>
        open, repeated, and enabled
       </strong>
       .  His preference for young boys was really fucked up.  Good for Rapp for coming forward, makes complete sense similar situations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's where it starts to get hazy.  allegations start flying right and left.  Good, I guess.  Yes, all sexual harassment and assault is bad but we're starting to lose our three themes:
       <strong>
        open, repeated, and enabled
       </strong>
       . I guess the HW story technically fits but is an old man in a wheelchair grabbing ass really the same as exploiting the power to make or break careers for decades?  What the hell was up all the men and women outside Weinstein's orbit just passing it off like it's a normal thing?  How normal is this?  Is it just Hollywood or are their other problem industries?  Any intersection?  It's clear already somehow this stuff is getting handled.  Props to the New York Times for breaking the story but are gonna talk about how the same paper killed the same story in its infantcy only a decade ago?  Then there's the  little matter of an elected DA killing a slam dunk case.  Props to the NYPD and the courage of the victim.  It takes balls to get that proof from wearing a wire.  With all the new names coming up somehow these are one day stories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the New Yorker dropped a bombshell:
       <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/harvey-weinsteins-army-of-spies?">
        <strong>
         Harvey Weinstein’s Army of Spies.
        </strong>
       </a>
       Read it. READ ALL OF IT.  The title gives Harvey a little too much credit.  He hired a high power law firm, they hired the spies but weinstein did follow the developments personally.  So how high powered?  It's run by David Boise.   He was the lead attorney for Al Gore in Bush v Gore.  The guy's now saying it was a mistake to hire "investigators",.  Quick question, are most investigators former Israeli mossad agents?
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        So what exactly were these ex foreign agents now for hire doing?
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Over the course of a year, Weinstein had the agencies “target,” or collect information on, dozens of individuals, and compile psychological profiles that sometimes focussed on their personal or sexual histories.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <em>
        It gets better
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Two private investigators from Black Cube, using false identities, met with the actress Rose McGowan, who eventually publicly accused Weinstein of rape, to extract information from her.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <em>
        Yeah, one more thing
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The law firm and Black Cube signed a contract that month and several others later. One, dated July 11, 2017, and bearing Boies’s signature, states that the project’s “primary objectives” are to “provide intelligence which will help the Client’s efforts to completely stop the publication of a new negative article in a leading NY newspaper” and to “obtain additional content of a book which currently being written and includes harmful negative information on and about the Client,”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       <em>
        Lastly
       </em>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Weinstein’s relationship with Kroll, one of the other agencies he contracted with, dates back years.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So here's a question, how the fuck isn't this the lead story.  I know, Roy Moore.  You can't have two major stories at the same time?
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's assume that pretty much all the allegations are true.  Why is each being treated as a new thing? Why are they being covered the way they are? We have laws against sexual harassment and sexual but remember those three things...
      </p>
      <p>
       We already know money tips the scales of justice to towards those who have it.  Is this hard proof there's a class of people laws don't apply to? How the fuck are former foreign agents allowed to operate like this?  Where's the outrage?  Investigations by congress and the FBI?
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        So here's the real question, is there manipulation to bury the elements I've described?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Bonus question, is reddit being used?
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7c65uq/actor_george_takei_accused_of_sexual_assault_by/">
        thread on  r/news
       </a>
       right now with 25k upvotes regarding some allegations.  It comes down to this 36 years ago George Takei met a gay model who was 23.  A year later they met at a bar after the model had broken up with his boyfriend. They go back Takei's apartment for more drinks.  The kid, Brunton, says he passed out and came to with Takei's hands down his pants. He freaked out and left.  If everything happened exactly like that George could have been charged with sexual assault.  Two problems tho: the statute of limitations expired 26 years ago and I thought we were talking about

       By the way the current count of women coming out about Weinstein alone is at around 40.

       Nice write up. I think it's just so far removed from actual normal people's lives that they don't care that much. People have jobs, bills, and realized life problems they can hardly figure out.

       That's my suspicion, and the way the topic of "sexual assault" is being so heavily pushed reminds me very much of how Pizzagate was so terribly diluted with disinfo when it broke. It's a tactic to distract, confuse and dilute the real issue which is child abuse. I honestly don't care very much if someone is sexually inappropriate in a grownup setting. If someone felt they were assaulted they should call the police or sue in civil court.

       There will be a high-profiled 'investigation' to debunk the whole thing. It will be on the media 24/7 and will appeal to the public's emotions to stop the witchhunt and will make everyone believe that there were a lot of fake accusations. Finally damage control ends and few of them see any prison time

       I"m going to walk you out there for a moment so you might be able to look back at all of this and really see the big picture.
      </p>
      <p>
       Harvey is not the biggest fish this scandal is going to hook.  In fact, Harvey is a test, sort of a controlled release, to temper the entire disclosure that is coming.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the 1970's there were some up and coming young filmmakers that were fresh outa school and looking to break into the business anyway they could.  It just so happened that these young directors and storytellers were Hollywood enthusiasts that knew all of the "real" history of the players in the business from the beginning of the business to that time in Hollywood history and they loved it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       These young directors were inseparable and shared access to everything with each other, although they were competitive, they were loyal.  Each had their own niche and expertise.  Each had their own access to the important people at the time, and each were young.
      </p>
      <p>
       Years later this group of storytellers became the most powerful Hollywood directors and storytellers the world had ever seen.  The blockbuster is attributed to this group.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there was something else going on at the sametime; Hollywood History.  This group is perverted.  Sick.  Demented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather than not participate in the underbelly of Hollywood lore, they took ownership of it.  They began to initiate others to their sick little power/control world.  During the 80's they participated in all manner of human exploitation and control - including snuff.  Child fucking has always been on the menu in Hollywood.  Remember, talent is not referred to by age in the business - only ability.  Doesn't matter the actors age if they can deliver both on and especially off the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jaid Barrymore:  Mother of Drew Barrymore.  Jaid knows more about who fucks children than most.  She allowed her child to become a Hollywood plaything when the girl was just 4 years old.
      </p>
      <p>
       Go back and research the Hollywood headlines of the 1980's.  You will easily be able to piece together puzzle of who was involved in the pederast activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hollywood has always been about two things:  The show and The secret.  There is no way the secret is going to be released uncontrolled by the gatekeepers.  This is a controlled release of information that seems organic, but is not.  The sharks are swimming around the four biggest names in the business.  These four have paid, threatened, disassociated from, bullied and done all manner of shitty things to continue their control and private parties going on 5 decades now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's the rub, through the use of private investigation and other outsourced fixers, these fuckers have been able to amass damaging information on almost all the major players in the business.  Because sex is expected and is considered the first rung in the business, no one really gives it much consideration.  The expectations are well known before these actresses arrive for their "test".
      </p>
      <p>
       What is happening right now is an allegiance of protection for these four powerful storytellers.  A cabal of human suffering and exploitation.  Those that will protect this cabal and those that will break rule number 2: Tell the secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       You know who these 4 people are, we all do.  This is really about their cabal and their reach throughout the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The length of the nondisclosure agreement should be telling enough.  Look at Oprah's - 99 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Funny thing is, it all goes back to Disney.  But that is another story.

       I've seen a few rumours about Spielberg recently so assumed it was him as I read your post. Sort of also thought it would include Lucas due to how close those two are. In your post you mention 4 main players. I'm guessing these are Coppola (just because so many of his family and extended family have done so well too so thought in part in might be that he's owed "favours"), then Spielberg and Lucas. In the post you linked to it also has De Palma and Scorsese. Are those two involved as well? Don't know much about De Palma beyond watching the recent documentary on him, but he seemed like an ok guy (obviously, I have no idea I'm just going by his interviews) and Scorsese seemed pretty genuine too but that could just be good PR. Obviously there's also Polanski and I think there's more stuff coming out about him and very young kids. What about people like James Cameron? Not sure if he was a bit later than that 70s crew.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you also heard about the "yacht girls"? I read a thing a while back that people thought was an anonymous comment from Robert Downey Jr about who are good/bad people in Hollywood. In the comment it said that Hayden Panateres mother had allegedly pimped her out when she was like 12-13. The blog the comment was on basically claimed that the gossip magazines are essentially catalogues for rich business men (especially in the Middle East) to decide which female stars they wanted to pay to sleep with. The blog seemed to suggest that very few actresses weren't for sale. They even said a couple of princesses were sold for sex too.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you happen to have an idea as to how true this might be or the extent to which it happens? Are there any stars (male or female) who don't have to do the "casting couch"? Like what level or jobs don't have to do these sex acts? I'm assuming screenwriters and behind the scenes crews don't have to do it, but do you know/think it happens for every job?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard about the old Hollywood stars being forced into it. I think there's a story that Frank Sinatra allegedly got Marilyn Monroe drunk/high and filmed her with lots of different guys in order to control her. Apparently actresses used to be mistresses for the rich/nobility back in the day so in order to give them money but keep them close without upsetting their wives, the rich/nobility would make sure they were in the big plays of the time and then when it went from theatre to movies that "tradition" of actors and actresses being used for sex carried on and became part of the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
       I only looked into the whole thing last year for a short time, but the little I read seemed to be very compelling evidence from some big name people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I heard a radio show that said Burt Reynold's book talks about having to do it and there's quotes from Travolta when he got arrested for propositioning a guy saying how he had to get used to enjoying gay sex in order to get roles. There's also a clip online where Richard Pryor is with Paul Mooney at a roast and Pryor says something like "last night Paul and I had to suck dick, I'm telling you now so he can't hold it over my head". Obviously, it was a comedy roast so people laughed, but Mooney and Pryor looked deadly serious when he said it.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem to have an idea about the whole thing so just wondering about your thoughts to any of the points I've listed above.

        is an old man in a wheelchair grabbing ass really the same as exploiting the power to make or break careers for decades?

      <p>
       Yes. Fact is, someone grabbing someone else's ass is pretty much sexual harassment and unwanted touching, no matter who the person is or the circumstances around it. Why give a free pass to an old man in a wheelchair (whether he's a former US President or not)?

      <p>
       Surprisingly normal. Casting couches have been going on since the film industry first began. People who get assaulted either speak out or keep quiet, and for decades, the latter are rewarded with continued work. It's a sick and twisted world, but it happens everywhere.

       <em>
        Every

       industry is rife with it. Film, TV, theatre, dance, music, sport. Even council offices, schools, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I knew someone who worked briefly as a teaching assistant in a school and had a student grab her ass, while others openly talked about wanting to drag her into the school's bathroom to rape her as she walked past them and overheard the conversation. Doctors in the UK have been jailed and their medical licenses revoked for groping and even raping patients during a routine consultation, some even did it during surgery while junior doctors looked on in horror and were terrified into silence until an anonymous whistleblower went to the media with the story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't care
       <em>
        when
       </em>
       it happened, this kind of thinking that groping and more is somehow "okay" really needs to be eradicated, yet I never fail to be embarrassed and revolted by comments online that seem to cheer on the assaults and blame the victims.

       Nick Kroll made use of his father's spies and law firms(Lavely and Singer, Marty Singer) to fix a few cases for is self professed best friend Tig Notaro. Yes, the laws absolutely don't apply to certain people. Also many rich and famous know of Kroll for decades and they know of the law firms that hires them, and it's amazing it has taken so long for them to be named.

       , just a contemporary that makes great cinema experiences that these other guys admire like fanboys. Although, Marty is also a Hollywood "historian" and would be better able to answer some of the more esoteric questions.
