<p>If confirmed, the arrest and detention of Bandar would constitute the most significant and high profile figure caught up in the purge - even above that of high profile billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal - given Bandar&#39;s closeness to multiple US administrations and involvement in events ranging from Reagan&#39;s Nicaraguan Contra program (including direct involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal), to making the case for the Iraq War as a trusted friend of Bush and Cheney, to directing US-Saudi covert operations overseeing the arming of jihadists in Syria.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Watch out for this new guy. I&#39;ll use a hockey example to explain why.</p>

<p>It takes a certain amount of time (in any culture) for a man to reach his peak: his social status, his reasoning ability, his experience and self-discipline. It&#39;s the same with hockey (or most sports), an athlete plays for a few years gaining experience before they become team captain. </p>

<p>In sports, or in society in general, a man doesn&#39;t rise straight to power unless he&#39;s shown absolutely exceptional ability to wield power.</p>

<p>Now a guy who probably has this ability has just risen to #1 in Saudi Arabia. He&#39;s currently in control of a big chunk of the world&#39;s petroleum reserves. His country supports several flavors of extremism financially and logistically. He&#39;s got friends with nukes. His country contains the birthplace of Islam (and 2 of it&#39;s holiest sites) within it&#39;s borders. His predecessors ruled with the support of the Wahhabi clergy. Perhaps he has their continued support as well?</p>

<p>This is the guy to keep an eye on. Even if he makes you think he&#39;s on your side.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This would explain why the Bushes (along with Obama, curiously at the same time) went hell-for-leather on Trump in the days before the Saudi arrests. Their personal and maniacal attacks seemed suspiciously out of place, but now we know - Prince Bandar is a personal friend of the Bush family. My first thought was &quot;something&#39;s happening.&quot; </p>
