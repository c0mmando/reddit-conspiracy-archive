        If confirmed, the arrest and detention of Bandar would constitute the most significant and high profile figure caught up in the purge - even above that of high profile billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal - given Bandar's closeness to multiple US administrations and involvement in events ranging from Reagan's Nicaraguan Contra program (including direct involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal), to making the case for the Iraq War as a trusted friend of Bush and Cheney, to directing US-Saudi covert operations overseeing the arming of jihadists in Syria.

       Watch out for this new guy. I'll use a hockey example to explain why.
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes a certain amount of time (in any culture) for a man to reach his peak: his social status, his reasoning ability, his experience and self-discipline. It's the same with hockey (or most sports), an athlete plays for a few years gaining experience before they become team captain.
      </p>
      <p>
       In sports, or in society in general, a man doesn't rise straight to power unless he's shown absolutely exceptional ability to wield power.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now a guy who probably has this ability has just risen to #1 in Saudi Arabia. He's currently in control of a big chunk of the world's petroleum reserves. His country supports several flavors of extremism financially and logistically. He's got friends with nukes. His country contains the birthplace of Islam (and 2 of it's holiest sites) within it's borders. His predecessors ruled with the support of the Wahhabi clergy. Perhaps he has their continued support as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the guy to keep an eye on. Even if he makes you think he's on your side.

       This would explain why the Bushes (along with Obama, curiously at the same time) went hell-for-leather on Trump in the days before the Saudi arrests. Their personal and maniacal attacks seemed suspiciously out of place, but now we know - Prince Bandar is a personal friend of the Bush family. My first thought was "something's happening."
