        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Had to post this again. I think it is worth the warning and for more discussion. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s SOME of my argument for a massive crash, worse than 2008. The decline has been gradual and there is too many facts to write about but ...</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(1) China Russia (oil rich) trading oil in yuan. Venezuela (oil rich) trading oil in yuan. Iran (oil rich) trading oil in Yuan. Other (oil rich) countries will trade in yuan. US print US dollars in 3 QEs. Excess dollars sent back to US. More dollars in circulation in the US. Hyperinflation is a certainty.</p></li>
<li><p>(2) Look at retail data around the world. Retail is very very bad. Also, yy 30% drop in property mortgages demand. 50% drop in automobile loans. etc ... just look.</p></li>
<li><p>(3) A good indicator of bad US economy is gold. If gold rises, that means global risk, meaning people are getting scared and buying the yellow metal. Same for silver.</p></li>
<li><p>(4) But price of gold and silver is low. Why? Because the price is being manipulated. Price is low because globalist bankers (cabal) are keeping it low. If people know gold and silver is high they would question. So, someone, cough, cabal, sold 38k gold contracts the other day in 8 minutes, not normal, and you can see price of silver and gold spike lower on charts. <strong>THIS IS MANIPULATION.</strong> Keep the price low so that people won&#39;t question the narrative. </p></li>
<li><p>(5) In this context where price of gold should be high because of risk because it is the real market, let&#39;s look at security services wages where there is a rise in demand, just for contrast. Why? Year on year, wages for them rise 24%. The elites KNOW something is about to happen. All around the world, they are hiring security personnel and buying safes, even renting places with airstrips to fly in their valuables in with heavy security.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>All the facts are searchable. Do it yourself but don&#39;t get caught up in the narrative they are feeding you.</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia is just one oil producer and was the leader of OPEC, but the US has plenty of shale oil and it is cheap too. In fact, we don&#39;t really know how much oil is left in SA because they keep it secret.</p>

<p><strong>ANYWAY, AS I STATED BEFORE, OLD SYSTEM WILL DIE, AND THEY WILL TRY AND ENSLAVE US AGAIN WITH A NEW MONEY SYSTEM. LIKE USD/CRYTOCURRENCY. WHICH THEY CONTROL AGAIN</strong></p>

<p>But will you be prepared for THEIR push for this? If I am wrong, ok, but if I am right, remember this post, stick together, and push for something decentralized like Bitcoin, and hold the gov hostage instead of the other way --- then humankind would escape servitude forever. Remember when it comes to money we are all stupid, when the shit hits the fan, we act and behave stupid, but keep a cool head, and make the right decision. PLEASE. For our kids sake. </p>

<p>EDIT: Why haven&#39;t they reset the system yet? Because they need to blame it on a false flag. If they can do this, then the FED will be given a pass from how they&#39;ve artificially created booms and busts simply to consistently profit from them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There exists the possibility that soon the economy will not tank, but will actually drastically improve. If you look at some of the moves POTUS has made, namely the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAUqcBc0hYI">Space Council Executive Order</a> and the recent happenings in Saudi Arabia, which allegedly were undertaken as part of an effort to move us away from the petrodollar and it&#39;s concomitant drug-running and endless war, we can begin to piece together a hypothesis for creating a different way to fund the government and sustain our economy. This method depends on the <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/otps/060320a/forum.cfm">revenue generated from investments in infrastructure projects</a> and it has served us <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_System_%28economic_plan%29">well in the past.</a></p>

<p>So what kind of infrastructure projects could deliver the requisite funding to finance the government? Could it be enough to reduce or even eliminate taxes? One possibility is <a href="http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3266/1">space-based solar power</a> furnished by constructing an <a href="http://www.orionsarm.com/fm_store/OrbitalRings-I.pdf">orbital ring</a> space <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20000105202.pdf">elevator,</a> which is theoretically feasible with current technology and materials. The revenue generated could be in the <a href="https://newfederalistpapers.joomla.com/11-orbitalring">realm of trillions annually</a>, enough to perhaps eliminate taxes and maybe even issue a universal basic income or create and make a deposit into a health savings account for every American citizen. This future is not a pie-in-the-sky fantasy but could actually happen if things fall into place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You said it, not me: &quot; hold ___ hostage&quot;. Maybe the paradigm shift that would be most beneficial is utilizing &quot;example setting&quot; rather than power weilding. Is humanity held hostage by cold, calculating violent thugs sporting phony epaulettes? If so, will emulating their terroristic tactics improve civilization, or will Roger Daltry echo in our ears: MEET THE NEW BOSS SAME AS THE OLD BOSS. Lots of people are observing for themselves that their livelihood hangs in the balance these days. Some are lucky enough to have been cast out of modernity with sanity intact. Anyone can research history and recognize pre industrial revolution ways of life are truly viable amid 21st c. chaos. We don&#39;t need to milk cows and tend to horses at 4 a.m. every day, or split firewood if we don&#39;t want to these days. We can leave the u.s. and build a rewarding life of self sufficiency ALMOST anywhere. This transition back to traditional humanity is attainable as shown by many intrepid folks. All this intrigue ceases to be attractive when youre dirtying your fingernails by day and then stargazing next to a campfire every night</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And so what has happened over 50 years that that the globalist bankers have been in charge? Case in point, what happened when Bush went into Iraq, did the people let him, could the people stop him? over a lie, over a lie about WMD? Did he go in? Are his goons and him charged with anything? Over the deaths of 1 million and displacing 2 million families? </p>

<p>Point being, you talk about coming together and solving problems, thinking logically as if that is reality it will happen, but I have already pointed out to you it doesn&#39;t work that way, because the masses are stupid. It isn&#39;t me or you or the cabal that can make the difference, it is the masses. And they have proved they can&#39;t. So looking at past data, you can pretty much speculate which way they will flow in the future? </p>

The thing is it&#39;s been a year since then and some of my stocks like amazon, google and apple are up 15-30%.  How do we know the correction will happen this year?  I was so sure it would happen last year because I heard some conspiracy about the jubilee year.  I think it may be rash to start pulling all investments.

<p>If yes, then what&#39;s your opinion on government mechanisms to control decentralized coins, like controlling who can send or receive them, and jailing people who don&#39;t adhere to these rules?</p>

<p>Obviously, this is wrong. </p>

<p>But you cant stop BC.  Even though China has limited or outright banned BC exchanges but how can they control 1 billion people. People can stay at home, encrypt their data and trade. There are even people that travel to HK and use bitcoin weekly. Point being all you need a computer terminal and internet and trade anywhere at any time.</p>

<p>What if we&#39;re only allowed to use government-approved computers?</p>

<p>Note that modern CPUs (and other hardware) all have gov backdoors already, and there are hardly any alternatives.</p>

<p>Will there be a scenario where this happens? </p>

<p>Yes, good point. Intel chips have their own OS from what I&#39;ve heard. But I doubt they can manipulate trades between CC traders and sellers because, again, each transaction is direct, and the info is sent to multiple ledgers. The weakness I see is the unique transaction ID of each transactor can be used to hijack CC accounts to steal and transfer the CC to their account. </p>

<p>Oh yeah, the idea of blockchain is that it is decentalized and cannot be manipulated, that&#39;s what you need to take away. Why? Let&#39;s say BC has a weakness and can be comprised. Then people will migrate to another CC. And will keep moving until there is a perfect and safe system for everyone. Look at all the other CC that have sprung up after BC like Ethereum etc ...</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly in the cards with a global NWO Agenda 21 police state. Don&#39;t you think so?</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t like it to happen, of course. But with this on the horizon, I believe we have a scenario where Bitcoin and other CCs would serve TPTB very well.</p>

<p>The trouble is that a rogue OS like Intel&#39;s ME (or AMD&#39;s pendant) could pretty easily check at what times you are using Bitcoin Wallets. It&#39;s also conceivable that such a software would be able to find out things like your balance and your local wallet&#39;s txn history (simply by reading the RAM of your main OS).</p>

<p>So I guess I&#39;m critical as far as all digital currencies are concerned (or in fact all money, though digital currencies are IMHO easier to control in a global police state)...</p>

<p>Agree, with most of what you say, however your type of thinking was pre Nov 2016. I&#39;m guessing the way you think is because it is the globalist bankers and silicon valley shaping you concerns. Don&#39;t worry, I share them too. </p>

<p>Trump is in office now, I am not saying he is the saviour and not part of the swamp, agenda 21 and global police state, but from his pro nationalist actions: cutting down gov, pedo arrests, Hillary, SA, Syria, trying to solve NK, working with China and Russia to dissolve the cabal, deep state purge, he seems to be on the up and up. Again, I am not saying he is part of them and he needs to be monitored more. </p>

<p>Now, with CC concerns in Trump era, I understand his corp tax cuts very well because as a biz owner myself, the place where I live is thriving on low taxes. If he is that serious about the health of the US economy, and protecting the 1st amendment I can&#39;t really see him stopping CC on a national level. He may even embrace it and find another solution to get tax from the people. </p>

<p>Generally the masses are dumb, that&#39;s why they don&#39;t think logically when it comes to money. Hence my OP, no?</p>
