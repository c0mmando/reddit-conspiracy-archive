    <div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s interesting how some of these so-called liberal groups display behaviors consistent with the most conservative elements in human history, e.g. homosexuals=priestly-caste, jews=aristocracy.  What I mean is that we&#39;ve been hustled into believing that conservatism is actually progressive, and that the new social hierarchy is somehow different and better than the old social hierarchy.  But you know what?  If these groups were really progressive or liberal there would be no shadow government now, but instead it&#39;s bigger than ever.</p>

But it is odd that just because of Rose McGowan making her voice heard did the trick. People have been speaking out about this for some time and it was never taken seriously so I am just surprised. I mean, perhaps that’s all it took was for her to say something about the right person who did it so much they had to give him up. But it is weird that it’s not just the same shitty denial that we usually get from the media and the public when it comes to allegations like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact is that most people have always known this is what goes on in order to get roles in Hollywood. As in the case with many things these days, normally well-intentioned people have been simply casting these issues to the back of their minds and ignoring the sad reality in order to placate their own proclivities and self-accepted cognitive dissonance that fits their conceived notions of the world. In actuality they know it is very dark and real subject matter, and attempt to ignore it so that their world stays &#39;magical&#39;. </p>

<p>This same pathetic self-accepted cognitive dissonance applies also in regards to US support for terrorists in Syria and Nazis in Ukraine, and the Saudi regime that is flooding Europe with FSA terrorists. People will lie to themselves and all their friends and family rather than admit these factual events are occurring. Why? Because, once again, the recognition of these facts demolish their world view. Alas, it just goes to show that a large portion of humanity is quite sociopathic, weak minded, fearful and willing to accept obvious lies and propaganda to placate themselves, thus hurting their own country and humanity as a whole, instead of stepping up to the plate and being a true patriot by pointing out when their country is in the wrong, and letting soldiers (their own children) go to die in wars based upon the support of those lies. Its sadly fascinating to watch, to say the least. </p>

It&#39;s too hard to get anyone to listen or follow to stop the behavior you&#39;re referring to, all we can do is our best to spread awareness, because anything else is a waste of time and money.

    <div class="md"><p>Well it&#39;s good this circle is being tied up. I feel this recent string of accusations to be pretty legitimate and I do hope they lead somewhere.</p>

<p>With actual names coming out more research can be done into who these Hollywood pedo&#39;s were connected with.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a distraction and I believe it is putting a lot of pressure on other pedos; at least as far as public reaction goes.</p>

<p>Hopefully it leads to people questioning where else pedophilia is prevalent and protected aka DC.</p>

<p>I have no evidence but I do feel that unless these circles are connected on a deeper level I think they may be mutually exclusive. </p>

<p>Hollywood has a long standing affair with children, drugs and power so I don&#39;t doubt they could have set up their own trafficking system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The nature of social networking in Hollywood, as in DC, college campuses, and certainly elsewhere positions those that are part of the clique to have the most access.    Being available to a sex network, knowing a secret handshake, or holding certain opinions will include some and exclude others.    The excluded have a legitimate reason to be upset if things are supposed to be fair and equal and moral too.    Things aren’t that way though.</p>

<p>I am still on the fence about how organic this upheaval is but Hollywood sure has a huge mess on its hands and one that can never be cleaned - which is greatly to our advantage.    And it has nothing to do with a casting couch.    Start looking into Judd Apatow and his connections to the deep state.   It certainly doesn’t stop there but it’s as good as a place to start as any.   Get 4chan on it.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is literally said about everything that ever happens ever. Football players kneeling? They&#39;re trying to distract you from something else. Plane crashing? It&#39;s a misdirect. Shooting? They want you talking about that, not this other thing. </p>

<p>Seriously.
I understand that we&#39;re in a conspiracy theory sub and it&#39;s important to question things, but sometimes things can be taken at face value. With sexual misconduct allegations, it happens like this a lot. One person comes forward, then two, then eight, then 20 etc. The more victims see others expressing what happened to them the more emboldened they get to share their own experiences.</p>

<p>I feel like Bush could come out tomorrow and admit to involvement in 9/11 and you&#39;d see posts here saying &quot;this feels too convenient. What are they trying to hide?&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I sort of get what you mean. I still don&#39;t understand what agenda they&#39;re trying to push. Sexual assault is bad? I can get behind that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just lazy conspiracy theory 101 to claim something is a cover for something else. Sometimes it absolutely makes sense. A shooting happening at the same time as a leak. Sure. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s always true. Plus saying it in this case feels really dismissive of claims of sexual abuse as theater and not taking any of it seriously. </p>

<p>But what if, these men being accused, your Kevin Spacey&#39;s, Louis CKs, Weinsteins, sure what if they <em>are</em> illuminati/thelema/scientology whatever puppets who were just really bad at it. Your assertions about Hollywood are real but these guys were just bad a playing the game so they&#39;re being purged. Maybe they abused their power one too many times and with the wrong people so now they&#39;re being made examples of. </p>

<p>Obviously stuff like this could take place in a less public way, but we&#39;re dealing with giant companies and studios and they&#39;re in a position where if they do nothing, they will be called out for aiding and abetting sex offenders. So they very publicly and very loudly condemn these guys in order to maintain the public&#39;s trust. I just think it&#39;s a case of allegations snowballing and getting too big for studios and production companies to ignore so, like I said, they loudly and publicly condemn them in order to save face. And because these names are all very much household names, the public latches onto it and makes it even bigger.</p>

<p>It&#39;s dumb, it shouldn&#39;t be as big as it is, it should be between the accused and the accuser(s) but the public loves a train wreck. The media gives the people what they want, not what they need. People demand celebrity gossip, editorials, and partisan news, that&#39;s what we get because nobody wants to think for themselves.</p>

<p>Sorry for the rant.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t completely disagree with you. I just find the &quot;too convenient&quot; angle to be too convenient and simplistic in a way that completely devalues the actual events taking place. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But people are literally watching their careers being erased because of this. Kevin Spacey had just completed a film and the director is cutting him completely out of the finished film and reshooting his scenes with a different actor. Louis Ck is probably done with FX, as they have publicly condemned his actions. Weinstein Co is definitely finished producing. Cosby will probably never have a fruitful stand up career again. I just don&#39;t see how any of this can possibly push the idea that sexual abuse is OK. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>These Hollywood revelations are a big deal in themselves, but the media focus on them has two ulterior motives.</p>

<p>1) The individuals being thrown under the bus (notably Weinstein and Spacey) are the tip of the iceberg. These supposed lone-wolf rapist/sex coercers are sacrificial pawns to hide a much larger and even more serious issue of elite ritual child abuse.</p>

<p>2) The timing is conveniently hiding some game-changing events with global implications, notably the transition of power in Saudi Arabia, and the anointment of the Israeli-US zionist puppet Mohammed Bin Salman (MBS) as the new King of Saudi Arabia. </p>

<p>The quid pro quo that is expected from MBS for the Mossad/CIA greasing him into position is that he will start a new conflagration in the Middle East, starting with Lebanon. The first blows will be dealt by Saudi Arablia, and Israel will create a false flag response from &quot;Hizbollah&quot; to justify Israel invading Lebanon (again). Israel, Saudi Arabia and the US want to suck Iran into this new war, so that they can destroy Iran. It&#39;s a desperate and senseless strategy, and could easily lead to WW3.</p>

<p>This is just a primer before they rally up women to go after Trump. Now that there’s actual dominoes falling and admitting their guilt, the next domino is Trump. They will expect him to own up to it like the others... except he probably won’t. With the current trend and mood of the country in dealing with sexual assault you can expect even more outrage and a clear cut case for impeachment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They started with Weinstein:  sexual harassment of women in the work place (even some rape, perhaps).  All vague consensual in the creepy Hollywood casting couch manner (one could work at Applebee&#39;s).  Any child abuse lost among sea of women.  Most NPR women emotionally attach themselves to Violations of the Workplace, we&#39;re being oppressed!  They do not heat any child abuse.</p>

<p>Then Spacey:  Any child abuse gets swept under the I am Gay rug.  Pedo and Gay gets mingled.  Everybody loves Spacey, he issued an apology, post-pubescent boys all want sex no matter what... these things minimize the devastation of child abuse and focus the story on Coming Out as Gay.</p>

<p>Then Louis C.K.:  Total pervert, totally coarse, totally crude.  Every woman&#39;s embodiment of That Guy.  No child abuse accusations (afaik).  </p>

<p>Now emotions can be focused on Violations of the Workplace by Crude, Perverted Men.  The focus is not on child abuse and the system that enables it.</p>

The celebrity obsessed culture whether it&#39;s hollywood, music, sports are what many people think is important, and none of it is. It was also used to create advertising campaigns connecting products to people others looked up to. Now you are seeing this all collapse like an empty house of cards.

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s analyze this. </p>

<p>What do you see going on here in the entertainment news in recent years, with these scandals being uncovered. Who are &quot;celebs&quot;? They&#39;re talented people on TV, who are better than you. Politicians, actors in the movies, live actors in theater, coordinated sports athletes, musicians, singers. A lot of them are good looking. They&#39;re also richer than the average person from the general public. People sort of &quot;idolize&quot; them. They think they&#39;re &quot;cool&quot;. The majority of the sheep voted them in. They&#39;re &quot;fans&quot; of the material. They&#39;ll go to concerts. They admire them. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, what are these entertainment media outlets you hear of these people when they begin to get famous? Who controls those. </p>

<p>Last night I was going through all the cable TV stations at work. A good couple hundred these days. When I grew up as a teen in the 80&#39;s, living in the country, with antenna TV, you had less than half a dozen stations. If you&#39;d go to the city where they had cable, there&#39;d be maybe like oh 50 stations. </p>

<p>I was going through the stations last night with just the next channel button. Took my whole lunch hour to get back to the beginning. Who&#39;s got time for TV? I threw it out like half a decade ago. You could do this with all your spare time after work and go nowhere your whole life. How about being a fan of sports. </p>

<p>Look at who owns these media outlets. Mergers every year and there&#39;s less choices of where your money is going. If it&#39;s a public company with stock, who knows who&#39;s buying the stock. Seems like the illuminati characters control all these media outlets. </p>

<p>You have Hollywood with the movies, actors, musicians, pop stars. They&#39;re taking a hit in recent years. It&#39;s more difficult to get famous. Back in the 70&#39;s you had a few TV stations, whoever was on TV, was famous and people knew about them. </p>

<p>Going through the TV stations last night, I was thinking, if you&#39;re an advertiser, who the hell is gonna watch your commercials. People&#39;s attention is so fragmented these days. It must be difficult for advertisers to reach people. Print media like newspapers is declining. Everybody ignores ads on the internet. They can&#39;t stand youtube ads. I&#39;ve never clicked one. </p>

<p>Did you notice there&#39;s less famous people as time goes on? If you have a hit song, it might get a lot of plays but it isn&#39;t like the previous decades where most people would hear about it. You&#39;d have to go to the youtube video and watch it. You don&#39;t really have these top Billboard charts where most people are familiar with it. Everybody&#39;s so tuned out of what&#39;s going on these days. </p>

<p>Then you have the video games you can spend a chunk of your life playing. Decades going nowhere. </p>

<p>There&#39;s less new pop stars as time goes on. Nobody watches the top network TV stations like they used to. Things started declining in the mid 2000&#39;s. People used to watch live TV. They don&#39;t do that any more. </p>

<p>There&#39;s these award shows once a year, where they hand their own buddies a pat on the back. Nobody cares about those any more. Even the Oscars, who cares. The news is buried hours later. Everybody&#39;s busy doing other things. </p>

<p>Nobody even cares about mass shootings any more. That&#39;s buried hours later. </p>

<p>The famous people are really taking a hit in recent decades. The musicians had it bad when CD&#39;s stopped selling. Rock is dead. The hip hop guys are still doing ok but I betcha they can&#39;t afford to live the pimping gangsta lifestyle like you see in those videos. Everybody famous is broke. The price of houses is ridiculous in recent decades. These famous people who used to be famous in previous decades can barely afford their lifestyle. They&#39;re all miserable. </p>

<p>Not too many artists are coming out with exciting new tunes that you go wow and your buddies tell you to check it out. Most people will be into whatever fragmented genre and don&#39;t really hear the mainstream stuff these days. </p>

<p>Think of who&#39;s famous.. often they got famous before the mid 2000&#39;s. This is around the time people got smart phones. You had a few of those younger pop stars making it big around that time but these days it&#39;s calmed right down. Those ones are getting close or over 30 and &quot;done&quot;.  Not a whole hell of a lot of new ones that the general public would know about. </p>

<p>Something fishy is going on with the famous people. How about the movies. What does well these days. So many movies that keep coming out. It&#39;s not like the previous generations where you&#39;d know about these big movies. You can check what&#39;s coming out but most people tune out from what&#39;s going on. Theaters are doing about as well as the newspaper industry. Those Marvel movies are doing ok but not too many new exciting ones you hear about. People are even starting to tune out from those Marvel ones and the Star Wars.</p>

<p>Then you have the CGI. People yawn at it these days. Nothing stimulates them. They&#39;re acting on a lot of green screen. They&#39;re replacing actors with CGI. Those guys are still doing voice work for animated ones. But the future is not good for them either. Eventually they&#39;ll be completely replaced and their voices synthesized. Same thing with the pop singers. </p>

<p>It&#39;s like all these famous people, the actors, the musicians are being &quot;phased out&quot;. Perhaps they want to replace them with CGI and synthetic computer generated stuff, it seems. The singing too. </p>

<p>What it seems like is going on in recent years, is these famous people you admired growing up, they&#39;re being shot down. Your idol is a &quot;bad guy&quot;. </p>

<p>You have all this witch hunting going on too, always looking for the next to take down. Then the sponsors ditch whoever after. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on but you know these illuminati guys control all those entertainment outlets. TV, the movies, the singers. They choose who gets famous. Seems like things are changing. They&#39;re tearing those celebs down. Less are becoming famous. </p>

<p>Something&#39;s going on. You can picture these Illuminati guys behind closed doors, planning things. Well, what are they doing? What their purpose here. What do they want? What&#39;s the end result later? This &quot;new world order&quot;. Seems like they want less famous people, and those who are, if they&#39;re bad, it gets uncovered. Seems like a lot are corrupt. Your hero was a bad guy and you though he was good.</p>

<p>These media outlets, if they didn&#39;t want a story happening, you know it wouldn&#39;t be. Seemed like the pizzagate stuff was kinda hush-hush and they didn&#39;t want that sort of thing being known. But even then, if you heard about it in the news, it&#39;s because they want it that way. Not sure of the purpose of that. The whole incident was the tip of the iceberg of how these high level politicians are devil worshipers and do nasty things with kids because of the devil worshiping. What&#39;s up with that? Seems like more people you admire, but these guys, the majority of the public voted them in. Wasn&#39;t just some pop star with talent. Something was different with that.. but it seems more like uncovering and tarnishing those politicians. </p>

<p>Seems like a bit of a similar thing with tarnishing those famous entertainment people. How about African American role models for the kids? Think of Bill Cosby.. or OJ back then. Who knows but people used to like them back in the late 70&#39;s. How about Michael Jackson, the kids. Whitney Houston, Prince did well in the 80&#39;s, later go down from drugs. How about Kanye being 50M in debt and having a meltdown on stage. </p>

<p>What are you talking about here with how these shenanigans would be to draw your attention away from something else. Well, how about all those TV stations, you could watch those instead of doing what? Uncovering who these Illuminati guys are. </p>

<p>I think anything you see on TV or in the news, all the politics, the wars, you can follow that and nothing ever changes. It&#39;s like those who watch sports. You&#39;re busy with that. It&#39;s like those who play video games. The smart phone clickers. Busy with that instead of uncovering the evil puppet master, wizard of Oz behind the curtain. </p>

<p>You have to shut off all that media distraction. Even the politics, if you vote whichever way, it won&#39;t change the outcome. Either party are going to bankrupt all the countries. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t waste your time being a sucker to their distractions. What you want to be doing is figuring out how to get big money so you can fix the problems in the world. Win at business and beat them at their own game. This is what they don&#39;t want you to be doing. Having power. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what the deal is with the price of houses in recent decades. You&#39;d think the government would say, naw, a house can&#39;t just keep going up in price. Land would cost, what for your great grand children? </p>

<p>How the hell is somebody supposed to set up a business to compete against Goliath later in the future? I&#39;m way more concerned about that than some dumbass celeb on TV. Inflation, the cost of everything going up. Less jobs, robots taking over. People having less money. </p>

<p>Who cares about stupid celebs or politicians who never fix the problems in the world. Those are the things we should be networking together to fix. Not falling for their bait and being a sucker to all the distractions they want you to watch with all your spare time after work. </p>

<p>What&#39;s this &quot;ideology&quot; though that you talk about. They&#39;re taking these famous people you admired and now, oh they&#39;re perverts. If you liked them, then these perverted acts might not be as bad as you thought, before you found out your hero was doing them the whole time. And lots of your heroes too. Who knows what the purpose is.. but this is the observation of what&#39;s going on. We don&#39;t know the &quot;why&quot;, yet. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post, and I agree with everything. I&#39;ve spent 15 years exploring the rabbit holes after taking the red pill. At the very bottom of the hole, or at the top of power structure is luciferians, pedophiles, and human sacrifice, and it&#39;s all done to get and hold power. If you want to reach that level, you also have to adopt those practices. This is big in the banking system which controls the money which controls all the industries. This happens in Hollywood also and it&#39;s a way to keep them under control and gain leverage on them. The &quot;why&quot; if you want to know is to defile innocence and destroy all life, and I&#39;m not joking. You can hear the top level people who left those groups explain in detail what goes on at the top along with why they do it.</p>

<p>Check out ex-banker Ronald Bernard. He was a rising star in that world, but he was asked to start participating in ritual child sacrifice he bailed, but not before already being exposed to it all. Listen to this interview if you want to understand the why.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QQew48O7Jo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QQew48O7Jo</a></p>

<p>Another thing related to the the top of this sub would be this:</p>

<p>According to U.S. Naval Intelligence, the real force behind the purge of Hollywood has been the NSA, which has been quietly informing victims of pederasts that they can provide proof to back up their accusations against their tormentors.</p>

<p>Now that Washington, D.C. politicians, academia, and Hollywood are being purged of satanic Khazarian gangster control, we assume the medical and pharmacidical establishments will be next on the list.  A heavy-duty raid on the American Medical Association headquarters, with a special focus on cancer-related information, would be a very good place to start.  On this front, we understand that Bill Gates has already been singing like a canary under special custody.</p>

<p>It’s certain that the war against the genocidal satan-worshipping Khazarian mob is not over yet, but it is no longer possible to deny that they are losing and doomed.  They have been warned to “surrender or die.”  We expect both to happen in increasing quantities before the nightmare ends and humanity is freed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did a good chunk of research over a couple decades. This is one thing I can no longer fall for any more, being distracted by the distractions. I have to work towards getting out of the hole. I have 370 business ideas I thought of over the past couple decades. I have do what will get those started. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t spend time being distracted with the conspiracy stuff any more. </p>

<p>I know what you&#39;re talking about though. In recent seasons I wondered &quot;why&quot; about the Illuminati and the devil worshiping. It wasn&#39;t just this satanic stuff just for kicks. It seemed to lead to &quot;the Archon&quot;. Over the summer was researching those topics reading text files from bibliotecapleyades.net. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have time for any of it any more. Everybody here in r / conspiracy this is what they do with all their spare time. It&#39;s similar to those who fall for the sucker bait of the distractions. Things like politics, TV sports fans. </p>

<p>I got a hunch of what may be occurring behind the scenes in the world. Now it&#39;s time to work towards getting boots on the ground. Big money and power so you can stop these guys. </p>

<p>The research is like schooling. Graduated and time to move on to taking down the big, bad boys. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>purge of Hollywood</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This seems to be what&#39;s going on. How about those directors, Roman Polanski, Woody Allen. How about Kubrick.. he wasn&#39;t a pervert but something creeped him right out and never set foot back on US soil after &quot;something&quot;. He even recreated an NY street scene setting from scratch instead of coming back there. Something&#39;s &quot;fishy&quot; about his deal. Then he was trying to tell people something with Eyes wide shut. Croaks, and that flick was &quot;edited out&quot;. You can bet it got into the devil worshiping. They didn&#39;t like that. </p>

<p>Now you have the Miramax guy and this other director, seems to fall into this category of directors doing down. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Good &#39;ol NSA. lol. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>which has been quietly informing victims of pederasts that they can provide proof to back up their accusations against their tormentors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Only way to &quot;win&quot; is to never get involved with any of their shenanigans. Yesterday I happened to think about Dave Chappelle.  Something creeped him out about Hollywood and seems similar to Kubric not wanting to hang out there in L.A. Any of these celebs who don&#39;t live in LA or NY, ya gotta wonder about them. I&#39;d look into any of those. Prince lived in Minneapolis. </p>

<p>Now that Washington, D.C. politicians, academia, and Hollywood are being purged of satanic Khazarian gangster control</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t read books dude.. trying to picture stuff you&#39;re talking about.. Plus, this is taking time away of my day where I have to do chores, then try to work on experimental tunes a bit each day. I have to axe reddit eh. It&#39;s &quot;sucker bait&quot; they want you to fall for. It&#39;s the opposite direction of where I have to go. </p>

<p>ok so what are you talking about here.. sounds like an Illuminati new world order plan. I wish I could have time to check out stuff you&#39;re talking about but I&#39;m beyond that, eh. I can&#39;t do it anymore. Got dishes I&#39;m in the middle of in the other room. Came back to look something up. I have to get to sleep too for work. </p>

<p>This is a huge thing going on to everybody, the accumulated sleep deprivation. Plus can&#39;t keep up with chores. Nevermind any of the working towards getting out of the hole. </p>

<p>ok so what are you talking about here.. </p>

<p>Anybody who&#39;s in the news or famous people, I don&#39;t trust any of &#39;em. I can&#39;t stand politics. I just know they&#39;re all corrupt. Best to throw out the TV, tune them out, turn it off and get to work on getting out of the hole. Anybody famous, I don&#39;t trust any of &#39;em. Any shenanigans or conspiracy stuff anybody &quot;uncovered&quot;, I don&#39;t trust any of it. It&#39;s all sucker bait they throw out. They want you wasting time on that. </p>

<p>I just know there&#39;s deficiencies and problems in the world, and nobody&#39;s fixing it. I don&#39;t care who, why or whatever&#39;s going on.. it&#39;s up to us to clean up this mess. </p>

<p>So I don&#39;t know who the hell a </p>

<p>Is, I don&#39;t have time for it. lol. I gotta get back to the dishes. In the meantime, if you&#39;re wondering about those business ideas, can get to them from funturistic.com which forwards to my youtube channel music videos. Any block of time I&#39;m working on next generation audio. Gonna take my time, over the whole winter, working on one audio track. I&#39;m gonna try to make &quot;wow product&quot;. I gotta get back to the dishes though.. sorry dude, I just don&#39;t have time for the conspiracy stuff any more. It&#39;s taking time away from that. I know how whatever stories are out there, may be bullshit and I&#39;m not falling for the sucker bait any more. </p>

<p>This is what led me to the Archon stuff.. I was wondering the why with the devil worshiping. It&#39;s not just for &quot;kicks&quot; to be evil. Was researching that Archon stuff all summer. In the middle of it. That got interesting about how they were created. Check out this page. </p>

<p>Looking into this &quot;Ronald Bernard&quot; guy.. gonna take a look at what he has to say. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to reach that level, you also have to adopt those practices. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think you can beat these guys. Don&#39;t get involved with any of them. They try to sucker you in with the money and sex, that&#39;s their bait. Beat them at their own game, the business. They&#39;re all corrupt with greed. Keep your companies private and beat them. Why prices are high is because of all the middlemen. You want to own every step of the processes yourself. I&#39;d start with cheap meat. All you&#39;d need to do is get a farm and raise livestock. They eat the grass that grows for free. The animals and meat are then free. Where&#39;s your cost coming from, heavy equipment and petrol. You can work around the costs of fuel with how alcohol can be a gas. Grow the weeds or cattails with the farming stuff. Flex fuel vehicles. You&#39;d want to get into heavy equipment manufacturing yourself. Why&#39;s it cost so much for heavy equipment, semi trailers. You don&#39;t need all that computer gizmo stuff in there. You can go back to the basics like the 1950&#39;s motorized equipment. Get into the mining to make the metal. All of this, you want to own every step and never rely on anybody. Eventually you get your costs down to below theirs for products. </p>

<p>I&#39;m telling you, you can beat these guys. Too many middlemen taking their cut. I get into all of this in those business ideas. What you don&#39;t wanna do is get involved and be &quot;buddies&quot; with any of these celebs. What I&#39;d want to get into first is the 24hr drive thru pizza slices restaurants. But your cost will be high because you have to get your ingredients from suppliers. Things seem to keep pointing to getting your own farm going. Start with the meat. Maybe make your own cheap meat little stores. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to reach that level, you also have to adopt those practices. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I will try to reach this level without adopting their practices or getting involved with any of them. What you want is to be totally independent. What sucks is taxes. You&#39;d almost need your own little country. Be the guy who gets the robots going. Then you don&#39;t pay wages. What&#39;s a product, it&#39;s things like mined rocks to make the metal. I don&#39;t like petrol though because you have to dig for it and always &quot;need&quot; others. </p>

<p>The key is always the scientific research. New propulsion methods. Things like beating the pharmaceutical companies and figuring out cures. Fuck them and their pills that never cure anything. </p>

<p>If you can get the robots going, have them go do the mining off planet. Come back with the gigantic space ships like in sci-fi movies. None of it was made here and you don&#39;t have to pay the man taxes. So all that could be &quot;free&quot;. </p>

<p>Anyways.. gonna check your links in the days ahead, research some of the things you said.. but any of this is on the back burner with blocks of time. Can only do this while I&#39;m having a bite to eat, then resume next meal. Plus I gotta work a night job and get rested up and do chores. Plus I gotta work on tunes somewhere with any blocks of time. Can&#39;t do it today cause was fucking around on reddit. lol. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They way the news is reporting this stuff definitely has a purpose behind it. There is certainly a hypernormalisation element to the reporting of this recent unraveling of some of Hollywood&#39;s dirty secrets. The whole &quot;#metoo&quot; campaign seemed a very convenient way of making this situation about all men and &quot;toxic masculinity&quot; when what it is really about is psychopaths and narcissists with huge amounts of power. Also, I think the purpose of the accusations against Louis CK being broadcast so heavily is to muddy the waters. This a way of dividing people, a way to get people to suddenly change their tone and say &quot;well, this isn&#39;t that bad&quot;, precisely because it isn&#39;t that bad. It also allows people to use the term &quot;witch hunt&quot; disparagingly against this event and not seem completely absurd. It suddenly gets people to stand up and defend a sex abuser, against the people who seem too hardline and who treat him like he&#39;s on the level of Weinstein or Spacey. It plants the idea that maybe we&#39;re going too far with this witch hunt, and now people are getting a bit too much hatred and notoriety for things which are bad, but not that bad. We think of all the things we&#39;ve done, all the kinks we have and think &quot;well, I don&#39;t want people to think I&#39;m bad too&quot;. This seems to me to be a deliberate attempt to get people to retreat and turn away from this initial unravelling of Hollywood&#39;s darkside. I expect to see the media most heavy reporting on cases which are bad, but not <em>that</em> bad, all for largely the same reasons that they reported the accusations against Louis so heavily. </p>

<p>However, there are good people in the media, even good people who have power. These people, no matter what, will be trying to get the really bad shit reported. They&#39;ve been successful with Spacey and Weinstein, and they did it with Saville previously, so let&#39;s just hope they can continue.  </p>

<p>Epstein should still be rotting in jail. The state defended him rather than prosecute him.</p>

<p>Epstein could bring down some HUGE names. </p>

<p>The “circled names” in the Holy Grail black book of contacts were people who Alfredo Rodriguez thought were engaging in sex with underage girls. Alfredo Rodriguez was the house manager, or butler, for Epstein’s house in Palm Beach and he would not know what Epstein and his vastly larger circle of pedophile friends were doing around the world. Therefore, the “circled list” of pedophiles below is by no means inclusive - not by a long shot. Alfredo Rodriguez was the one who would have to clean up Epstein’s sex toys after the orgies and molestations were over.</p>

<pre><code>        Here are some of the names Alfredo Rodriguez, now deceased, circled because he thought they were having sex with underage girls:
</code></pre>

<p>1) Flavio Briatore - estimated net worth $150 million. Forumula One racing manager <a href="http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/business-executives/flavio-briatore-net-worth/">http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-businessmen/business-executives/flavio-briatore-net-worth/</a> </p>

<p>2) Jean Luc Brunel - an epic pedophile in the modeling industry and one of the closest friends of Jeffrey Epstein. Should be in jail for 25 years. <a href="http://jezebel.com/5603638/meet-the-modeling-agent-who-trafficked-underage-girls-for-sex">http://jezebel.com/5603638/meet-the-modeling-agent-who-trafficked-underage-girls-for-sex</a> </p>

<p>3) Bruce King, former governor of New Mexico, who died in 2009 at age 85. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/us/14king.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/14/us/14king.html</a></p>

<p>4) Bill Richardson, former governor of New Mexico. <a href="http://www.billrichardson.com/about-bill/biography">http://www.billrichardson.com/about-bill/biography</a> </p>

<p>5) Ehud Barak, former prime minister of Israel - <a href="http://www.billrichardson.com/about-bill/biographyMy">http://www.billrichardson.com/about-bill/biographyMy</a> sources say this man is a big time pedophile.</p>

<p>6) Alan Dershowitz              According to an Undisputed Statement of Fact filed by the victims’ lawyers in April of 2011, “Epstein’s housekeeper Alfredo Rodriguez testified that Dershowitz stayed at Epstein’s house during the years when Epstein was assaulting minor females on a daily basis” and “Dershowitz was at Epstein’s house at times when underage females where there being molested by Epstein.”</p>

<pre><code>        For me the question is not did Alan Dershowitz statutorily rape Virginia Roberts numerous times, but rather what other underage girls was Dershowitz having sex with.
</code></pre>

<p>7) Courney Love bisexual singer - <a href="http://www.nndb.com/people/389/000022323/">http://www.nndb.com/people/389/000022323/</a></p>

<p>9) Joseph Rueda (wife is Floven) </p>

<p>10) Ghislaine Maxwell - pedophilic girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein. She is the one who snared a 15 year old Virginia Roberts into the Epstein pedophile web in 1998. She is also very good friends with Bill Clinton who invited her to Chelsea’s wedding in 2010. She is the daughter of Robert Maxwell. She also pandered Virginia Roberts to Prince Andrew. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghislaine_Maxwell</a>  </p>

<p>11) Alberto Pinto (1945-2012) - French high end interior designer 1) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Pinto_(interior_designer)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alberto_Pinto_(interior_designer)</a> 2) his work <a href="http://www.albertopinto.com/1en.aspx">http://www.albertopinto.com/1en.aspx</a> </p>

<p>14) Les Wexner. Huge Republican PAC donor.  Held fundraiser event for Mitt Romney. Very close to Jeffrey Epstein and gave him huge amounts of money, presumably for money and investment management. Both Les Wexner and Jeffrey Epstein are ardent pedophiles with a deep sexual thirst for underage girls. Wexner, owner of the Limited and Victoria’s Secrets, has a lot of Republican friends. Epstein has a deep well of Democratic friends. Estimated net worth - $6 billion - huge retailing fortune - <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2014/09/30/victorias-other-secret-the-low-key-billionaire-behind-the-lingerie-giant/">http://www.forbes.com/sites/danalexander/2014/09/30/victorias-other-secret-the-low-key-billionaire-behind-the-lingerie-giant/</a> </p>

<pre><code>        Some people think Les Wexner has had a man murdered in Ohio. I am referring to the Arthur Shapiro case - http://freepress.org/article/dispatch-goes-re-kill-arthur-shapiro  Gave $65 million to Ohio State University.

<p>15) Eric Gany - I think but am not sure this refers to Hewlett Bay partner Eric Gany <a href="http://thebollard.com/2008/04/24/pingrees-take-tops-1-million-but-at-what-cost/">http://thebollard.com/2008/04/24/pingrees-take-tops-1-million-but-at-what-cost/</a> Big time Democratic donor, so it is probably the right one: <a href="http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/eric-gany.asp?cycle=10">http://www.campaignmoney.com/political/contributions/eric-gany.asp?cycle=10</a></p>

NYMag: “After word of the investigation got back to Epstein, through his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York decorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoettle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized a dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-shaped soaps.” </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me give you a little tidbit I learned from a friend who was up until recently a high powered lawyer in the Virgin Islands. Epstein actually owns two islands in the Virgin Islands.</p>

<p>The people in the Virgin Island obviously do not like Epstein, and know what is up. They didn&#39;t want him having two islands. Epstein engaged the services of another lawyer (not my friend), to help him purchase this second island.</p>

<p>They used a Qatari holding company and a number of front companies to hide the purchase of the island. The people of the Virgin Islands eventually figured out what was up, but by then it was too late.</p>

<p>Epstein now has two islands in the Virgin Islands. We know about the infamous &quot;Orgy Island,&quot; but what is the story with the second island? Is this for hiding records? A more secure location? Something else? I don&#39;t know. All I know is he has two islands in the Virgin Islands, one with more hidden ownership. The high-ups in the Virgin Islands know what&#39;s up, so I&#39;m sure to the feds it&#39;s not completely hidden.</p>

<p>Still, there must be advantages to having two islands. Perhaps it makes it more difficult to serve warrants? Have the action take place on one, but have the information on the others? I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m saying if what I do know, and that it&#39;s got to be something sketch. I mean, it does involve Qatar.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting information.</p>

<p>The stand out for me is that you mention the feds like they are going to sweep in and save the day. In reality, they are not. They have been aware, for some time, of the pedophiles in our government, and have done nothing. Check out the following videos ...very informative.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a31o6AfjJw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5a31o6AfjJw&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>It seems pretty obvious that whatever is going on on these islands, they are recording it. Who is going to talk if everybody can be black mailed. </p>

<p>Look at the visitors to that island that we know about. Multi-national, bi-partisan, royal, political  .... Clinton AND Trump. I don&#39;t understand who is going to pull the rug out from under who.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to sweep in and save the day. I just imagine that someone like Epstein is smart enough to think if possible eventualities. One island might have the orgies, but the other has the little black book and any other records he needs to keep. Close enough to be useful for him, but should something go south, it&#39;s outside of a search warrant, and save&#39;s his ass and that of his clients. At worse they get booked for what&#39;s on the island presently. With splitting among two islands (one secret), then the Orgy island isn&#39;t a continuing enterprise, it&#39;s just a one time deal.</p>

<p>... or ... yeah, that&#39;s where he keeps the blackmail information to prevent the island (and him) for every going down. No sneaking guest can get to that information as it&#39;s on another island.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware there&#39;s little chance of Epstein getting in trouble. I&#39;m aware pedophile are high up. What I&#39;m saying is think about this almost as an &quot;Insurance Island&quot; that contains the Insurance/Blackmail files. Would be a bad idea to keep it all in one place.</p>

<p>There are ALWAYS issues being ignored by the MSM irregardless of if there is a big breaking story or not. The question is just, what are those issues? I think one of the biggest overlooked stories over the past few years is definitely the war in Yemen. This is a no brainer as the US is feeding the Saudis all the munitions they need to utterly destroy their neighbors who have ideological and religious differences. The situation in the middle east has been a power grab over the last decades and we know that the Saudis are seeking regional hegemony by any means necessary.</p>

<p>This is just some Game of Thrones shit. Two or more factions full of Les Grossman clones using the media as a weapon against their rivals to get more money and power for themselves as individuals.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying there aren&#39;t any social-engineering-type Hollywood conspiracies that are real. But it&#39;s likely most of the bigwigs in Hollywood are too busy, rich, and self-satisfied to give a thought to micromanaging what the plebs are thinking about.</p>

<p>Women won&#39;t even realize what they&#39;ve lost until it&#39;s too late. Worse, this is largely a war of words, which is their strong suit, but they&#39;re too caught up in glass ceilings and a culture of victimization to recognize the on going battle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. I think they did their research and found out that pizzagate is still something that a lot of us, especially the recently woke, will let our emotions get the better of us over. So they are going to use these limited hang outs to dangle a carrot in front of us so we invest our time and effort spreading the word and investigating their red herrings.</p>

<p>Not that these victims don&#39;t deserve justice, but the way the MSM is covering these sexual scandals is starting to seem like a disingenuous distraction.</p>

<p>So what I am trying to say is be aware of how some of these conspiracies can make you feel and don&#39;t be tricked into putting on the tunnel vision for any one of these scandals. It&#39;s only a matter of time before enough people start to notice the patterns and start to wake up to the truth. </p>

There are so many allegations of much more sinister shit, for them to not throw anyone under the bus would be trying to maintain the facade that none of this happens which is much harder to believe for the public.

    <div class="md"><p>I really hope I am wrong. . .but I think it could be a limited hangout. Please hear me out before you call me an apologist. </p>

<p>Has anyone else noticed that almost all the accusations are against either adults or around age 15 onwards? </p>

<p>Now as bad as the accusations are, almost none of them are young children. Yes, they are still predators with predatory behaviour, but we all know for an absolute fact that the truly sick pedos target prepubescent boys and girls. And yet so far almost none of them have been outed. </p>

<p>I know this is gonna sound wrong, but most men are attracted to young women, just go on any porn search engine and sort by popular. WOMEN though, not young girls I can&#39;t stress this enough.</p>

<p>You see what I mean. That isn&#39;t to say they should do anything without consent. They shouldn&#39;t even be trying it on when the have the power differential. They should still be prosecuted to the full extent because they are still rapists and sexual abusers.</p>

<p>But what I don&#39;t want people to think is  &quot;gee I didn&#39;t realize that Hollywood was full of preverted old men that like <strong>teens</strong>&quot;. I want people to see it for how fucking bad it truly is, I want the public to realize it&#39;s full of men (and women) that want actual <strong>children</strong>.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t want the public to stop digging that&#39;s all. It&#39;s goes a lot deeper then people think it does and I suspect  TPTB wants us to think that the worst it gets is the likes of Louie CK or Weinstein, when in my opinion, they are not even the tip of the iceberg. There are far sicker people in the world who are being totally ignored. That is why I think it&#39;s a limited hangout.</p>
