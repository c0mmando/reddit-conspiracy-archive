        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The &#39;it&#39; im referring to in the title will be anything and every thing conspiracy related.  When u dig deep enough into 911, kennedy, shadow governments, the united nations, pizza gate, the catholic church, charles manson, mk ultra, the mormon church, the united nations,  evolution, islam, pentacostalism, hinduism, the statue of liberty, freemasons...it will all point back to a form of worship of molech or baal or semiramus or athena...all pointing back to the tower of babel...and ultimately just a form of satanism.</p>

<p>Yet...when this forum finds this out...they dont connect that the bible is real...that &#39;they live&#39; and know it...and that we should read the bible...EXAMINE the evidence of its historical, scientific, geographic claims and look at the life if Jesus and figure out if he was either 
A) a liar
B) a lunatic who didnt realize what he was saying
C) Lord...the Son of God </p>

<p>and ultimately follow him.  If the powers that be knew all this...then its no wonder they would destroy knowledge of this in the education system...the media...and everywhere.</p>

<p>Examine the evidence people...start by reading the bible again...read from john till the end...get a commentary or google every verse and see if what they are saying is true.</p>

<p>If you care about intellectual arguments...here are a couple videos that even atheist scholars would be challenged by about the bible and the proof of Jesus resurrection:</p>

<p>If you care about conspiracy videos and dot connecting of every conspiracy and how it all goes back to the bible...heres a series called know your enemy that connects every dot:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Church are the only real Christian Churches. Anyone outside these is not Christian, but a sectarian who will not be saved. It&#39;s only the ego, inspired by the charms of Satan, that claims otherwise. Spreading false teaching against Christ&#39;s very body will see you first class in Hell. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why wouldnt they?  The roman catholic church came about because christiany was on the rise but the people of rome loved their pagan gods.  So the non christian false religious leaders decided to keep their cash flow from worshipping of the oagan god of everything ( they had a god of the sea...a god of the land...a god of the forest..a god of the stars) they said lets adopt some of christianity and change the term god to saint of...and have a patron saint of the sea....saint of the forest...saint of the stars...that way they can rebrand.</p>

<p>It worked.   </p>

<p>So its just paganism..worship of mary is worship of semiramus....and all ties back to the tower of babel.</p>

<p>Go ask a historian at any university if what i just said was true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The evil priests and bishops and popes throughout history are burning in hellfire for eternity. Jesus said &quot;thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build MY church, AND THE GATES OF HELL SHALL NOT PREVAIL AGAINST IT&quot;. This isn&#39;t some bibliographic or technical point. The apostolic succession does not lie outside Catholic and Orthodox. This is THE CHURCH. If you are blasphemous enough to mar Christ&#39;s legacy with the sins of Satan&#39;s
 children who have plagued it, you are grossly in error. You have elevated yourself to an arbiter. I Pray for your souls, that you might see the error of your ways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is your evidence that its been chooped up and edited?  On the contrary we have over 5000 manuscripts from the 1st and 2nd century from the new testament where you yourself can go and research and see if these manuscripts differ in ANY way to whats written in the canonized bible.
The evidence for the bible literally outweighs the historical evidence of any ancient book by far....yet whybare we not taught it in schools? At the very least the new testament is way better and more evidenced than any history book taught in elementary and high school.  </p>

<p>Watch the first 2 videos in the title thread and do research.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just by saying sky-daddy you kind of show your ignorance of The actual philosophy of Christendom, ironic or not. Obviously God being the ultimate Creator means he&#39;s above all and  so he&#39;s outside of things like the universe, time and beyond the realm of imagination. He is the first cause of being, contingency and motion.</p>

<p>Now go from the philosophical neseccity of a Creator and do your research into judeo-christian history. If God is truth than he must be homogenous with the truths of philosophy or science(which ultimately find their truth in him). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not Catholic, but I went to a Catholic School when I was little, and I went to Catholic Sunday school for awhile after that, so I am familiar with basic Catholic teachings. I find the &quot;Catholics are Satanists&quot; to be weird. When I was younger, I associated with Mormons, and they didn&#39;t seem Satanic to me at all.  I have also associated with several cults, some of which were/are Satanic, and they were very different from the Catholics and Mormons. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my opinion it&#39;s a classic case of missing the forest for the trees. As you said there is a serious satanist/freemasonic/sodomite infiltration in the Church, and possibly has been for many decades - I think probably going stronger as time passes and real Catholics don&#39;t speak up for fear.</p>

<p>I myself have become very jaded with anything coming from the Vatican nowadays. But that still doesn&#39;t make sola scriptura a good idea. I think reading the Early Church Fathers and some of the Orthodox writings dispels the idea of the Church being Satanic in essence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bear with me while I attempt to articulate this…</p>

<p>After all of my years being bound by this reality, If there is only one thing I can say is &quot;true&quot;, it&#39;s the ignorance of our species. </p>

<p>Every so-called &quot;religion&quot; purports to have  knowledge of the &quot;truth&quot;. Upon critical examination of what&#39;s possible to know to be &quot;true&quot;, the fallacy of man becomes ever apparent. </p>

<p>Thus, knowing the hearts of men, having experienced it firsthand, I find the creations of man to be wanting... All so-called &quot;religions&quot; become suspect. </p>

<p>Having said all of that, the Bible in all of its forms was most certainly written by men. See above for the &quot;truth&quot; of man…</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s true, the world is controlled by two forces, the people of the light and the people of darkness. The ruler of darkness is called Satan, people of the light have a ruler called God. It’s puzzling that people know the name of Satan, the ruler of the darkness, But have forgotten the name of God. Jesus told us we must pray this way at Matthew 6:9 Our father in the heavens let your name be sanctified. The greatest conspiracy ever perpetuated upon the people of the earth, is making people forget the name of the only true God, Jehovah. Jeremiah 23:27 tells us they intend to make the people forget my name by the dreams they relate to one another just at their fathers forgot my name because of Baal, and forgiveness mankind has done in a large way. The Bible says if you add or take away anything from the word of God you should be cursed. The name of God, The Tetragrammaton , is in the Bible over 7000 times. All through the Bible we are told of the importance of Gods name. To forget his name and never speak it or talk about it is a grave error. Joel 2:30 yet says and I will give wonders in the heavens and on the earth blood and fire in columns of smoke, the sun will be turned into darkness in the moon into blood before the coming of the great in all inspiring day of Jehovah, and everyone who calls on the name of Jehovah will be saved. The Christ emphatically directed allOf us to praise the name of his father. The greatest conspiracy ever. Have a good day brother is a Friday.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am going to preface this by saying there is truth in almost every religious text I&#39;ve laid read faithful translations of aldous huxley summed it up well in his &quot;perennial philosophy&quot; in that there IS a golden thread of truth and love that can&#39;t be edited out and is there for anyone to pick up. But  I am speaking specifically of the king James version of the bible which is the most widely sold / read / used in Christian history. The King James Bible has undergone three revisions since it was created by roughly 50 scholars in 1611, over these three revisions there were more than 100,000 changes. You need only look at all the denominations of Christianity for disputes in interpretations of Christ&#39;s message. It&#39;s hardly a unified religion with one true bible. Which would you like for me to pick from? The kJV, the Mormons, the Presbyterians,  the unitarian,  the catholics, the seventh day adventist,  russian orthodox , nag hammadi,  the Lutheran translation which predates kJV by 100 years? The Greek version they were translated from? The Aramaic version the Greek one was translated from? Or the sanskrit version he Aramaic one was derived from? Or all the councils through the years that predated the kJV where they picked the books most useful to continuing their powers of control? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thats not how translations work.  Its not a game of telephone where you translate from the latest version.  Do you know how meticulous the scribes were when they copied the ancient manuscripts.  Some scribes would wash their hands...pray and write one letter a day until it was complete.</p>

<p>The NT has 5000 manuscripts and versions are based on those copies from the 1st and 2nd century.   The only differences are minor spellings of names.  If you think a version is wrongbyou can literally look up in 10 seconds on google what the original greek, aramaic or hebrew word was and figure out how close the translation is.  Or you could physically go to the museum and look at the manuscripts.</p>

<p>New version are all based on the copies of the manuscripts, not based on the latest one.   This thinking that it is like a game of telephone is one of the many popular myths that tries to discredit...but i challenge you to go to any university and see if what im saying is true</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is the game of telephone which is the problem. If you can skip the telephone and talk someone in person, which is better? There are some ideas that can&#39;t be expressed in English,  Latin,  Greek,  Chinese,  etc, so compromises are made which generally get the message across but can be used to manipulate the message in subtle ways over the centuries as well. If i had the time to be a omni linguist to verify these things myself, I would, but going by the admissions by translators in many of the books I&#39;ve read, sometimes truth is lost in translation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simply, no. Do more research buddy,  I&#39;m not trying to trash your religion but at least be aware of its formation and history. The first complete new testament wasn&#39;t found till 400 ad , because the council which patched the new testament together didn&#39;t form until then! Before this point what texts were accepted by Christians varied widely. The texts you get today are the ones that were selected for their ability to control a population. Some of jesus&#39; s most important work was disregarded during those times, and I encourage all true Christians to throw out their trash bible and start looking for the other places jesus dropped his truth!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>See man this is why your soul is going to take lifetimes to progress, I&#39;ve given you the keys to a hundred different avenues of knowledge and you&#39;d still cling to your narrow minded beliefs about the new testament, why do gnostic and coptic versions of the scripture differ so greatly?  The king James Bible is a tool of control. I doubt you even read the link I posted (though I watched your shitty videos). Think about it , first copies found 100-400 years AFTER his death, would you trust a modern day story written about someone from 1917?1817? 1717? 1617? Hell the Mormon book only happened 200 years ago and it&#39;s already passed the point of provability. Anyways doubt you read any of this, have fun spreading lies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Baal means &quot;Lord&quot;. The name of God is removed from the Bible and replaced by LORD (Baal). Christians are told to worship Jesus as Lord (Baal).</p>

<p>Blood sacrifices to Molech, Baal, and others were adopted by Israel as a form of worship to the Lord (Baal). The prophets up to Jesus denounced this evil blood spilling taking place at the Temple of the Lord (Baal). They were persecuted and killed by the powers of their day.</p>

<p>The &quot;apostle&quot; Saul/Paul was a State agent aligned with the Herodians and priests. He persecuted and killed those that followed Jesus teachings. When this action failed to stop the spread of the way, Saulus infiltrated the community and began to corrupt the teachings of Jesus, presenting a gospel of his own he claimed to receive by divine revelation. In doing so, he emphatically rejected what was taught by those who had learned directly from Jesus. </p>

<p>For example, Paul taught that it was okay to eat animals that had been ritualistically sacrificed to demons. This is condemned by James and Jesus (in Revelation). Paul taught that believing the murder of Jesus was a holy sacrifice, one will not have to face the consequences of his sin. Further, he promoted a mock cannibalism ritual in which believers drink the blood of Jesus and eat his flesh.</p>

<p>Modern Christianity is built upon the false gospel of Paul. Human sacrifice is venerated via the murderous cross, which is presented as an object of worship and love. Baal worship continues covertly. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paul was confirmed as a truth teller by the writings of peter...who names him (2nd peter 3 15).  Eating food sacrificed to idols was a big deal for corinth and some jewish converts...but the food was many times cheaper...so some christiand thought it was ok because they know thatt those were not real at all...not god...just refular meat.  But this made some christians struggle.  Thats why paul said...everything is oermissible...but not eberything is beneficial&#39; 1 co 10 23-33.  Its like me....if i have a superbowl party...and have alcohol at the party...is that sin?  Well...depends...if it can make others sin..maybe i shouldnt serve alcohol.  If i am an alcoholic...then serving alcohol is just unwise and could lead me to sin.</p>

<p>But...if it doesnt make me or others sin....its all good.   </p>

<p>Do u understand?  I can provide more insight if i wasnt clear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Nevertheless, I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin so that they ate food sacrificed to idols...&quot; - Jesus / Revelation</p>

<p>&quot;You are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols,&quot; - James the Just, Brother of Jesus.</p>

<p>Why do you feel Paul&#39;s word is superior to Jesus and James? </p>

<p>Paul is a spouter of lies and false teacher.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That church needed to abstain from food sacrificed to idols because they were sinning when they did that.  </p>

<p>Its like a coach saying to lebron...shoot more.</p>

<p>Then the same coach saying to kobe...shoot less.</p>

<p>Is that a contradiction?  No...different audience need to do different things.  The corinthian struggle was...along with numerous other things...revering meet worshipped to idols.</p>

<p>The bible doesnt contradict...its easy to explain.  Do i need to explain further?</p>

They also seem to miss the fact that every real Christian truth is being persecuted by the same powers - and that everything that Christians oppose (even the things that seem to be only part of &#39;personal choice&#39;) is connected in some way to the Evil being perpetrated by the elites, as a way to corrupt the culture, but they dismiss it as &#39;none of my business&#39; and &#39;that&#39;s not actually connected to anything&#39;.
