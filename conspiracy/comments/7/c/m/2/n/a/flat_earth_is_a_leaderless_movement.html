<p>You said it mate. I&#39;m just saying his username suggests he has a lot of interest in this topic. He doesn&#39;t need to shill on behave of a company he has an agenda of his own. An interest in debunking this shit. </p>

<p>To be honest who can blame him? Just imagine for a second if this is your field and its bullshit. Can&#39;t even...It would be horrific. Even if these guys started to suspect it themselves their pride would make them want to make sure it never got out. </p>

<p>Not even talking about the people (if it is flat) in place to make sure it doesn&#39;t get out. But the average joe scientists. If its flat they&#39;ve wasted so much more time than the flat-earthers.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why when debating this shit they ignore the questions asked, clinging to their own questions they think proves its round. </p>

<p>Four conclusive experiments performed by the top scientists of their day proved that the Sun, Moon and stars revolve around us, and that Earth is the fixed, motionless centre of the universe. </p>

<p>The Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Airy&#39;s Failure and Sagnac experiments scientifically proved Geocentrism and nearly crushed the dying Heliocentric theory until Mr. Einstein came through with his Special Relativity mathematical denial of the proven Aether and philosophically (not scientifically) banished the Aether from study ever since. </p>

<p>These studies and peer reviewed experiments are never covered in any university courses. These conclusive peer-reviewed and repeated scientific results are nowhere debated or denied, merely suppressed and ignored. The fact of the matter is that Geocentrism has been conclusively proven for over a century.</p>

<p>In 1913 Sagnac conducted an experiment to test the speed and constancy of light and proved the existence of the Aether (Disproves relativity) Therefore, The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted using an interferometer clearly demonstrated that the Earth was motionless. The Michelson-Gale experiment detected the Aether/Firmament passing over the surface of the motionless Earth. Airy&#39;s Failure, demonstrated that it is the stars moving relative to a stationary Earth, and not the fast orbiting Earth moving relative to comparatively stationary stars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i already did. the idea of &quot;8 inches per mile squared&quot; is wrong. &quot;8 inches per SQUARE MILE&quot; means that for any one straight plane mile (one line in one direction--&quot;distance&quot;) you would see an overall curve of 8 inches. </p>

<p>dubay asserts that for 100 miles the math finding curve is (8x100)<sup>2.</sup> there is no reason to square anything. this is just a wrong idea. the correct curve (approx) is 800 inches, or 66 feet. 66 feet curve over 100 miles would not be noticeable unless you had a completely smooth plane without any topography. </p>

<p>suspend your belief and think about this one:</p>

<p>Definitely not lol. </p>

<p>Ships disappear bottom first, no amount of zoom will bring back the bottom section of a ship. The only thing that will bring them back is to increase your elevation. This should not work on a FE</p>

Experiment 2 - Gyroscope Proves Earth is Stationary RAW 6 Hrs



Flat Earth Level 9000:
</code></pre>

<p>Four conclusive experiments performed by the top scientists of their day proved that the Sun, Moon and stars revolve around us, and that Earth is the fixed, motionless centre of the universe.</p>

<p>The Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Airy&#39;s Failure and Sagnac experiments scientifically proved Geocentrism and nearly crushed the dying Heliocentric theory until Mr. Einstein came through with his Special Relativity mathematical denial of the proven Aether and philosophically (not scientifically) banished the Aether from study ever since.</p>

<p>These studies and peer reviewed experiments are never covered in any university courses. These conclusive peer-reviewed and repeated scientific results are nowhere debated or denied, merely suppressed and ignored. The fact of the matter is that Geocentrism has been conclusively proven for over a century.</p>

<p>In 1913 Sagnac conducted an experiment to test the speed and constancy of light and proved the existence of the Aether (Disproves relativity) Therefore, The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted using an interferometer clearly demonstrated that the Earth was motionless. The Michelson-Gale experiment detected the Aether/Firmament passing over the surface of the motionless Earth. Airy&#39;s Failure, demonstrated that it is the stars moving relative to a stationary Earth, and not the fast orbiting Earth moving relative to comparatively stationary stars.</p>

Experiment 2 - Gyroscope Proves Earth is Stationary RAW 6 Hrs

Flat Earth Level 9000:
</code></pre>

<p>Four conclusive experiments performed by the top scientists of their day proved that the Sun, Moon and stars revolve around us, and that Earth is the fixed, motionless centre of the universe.</p>

<p>The Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Airy&#39;s Failure and Sagnac experiments scientifically proved Geocentrism and nearly crushed the dying Heliocentric theory until Mr. Einstein came through with his Special Relativity mathematical denial of the proven Aether and philosophically (not scientifically) banished the Aether from study ever since.</p>

<p>These studies and peer reviewed experiments are never covered in any university courses. These conclusive peer-reviewed and repeated scientific results are nowhere debated or denied, merely suppressed and ignored. The fact of the matter is that Geocentrism has been conclusively proven for over a century.</p>

<p>In 1913 Sagnac conducted an experiment to test the speed and constancy of light and proved the existence of the Aether (Disproves relativity) Therefore, The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted using an interferometer clearly demonstrated that the Earth was motionless. The Michelson-Gale experiment detected the Aether/Firmament passing over the surface of the motionless Earth. Airy&#39;s Failure, demonstrated that it is the stars moving relative to a stationary Earth, and not the fast orbiting Earth moving relative to comparatively stationary stars.</p>

Granted globe based science can be in a held in a similar position. Answer me this. Let&#39;s say for sake of argument that the earth is undoubtedly flat, what the agenda for pushing the global theory so hard, what does anyone gain from it?

<p>Lets do a simple thought game. What happens to objects put into a vacuum sealed box? If I put a brick in a box and removed all of the atmosphere in there so there is no other density for the brick to interact with, what happens?</p>

<p>Does the box get lighter? why or why not? </p>

<p>Buoyancy is simple to test for. What happens to objects in a vavuum sealed box? Do they float and is there a change to the weight of the vacuum sealed box? If no to both of those then we know its not density or buoyancy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol, great response. I post flat earth threads too and Jesus if I couldn&#39;t reply the same sometimes.  Hey, can you calculate the complex physics problems I have, to prove your theory?, when if they even had a pic of the earth that was real they could easily prove their own globe. No, it&#39;s up to the flat earthers to solve complex mathematical problems using ball earth theories like a gravitational constant.  Then they say it&#39;s not real because their one little storie problem is ignored. If all they have are a few evidences backed by the mainstream Jesuit psuedo science like &#39;spinning at 1000mph and having water stick like glue because of gravity!&#39; Fucking joke. Then you mention density and buoyancy and it&#39;s like the most foreign concept they have ever heard of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very good. They dont know we love them and don&#39;t want to see them deceived by whatever NASA is doing, for one. And that leads to the Baal Earth deception. Tbh At first I had an issue with the constant brigading and stupidity. Now I have fun with it. You see the same people just different names.</p>

<p>One point I always like to make is to axdress to how FE has been considered a psyop, Though in reality it&#39;s perpetually down voted and brigaded by groupthink.  So you too make a good point, there is no leader. No team of shills putting Flat Earth on the map. They don&#39;t want that.  People also have a hard time getting past the idea that a person on youtube or reddit can more perceptive than the people in labcoats on television ,or in popular science magazines.</p>

<p>I&#39;m all for loving everyone and being helpful and all that. But these bastards don&#39;t play fair, so anyone trying to &quot;debate&quot; politely and fairly is going to come second, every single time.  So the gloves are staying off for now.</p>

<p>Anything Flat Earth related will disappear into oblivion shortly after posting. It&#39;s called forum sliding. They just turn on the swarm of voting bots and all our posts and comments gets downvoted instantly.</p>

<p>For most people, nothing less than some authority on TV telling them the earth is flat will do. And even then, they&#39;ll probably have that person committed to a mental asylum.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No prob man. I usually will say what&#39;s up when I have time to others on this path. I saw this post this morning and it reminded me of the same things I experienced. </p>

<p>I mean yea, it&#39;s perfectly normal for them to brigade these posts and say the most negative and filthy things and completely ignore the premise. I have been called mentally ill by so many idiots I should a reddit trophy by now. I have found some people are more eager than others to be present and derail the thread immediately.  Still others just come by to drop neg after neg while you try to have a normal conversation. In general the arguments are one sided and confined to the ball earth perception.  Einstein&#39;s gravity, Galileo, Copernicus. Three people have formed the basis in everyone&#39;s mind of a false model. People hear these names and think they could never be wrong since they are Geniuses.  But they aren&#39;t. They are propagandists for this deception and all are agents within it, even though Galileo is just a pawn of it. </p>

<p>This of course then gets into our public education.  So they ask, what can be gained by fooling us all? Not realizing the lie has already consumed their perception.  And what &#39;They&#39; gain is control over our minds. Or try to, it has worked for generations.  And from this model of heliocenteism can be gained trillions of dollars and other forms of capitalist enterprises designed to swindle and mind control the public&#39;s consciousness, all while keeping us trapped here with no knowledge of where we are at.</p>

<p>They think there isn&#39;t a shadow government just for this topic. They think there aren&#39;t elite families that go back in our history for thousands of years who stay in power and control through governments. And government is mind control. Maybe they aren&#39;t ready for that. That awareness. So they play dumb and think flat earth is a psyop.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fully agree.</p>

<p>The thing that gets my goat so to speak, is how little interest people have in the world around them. And I honestly do feel sorry for them. We&#39;ve been taught from a very young age to listen, remember and repeat. Most people had no chance at all. </p>

<p>How do we get these people to start thinking and reasoning rationally? Where to even begin?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You think NASA fakery being exposed would really wake some people up. It&#39;s totally obvious I&#39;m sure I don&#39;t have to tell you that.  </p>

<p>So NASA to me is the biggest liars and they mess up so much.  And you will start to see threads here about it again some traction. Then, for example this weekend, reddit had on r/all a very highly Upvoted popular mechanics article debunking the conspiracy of a fake moon landing.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s a war. It&#39;s like, you can make some ground here, but then the propaganda gets thicker and more trolls appear and it&#39;s like starting over almost.  </p>

<p>As time goes on we will find better ways to present this but NASA is so fake it can&#39;t be ignored so I think it&#39;s our best bet to at least wake a few of these mind controlled up. Little by little we get there.</p>

And from this model of heliocenteism can be gained trillions of dollars and other forms of capitalist enterprises designed to swindle and mind control the public&#39;s consciousness, all while keeping us trapped here with no knowledge of where we are at.</p>

<p>They think there isn&#39;t a shadow government just for this topic. They think there aren&#39;t elite families that go back in our history for thousands of years who stay in power and control through governments. And government is mind control.

<p>Four conclusive experiments performed by the top scientists of their day proved that the Sun, Moon and stars revolve around us, and that Earth is the fixed, motionless centre of the universe. </p>

<p>The Michelson-Morley, Michelson-Gale, Airy&#39;s Failure and Sagnac experiments scientifically proved Geocentrism and nearly crushed the dying Heliocentric theory until Mr. Einstein came through with his Special Relativity mathematical denial of the proven Aether and philosophically (not scientifically) banished the Aether from study ever since. </p>

<p>These studies and peer reviewed experiments are never covered in any university courses. These conclusive peer-reviewed and repeated scientific results are nowhere debated or denied, merely suppressed and ignored. The fact of the matter is that Geocentrism has been conclusively proven for over a century.</p>

<p>In 1913 Sagnac conducted an experiment to test the speed and constancy of light and proved the existence of the Aether (Disproves relativity) Therefore, The Michelson-Morley experiment, conducted using an interferometer clearly demonstrated that the Earth was motionless. The Michelson-Gale experiment detected the Aether/Firmament passing over the surface of the motionless Earth. Airy&#39;s Failure, demonstrated that it is the stars moving relative to a stationary Earth, and not the fast orbiting Earth moving relative to comparatively stationary stars. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly I have never seen a single flat earth supporting theory that was was not refuted by another flat earther with a different theory. Granted globe based science can be in a held in a similar position. Answer me this. Let&#39;s say for sake of argument that the earth is undoubtedly flat, what the agenda for pushing the global theory so hard, what does anyone gain from it? And remember people have generally agreed that the earth is a globe way before NASA was created. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Density and buoyancy only work if there is a force pulling everything down... </p>

<p>Buoyancy is simple to test for. What happens to objects in a vavuum sealed box? Do they float and is there a change to the weight of the vacuum sealed box? If no to both of those then we know its not density or buoyancy. </p>

<p>Definitely not lol. </p>

<p>Ships disappear bottom first, no amount of zoom will bring back the bottom section of a ship. The only thing that will bring them back is to increase your elevation. This should not work on a FE</p>

<p>I&#39;m hanging with Santos Bonacci and another youtuber named Subphotonic.  Santos gets into the ancient theologies about the Earth. And subphotonic is just a raw uncensored dude who goes over countless memes about the Copernican Jesuit influence on science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i already did. the idea of &quot;8 inches per mile squared&quot; is wrong. &quot;8 inches per SQUARE MILE&quot; means that for any one straight plane mile (one line in one direction--&quot;distance&quot;) you would see an overall curve of 8 inches. </p>

<p>dubay asserts that for 100 miles the math finding curve is (8x100)<sup>2.</sup> there is no reason to square anything. this is just a wrong idea. the correct curve (approx) is 800 inches, or 66 feet. 66 feet curve over 100 miles would not be noticeable unless you had a completely smooth plane without any topography. </p>

<p>suspend your belief and think about this one:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsOz_J6tJVU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsOz_J6tJVU</a></p>

<p>going out of his way to assert &quot;8 inches per mile squared&quot; is either deceitful or ignorant. </p>
