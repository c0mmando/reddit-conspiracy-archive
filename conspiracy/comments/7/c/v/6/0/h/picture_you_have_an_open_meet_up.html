        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Its in a local gym and you have it every week or so. Usually there&#39;s about 55 people who meet and talk there regularly. Maybe a few of them are more vocal than others and a few, on occasion, have a small group gathered around them discussing conspiracies.</p>

<p>Then let&#39;s say you pop in this week, and there&#39;s motherfucking 1000 people in your meet up room, 800 some of which you have never seen before. And at the front of the room and a few of them are all mic&#39;d up on a PA giving a large presentation. They have a huge congregation in front of them eating it up. You don&#39;t recognize anyone (aside from the astonished onlookers who were there last week), the issue they&#39;re talking about is clearly not nearly as important as some of the more recent breaking news, and they&#39;re basically just yelling over everyone and drowning the rest of the regular attendees out.</p>

<p>This is r/conspiracy right now. </p>

<p>and no I&#39;m not here with the brigade, I&#39;m just saying if it&#39;s a public meeting, you have to accept the fact that occasionally the public might show up, maybe start a private meeting somewhere if the general public was never actually suppose to come..... besides their presence is reactionary, I doubt the dust will even settle before they&#39;re all gone anyways </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Elaborate on how the overton window has shifted? I see that article posted a lot, but I&#39;m a bit skeptical about it.. it seems to be used to make one&#39;s self look like an authority on the matter, which is why I ask you to elaborate.</p>

<p>Unlike some people I know there&#39;s some fairly intelligent people here, but there&#39;s also morons. One of the most overused trends I see on here is logical fallacies, most use them badly and they simply don&#39;t understand the actual fallacy, and almost none point out the <em>exact</em> flaw in logic that contributes to the fallacy.. which is required in formal debate.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk q Anon for a minute, relating to your article. Firstly, no one here is anything more than the equivalent of an old guy shouting at the sky, we aren&#39;t important (unless we are) and they aren&#39;t going to waste resources assassinating an individuals character on here.. except perhaps in cases of people like &quot;q Anon&quot;.</p>

<p>Simply put, q Anon or any of the others could be the people that article is talking about, putting out fake information trying to influence real people&#39;s views. That&#39;s why I kind of keep mental track of posts trying to bring attention to a totally different forum, trying to get the information as much attention as they can.</p>

<p>But the same can be said in reverse, the Anon could be totally legit, and the people saying it is fake could be trying to derail information they don&#39;t want people to accept.</p>

<p>And quite literally, both could be true, the entire narrative is false, Anons are fake, the people spreading it are fake, and the people trying to say it&#39;s fake are also the same people.</p>

<p>The point? We see a maybe authentic battle for the minds of the sub, it occupies our time, keeps us from discussing things they wouldn&#39;t want to, etc.</p>

<p>Kind of thinking this should be a post instead of a comment.. but my thought is that that site can too easily be used as a tool to manipulate this site&#39;s users.</p>

<p>So what do we do? If we ban 4chan links/posts they can still make YouTube videos, they can make blogs they share here.. they&#39;ll simply find another way to alter the discussion.</p>

<p>But, we can make a mental or actual list of the people actually doing it, and give them less weight. Calling people shills for no reason with no evidence doesn&#39;t actually do anything but make the sub more volatile.</p>

<p>I mean, you posted the article and some vague comment without any kind of context, what are your thoughts? Care to elaborate what you were actually trying to say?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Number 358 is a blend of the vibrations of number 3, the energies of number 5 and the attributes of number 8. Number 3 relates to optimism and enthusiasm, communication and self-expression, inspiration and creativity, expansion and growth, manifesting and manifestation. Number 3 also relates to the energies of the Ascended Masters. Number 5 resonates with major life changes, making important choices and decisions, promotion and advancements, adaptability and versatility, personal freedom and individuality, life lessons learned through experience and resourcefulness. Number 5 encourages you to be yourself in all ways. Number 8 brings it vibrations of manifesting wealth and abundance, self-confidence and personal authority, discernment, achievement, giving and receiving, inner-wisdom and serving humanity. Number 8 is also the number of Karma – the Universal Spiritual Law of Cause and Effect.</p>

<p>Both of these presidents are simply puppets to whomever runs the show behind the scenes. Trump is almost certainly a part of this same scheme. He sold military grade weaponry to the country who financed and supported the terrorists on 911 (Saudi Arabia) and has done literally nothing to fight those who organized the demolitions and the subsequent lies in the media.</p>

<p>There is something much fucking larger at play here and all this Russia bullshit is nothing but misdirection from it.</p>

<p>Those who organized the greatest attack on American soil in history are still unpunished and operating within the US govt. THAT is where <a href="/r/Conspiracy">/r/Conspiracy</a> should be but instead they are chasing their tails on a conspiracy that came from the same fucking people who have been rigging the game the whole time.</p>

<p>The Russia conspiracy was given to you by the same fucking media who brought you ever other lie this sub has exposed for a decade. People feel comfortable with the Russian conspiracy because they&#39;ve been given the OK by western media to believe it.</p>

<p>Pretend you are a US citizen, with a government job or intelligence job and you helped organize 911. Wouldn&#39;t all this Russia/Trump talk distracting everyone just make you lick your lips with satisfaction?</p>

<p>America has been positively infiltrated by Israel in nearly every facet of influence. Media/Entertainment/Politics/Finance and so forth. There are a SHITLoad of dual citizens of America/Israel in politics. Just imagine for me please if all of this was the case but with Russia. You would be mad, and rightfully so. So why not the same treatment?</p>

<p>The &quot;steel beams&quot; and &quot;Loose Change&quot; and all of that is absolute nonsense. I do my research to find the truth, not to further fuel conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Personally took a break when conspiracy boards started getting infected with people with a clear political agenda. It&#39;s sad that so-called critical thinkers can&#39;t see they&#39;ve been duped. Now i&#39;m active here (because certain obvious shilling mods were ousted) and branded as an outsider. Take that circlejerk back to t_d, all authority need to be questioned without favouritism. Obvious agenda is obvious, gimme back bilderberg, ufo&#39;s, black projects and false flags. :(</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s how Reddit works. You get enough upvotes quick enough and you get into r/all/rising and the rest of the site joins in.</p>

<p>To give some numbers:</p>

<p>Almost 2,000 accounts post here each day: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/JEF3PZs.png">https://i.imgur.com/JEF3PZs.png</a></p>

<p>In the thread at the top of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7cqh4t/leaked_emails_show_wikileaks_and_trump_jr/">sub right now</a> with over 2500 comments, there are 897 unique accounts. Of those, 241 had never posted here before October 1 (I haven&#39;t loaded october data yet)</p>

<p>Which doesn&#39;t seem extraordinary when you look at past threads: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/YiA6kvN.png">https://i.imgur.com/YiA6kvN.png</a></p>

<p>Somewhat related:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People complaining about Wikileaks and Trump&#39;s administration getting hammered here are just silly. Trump&#39;s own people have lied about going to Russia. Trump has even condemned them for it. The claims made are not insignificant or unsubstantiated. Wikileaks concerned themselves with Trump&#39;s campaign and administration&#39;s optics. It was a smart strategic move for them, but I think most people don&#39;t think of Wikileaks doing this sort of thing-they have a romanticized view of what Wikileaks is and what it does. Of course people will say this means Wikileaks is actually run by Vladimir Putin, and its employees are all ex KGB, but the truth is there are no white knights in this dark political world. That doesn&#39;t excuse Wikileaks, it just accurately gives context to what we are seeing.</p>

I was hesitant to join in the conversations because of mods constantly banning people frivolously, because of the constant calls if shills, and the high presence of the Donald basically going around insulting anyone who they disagree with or are critical of Trump.</p>

<p>Sometime in the last six months or so I started commenting because they got rid of a few mods I think were the problem, and the trumpets seem to be more reigned in than they used to be. What I didn&#39;t realize was the effect commenting here would have on my comments in others subs.. basically, people would call be an idiot for participating here, and other harassment.</p>

<p>ALEFANTIS: Well, we make everything from scratch. Other restaurants, even good restaurants, will, like, not roast their own peppers. You can just buy the roasted peppers in a can. Or you can buy garlic oil. Some products you can get, and they’re consistent and they’re easy. But I didn’t even know that existed actually until they said that. I was like, “What do you mean? There’s another way? You can just buy these things?” Because a lot of restaurants will open a can and put it on. Like our sauce — we harvest a whole crop of organic tomatoes — 10 tons of tomatoes every year. Can them all, store them in the basement, have like a harvest party when it gets loaded in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So he makes a throwaway line about the old way of doing things where tomato sauce in a basement and that automatically installs a basement where there was none before?</p>

<p>FYI: Comet uses a low-slung refrigerator at Buck’s Fishing &amp; Camping, Mr. Alefantis’s other restaurant, to store produce, cheese and proofing dough. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/12/10/business/media/pizzagate.html">source</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because no building ever has had 2 floors above ground, right?</p>

<p>Let me help you here. As it turns out, I was 100% wrong about a simple reference to &quot;doing it the old way&quot;.</p>

<p>As it turns out, you were also 100% wrong about the basement. The basement in question is in a building 2 doors down. My source even mentions the story from your article: <a href="http://archive.is/6opBr#selection-1511.275-1511.491">http://archive.is/6opBr#selection-1511.275-1511.491</a></p>

<p>So, to recap, I&#39;ve refined my story according to new information and admitted my previous error. Are you ready to do the same or are you going to go search for more evidence of the magic basement?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t a clue what I&#39;m talking about apparently. The guy cited the ping pong playing on the sidewalk, and suggested the establishment was a danger to kids. Plain and simple. When he went to the council meetings, pong brought an entire crowd of non residence and the showed support. I&#39;m making the analogy of this op thread to that occasion. Cause comet brought people from outside to defend them at a local meeting. Carry on dude. </p>

<p>Where else can you really go or who else can you really talk to or will be receptive and understanding when you simply can&#39;t accept the official story or what the MSM is dishing-out about any important and ongoing events? </p>

<p>These are very uncertain and disconcerting times in ways that no one really expected. As people see more and more of their own suspicions they they usually turned a blind eye to being steadily confirmed and exposed they can no longer pretend that &quot;the Emperor has no clothes&quot;, or that they&#39;re too dumb to see them, so to speak.</p>

<p>Obviously those larger numbers and more contemporary news items getting posted are also pulling in the typical defenders, disruptors, and wannabe debunkers working to uphold the official line.</p>

<p>I think that the regulars here need to see that not all of the recent arrivals are controlled opposition simply putting a show of their own on here, but only a small part of that. </p>

<p>People are awakening to the conspiratorial nature of their own ongoing history and seeking out new and other sources of information regarding it wherever they can find them as they grow increasingly more aware of that. This forum just happens to be one of the most obvious and better known ones to start from.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Saved. Well articulated analogy. </p>

<p>My experience at a much beloved &#39;politics&#39; sub was just like this. For fun, use one of the many reddit analysis tools out there to check my account history. Of my first three years on reddit that politics sub was where all of my contributions were made. That was my regular meeting. </p>

<p>Motherfucking 1000 people showed up in my meet up room. They&#39;re still there flapping at the mouth about non-arguments. Sometimes I poke at one to test if they&#39;re real and I&#39;m not convinced, there may be animatronics inside. </p>

<p>Ok cool, I just stepped outside and entered the other coffee sub next-door to the gym. And I saw all the people from my regular meet-up with the custom flair I&#39;d set there too! Everyone just stepped out of the room and found a new room to continue having the regular meeting. Only now we&#39;re annoyed at whomever backs the weird obscenity taking place in the old room. It&#39;s actually very useful to gauge the barometer of what topics to scrutinize closely.</p>

<p>Archons. Prison planets. Central banks. Occult symbolism. UFOs. The good stuff.... Not this partisan crap. The real meat of conspiracy.  To see the invasion of hillbots and trump idiots is soul crushing. Real conspiracy is once again being pushed out by Alex Jones type bullshit.

If someone makes a post that is any any way supportive of any political party or person is almost always a blip on my bullshit meter.

Take my word for it and don&#39;t take my word for it. Don&#39;t take anyone&#39;s word for it. Trust no conclusion you can&#39;t reach on your own.
