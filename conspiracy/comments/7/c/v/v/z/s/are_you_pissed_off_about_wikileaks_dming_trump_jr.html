<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The allegations that we have colluded with Trump, or any other candidate for that matter, or with Russia, are just groundless and false. We receive information anonymously, through an anonymous submission platform. We do not need to know the identity of the source, neither do we want to know it. The intention of the source is irrelevant in our editorial process. Every source of every journalist has an intention and an agenda, may it be hidden or clear. Requesting the intention from our sources would firstly likely jeopardize their anonymity, and secondly form a bias in our understanding of the information we received. Their authenticity and their relevance to the public or the historical record are the only preconditions for us to publish the documents we are given.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We are reading the same DM’s, the problem is that you went into reading them with the preconceived notion that they are incriminating. So, much like the original article from <em>The Atlantic</em> (corporate MSM propaganda outlet), you are stretching their words and trying desperately to find something in them that somehow discredits Wikileaks and proves collusion. Sorry, but it’s called opposition research, and the Democrats did it too. Wikileaks is not a Russian organization, and they did not receive the DNC email leak from the Russians; therefore, these direct messages have nothing to do with the Russian collusion investigation. </p>

<p>If you read the same DMs as me, then you would pick up on the tone of whoever is messaging on behalf of Wikileaks. They are talking about exposing corruption. They are suggesting the Trump campaign act with honesty and integrity and go ahead and just release Trump’s tax returns and the emails the New York Times got their hands on. Those direct messages have more to do with Wikileaks trying to get the Trump
campaign to do the right thing. Could it be consider “helping” the Trump campaign? Yes, they gave them advice, but nothing more and nothing less. And can you really blame them for wanting to even the odds in an election where our mainstream media spent 90% of their election coverage bashing the Republican candidate?</p>

<p>If you had even the slightest understanding of the context of what’s going on, then you would see that Wikileaks as an organization was in a sticky situation after releasing the leaked DNC emails. They did something that had never been done before and exposed a lot of corruption. Julian Assange was holed up in the embassy the entire time and was receiving death threats. Hell, news pundits and politicians were asking why we can’t just kill him. Why do you think News pundits and politicians would be so angry if there weren’t some things in those emails that they didn’t want you to know about? Why do you think CNN tried to get away with telling it’s viewers that it’s illegal to read Wikileaks?Once again, you should be grateful for Wikileaks exposing the corruption of one of our major political parties. </p>

<p>What you fail to understand is that this whole thing is COMPLETELY about the DNC email leaks. The Russian collusion narrative was hatched by the DNC as a means to distract from the actual content of the leaked emails. Any time they were questioned about it they used the Russia deflection, and they were never, ever asked any <em>hard</em> questions about the content of the emails. Their intent was that it would be blown out of proportion. It would also serve to kill two birds with one stone: cover up the shocking revelations from the leaked emails, and create justification to impeach Trump and start another war.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not everything has to be about the DNC. The DMs mainly show Wikileaks has lied, has an agenda, and is partisan. Like you said this isn&#39;t proof of Russia Collusion. And not once I ascertain that.

<p>Starting from my first comment I said this means Wikileaks lied, and the main proof I have is them giving Jr. a password to a opposition website completely breaks their statement I quoted.</p>

<p>not at all, i use a tried and true system that&#39;s been around for thousands of years. it&#39;s called &quot;critical thinking.&quot;</p>

<p>so a quote from a rockefeller saying that he&#39;s happy the media has been complicit in hiding his secret plans for world domination doesn&#39;t pass the &quot;smell&quot; test. it&#39;s an extraordinary claim, and thus requires extraordinary evidence. </p>

<p>if he said that 26 years ago, why have i never heard about it?</p>

<p>if he said that, why is it not more accepted that the BG is a true NWO conspiracy?</p>

<p>if he said that, why isn&#39;t it paraded around constantly as prime evidence of the NWO?</p>

<p>Do you just assume things are true based on whether they are on youtube? That&#39;s not a very good way to evaluate whether a claim is true or false is it?</p>

<p>That video isn&#39;t a video, it&#39;s audio. Unverified audio with no credentials. Anyone could have made that tape. I have no idea whose voice that is, or who recorded it, or why.</p>

<p>So why should I believe it?</p>

<p>How can you be sure you&#39;re not engaging in post hoc rationalization to defend a position you already committed to without critical thinking? It&#39;s a subtle distinction.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know, but none of these refute the point on a <em>logical</em> level.</p>

<p>No, that&#39;s you. We&#39;re talking about specific facts, and you and your friends keep throwing out rhetorical nonresponses and hoping that the vote bots will convince everyone of their veracity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t referred to either twitter or infowars. Why do you feel the need to lie instead of just dealing in facts?</p>

<p>&quot;The Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS) have been investigating the now conventional wisdom that last year&#39;s leaks of Democratic National Committee files were the result of Russian hacks. What they found instead is evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p>Unlike the &quot;current and former intelligence officials&quot; anonymously quoted in stories about the Trump-Russia scandal, VIPS members actually have names...</p>

<p>VIPS instead surmises that, after WikiLeaks&#39; Julian Assange announced on June 12, 2016 his intention to publish Hillary Clinton-related emails, the DNC rushed to fabricate evidence that it had been hacked by Russia to defuse any potential WikiLeaks disclosures. To this end, the theory goes, the DNC used the Guccifer 2.0 online persona to release mostly harmless DNC data. Guccifer 2.0 was later loosely linked to Russia because of Russian metadata in his files and his use of a Russia-based virtual private network.</p>

<p>The VIPS theory relies on forensic findings by independent researchers who go by the pseudonyms &quot;Forensicator&quot; and &quot;Adam Carter.&quot; The former found that 1,976 MB of Guccifer&#39;s files were copied from a DNC server on July 5 in just 87 seconds, implying a transfer rate of 22.6 megabytes per second -- or, converted to a measure most people use, about 180 megabits per second, a speed not commonly available from U.S. internet providers. Downloading such files this quickly over the internet, especially over a VPN (most hackers would use one), would have been all but impossible because the network infrastructure through which the traffic would have to pass would further slow the traffic. However, as Forensicator has pointed out, the files could have been copied to a thumb drive -- something only an insider could have done -- at about that speed.&quot;</p>

<p>What have I lied about? Trying to discredit any argument I make by making a false accusation at the beginning of your statement?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A simple explanation, Russian intelligence isn&#39;t &#39;common&#39;, and has the ability to route over multiple connections and different avenues than &#39;common&#39; users. I have access to a 200mbps connection and I&#39;m just an end user. Do you think the NSA operates PRISM off a single T1 line? Why would we assume a sophisticated attack by the Russian gov&#39;t to be handicapped to end-user level hardware and access? A well connected server could easily reach 1gbps. Multiple VPN connections and boom, have your 180mpbs as theorized. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying the theory of an inside job is bunk, but there are still enough possibilities against it for it to remain a theory as much as Guccifer 2.0 is a theory. But the original point was &#39;leveraging leaks to start an FBI investigation&#39;, which is misleading at best. The FBI and Special Counsel&#39;s investigations were started in part by the DNC hack/leaks, but also by the spread of false stories on social media, botnets, financial contributions to campaigns, collusion with foreign agencies for information, etc. </p>

<p>Also by nature of this forensic analysis, the Seth Rich theory is on much weaker ground, because the second copy was dated Sept, after his death (Jul 10 2016).</p>

<p>Hillary wanted to [drone] strike Assange </p>

<h1>FAKE NEWS</h1>

<blockquote>
<p>First of all, the only cited source documenting that Hillary Clinton had ever suggested (even in jest) that a drone strike could take out Julian Assange was “sources at the State Department,” a vague and anonymous reference that does not yield to verification. Second, the claim that Hillary Clinton or her aides had either hinted or directly ordered remote assassination of Assange in November 2010 focused on a questionable interpretation of the terms “legal and nonlegal strategies” that appeared in the subject line of e-mails sent by Anne-Marie Slaughter, Director of Policy Planning at the U.S. Department of State and released via WikiLeaks’ first searchable Hillary Clinton e-mail archive in March 2016.</p>

<p>However, the text of those e-mails (located here and here) neither said nor implied anything of the sort</p>

<p>Idk about you but I don&#39;t think of the NY times as some impartial journalist organization. Journalism died a long time ago. I don&#39;t consider Wikileaks journalism either. They&#39;re a media company that releases information, largely about abuses of power and injustice. They also look out for themselves, which means imploring unscrupulous tactics and being in a morally gray area. That&#39;s not defending Wikileaks, that&#39;s just an accurate representation of the context for what has happened. Wikileaks shouldn&#39;t have said a damn thing to Trump Jr., and in doing so they fucked up big time. Lost a little respect for them, there. To be fair, though, to expect them to be white knights or some shit would be naive. It&#39;s an organization of people, and people have the capacity for a wide variety of behavior, good and bad, and everywhere inbetween.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great. So if you included a source, I could have some context to work with. Maybe they didn&#39;t have anything worth releasing. Seems plausible, considering they have to ask for something like his tax returns.</p>

<p>You&#39;re trying to claim they had damaging material on Trump, but I would need a source to understand if that&#39;s really the case. I would like to see what they actually said.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s safe to assume that publishing material is an effort intensive operation. I think it&#39;s safe to assume that publishing non-damaging or low quality material can damage Wikileaks credibility.</p>

<p>So if all they had was evidence that he cheated on his wife in the 1970&#39;s or something, I could see why that was not worth releasing.</p>

<p>Without knowing what they had, we can&#39;t say for certain that it was worth Wikileaks time and energy to release it. If you can&#39;t even include the quote from Wikileaks, then we can&#39;t even have a clue as to how damaging that material might be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seemed like social engineering to me. That kind of social engineering probably happens all the time with other organizations. They wanted Trumps tax returns, so they made it seem like it would be in Trump&#39;s best interest to release the returns to them. </p>

<p>With that said, the totality of the messages doesn&#39;t look like good PR for Wikileaks. If this was Assange sending the messages, it would be a little worse, but this was some person who worked for Wikileaks. And the fact that it was all over Twitter makes me think they didn&#39;t really feel like they were doing anything wrong. It&#39;s just the way the shit is worded that makes it look bad. </p>

<p>A foreign organization pushing their political agenda onto a domestic election? By directly influencing campaign members?

<p>Neither did Russian intelligence, and yet they still put money into sewing doubt and dividing the US through botnets and spreading fake news. Just because something isn&#39;t expected to happen, if the reward is there (weakening of a Super Power) it is still worth the effort.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand how you can be defending Jr and WL&#39;s interactions after this. If it was HRC, would you be treating them the same? And before the whataboutism with CNN debate questions, yes I think that was wrong and if a law was broken, she should be prosecuted, but it&#39;s also a different matter, as that was domestic corruption issue, not foreign corruption. Both are bad, but different kinds of bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>collusion
kəˈl(j)uːʒ(ə)n
noun
secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy in order to deceive others.
&quot;the armed forces were working in collusion with drug traffickers&quot;
LAW
collusion between ostensible opponents in a lawsuit.</p>

<p>It takes two or more people getting together in secret for there to be collusion with parties acting upon said conversation. One person talking/emailing another doesn&#39;t make collusion, especially if second party doesn&#39;t act on what person has communicated.</p>

<p>Me emailing you is not collusion. If you report me for contacting you then there can be no collusion as the meeting is longer secret. You ignoring my emails is not collusion. </p>

<p>Even if answer my emails, it may not be collusion in itself as nothing I say interests you which ergo results in no action on your part. All that had happened is you&#39;ve wasted time reading or listening to banter.</p>

<p>If I tell you not to jump off a 10 story building in a secret meeting and you don&#39;t as you were not planning to in first place, that is not collusion. </p>

<p>First article names Wikileaks not Assange as the contactee. Whether this means Assange or the cleaner Wikileaks employs is contacting Junior I don&#39;t know. That if isomeone is someone working at Wikileaks doing something off his own bat we don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Second Article is way to vague on detail with one sentence being quoted to be used to convey the entire substance and intent of entire email. Whether such statement is what message conveys we would need to read entire email.</p>

<p>Examples said to prove collusion in article are inane and require suggestion as being nothing  more then Junior being interested in playing Wikileaks for what he could get out of it for himself and his father rather than collusion.</p>

<p>When Junior replied “ask around.” (the article used the word &quot;promise&quot;. Is this the journalist interpretation of Junior&#39;s words? If Junior had used word promise, why isn&#39;t the use of the word quoted from the email?) but the example that he did then ask around so is lacking. </p>

<p>All we have some anonymous source saying Junior immediately notified other senior people in the campaign that Wikileaks contacted him and then Kushner forwarded email to a communication staffer. So what? You have a prank call you&#39;d probably have to notify someone. </p>

<p>Need to see the email demonstrating that Junior asked around and replied answering what Wikileaks wanted to know in first email.
THAT WOULD BE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION. Mind you, if Wikileaks wanted to know anything and the whole fracas is just a rhetorical question? Again not enough information in article to makejudgement one or another on it.</p>

<p>As for Junior not rebuffing Wikileaks. Think anyone in any campaign would rebuff someone contacting them who may have credible dirt on an opponent? If  you believe politics is fair you afe delusional. All politicians throw mud if and when that is all that is left they do so abundantly.</p>

<p>As for Junior giving his father an email link within 15 mins is speculative. Need to know where Junior was in relation to father in 15 minutes time frame. If Junior was in his father&#39;s presence sure. If not in his father&#39;s presence there will be phonecall/email/SMS/tweet etc... which would verify collusion. Such evidence is not mentioned in article. Though Trump himself could have had anyone on his team tell him about Wikileaks news from looking at Julian Assange tweets or Wikileaks website itself. Wikileaks was important to both candidates. No surprise if Clinton had people keeping an eye on Wikileaks. To do so is not conclusion.</p>

<p>That Junior tweeted link out two days later is no big deal. Two days after Julian tweeted something there would be thousand of retweets Junior could have used desperate from email.</p>

<p>That Wikileaks asked Junior to dump his father&#39;s tax returns is merely what journalistic standards would demand. Trump&#39;s tax returns were being sort by every news source at time.</p>

<p>The real worry is from Wikileaks end is the story about the Ambassadorship. If true it suggests Wikileaks and Assange are prepared to dodge the truth in reporting stories. It is the following</p>

<p>&quot;in sharing its work, in contesting the results of the election, and in arranging for Julian Assange to be Australia’s ambassador to the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>First its an insane statement. </p>

<p>That or a larikin joke taken out of context. Larikin humour is Australian when you say something about a person or thing in mockingly dark terms but everyone knowing it is ridiculous knowing it&#39;s the truth, hence the humour.   </p>

<p>Officially U.S. has no control over selection of Ambassador. Officially, the U.S. can refuse an Ambassador but that is all. </p>

<p>To think an Ambassadorship could be the outcome of any collusion with Trump, then Julian Assange&#39;s mental health is deteriorating due to his imprisonment in embassy as some people have been calling out. Or the entire thing is bogus. Would like to read actual email word for word but can&#39;t. Since Iraq WMDs I need more then some journalist  telling me to trust them and that Assange wrote this in an email. Assange is an intelligent man who knows how things work in regards to Ambassadorships.</p>

<p>CIA do decide who our prime minister are. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming. Have since Whitlam. Julia Gillard visits American embassy, has U.S. Diplomats gushing over her, and a few weeks later becomes PM after stabbing Kevin Rudd in back. So I can believe they probably choose Ambassador too.</p>

<p>But after what Assange has done to the CIA, they&#39;d kill him before doing this regardless of what The President tks them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more than a bit deceptive even when your entire thing isn&#39;t transparently publishing leaks for the sake of transparency.  It&#39;s filthy and it&#39;s particularly anathema to WL&#39;s asserted purpose and self alleged MO.  </p>

<p>Remind me again of the point of WL: is it to deceive the public, and undermine transparency by deliberately obscuring the fact that they are releasing information vetted and given to them for that purpose by the very entity they claim they&#39;re publishing the leaked information of?  </p>

<p>If Trump&#39;s tax returns make him look bad, he won&#39;t hand them over and Assange isn&#39;t naive to that fact.  Assange intended to be given information that the Trump&#39;s had vetted to ensure it wouldn&#39;t reveal any of their secrets, and then pass it off as leaked against Trump&#39;s will which would have allowed Trump to turn around and say that even when someone got hold of his tax returns and leaked them, they were clean.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but I really do believe they would leak info</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Firstly that&#39;s not relevant here because this isn&#39;t about publishing a leak, a key aspect of which is that the owner of the information intended to keep it secret.  That&#39;s why leaks can be valuable - they reveal something someone was trying to keep secret or private.  To pass off vetted information the subject gave you to publish, knowing full well there is nothing in there they intended or needed to keep secret is filthy beyond filthy.  This isn&#39;t a trivial deception.  He was not only going to lie on his own behalf, he was literally offering to conduct a limited hang out for Trump.  That&#39;s outright propaganda.</p>

<p>What it changes is not what happened by why and with what intent. As always, context is important, leaving out key phrases is a basic form of disinformation.</p>

<p>But whatever, I&#39;ll play along.</p>

<p>So, before this new information, assange was secretely conspiring with one campaign to lie to the public so that the public wouldn&#39;t think he was biased.</p>

<p>And after this new information, assange was secretly conspiring with one campaign to lie to the public so that the public wouldn&#39;t think he was biased, because Clinton said he was biased and secretly supporting and or conspiring with one campaign.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that publishing previously secret documents would be a form of truth telling and a side effect of this process, as was stated in the full text, it would provide a counter-point to the slander coming from the DNC / Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>So clearly they were looking to publish documents on Trump, but first they would have to acquire some to publish. Attempting to convince DJTjr to provide much sought after documents (which he didn&#39;t even do) isn&#39;t exactly that concerning.</p>

<p>Those are not the same sentence. At all. Different meanings, different implications.

    <div class="md"><p>But the leaks were either incomplete or at least not presented in an unbiased way. The only unbiased way to present the info is to release them in full, which they didn&#39;t do. Thus, Julian&#39;s claim remains true. Feel free to debate the content of those DMs all you want, though IMHO both parties are simply doing their job and there was zero collusion of any kind. It would be like if I told you, &quot;hey did you hear about Harvey Weinstein? You should spread that story around.&quot; WikiLeaks didn&#39;t share info that wasn&#39;t already public with them, though idk if I&#39;d even consider that collusion anyway. Yes, WikiLeaks asked for documents, but so did David Brock and he offered $5 million for them.</p>

<p>Second, this isn&#39;t a journalist, this is someone that is supposed to release information they are given without solicitation, exactly the way it is given. WikiLeaks isn&#39;t a news organization.</p>

<p>So, contrary to the post/ama last year, where they said <em>specifically that they don&#39;t do exactly what they just did</em>, we see that he&#39;s trying to get dirt on Trump, <em>for the sole purpose of looking like they aren&#39;t biased</em>. They actually say those exact words, that it will make all their Hillary shit look better.</p>

<p>So.. who is lying? Assange or Jr, and why? Jr is the one that came out, do you think he would literally attempt to falsify evidence? Pretty sure he&#39;d go to jail if he did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The messages as presented by the Atlantic only make a bad thing look worse, which is apparently what literally everybody these days seems to feel the need to do when attacking someone. It&#39;s as if they think that people won&#39;t react strongly enough to something bad, so they need to make people think that the bad thing is literally the worst thing imaginable.</p>

<p>In the Atlantic version, Assange almost seems to be admitting to being pro-Trump/pro-Russia. In the full message, he seems to want to have it both ways by claiming that his obvious pro-Trump stance is &quot;slander&quot; coming from the Clinton camp.</p>

<p>Assange is a snake in the grass, but for all I know he might be on the right side of unwritten history. Whether or not his vendetta against the United States warmongering establishment (which he clearly considered Clinton to be a part of) was worth the dice roll of attempting to manipulate support for Trump (whom he referred to as &quot;unpredictable&quot;), only time will tell.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a subjective argument and a matter of ideology, but it is absolutely clear that Wikileaks was working behind the scenes in an arguably deceptive manner towards the goal of social engineering. Assange had a personal interest in the 2016 election.</p>

<p>Of course Assange has a personal interest in the election. His organization released documents about the election and it’s literally his job to get people to read their publications as well as attain new documents to distribute.</p>

<p>Assange ‘helping’ Trump is no different than a used car salesman. The salesman has something the buyer wants but not at just any price... Likewise Assange wants new leaks and new reach. But why would the Trump administration help out Assange if there was nothing to be gained in return?</p>

<p>I guess you could also try to make the argument that he doesn’t like Clinton, but that’s pretty irrelevant to what those Tweets were about... which is doing his job.</p>

<p>And it’s definitely no worse than US citizen (David Brock) of correct the record / shareblue publicly offering $5 million for Trump’s taxes.</p>

<p>I mean I guess maybe they are stretching the truth to convince Trump to release his taxes, but that’s just speculation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If Wikileaks had obtained Trump&#39;s tax return in this manner, they wouldn&#39;t have told the world that they got it from Trump himself; they knew that the assumption would have been that they published them <em>against</em> Trump&#39;s wishes, thus making it look like they&#39;re willing to &quot;go after&quot; either candidate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Who cares what people think? Only facts should matter.  And if this was such a big deal, why wasn’t The Atlantic worrying about when CNN when they defended Clinton from the email scandal and pissed on Bernie throughout the primaries? Why was CNN only helping one candidate?</p>

<p>So I’m conclusion... CNN gets a pass for helping rig the election with lies, but people instead blame WikiLeaks for rigging the election with facts. Smells like some bullshit.</p>

<p>No; WikiLeaks would essentially be faking a &quot;leak&quot; with genuine information. It&#39;s not actually a <em>leak</em> if the information is solicited right from the source in a mutually beneficial arrangement. WikiLeaks&#39; plan - as told to Trump Jr. - was to give the impression to the public that they were just as willing to expose dirt about Trump as they were about Clinton. They wanted to manufacture the semblance of balance to counter the &quot;vast&quot; amounts of information they were releasing about the Clinton campaign.</p>

<p>There are ethical problems with this that take away some of the moral high-ground on which WikiLeaks likes to stand. It&#39;s not exactly Watergate-levels of scandal, but it doesn&#39;t look good no matter what light you choose to view it in.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve explained this in as much detail as I possibly can: If they obtained the returns and released them as a leak, they would be deceiving the public.

The kinds of leaks they champion themselves on aren&#39;t the kind of leaks they&#39;re obviously willing to use in misleading ways. The real bottom line is that not all leaks are equal.</p>

<p>You keep saying fact but you still haven&#39;t proven the motive behind their DMs. To do that you&#39;d need to read the mind of whoever sent the DM. To me, it just looks like they&#39;re doing their job, which as I&#39;ve said before, is expanding reach &amp; getting new material to release.</p>

<p>The Trump tax return &quot;leak&quot; would have been deceptive and misleading. It&#39;s that simple.</p>

<p>See above. You simply cannot prove that.</p>

<p>WikiLeaks presents itself as a passive, unpolitical, and unbiased hub of information dispersion.</p>

<p>The Trump Jr. exchanges prove the opposite no matter what light you view them in.</p>

<p>Do you dispute that?</p>

<p>If I wanted somebody to leak me material, I would have used the same techniques. I would try to sell the Trump admin with good reasons (for them) why they should leak and help expand reach, otherwise they wouldn&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>Not only that, but leaking Trump documents would indeed expand WikiLeaks&#39; reach and greatly enhance the credibility of their DNC Leaks <strong><em>regardless</em></strong> of motive (which you can&#39;t prove).</p>

<p>So again... they are doing their job. Prove to me otherwise, or don&#39;t... I really don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>I mean, every single thing they leak, I now have to wonder if it was something they actually sought out to change my perception of them. I mean.. isn&#39;t that the <em>entire problem with the media</em>, that we aren&#39;t simply getting the facts, we are getting spin?</p>

<p>If WikiLeaks is going to start chasing stories, then I&#39;ll be just as critical of them as all the other mainstream media.. they&#39;ll just be Fox news little brother to me.</p>

I understand Wikileaks may have been the deciding factor in the election, but they did provide transparency.
Also, doesn&#39;t the chain of messages he released pretty much disprove the whole &quot;Trump colluded with Putin and Wikileaks from the start&quot; narrative? The DM chain shows DJT had little idea what Wikileaks was up to.
Also, it&#39;s confirmed Assange wasn&#39;t able to access internet Oct. 17. I&#39;m just looking at this from all angles. It does show correspondence between the two, but this would be brushed off in court instantly. DJT already submitted it to congress.</p>

<p>&quot;Clinton is falsely accusing of us of secretly supporting and or conspiring with Trump! Anyways, hey Trump Jr, mind helping us out here so we can lie to the public and show them that we&#39;ve never secretly supported, conspired with, or communicated with you or your fathers campaign? Thanks buddy.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>holy shit dude. Assange already admitted he had material on trump but chose to not release it because he claimed it wasnt interesting. None of this disproves any of that in any way. The reality was probably that wikileaks DID have damaging info on trump, but chose not to release it because he is pro trump. He then asked for <em>non</em>-damaging info to release to make them seem impartial</p>

<p>From what I read I seem to recall wl asking Don Jr for a few things as examples but also wl asked for anything that Don jr think might be leaked elsewhere. This info wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to be non damaging but they would have released it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well fuck me, they do call themselves journalists. Since when did they go from an organization that published stuff that is leaked to them, to &quot;chasing stories&quot;? Because every time they talk about themselves, they make it sound like that&#39;s all they do.. like the AMA last year.</p>

<p>I hate doing it, but I&#39;m deleting it editing comments because I sound dumb.. but seriously, when did they become &quot;media&quot; rather than just publishing leaked shit?</p>

<p>How soon people forget this. Not to mention even if they&#39;re biased they still exposed real corruption and let everyone know that the DNC primaries were rigged, and that Bernie donaters/supporters were essentially scammed out of almost a <em>quarter billion dollars</em>. Not to mention that the powers that be, corrupt career politicians, and mainstream media still tried to stop Trump from winning 100% of the way.

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, WikiLeaks literally is withholding things that damage the right, while literally asking Trump for things before they come out so they look less biased. The reason for the lack of corruption is because <em>they won&#39;t share it</em>. Maybe there&#39;s plenty of corruption on the right, I wouldn&#39;t know because WikiLeaks isn&#39;t sharing it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a conservative, does it help me that I don&#39;t know who I can safely vote for on the right? If there&#39;s corruption on the right, I want to see it. My chances of voting Democrat is really really tiny regardless, so showing me that they are bad isn&#39;t proving the other side isn&#39;t just as bad.</p>

<p>Because WikiLeaks isn&#39;t sharing the corruption on the right, what choice do I have but to rely on the media? WikiLeaks <em>isn&#39;t doing anyone any favors by being biased</em>. Sure as fuck doesn&#39;t help if they do the <em>exact same thing</em> as the media does, spinning stories that make them look good.</p>

<p>Dude, there is literally no proof of that. What you&#39;re describing (that there is proof for) is the MSM doing that for Hillary and the DNC. You must have gotten confused for a second there.

<p>Not blindly doing anything. There&#39;s nothing here except proof that Wikileaks contacted him, he replied a few times and essentially nothing came of it. Also gotta love the &#39;I&#39;m a real conservative and even I can see how bad this is&#39; concern trolling. Same with the &#39;Hillary lost, stop talking about her&#39; narrative.

<p>As far as I can see they did release them all. I&#39;m sure people like you would love for them all to have been released at once so they MSM can &#39;debunk&#39; them all in a few days and get on with their next narrative instead of having to push back against daily email dumps containing new information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, I feel the need to mention I&#39;m a conservative rather than a trumpet, because that&#39;s an important distinction to make. Hillary was a God awful fucking choice, Trump wasn&#39;t better, there was no one worth voting for.</p>

<p>But I also would love to see people in my political party discuss something besides <em>just</em> the person who lost the election. If she did something illegal, fucking lock her up, but a year from now when it&#39;s time to vote, I&#39;d hope to have conversations about someone in my fucking party.</p>

<p>Also, you know when you text a girl too much, and she doesn&#39;t reply to multiple texts? That&#39;s why I said begged, because this mostly one sided conversation reeks of desperation.</p>

<p>Honestly, at this point I&#39;m hoping to find any conservatives online that aren&#39;t hardcore Trump supporters, in the only sub I frequent.. they must exist. Instead there&#39;s people like you, &quot;Trump can do no wrong!&quot; People that defend Trump and anything Trump related like WikiLeaks, no matter the mental gymnastics required.</p>

<p>And I guess WikiLeaks is literally fake news since you couldn&#39;t show anything <em>current</em> that shows they are unbiased. How many years ago did they leak that shit on Bush?</p>

<p>Go so your mental gymnastics somewhere else troll.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it changes the meaning altogether, which is why it was left out. That is my point.</p>

<p>For one thing it is standard journalism to, when quoting, use elipses to denote an incomplete quote.</p>

<p>From the Atlantic article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From the original conversation:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That means that the vast amount of stuff that we are publishing on Clinton will have much higher impact, because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source, which the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ending the quote with a <code>.</code> rather than a <code>...</code> is unethical. </p>

<p>Here is the <a href="https://medium.com/@caityjohnstone/the-atlantic-commits-malpractice-selectively-edits-to-smear-wikileaks-65ecd7c2468f">longer article</a> describing this intentional omission. But the tldr; is this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a big difference between “because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source” and “because it won’t be perceived as coming from a ‘pro-Trump’ ‘pro-Russia’ source, which the Clinton campaign is constantly slandering us with.” Those are not the same sentence. At all. Different meanings, different implications. One makes WikiLeaks look like it’s trying to hide a pro-Trump, pro-Russian agenda from the public, and the other conveys the exact opposite impression as WikiLeaks actively works to obtain Donald Trump’s tax returns. This is a big deal.</p>

<p>If you cut a hole in a water pipe with a drill for a specific reason that isn&#39;t a leak. That&#39;s an engineered hole. </p>

<p>The dictionary says <strong>verb</strong>: <em>(of a container or covering) accidentally lose or admit contents, especially liquid or gas, through a hole or crack.</em></p>

<p>Oh Assange says? Oh. His word is worthless. I&#39;m not saying he&#39;s a liar but he&#39;s a little bit conflicted with his interests here. And he&#39;s omitting truths until which point he is forced to admit the deception. </p>

<p>And he&#39;s also a prisoner is he not? Prisoners only care about one thing. Getting their ass out. That makes them easy to manipulate. </p>

<p>Whereas it would be a fake leak if it were released by the Trumps to Assange for the purpose of publishing it and Assange then passed it off as a leak rather than making it clear to the public that it was in fact a release he was publishing on the Trump&#39;s behalf.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s a bold claim that requires extraordinary evidence. It looks far more like they were looking to utilize an obvious strategic advantage, which they definitely shouldn&#39;t have, but it&#39;s not evidence of anything other than opportunism, however unfortunate the source of the opportunity. You&#39;re taking this and extrapolating it well beyond what is warranted.</p>

Are you referring to the Russian government official that was oddly allowed into the US by Preet Bharara under Justice department request and who was on the payroll of Fusion GPS who was hired by Hillary Campaign and DNC funds? Now we find out Glen Simpson of F. GPS met with this &quot;Russian Government Official&quot; within 72 hours before and after her meeting with Don Jr. So what we have here is Clinton and DNC paying millions to Fusion GPS to run an entrapment scheme on the Trump campaign using Russians. At the same time Fusion GPS was paying Steele, with Hillary and DNC funds, to compile a blackmail dossier filled with information that Russians provided. This is what actually transpired here but you don&#39;t care about that. You want to focus on Trump-Russia contacts while ignoring the deeper contacts and payments made between Hillary and Russia.</p>

This is everything though, so we can all move on.&quot; and then more emails got leaked and Don Jr. was like &quot;oh, looks like I forgot some. Let me release all of them this time. I forgot about these other ones before, but now I truly have remembered everything and there is no reason to dig deeper.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because the United States was backing Nazis in Ukraine:</p>

<p>&quot;Is the US backing neo-Nazis in Ukraine?...</p>

<p>White supremacist banners and Confederate flags were draped inside Kiev’s occupied City Hall, and demonstrators have hoisted Nazi SS and white power symbols over a toppled memorial to V.I. Lenin. After Yanukovich fled his palatial estate by helicopter, EuroMaidan protesters destroyed a memorial to Ukrainians who died battling German occupation during World War II. Sieg heil salutes and the Nazi Wolfsangel symbol have become an increasingly common site in Maidan Square, and neo-Nazi forces have established “autonomous zones” in and around Kiev.</p>

<p>One of the “Big Three” political parties behind the protests is the ultra-nationalist Svoboda, whose leader, Oleh Tyahnybok, has called for the liberation of his country from the “Muscovite-Jewish mafia.” After the 2010 conviction of the Nazi death camp guard John Demjanjuk for his supporting role in the death of nearly 30,000 people at the Sobibor camp, Tyahnybok rushed to Germany to declare him a hero who was “fighting for truth.” In the Ukrainian parliament, where Svoboda holds an unprecedented 37 seats, Tyahnybok’s deputy Yuriy Mykhalchyshyn is fond of quoting Joseph Goebbels – he has even founded a think tank originally called “the Joseph Goebbels Political Research Center.” According to Per Anders Rudling, a leading academic expert on European neo-fascism, the self-described “socialist nationalist” Mykhalchyshyn is the main link between Svoboda’s official wing and neo-Nazi militias like Right Sector.&quot;</p>

<p>No, it&#39;s very simple. The US supported Neo Nazis in a coup against the elected government. Small children can understand why this is wrong.</p>

<p>Knowing that Vault 8 recently confirmed that the CIA impersonates Russians, have you considered whether the CIA (which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">controls the media</a>) is lying to you?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well in our country most of the MSM operates under the guidance of &#39;Operation mockingbird&#39; via the C.I.A. so there&#39;s a clear bias in the majority of what&#39;s focused on in the media. How do you get around that if you are running for president and the media (and intelligence community) itself has a clear bias against you? My guess is go somewhere that is (possibly) outside of the sphere of influence of the C.I.A., enter WikiLeaks.<br/>
Not that I claim doing so is the right thing to do, but this is my guess as to why it happened.   </p>

<p>Also don&#39;t forget that propaganda is legalized to be used against us citizens, and that the intelligence community can spoof whatever they want to appear as whatever country they want.  </p>

<p>The truth is everyone in politics is doing bad things and to win the election they&#39;ve both got dirty hands trying to paint the other candidate as incompetent or criminal. </p>

However, compromised or not, wikileaks has exposed and released information that would more than likely never have been available.

As long as Assange and WL are still releasing TRUE information I will look past this whole DTJR and Assange exchange of info. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>JA reached out to Don Jr to try and get information on his dad to release to the public. Is the problem that he framed it like they need to show they aren&#39;t conspiring with Trump like Hillary claims? </p>

<p>I am a supporter of Wikileaks so I&#39;m obviously biased and won&#39;t pretend to be anything else. But looking at this as objectively as I can it doesn&#39;t seem like JA did anything illegal or even improper. He tried to get dirt on Trump (through trumps son which was stupid) and didn&#39;t get that information. What would everyone say if he was successful in getting the tax returns and then released them? </p>

<p>Unless there are extra DMs we don&#39;t know about this all seems like a normal interaction between an information hungry company like Wikileaks and a potential leaker.  It reminds me of when I was in sales. I reached out to anybody that I thought might help me reach my goals even if there was a 99.9% chance id be told to go jump off a bridge  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Huh. We both read the exact same emails between Wikileaks and Mini Trump and came to different conclusions. I thought it sounded like what a lot of journalists do, cozy up to those in power and then hit em&#39; anyways. You thought it was a suggestion of their support of the Trump Campaign. Either could be closer to the truth.</p>

<p>It&#39;a nice living in a world where there&#39;s openminded people willing to read and openminded organizations willing to publish information in its entirety to let us make up our own minds.</p>

<p>(I&#39;d be willing to bet they also communicated with the Clinton, Sanders, and even other political campaigns trying to secure info. I guess there&#39;s also a point of order here if Wikileaks led us to believe they never solicit insider information. Guess I never really cared as they generally publish megadrops.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you just answered your own question by saying most. Is it collusion if he replied 3 times, acted on some of the information, and is implied but not certain used the password Wikileaks to break into a website.</p>

<p>Heck lets just break it down easy. If Jr. used the password Wikileaks gave him to access a computer network of an opposition website is that collusion?</p>

<p>Oh ok, so WikiLeaks sent Trump Jr. DMs and then deleted them. And you think this <em>helps</em> your argument?</p>

<p>Rather than play semantics, address why Assange didn&#39;t release the full messages before Trump Jr. did</p>

    <div class="md"><p>collusion
kəˈl(j)uːʒ(ə)n
noun
secret or illegal cooperation or conspiracy in order to deceive others.
&quot;the armed forces were working in collusion with drug traffickers&quot;
LAW
collusion between ostensible opponents in a lawsuit.</p>

<p>It takes two or more people getting together in secret for there to be collusion with parties acting upon said conversation. One person talking/emailing another doesn&#39;t make collusion, especially if second party doesn&#39;t act on what person has communicated.</p>

<p>Me emailing you is not collusion. If you report me for contacting you then there can be no collusion as the meeting is longer secret. You ignoring my emails is not collusion. </p>

<p>Even if answer my emails, it may not be collusion in itself as nothing I say interests you which ergo results in no action on your part. All that had happened is you&#39;ve wasted time reading or listening to banter.</p>

<p>If I tell you not to jump off a 10 story building in a secret meeting and you don&#39;t as you were not planning to in first place, that is not collusion. </p>

<p>First article names Wikileaks not Assange as the contactee. Whether this means Assange or the cleaner Wikileaks employs is contacting Junior I don&#39;t know. That if isomeone is someone working at Wikileaks doing something off his own bat we don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Second Article is way to vague on detail with one sentence being quoted to be used to convey the entire substance and intent of entire email. Whether such statement is what message conveys we would need to read entire email.</p>

<p>Examples said to prove collusion in article are inane and require suggestion as being nothing  more then Junior being interested in playing Wikileaks for what he could get out of it for himself and his father rather than collusion.</p>

<p>When Junior replied “ask around.” (the article used the word &quot;promise&quot;. Is this the journalist interpretation of Junior&#39;s words? If Junior had used word promise, why isn&#39;t the use of the word quoted from the email?) but the example that he did then ask around so is lacking. </p>

<p>All we have some anonymous source saying Junior immediately notified other senior people in the campaign that Wikileaks contacted him and then Kushner forwarded email to a communication staffer. So what? You have a prank call you&#39;d probably have to notify someone. </p>

<p>Need to see the email demonstrating that Junior asked around and replied answering what Wikileaks wanted to know in first email.
THAT WOULD BE CLEAR EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION. Mind you, if Wikileaks wanted to know anything and the whole fracas is just a rhetorical question? Again not enough information in article to makejudgement one or another on it.</p>

<p>As for Junior not rebuffing Wikileaks. Think anyone in any campaign would rebuff someone contacting them who may have credible dirt on an opponent? If  you believe politics is fair you afe delusional. All politicians throw mud if and when that is all that is left they do so abundantly.</p>

<p>As for Junior giving his father an email link within 15 mins is speculative. Need to know where Junior was in relation to father in 15 minutes time frame. If Junior was in his father&#39;s presence sure. If not in his father&#39;s presence there will be phonecall/email/SMS/tweet etc... which would verify collusion. Such evidence is not mentioned in article. Though Trump himself could have had anyone on his team tell him about Wikileaks news from looking at Julian Assange tweets or Wikileaks website itself. Wikileaks was important to both candidates. No surprise if Clinton had people keeping an eye on Wikileaks. To do so is not conclusion.</p>

<p>That Junior tweeted link out two days later is no big deal. Two days after Julian tweeted something there would be thousand of retweets Junior could have used desperate from email.</p>

<p>That Wikileaks asked Junior to dump his father&#39;s tax returns is merely what journalistic standards would demand. Trump&#39;s tax returns were being sort by every news source at time.</p>

<p>The real worry is from Wikileaks end is the story about the Ambassadorship. If true it suggests Wikileaks and Assange are prepared to dodge the truth in reporting stories. It is the following</p>

<p>&quot;in sharing its work, in contesting the results of the election, and in arranging for Julian Assange to be Australia’s ambassador to the United States.&quot;</p>

<p>First its an insane statement. </p>

<p>That or a larikin joke taken out of context. Larikin humour is Australian when you say something about a person or thing in mockingly dark terms but everyone knowing it is ridiculous knowing it&#39;s the truth, hence the humour.   </p>

<p>Officially U.S. has no control over selection of Ambassador. Officially, the U.S. can refuse an Ambassador but that is all. </p>

<p>To think an Ambassadorship could be the outcome of any collusion with Trump, then Julian Assange&#39;s mental health is deteriorating due to his imprisonment in embassy as some people have been calling out. Or the entire thing is bogus. Would like to read actual email word for word but can&#39;t. Since Iraq WMDs I need more then some journalist  telling me to trust them and that Assange wrote this in an email. Assange is an intelligent man who knows how things work in regards to Ambassadorships.</p>

<p>CIA do decide who our prime minister are. The circumstantial evidence is overwhelming. Have since Whitlam. Julia Gillard visits American embassy, has U.S. Diplomats gushing over her, and a few weeks later becomes PM after stabbing Kevin Rudd in back. So I can believe they probably choose Ambassador too.</p>

<p>But after what Assange has done to the CIA, they&#39;d kill him before doing this regardless of what The President tks them.</p>
