    <div class="md"><p>worrying about conspiracies is not a complete waste of time and id say that people arent taking them seriously enough. 
major change doesnt come from simple awareness but awareness does lead to action. unfortunately a lot of u.s citizens have CHOSEN to ignore the suffering in the world carried out by their government and thusly do not take action en masse. so the appropriate action to take on the personal level becomes unclear. 
yes of course, worry about you and yours first before you worry about some shmos on the web. what resources do you have access to? are you in a major city? near the coast? near any military bases? do you have access to land? can you grow food on it? how much food? does it have clean water access or water and filtration access? can you sustain your power needs on that land offgrid? how many people can you get to help you work this land?
 it is my opinion that the major cities, especially on the coasts, are already lost. we, as a people, need to become aware of this and take steps to secure our future in a world of 8-10ft sea level rise. 10 ft is all it takes to flood the nyc subway. even a sea level rise of 5ft would be crippling once storm surge is factored in even without factoring in rise in strength and number of storms. per year.
awareness leads to action. action is sometimes lonely and isnt always glamorous or fun. the right thing to do is often unpopular and unsafe.</p>

<p>Just stop fighting over little shit, children</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you followed the macro numbers and demographics on here, you&#39;d realize that the people &#39;fighting over little shit&#39; are not the people you should be calling to action... they are already being called and paid to be here.</p>

<p>Manipulation and &#39;online opinion shaping&#39; have become a growth industry. Over the last few weeks, i&#39;ve never seen so much chaff and manipulation on here, and honestly I think that is what you&#39;re seeing. The reason these conversations aren&#39;t seeming genuine is because they&#39;re not.</p>

<p>You can want to be a soldier/general/whatever, but if you aren&#39;t able to recognize your enemies, what good are you going to do by going to war? If you want to help, fight those who would turn this place into an echo chamber of concern trolling and baseless accusations and insinuations. Don&#39;t go after those who find it hard to keep up with the paid help.</p>

It <em>is</em> however scientificly proven that men are <em>usually</em> on average stronger physically. We per capita can handle more stress than women, its biological. That doesn&#39;t mean that there aren&#39;t feminine men, or masculine women. </p>

<p>The natives had 4 genders. Two for each sex. There were those girls who were hunters with the boys and those boys who took care of the home with the women. </p>
