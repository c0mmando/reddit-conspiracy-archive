<blockquote>
<p>Timeline 2016</p>

<p>May, when self-claimed dating agency &quot;ToddAndClare&quot; (T&amp;C) approach saying they were contacted by the Russian government.</p>

<p>Sep 3, T&amp;C email Assange’s Swedish lawyer Per Samuelson offering one million dollars for Assange to appear in a video advertisement for the &quot;dating agency&quot; ToddAndClare.com (See attachment). This is the first contact.</p>

<p>Sep 15, email sent from a member of Mr. Assange’s defence team to <a href="mailto:hannah@toddandclare.com">hannah@toddandclare.com</a> requesting further details (See attachment).</p>

<p>Sep 19, <a href="mailto:hannah@toddandclare.com">hannah@toddandclare.com</a> email with elaborate bonafides, proposed agreement and the claim that the source of the US$1 million is the Russian government. The email states that T&amp;C was approached by Russian representatives in May 2016 and that &quot;The source of the $1,000,000 is the Russian government&quot;. The email then goes on to &quot;verify&quot; bonafides by giving a detailed description of the interior of the house and desk of Mr Assange’s lawyer, Helena Kennedy, who is a member of the UK Parliament, including a reference to a photo of Tony Blair (Kennedy states that the Blair reference is accurate, although out-of-date).</p>

<p>Sep 20, a representative of Mr Assange’s defence team writes to <a href="mailto:hannah@toddandclare.com">hannah@toddandclare.com</a> stating that the proposal appears to be an &quot;elaborate scam designed to entrap Mr Assange’s reputation into unwanted and unwarranted publicity&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looks to me like the Clinton/Deep State cartel realized that WL had acquired potentially incriminating information on them and launched a preemptive smear campaign to undermine Assange&#39;s credibility. What&#39;s the worst thing they can besmirch someone&#39;s reputation with? Pedophilia (oldest trick in the book) and by god, he&#39;s working for those evil Russian bastards to boot! Very imaginative, &quot;Intelligence&quot; Community. Bang up work there.</p>

<p>Due to this blatant attack, Assange then goes all-in with the opposition, contacting Don. Jr. with helpful information for the Trump campaign. Doesn&#39;t attempt to hide this &quot;collusion&quot;, in fact tweets about it publicly at one point. Keeps his interactions within the bounds of the law, and essentially &quot;on the record&quot; by using Twitter DMs to do it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even with a quick look at the Todd &amp; Clare Facebook page, you can see it&#39;s clearly a fake company. It was very badly done.</p>

<p>The trail led to some scammer called Tunde Reid Kapo and a telephone number that was linked to a company owned by a friend of the Clintons.</p>

<p>lol Literally nothing you say supports that.</p>

<p>Man, this sub really is in full-on defense mode of Wikileaks today. Pathetic. </p>
