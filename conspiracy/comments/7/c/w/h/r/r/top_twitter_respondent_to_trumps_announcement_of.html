       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       @SLandinSoCal has a large affinity for Russian State Sponsored media and conversations with other Russian Troll Accounts:
       <a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/924765442283003905">
        https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/924765442283003905
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       And for someone in 'California', they sure keep strange hours while tweeting 16-20 hours a day:
       <a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/924765864762621952">
        https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/924765864762621952
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now this same account was the subject of an article on Media equalizer by Brian Maloney, who was either hoodwinked or in on it:
       <a href="https://mediaequalizer.com/brian-maloney/2017/09/one-users-story-how-conservatives-are-systematically-removed-from-twitter">
        https://mediaequalizer.com/brian-maloney/2017/09/one-users-story-how-conservatives-are-systematically-removed-from-twitter
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is likely a catphishing account that was re-purposed or bought considering the views associated with the profiles on FB and LinkedIn
      </p>
      <p>
       edit: considering the 0 upvotes, 70 views, and 50% upvoted stat, im guessing conspiracy is still the wrong place for this. Im open to ideas on where else to share this.
      </p>
      <p>
       edit2 for more:
this twitter account also has submissions that appear on multiple wordpress blogs, i.e.;
       <a href="https://mb50.wordpress.com/category/geopolitics/sls-rant/">
        https://mb50.wordpress.com/category/geopolitics/sls-rant/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       but at the very bottom of this 'section' there appears to be an old bit of writing written in 2013 by a greek individual. It sticks out and is completely non-sequitar with this section (all SLandinSoCal) could this be left over or an accidnetal copy paste of another document?
      </p>
      <p>
       @pctacitus
       <a href="https://twitter.com/pctacitus">
        https://twitter.com/pctacitus
       </a>
       claims to have pulled statements from the @SLandinSoCal accounts facebook page and to have discussed things with them. Yet there are no posts stating anything that was mentioned by this 'author', and the the SLandinSoCal's facebook account consistes of 30-40 'friends' usually male and from 3rd world countries...

       well you would think that someone like this would have more of an online presence considering the amount of tweets they blast out, yet cant find anything. Which is weird considering the supposed age range and demographic of the "woman" in this account.

       According to Twitter's research on the matter, the numbers generated are too low to cause alarm and have been far too low to have any significant impact on elections or public opinion. The accounts in question (Russian) made up only .012% of their accounts, and only .33% of impressions on election related tweets

       "The 36,746 automated accounts that we identified as Russian-linked and tweeting election-related content represent approximately one one-hundredth of a percent (0.012%) of the total accounts on Twitter at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 1.4 million election-related Tweets that we identified through our retrospective review as generated by Russian-linked, automated accounts constituted less than three quarters of a percent (0.74%) of the overall election-related Tweets on Twitter at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those 1.4 million Tweets received only one-third of a percent (0.33%) of impressions on election-related Tweets. In the aggregate, automated, Russian-linked, election- related Tweets consistently underperformed in terms of impressions relative to their volume on the platform."

       You said something about the creation date of my account. It didn't please you. I figured I would ask what date is pleasing. Then I proceeded to point out that during the election I didn't like Trump at all but I also didn't fall for the "blame Russia" bullshit.

       They're not necessarily all bots. Many times they are accounts controlled by real people. The idea is to mask themselves as Americans and shill for Russian interests. Unfortunately, many Americans fall for their shilling.

       Russia just wants an unstable USA. Russia gains when we're incapable of doing what needs to be done. That is all they've wanted all along. Russia never thought Trump would actually win. They wanted Hillary as the president, but with an overwhelmingly Republican congress and scandals over her head. That would have basically stalled our government in a partisan shitshow.

       You could be right. But it seems like America doesn't need Russia's help in destroying itself. It would be like me helping Tony Montana snort a line of Coke. The thing is , is that the left and right propaganda machine has been running for a long time. I'm not going to just forget about how corrupt Hillary is because she says Russia. I've seen our media complicit through sandy Hook and many other obvious propaganda pieces. Sorry if I don't buy the Russia cry from the left. They had their chance to gain trust and failed miserably.

       Russia has fed it massively. If you look at the "patriot" twitter bots that were established across the middle of America, you can see how they sowed dissent. A popular Texas twitter account was shown to be a Russian bot that constantly pushed a pro-America, anti-immigrant, anti-BLM, anti-LGBTQ message for a year.

       You didn't mention Hillary but I was using that as an example. If I say something bad about Hillary and Trump agrees, I'm spreading Russian propaganda. That's the problem. Everyone keeps blaming Russia. Everyone already had opinions. Now it seems your opinion you had for years are now Russian opinions.

       I don't think Trump liked Hillary. I doubt Russia had to do anything to convince him to not like her. But when you say "fell for" do you mean the exposure of Hillary as a criminal? That's a good thing. I've been trying to wake people up to that fact for a lot of years.

       Hillary and Trump are friends, and have been for years. That's a well-established fact.
       <br/>
       I mean, he started pushing some of the conspiracy theories that were put out there, including by retweeting Russian Twitter bots. A good example is a number of the memes he retweeted with fake crime rates of black v white people.

       One possibility is to simply sow discord among Americans.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, in a recent Senate hearing it was shown that Russian troll factories had two facebook pages that would coordinate with one another to incite protests against each other.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facebook page 'Heart of Texas', which had about 250,000 followers and was controlled by
       <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html">
        The Internet Research Agency in Russia
       </a>
       held an event called 'Stop the Islamization of Texas'
      </p>
      <p>
       On the same day, in the same location, a FB page called 'United Muslims of America' that was also under control of Russian trolls held a pro-Muslim protest called 'Save Islamic Knowledge'
      </p>
      <p>
       Real Americans left their homes to go protest. These Americans had no idea they were being manipulated by paid Russian shills.

       What I'm getting at here, is that people like Soros has been doing that shit for years. A long time. Did everyone just forget about him? This isn't new. If people don't like Hillary and want to see her pay for all the shit she did, why is that considered Russian propaganda? I have to change my ten year old opinion because Russia recently started agreeing with me?

       I'll say I didn't hear of your example so it must not have been that successful. I gave an example of how the same tactics have been used in the recent past. Remember black lives matter, occupy wall street, feminism, it goes on and on. I have research this shit for years and now all of a sudden the shit I have come to understand is considered Russian propaganda. I personally don't see what Russia has to gain. It seems like a phyops to discredit people who have come to terms about our political system. It's a new element that throws everyone through a he said she said loop with no outcome.

       Just call me a shill if you want to but I have never let my accounts age very long as I like my privacy.  But this isn't supposed to be about me I genuinely wanted to know why this matters and your answer is less than satisfactory.  "accounts to sow disinformation or create drama"  According to that statement of yours this twitter account matters because they could possible be a troll?  Because you just defined your regular old internet troll.  Why are you wanting to pretend being a troll on the internet is significant and should be investigated further?  I'll give you another chance to think of a better reason as to why this twitter account is even worth talking about.  Because it could be an "account to sow disinformation or create drama" is not something I would concern myself with.

       Russia's main goal isn't to "Help trump" it's to create division. This is also important because Twitter is a news aggregator and arguably the biggest source of news for people other than facebook. It is also very easy to make fake accounts on Twitter and create distractions and make it seem like there is more turmoil than there actually is.

       The internet, media, and government are much more divisive than my everyday neighborhood.   They make a small isolated incidents look like a vast widespread epidemic that typically stirs racial tensions and forces people to "pick a side" then the people that eat that shit up and start cheering for their side while demeaning the other side are the same people saying Russia is trying to destabilize the US.  Even though they are creating far more division and instability than any state actor from Russia.  It's very ironic.
