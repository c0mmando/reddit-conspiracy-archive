       Hello all, first post on Conspiracy, I'm fairly new to Reddit in general but I've been following this conspiracy page for a while now, I see all these posts about Shills and other Bots taking this channel over and trying to control it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just curious if anyone would be willing to point me in the direction of some forms of media that aren't smothered with shills and bots.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also have lots of confusion on whatever the hell is going on with Trump and the Russians, in my defense I don't know who to believe on these stories so I just haven't looked into it, I've mostly been following the Las Vegas shooting but I am noticing this subreddit isn't the best for valid information.

       I myself can't really spot the shills yet the only thing I notice is when usernames are something like this 84237849823548923 - Clearly a bot or something with a name like that.

       Shills deserve to be mocked. It's a great way to identify the obvious ones. It also helps that they all seem to have been born without a sense of humor. Once you have enough comment karma you can even troll them in r/politics, which is nice.

       "The mark of an educated mind is the ability to entertain a thought without accepting it" - Aristotle.
      </p>
      <p>
       That quote has been a bit of a mantra here for a long time, and I think that it's the hallmark "identifier" between a user that's here in good faith, and a user that isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe everything on here either, but I think it's pretty fun thinking about some of the things this community offers... but... there are tons of people in this community who are both completely incapable of entertaining those ideas and who want to restrict my ability to entertain/disucc those ideas with others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Identify the people who are willing to entertain ideas and you'll find the ones who are here in good faith.

       I agree, although you also have people who get offended when you provide evidence to shed doubt on certain theories.  I was recently dealing with that in regards to the LV shooting hoax theory.  Gotta take the good with the bad and keep an open mind imo.

       I have nothing but an open mind when it comes to Las Vegas because even someone who follows MSM religiously can see that there is something fishy about LV, I've tried to read every theory about the shooting with an open mind, I don't believe in verbally abusing someone over a disagreement in theories, we're all in this together and we all want the same answers, we're supposed to be a team and work together to get these corrupt leaders exposed.

       Yes and no imo, someone pointing to

        girls laughing
       </a>
       as evidence that it's a hoax isn't doing this community any justice.  Pointing out the inconsistencies with the Campos Story, Paddocks fucked up background, helicopters, other apsects... I'm totally down, but there are groups of people that try to marginalize this sub by submitting out laddish shit imo.  Everyone has different degrees of BS detectors and are interested in various conspiracies, and to each their own.  But don't think if someone is pointing out flaws in a conspiracy it's because they are a shill, maybe they are trying to separate the BS from the facts.

       For the most part I agree. The problem is when people don't just entertain these wild ideas; they internalize them, and then
