       That's interesting, basically said there are three genders, male, female and androgenous. Then some people are both with genitals that aren't strictly male or female.

       Even trying to define by chromosomes can be an issue. The Olympics tried this and then found out a large portion of their female athletes had and extra sex chromosome that wasn't expressing itself in obvious ways.

       You can look at it as a spectrum with masculinity on one side, androgynous in the middle, and feminity on the other end. Some people may completely identify with everything their culture considers masculine, but gender roles differ depending on culture. So gender is all in your head while sex is a physical thing. You can have male genitals and identify as feminine or have female genitals and identify as androgynous.

       They can personally do that, but they should never expect anyone else to go along with there made up fantasy, they shouldn't expect anyone to refer to an actual bloke as her or allow a male to use female bathrooms.

       I hope someday you become more open minded. You feel threatened by other peoples identity, I think that just shows how insecure you are about your own identity. You want to lock up people for expressing their self how they personally choose to express their self, it doesn't threaten you or children in any way. I had a college professor that was trans, she was a marine during the Iraq war and is a productive member of society doing research on behavioral modification and addiction. She is doing more good than the majority of people but you think she should be locked up even though she served her country and continues to do research that improves society.

       There will only ever be two genders and as loud as transsexuals shout about it, this will never change because taken the opinion on gender from a transsexual is the same as taking the opinion of the age of consent laws from actual pedophiles.

       What u/TallMail is saying is gender (identity) =/= sex (genitalia).
      </p>
      <p>
       There is more than one
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender">
        gender
       </a>
       (Male, Female, Trans, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       You are correct in stating (in most cases) there are only 2 sexes. There is also the occasional instance of
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex">
        intersex
       </a>
       in which a human is born with both genitalia, a combination of chromosomes (which you referred to in your comment).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, what is so wrong with someone expressing themselves to the extent that they want to put on a wig to dress as a woman, or vice versa as a man? How does that lifestyle negatively affect yours?

       Because a lot of people in this sub can't see past their cultures definitions of masculinity and feminity. They think its some liberal conspiracy, but if they visited or studied other cultures they might realize that there are many different ideas of what is masculine or feminine. We have freedom of expression some people that are born with one genitalia don't identify with the culture's expectations of them, and that's perfectly ok.

       Actually, it does, it doesn't change his biological sex but it does change his gender. If he/she chooses to identify as genderless thats completely ok, it's his/her business. It's your business what gender you want to identify as. I think you're just scared you're going to end up having sex with a transgender person lol

       There will only ever be two genders and as loud as transsexuals shout about it, this will never change because taking the opinion on gender from a transsexual is the same as taking the opinion of the age of consent laws from actual pedophiles.

       Gender roles are culturally defined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender = sex. It’s the same thing, always has been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender roles and gender identity change culture by culture and individual by individual, but you’re not magically a woman because you mutilate yourself and take hormones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender identity, like intersectionality, are two ideas that should have never found their way out of academia. People are too stupid to have subtle conversations.

       I absolutely do understand, let me explain it to you.
      </p>
      <p>
       People born with XX chromosomes are female and people born with XY chromosomes are male, this is a biological fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anything that deviates from this is nothing more than birth defects/syndromes and this is why there is only
       <strong>
        TWO
       </strong>
       sexes and
       <strong>
        TWO
       </strong>
       genders, trannies can not change their gender, them thinking so is called a mental health problem amd they should be locked up for everyone's safety.
      </p>
      <p>
       Glad I could help you out with this.

       Yes there are two biological sexes, but gender is a spectrum. Your culture defines what it means to be a man or woman, some people dont feel like they are masculine even if they were born with male genitals. So they would idenitify as a feminine man, or they would transition. I think it's funny you want to lock someone up for identifying differently than you, transgender people are people. No one is trying to take your dick away bud you are free to be as masculine as you want, just as other people are free to be however they want. It literally has no effect on you.

       No it isn't, there are only two genders, if a born male can't identify as a male then he was either born with a birth defect/syndrome or he is mentally sick in the head.

       Man you really need to read about other cultures. Step outside your narrow worldview, transsexuals are not by default pedophiles. They have no interest in you or your daughter. Worry about the actual pedophiles that will go into the female bathroom. I'm not trans but I have friends and mentors who are and they are great people doing great things, despite people like you trying to demonize them.

       It's all part of the constant effort to keep us separated. Everyone needs a boogeyman so that they don't notice the man behind the curtain. Keep your eye on the "national anthem is racist" story. This is going to be the big wedge issue to separate the country into two sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pro Anthem will see themselves as "loving america" while being called racists by the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anti Anthem will see themselves as fighting for social justice while being called anti-American by the other side.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone will be forced to choose a side by their peers. Most people will chose whatever side they are surrounded with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, as a white guy, thanks for seeing through the bullshit and not seeing us as the demons people want you to see us as. In the end we are all on the same side - the side of people.

       Because a lot of people in this sub can't see past their cultures definitions of masculinity and feminity. They think its some liberal conspiracy, but if they visited or studied other cultures they might realize that there are many different ideas of what is masculine or feminine. We have freedom of expression some people that are born with one genitalia don't identify with the culture's expectations of them, and that's perfectly ok.

       Gender roles are culturally defined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender = sex. It’s the same thing, always has been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender roles and gender identity change culture by culture and individual by individual, but you’re not magically a woman because you mutilate yourself and take hormones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gender identity, like intersectionality, are two ideas that should have never found their way out of academia. People are too stupid to have subtle conversations.
