    <div class="md"><p>You can look at it as a spectrum with masculinity on one side, androgynous in the middle, and feminity on the other end. Some people may completely identify with everything their culture considers masculine, but gender roles differ depending on culture. So gender is all in your head while sex is a physical thing. You can have male genitals and identify as feminine or have female genitals and identify as androgynous. </p>

I had a college professor that was trans, she was a marine during the Iraq war and is a productive member of society doing research on behavioral modification and addiction.

<p>There is more than one <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender">gender</a> (Male, Female, Trans, etc.)</p>

<p>You are correct in stating (in most cases) there are only 2 sexes. There is also the occasional instance of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex">intersex</a> in which a human is born with both genitalia, a combination of chromosomes (which you referred to in your comment).</p>

<p>Also, what is so wrong with someone expressing themselves to the extent that they want to put on a wig to dress as a woman, or vice versa as a man? How does that lifestyle negatively affect yours?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it does, it doesn&#39;t change his biological sex but it does change his gender. If he/she chooses to identify as genderless thats completely ok, it&#39;s his/her business. It&#39;s your business what gender you want to identify as.

<p>How would that even be possible, some guy who is an obvious male, who mutilates his body and ends up with literally an open wound, that is what gender &quot;reassignment&quot; surgery actually is, they end up with a fucking gaping wound that constantly tries to heal itself.</p>

<p>People born with XX chromosomes are female and people born with XY chromosomes are male, this is a biological fact.</p>

<p>Anything that deviates from this is nothing more than birth defects/syndromes and this is why there is only <strong>TWO</strong> sexes and <strong>TWO</strong> genders, trannies can not change their gender, them thinking so is called a mental health problem amd they should be locked up for everyone&#39;s safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes there are two biological sexes, but gender is a spectrum. Your culture defines what it means to be a man or woman, some people dont feel like they are masculine even if they were born with male genitals. So they would idenitify as a feminine man, or they would transition. I think it&#39;s funny you want to lock someone up for identifying differently than you, transgender people are people. No one is trying to take your dick away bud you are free to be as masculine as you want, just as other people are free to be however they want. It literally has no effect on you. </p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t, there are only two genders, if a born male can&#39;t identify as a male then he was either born with a birth defect/syndrome or he is mentally sick in the head.</p>

<p>People aren&#39;t stupid, you are not going to convince anyone that there is more than two genders because this is a biological fact that can not change.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because a lot of people in this sub can&#39;t see past their cultures definitions of masculinity and feminity. They think its some liberal conspiracy, but if they visited or studied other cultures they might realize that there are many different ideas of what is masculine or feminine. We have freedom of expression some people that are born with one genitalia don&#39;t identify with the culture&#39;s expectations of them, and that&#39;s perfectly ok.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gender roles are culturally defined.</p>

<p>Gender = sex. It’s the same thing, always has been. </p>

<p>Gender roles and gender identity change culture by culture and individual by individual, but you’re not magically a woman because you mutilate yourself and take hormones. </p>

<p>Gender identity, like intersectionality, are two ideas that should have never found their way out of academia. People are too stupid to have subtle conversations. </p>
