     <div class="card-body md">
      <p>
       First, George W. Bush. I will quote the details below, which come from the Wikileaks Global Intelligence Files here:
       <a href="https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/47/475107_agents-bush-firings-obstructed-sex-spy-probe-.html">
        https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/47/475107_agents-bush-firings-obstructed-sex-spy-probe-.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        According to U.S. intelligence sources, President Bush obstructed justice
last December when he had senior advisor Karl Rove and White House Counsel
Harriet Miers instruct Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez to fire eight
U.S. attorneys who were among several others conducting ongoing public
corruption and secret national security grand jury investigations
connected to an espionage linked prostitution / pedophile sex ring
operating at the Washington Ritz-Carlton and other DC hotels, whose
clients included U.S. senators and congressmen, elite Washington news
reporters and high government officials some of whom were named by an
intelligence insider.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       And look what is claimed in the second part of the file:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Central to the scandal is fired U.S. attorney Carole Lam of California who
was reportedly conducting testimony before grand juries linking indicted
former Bush CIA Executive Director Kyle Dustya Foggo and convicted
Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff to the sex ring, Israeli espionage, GOP
Under Secretary of Defense for policy Douglas J. Feith, a forged British
intelligence dossier used by Mr. Bush to deceive Americans into supporting
war against Iraq and an attempt to plant weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
in Iraq before the war via an intelligence pipeline through Dubai and
Turkey.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Using a forged British intelligence dossier to deceive Americans into supporting an Iraq invasion AND an attempt to plant WMDs in Iraq? Hmm, very interesting.
      </p>
      <h1>
       Moving on
      </h1>
      <p>
       Who else has been accused of a similar obstruction of justice into almost identical crimes? Hillary Clinton, while Secretary of State. This story originally broke on NBC with a report by Chuck Todd. Interestingly enough, the video of the report has largely been scrubbed from the internet, and Youtube users that shared the video have had their accounts suspended. Luckily, I was able to find one which is still up, and part of the video is transcribed below:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hubT6i30WDE">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hubT6i30WDE
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "There is an old saying in Washington that the cover-up is worse than the crime. But in this case both parts of it are disturbing,” Chuck Todd continued.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Allegations of prostitution and pedophilia, and allegations that those crimes were somehow covered up or not looked into. So the State Department this morning is having to respond to those claims, and those investigations involve misconduct by State Department officials, including an Ambassador and security agents attached to then secretary of state, Hillary Clinton.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “The allegations are that these investigations were whitewashed, quashed altogether, and that those orders came from high up.”
       </p>
       <p>
        “NBC has obtained documents relating to ongoing investigations into some disturbing allegations involving State Department personnel and at least one ambassador. A State Department memo says, quote, “the Ambassador routinely ditched his protective security detail in order to solicit sexual favors from both prostitutes and minor children.
       </p>
       <p>
        “The memo also says a top State Department official directed State Department investigators to “cease the investigation” into the ambassador’s conduct.” It’s just one of what another document describes as “several examples of undue influence” from top State Department officials.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Is anybody noticing a familiar trend? If you're truly non-partisan, then you'll push to have all sides of our government held accountable for participating in and covering up these heinous acts. It truly is a non-partisan issue, and the truth needs to come to light

       Money shot right here.  The intentional misdirection by some "users" here to turn arguments (such as ElsaGate) into a Dems vs Repubs argument is a divide and conquer technique.  Please don't fall for it, guys.

      <p>
       Also, if I may take the time to say fuck Bush and his administration in particular for pushing for a false war that got a few of my friends killed.  And fuck you too Obama for giving people false hope of actually pulling out of Iraq/Afghan.  Finally, fuck both of you for murdering the 4th amendment.

       <p>
        So you wanna prove Pedogate on Clinton with a fake sex tape, but wanna cover for real cases like Moore's with fake tweets?

       <p>
        Is that it Drone? Is that defeating the Deep State?
