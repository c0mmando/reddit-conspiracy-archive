       Yeah, you're probably close to being the only one. But then again, I've never understood why anyone would watch a movie they've already seen, so I may have no idea what I'm talkÄ«ng about.

       And entertainment, for that matter. Cut off cable. Refuse to pay for movie tickets. Get involved and support local theater, learn how to play pinochle and throw parlor parties. Join a book club. I know it sounds terribly old fashioned, but there is no reason to support Hollywood if you find it morally reprehensible. And it's not that hard to walk away.

       First off, I'm gonna need a source on that. Second, just like in Hollywood, not EVERYONE in EVERY studio is involved or has been covering up for pedophiles. The consumer might have to do a little more research to make a more ethical purchase but surely there's still child abuse free media companies out there we can pick from without totally abandoning a hobby or interest.

       He said it's overdiagnosed, which I agree with. Nowadays doctors are a lot more cautious with it though. Now they try to overdiagnose people with autism and shit. I know a guy who's a million times more normal than I am, and he's somehow diagnosed with autism and ADD and he used to take ritalin and is getting MMJ. Lucky fucker.

       I donât watch many Twitch streams, but I have been watching the Rocket League championship series when it goes out. They are tweaking soooo hard on adhd meds their hands are constantly shaking. Iâm going out on a limb here and assuming that all e-sports pros are the same way. The few times Iâve taken adderall Iâve been on such another level.

       Local theater is awesome. I took a course in college because I wanted to try different things and I thought going to the plays would be lame and a waste of time. It's literally like watching a tv show live. Love it.

       All I see these days are over-the-top CGI, over-choreographed action scenes that lose all impact and tension as they further become more and more "processed" and completely lose any amount of meaning or soul, and a botched together series of events losely tied to eachother in a way that can constitute an hour and a half of attention keeping for the regular American audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are still a few gems from time to time, like music, but these days movies have generally become completely sterile.

       you guys are missing out. If you watch a few here and there, you can see in the plot and the characters, how Hollyweird is programming/brainwashing America with female princess syndrome, joining the military, making it cool to be a weak beta male who cant ever get a gf, cultural marxism, making sure you realize the importance of continuing to be a wage/debt slave and stay in your place, and so on

       Sounds about where we were when I still watched "commercial release" movies upwards of 8 years ago, though the trailers and brief reviews I see definitely speak to how much it's been dialed up in such a small amount of time.

       It's not hard to understand; it's a byproduct of globalization. Simplified plots ladden with action scenes are easily translated into other languages and cultures.
      </p>

       And they're less likely to run afoul of overzealous censors, mainly in China.

       Redlettermedia really hit the nail on the head of the international success of recent movies compared to that of local/US, they specifically went into detail about how some Marvel movies (or some odd B-Movie type wanna be Marvel "blockbusters") were practically created to be marketed and profited from Chinese markets. Thanks for reminding me of that.

       Weirdly, right before the accusations came out, my eldest daughter put on "The Life of David Gale" and I could only get part way through. It's funny that she found it at Wal-Mart in the $3 bin.

       Isn't it? Getting rid of stock or preemptive move, I don't know. Maybe even my own daughter knowing we were about to hang out out with family members that are huge Spacey fan/supporters- one of which fell to tears at a dinner party because she was so hurt that Spacey ruined her "image of him".

       I mean, I just keep seeing examples on how celebrity worship might not be the healthiest thing in the world, psychologically (though no judgement against said family member.)
      </p>
      <p>
       My own childhood action hero/pseudo role model might have been "ruined" for me as well now. Not that I'm even invested emotionally to any larger extent. Hollywood began to look incredibly shallow a long time ago, and it's embarrasing to be a human sometimes when looking at all the zealousness, hypocrisy and these celeb "beef" and "scandals" making the tabloid news close to a headline or article about some flood, earthquake and deaths in some country a little closer to the equator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Politics in award shows, and highschool like shit throwing between celebrities. Exchange of smug comments and passive aggressiveness. It's incredibly boring and disheartening to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like to think there are some of them are still "good" and trying to bring attention to some alturistic cause, but I can never know whether it's genuine or not.

       Is the art of someone who does bad things bad itself?  An argument against is that the art is no longer owned by the artist, it is owned by us all.  Love it or hate it, it is up to each of us to decide.

       Good point.  I saw a rumor about another possible perp the other day and felt something close to grief that some of my favorite childhood films could potentially be tarnished.

       Made me wonder if huge swathes of films could have at least some kind of tangential connection and question how I would deal with it.

       Honestly, the whole Hollywood charade has never been my deal and the last few years the embedded propoganda in most mainstream films is really uncomfortable for me sit through so I just avoid it. I'm grateful that I came to this conclusion years ago and haven't given a penny to them for as long as I can remember.

       30 years running and it feels amazing.
       <br/>
       I've seen almost nothing out of Hollywood since 1984 or so.
       <br/>
       I've never seen an entire star wars film and have seen zero minutes of any star trek film.
       <br/>
       People seem dumber and dumber as time goes on, the way they worship hollywood. It's disgusting and pathetic.

       Yes, almost exclusively non-fiction.  I love very low budget films, especially from the 50s and 60s.
       <br/>
       ''A Bucket of Blood'' was made in 4 days on a budget of $5000, and a crew of about 10 people. That is called making a film. Ignore the title and watch that masterpiece with your friends. Every shot is first take.
       <br/>
       Hollywood films have 1000+ people in the credits, and have little to no artistry or creativity. I like art made with guts.
       <br/>
       I love lots of kinds of music. I make art as well. I grow plants. I love the quiet of being far from modern conveniences, electricity, roads, and any other traces of humans.
       <br/>
       I have spent years of my life off the grid with no electricity.
       <br/>
       I raised my daughter with no sitting in front of the TV, ever. She runs rings around her peers intellectually. We played lots of board games and read lots of books. I took her to see the ballet, the opera, symphony, avant garde jazz, world folk music, museums, and whatnot. I am a long haired alternative type, but know how to chameleon my way into any culture scene. Real life is way better than TV and movies.

       May your life and your family be blessed.  We also left popular culture including music and television and movies and were homeschooled.  Of all the gifts from my parents, this I value the most.  The gift of an independent mind.

       I would spend money and see one movie in a theater a year, a nice treat for a person not big into TV or movies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local theater does $5 Tuesdays and have seen a lot more recently, and they all suck ass. Every move has the same direction of how the movie plays out. Nothing is original anymore and with  100 years of movies you think they would be more realistic when it came to things.

       I'm feeling it---While I was watching "Stranger Things" after it came back, half the time I'm thinking "Did all these kids get raped?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Especially "Eleven" and the new little redhead girl, who is adorable looking but not a good actress at all. I can't imagine how competitive it must've been among the kid crowd to get into the second season of "Stranger Things," right?
      </p>
      <p>
       You can pretty much presume every kid actor who's gone on to adult stardom was a victim. It's sick.
      </p>
      <p>
       But now we're hearing rumors of Bruce Willis? Harrison Ford? It sounds crazy, but when you read the connected dots, see how many kids they worked with and who those kids are....holy shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will be very very sad if I can never watch "Die Hard" or "Moonlighting" or the Indiana Jones movies anymore. But I'd rather know the truth and see justice than live a lie. I hope we all feel that way.

       Can you imagine if it comes out that the kids from Stranger Things were hurt? They have a hoard of fans who would literally destroy anyone who hurt them.
      </p>

       God I hope no one put their hands on those kids, but if it turns out they did, I really can't wait to see the bloodshed when the news gets out.

       Really? You had no idea until now? That sounds like complete bullshit. It wasn't obvious who all the perpetrators were. But if seeing one child star after another get fucked in the head before 20 wasn't ringing any alarm bells, you weren't really paying attention anyway and won't give a shit after all the news blows over.

       I was never really into movies, certainly not celebrities, but itâs one thing to have a general idea that everyone is messed up in the head and another to hear very specific and verified accusations about people who have been icons for decades - and that they are not just junkie drama queens but sexual predators.

       No, it was orchestrated. The narrative that some ladies suddenly felt brave enough to announce they'd been forced to look at Louis CK's dick is ridiculous. Who gives a fuck. How could you not just feel sorry for him? He's the court jester. The deep state has killed the court jester. That's how you know your country is over.

       You didn't ruin my story, I was giving examples which you should have the power to extrapolate from.
      </p>
      <p>
       But let me give you some examples that will work for you. Assuming you are of breeding age and managed to lasso some hapless fool, perhaps you were on the rage some time, your emotions got the best of you, and you made your significant other's night a livving hell one time. His night would have been infinitely better if he had been forced to look at a dick rather than spend it with you. Or perhaps you told your mother you "hate" her and she now permanently lives with a complex. That greatest likelihood is that you committed some act of evil that you're not even aware of, yet should completely be held accountable for. Just saying, you're definitely a creep whether you know it or not.

       My friends have also been sharing stories and talking about our experiences more. I have had experiences that I have never told my husband or close male friends because I was afraid of their reaction and seeing them angry, hurt and helpless. The #metoo campaign opened up the dialogue more and gave us a way to tell them without detail while showing them how prevalent it is. I have a lot of male friends that have also endured sexual assault and abuse, but none of them posted #metoo. It makes me feel really sad for them that they don't feel comfortable enough to be part of the conversation and get the support they deserve.

       Take heart, you're not alone or Hollywood wouldn't be having one of the most disasterous and disappointing seasons it's ever had in decades if the level of public outrage and disgust about what has come to light wasn't running high.
      </p>
      <p>
       You may not know it, but ticket sales and the profits of movie making were extremely high during the depression and WWII as people flocked to the movies as a distraction and a brief respite from the fear and uncertainty of everyday life beck then despite how hard it was to scrimp and scrape up the money for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd have to say the level of fear and uncertainty is probably running just as high these days but rather than looking for distractions and escapist fare, far more people are digging in and paying attention to what's actually going on. Back then people took whatever the MSM reported as the gospel, now there's hardly a person that doesn't realize that the news is being manipulated in order to manipulate them. There are also growing numbers that are beginning to see that movies and entertainment are in the same game.

       This, and Hollywood hasn't produced a film worth its ticket price in decades (with some, mostly minor, exceptions).
      </p>
      <p>
       Why watch a crappy new Hollywood flick when I can watch a good classic Hollywood film at home, and pay less than I would at the theatre? Or explore independent/YouTube/foreign films at home, on my own time, as many times as I want?
      </p>
      <p>
       If theatres began showing classic Hollywood films they might make up for lost ticket sales. I would happily fork over cash to see some of my old favorites on the big screen. Some theatres are already doing this, but they are few and far between.
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking at my DVD/BD/VHS collection, it is rare to find anything past the 1970s. Some films I took a chance on, but few of any newer films have re-watchability.

       There's nothing quite like being in a packed theatre and watching a very interesting or amusing play being put on by live actors on stage except for perhaps attending an equally good movie you could say the same thing about with a good crowd of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       In sports when the home team is winning the stadium is always full. Any good experience grows with the number of people who happen to share in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Attendance is down and dwindling in movie theatres due to the lack of substance in far too much of what's being produced. That's why the experience doesn't measure up, not some audience of
       <em>
        strangers

       Same here. I haven't watched TV for years and hardly ever use my Netflix subscription. And my taste in music is mostly Indie Folk.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every time I think of different movies now I can't help immediately thinking those actors and actresses have been abused at some point. My movie experience is totally ruined now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe it isn't so bad in the Indie film industry or even foreign films which I enjoy. Hollywood copies most foreign films anyway and the originals are usually way better.

       Havnt owned a television in 15 or 20 years. Maybe went to 1-2 movies in that time, but only if asked by friends.

       When i go to my sisters, they leave the TV on all day. Even commercials are weird. Fuck, especially the commercials. Like a commercial for cleaning products has these weird racial overtones, and another commercial for some fucked up drug has some subtle commentary on feminism, or politics. Or like the lumber 84 or whatever was about immigration.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it there and im bewildered, and the rest of the fam doesnt notice, or thinks its normal. Or their so used to not paying attention to it, that they use that as subliminal programming or some shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its fucking weird.

       I've had similar experiences going over to visit my parents. Each night, they sit in front of the television and watch hours and hours of clear propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice all males are protrayed as Homer Simpsons, dumb as a nail next to their smart and sophisticated wife. Notice the inclusion of non-traditional families in every commercial. Notice how every television show includes a gay or transgender character. Notice how they trash any sort of belief in God as an uncivilized unintelligent item of the past.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, it has always been this way. But you and I---we've been away long enough that we can come to it now and see it for what it is. Unfortunately, I feel that I kid myself sometimes thinking I can escape its grasp. It's certainly not just television and Hollywood. It's the record labels, publishing houses, radio (with exception of some talk radio and nutty voices on the shortwave band), newspapers, magazines, podcasts, old media, new media. On and on. Sometimes I think it would be easier to give up and join the masses.

       A similarly sinister area to research is what they call Nudging. It's disturbing just how pervasive it is, and how open Governments and workplaces are about modifying peoples behaviour. Truly the mundanity of evil at work in those organisations.

       This is one of most ignorant things I've ever seen posted on this sub and many of the comments are equally moronic! Obviously non of you work in Film or Television.  Do any of you realize how huge the FILM/TV industry is?  First of all,  just because all these stories are coming out of the woodwork doesn't mean it's rampant in the industry and definitely not the norm.  Let me put it into perspective for you.  For every one of these reports that have come out there are easily 1,000 cases where women and men gladly and willingly exchanged sex for opportunity and even initiated it or instigated it. How many women have come forward to admit they willingly sucked a dick in exchange for a role or even to be put into consideration? ZERO. Does that mean it hasn't happened?   Trust me, Rose McGowan,  your Joan of Arc of victims has willing used sex to advance her career for years!  The only reason we are hearing from her now is because she can't get work.  She hooked up with a married Robert Rodriguez and got him to leave his wife and family.  Then when she got pregnant, she got an abortion without telling him and that was ultimately the reason they broke up.  All these stories,  although troubling and unfortunate are very much the exception to the norm and are being used to distract weakminded people from bigger and more sinister realities. Hollywood employes MILLIONS of hard working,  dedicated and creative people.  It's an AMERICAN INDUSTRY and part of our history.  You are going to boycott all movies because a bunch of rich and powerful asshole used their position to get some sex?  Are you going to boycott voting or participating in government and politics?  I can assure you that the rich and powerful assholes in government are much worse than these stories coming out.  The pedophile capital of the the US is in D. C. and there are no shortage of stories about interns getting sexually harassed and getting taken advantage of and it goes all the way up to the White House. Harvey Weinstein was the head of a movie studio,  that's the top of the pyramid. That studio employs thousands and thousands of honest hard working people,  so are you going to punish them for the actions of one prick? Yeah that's really smart.

       when was the last time Hollywood made a truly good movie like Braveheard, Shawshank Redemption? I mean it's all virtue signaling stupid shit now or dumb comedies that aren't even funny.

       After years of not going to movies and never having access to cable unless I was visiting I take myself to the movies at least two times a month and now have lots of tv channels to chose to watch the latest idiocy. I enjoy being manipulated as well as understanding the method of manipulation.  What I really have been focused on is movies made before, during and immediately after WWII, especially those picturing agriculture. You get to see crudely packaged propaganda and great old tools. Completely worth it.  Loved the new blade runner, deeply philosophical movie!

       There are some movies that will always hold a place in my heart, but it's hard to watch them anymore. Same with TV. Richard Dreyfuss just got outed for exposing himself which makes my all time movie (Close Encounters) super awkward to watch.

       A lot of this stuff has been dying for me for a long time. I'm really not into movies to start with. I've cut down on a lot of the tv shows I watch. I love music, just don't have any that are really huge at the moment.

       1 in 3 women are sexually assaulted at least once. 1 rape occurs in the USA every 98 seconds.  Why would we expect Hollywood or politics to not be reflective of this?
The only positive to come out of this, is that it forces some kind of behaviorial change in society.. "don't be a Weinstein"

       Oh well, it's not even hard to boycott Hollywood these days... I haven't seen a good movie in decades!
They basically self-imposed a boycott by propagandizing and dumbing-down to the extreme EVERY single movie they make.

       Wonder Woman was the first film I'd seen theatrically since 2013.  I used to see 3-4 movies per year.  It's not because of the pedo stuff but just because the films themselves suck so much now that I'd prefer to spend my time in other ways.

       I've always watched independent films, so big Hollywood movies are like movie theater popcorn, slightly gratifying but really just unhealthy. HBO has been making great content, and Netflix is upping the game. If you listen to actors and directors, getting an HBO/Netflix/Hulu deal is where the quality work is.

       No way man.  I can't wait for the 900th 'reboot' of Spiderman or Batman.  Maybe to keep it hip and trendy they can make the hero a transgender.

       I think one problem is that we all think Hollywood was "infiltrated" by sexual deviants and pedophiles (satanists, occultists, whatever you want to call them) pretty sure it was started by and for them. As soon as they realized what a great tool for control and influence film and televison could be, they jumped on it. It's always been this way, for some reason they are letting it become mainstream knowledge right now...I'm wondering why.

       Isn't it? Getting rid of stock or preemptive move, I don't know. Maybe even my own daughter knowing we were about to hang out out with family members that are huge Spacey fan/supporters- one of which fell to tears at a dinner party because she was so hurt that Spacey ruined her "image of him".

       I have yet to meet a man who hasn't done something evil, and I've been around a long time. So what you've said doesn't mean anything to me, since I know you're definitely a creep without even meeting you.
