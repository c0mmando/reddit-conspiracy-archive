       So I came across the whole 'elsagate' thing here on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       today and decided to look into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       After reading several of the comments from the reddit AMA post about ELSAGATE somebody mentioned that the kids gymnastics scene was ripe with perverts and paedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I run a blog where I blog about child abuse and stuff like that, so I thought I'd set out to do my research for a potential new story and some of the stuff I came across was vile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only do these kids gymnastic videos have over inflated views (I didn't know gymnastics were that popular) but the comments in some of those videos are honestly vile, people time stamping the videos in the comments to show young girls in perverted positions, not only that but the thumbnails and recommended videos seems disgusting.
      </p>
      <p>
       It lead down a very dark/horrible hole and frankly I had to stop watching after a couple of videos. It's scary that so many people can comment on a public social media platform and not be afraid to air their disgustings views and taste in children.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing is for sure, my kids will NEVER EVER be taking part in gymnastics, worrying to say the least.

       I think i'm good on that. To be honest, I'm not really surprised that kind of stuff aint taken down because it fits with the needed narrative of forced helplessness and child indoctrination.

       It's disgusting, I can't ever see it being taken down either because it's not wrong in and of itself it's the people watching and their perverted minds.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like all the paedophiles are flocking to these videos, it's just shocking how many of them there are. I knew there were peado's and a lot of them but I think this is some sort of epidemic.

       The even sadder thing is that the pedo subject is so dark and twisted that most uninitiated people instantly turn away and hide their heads in the sand. I have tried explaining the thing to my work colleagues and its close to impossible to convince them.

      <p>
       I personally download xhamster, xvideo porn vids, I like normal dildo vids, the websites suck to download from, anyway. I use a website called Savido. One time I went to Savido's youtube side (non-nonchalantly just trying to download dragon ball super episode before youtube copyright people ripped it off the web), go look at savido youtube recently downloaded and recommendations, you will back out as fast as I did.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit is absolutely fucking demented, and now I have to create a phony porn account on all these websites to download a 240p version of the video :(. Fucking creeps yo, I just want to see matures getting porked.
