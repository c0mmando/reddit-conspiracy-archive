    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure to some degree. The foundational nature of government is conspiracy, if ya think about it. And like all other conspiracies, there will be efforts to conceal and distract. This is what makes the idea of the crazy tin foil hat conspiracy theorist false. Not saying we don&#39;t have crazies, but to pretend like the world isn&#39;t built on conspiracies is by far the crazier position.</p>

Why risk it?&quot; &quot;The investigation is still ongoing, of course not everything makes sense&quot; It&#39;s always some kind of generic preloaded bullshit like that.

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s usually both, the maniacs are given the means and material support to carry out atrocities by our own &#39;Intelligence&#39; communities in order to support their claims that the removal of our rights and privacy is in our own best interest rather than their own. If any of these sponsored terrorists actually had a 20% chance of attacking a target that would actually further their aims, like a Govt. institution directly involved in the destruction of their homelands and cultures, they&#39;d probably never even be heard about. Straight to Guantanamo with them.  </p>

<p>While the public can be hoodwinked into believing that the actions of our respective deep state actors is for <em>our</em> benefit the charade will continue and the public will continue to pay the price of their treachery. It&#39;s only treason if they attack the leaders, the useful idiots who are blindly defending their acts are fair game and &#39;collateral damage&#39; in their power plays.  </p>

<p>Not to sound like a tinfoil hatter, but why is &quot;tinfoil&quot; used as the ultimate insult to conspiracy theorists? I haven&#39;t researched where the term came from (CIA?) but it would be interesting to find out what prompted it&#39;s mainstream use.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It comes from an old conspiracy regarding radio wave mind control. And there are currently people that believe they are targeted individuals of EM radiation attacks of various kinds, there are subreddits that focus on this type of thing, and countermeasures which include something we could think of as an actual tin foil hat. And tbh, it was generally thought they were <em>actually</em> kinda bonkers until the recent attacks in Cuba. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>most immigrant sexual attacks are not paid medial attention to. if they are there is always stuff like &quot;germans do so to&quot;, and at least &quot;its an isolated case&quot; even if there are about 2-xx attacks per day. if you point this stuff out you get called nazi immediately as you attack poor refugees. if you tell them &quot;i dont talk about refugees, i talk about criminal migrants and only them.&quot; you still get called out and they ignore what u just said.
they tell us since the beginning that these are all qualified employees and doctors whatsoever and that they are what germany needed so desperately. then they tell us after 100 of such glorifying news &quot;oh out of a sudden they dont seem to be, they dont even went to school nor do they want to work&quot; next day it starts over.</p>

<p>propaganda ala &quot;germans dont think about migrant crisis&quot; and ~10 minutes after &quot;most germans are afraid of migrant crisis&quot; from SAME outlet. </p>

<p>and now it comes:
the munich shopping mall shooter. EVERYWHERE communicated as David S.
whilst his real name is Ali Davoud Sonboli.
one might ask why is that? i can answer you, ~2 weeks ago they started bring on radio and news outlets &quot;researchers are now sure, it was a 100% rightwing shooting, theres absolutely no doubt david s. is a full blown nazi&quot;
theres your answer. its easier to just eat it if a david s. is a nazi than a ali davoud sonboli.
they forget to tell that he got harassed for years by whatever ppl like from albania, turkish ppl whatever. thats why he had cruel on them. beside the fact that this whole case screams for mossad(richard gutjahr was right in place same as his daughter(just like in FR-Nice Truck plot what a coincedence with his mossad wife!)</p>
