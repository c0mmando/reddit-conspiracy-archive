       You'll have to be patient... it was dark and people were filming with cellphone cameras... but I'm sure that  the one dude that had a tripod mounted high speed camera setup perfectly to catch slo-mo video of a bullet travelling in midair and then penetrating a body will release the video that will appease you...
      </p>
      <p>
       And I have a feeling that if you saw a video of doctor removing a bullet you would just say it was other footage unrelated to this particular shooting.

       A real killing field isn't the same as a mass shooting crime scene... this shooting was a one sided affair. I can understand you questioning the official story... but I can't understand what kind of insane logistical nightmare that you think must have had to happen to fake this entire affair with no actual injuries. I know this sub ain't the place for Occam's Razor, but to pull off such a perfect open air hoax in an uncontrolled public environment would have required so many accomplices and so many sleights of hand that no one would be crazy enough to even dream of attempting it.

       More like Sandy Hook Extreme Ultra Super Street Fighter Edition 2.0... Sandy Hook was a tiny little box that could be neatly closed and dozed without too many prying eyes seeing what was inside... a totally reasonable hoax to attempt...  this happened in front of tens of thousands of wild civilian eyes in a city loaded with video surveillance. On a difficulty scale Sandy Hook was 3/10 and this is pushing a 9/10... You couldn't dream up a more inconvenient way to fake the killing of 60 people.

       You have to pay out for real lawsuits from the real victim's families, as opposed to settling with the fake families for $0.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, some real stubborn families will investigate further and not accept a cash settlement. If they find out the truth that the government killed their loved one, then you will have to kill them too.

       The payouts are miniscule compared to whatever government agenda they're after. 60 family payouts at $1-$2 million each? Compared to a multi billion dollar deal to have x-ray and back scatter scanners in hotels, schools, malls. To take away our 2nd amendment rights is such a small price to pay...

       But I'm not going to risk my life, and neither are you, trying to hiring private investigators, calling relevant companies and people,  demanding answers from police, doctors, EMTs who were present, security, Mandalay Bay, gun sellers, ballistics experts.  Some of the people who lost real family members would go through all that trouble and cost and risk.  Then you have to kill them before they find the truth.

       And actually I'd think legitimate lawsuits and payouts would make it easier to secure a multi-billion dollar x-ray and back scanner deals for hotels, casinos, etc. The plaintiffs are essentially making their case for them.

       My gf had a friend in high school that was there, she was shot but not killed, she was shot in the head and caused one eye to be permanently blind but apparently she has a chance to see out of her other.  This post is stupid.  The whole thing reeks but what makes you think the TPTB wouldn't kill citizens to push an agenda?

       None of the wounded that I've seen on TV have real injuries. They are faking it so hard, it's not even funny. When people are injured, they move differently. Simply put: they avoid moving the areas that are injured--because, well, it hurts like a SoB. There's also visual swelling and different levels of skin discoloration. These are bad actors. Why don't TPTB hire movement and acting coaches to sell the story better? This is just sloppy work.

       My grandmother told me she saw my cousin and her boyfriend (who were shot) at the hospital down there.

       So you are correct, and maybe it is a hoax, because I didn't pull the bullet out myself.

       But I trust my grandmother over what I read here. I certainly don't think we're getting (or ever going to get) the truth about what happened there. But people were hurt.

       More like Sandy Hook Extreme Ultra Super Street Fighter Edition 2.0... Sandy Hook was a tiny little box that could be neatly closed and dozed without too many prying eyes seeing what was inside... a totally reasonable hoax to attempt...  this happened in front of tens of thousands of wild civilian eyes in a city loaded with video surveillance. On a difficulty scale Sandy Hook was 3/10 and this is pushing a 9/10... You couldn't dream up a more inconvenient way to fake the killing of 60 people.
