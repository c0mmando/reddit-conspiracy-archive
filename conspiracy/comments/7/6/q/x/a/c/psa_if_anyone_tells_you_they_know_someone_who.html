    <div class="md"><p>A real killing field isn&#39;t the same as a mass shooting crime scene... this shooting was a one sided affair. I can understand you questioning the official story... but I can&#39;t understand what kind of insane logistical nightmare that you think must have had to happen to fake this entire affair with no actual injuries. I know this sub ain&#39;t the place for Occam&#39;s Razor, but to pull off such a perfect open air hoax in an uncontrolled public environment would have required so many accomplices and so many sleights of hand that no one would be crazy enough to even dream of attempting it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay I&#39;m not going to say I know anyone that was there, but one of the victims lived in my city, went to the same school as my relatives, there parents own a business in town, and are well known in the community, and the victims funeral service, and burial location is public knowledge.</p>

<p>How does that work?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>None of the wounded that I&#39;ve seen on TV have real injuries. They are faking it so hard, it&#39;s not even funny. When people are injured, they move differently. Simply put: they avoid moving the areas that are injured--because, well, it hurts like a SoB. There&#39;s also visual swelling and different levels of skin discoloration. These are bad actors. Why don&#39;t TPTB hire movement and acting coaches to sell the story better? This is just sloppy work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My grandmother told me she saw my cousin and her boyfriend (who were shot) at the hospital down there. </p>

<p>So you are correct, and maybe it is a hoax, because I didn&#39;t pull the bullet out myself. </p>

<p>But I trust my grandmother over what I read here. I certainly don&#39;t think we&#39;re getting (or ever going to get) the truth about what happened there. But people were hurt. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>More like Sandy Hook Extreme Ultra Super Street Fighter Edition 2.0... Sandy Hook was a tiny little box that could be neatly closed and dozed without too many prying eyes seeing what was inside... a totally reasonable hoax to attempt...  this happened in front of tens of thousands of wild civilian eyes in a city loaded with video surveillance. On a difficulty scale Sandy Hook was 3/10 and this is pushing a 9/10... You couldn&#39;t dream up a more inconvenient way to fake the killing of 60 people. </p>
