       - I'm actually not sure why youtube hasn't demonetized or banned this account, although I'm glad they haven't, but they cover government and big corp conspiracies in a very careful and well researched manner. It's a very active channel and they post a new video almost every day.

       - a libertarian anarchist who discusses government propaganda/conspiracies, cryptocurrencies, and explores voluntary solutions to societal issues (like Corbett). He has been having some really great guests on his show including Scott Horton, Ron Paul, James Corbett and Roger Ver. Also check out his recent episode on the Vegas shooting, he is a Las Vegas native and has the most insightful theory that I've heard on what happened.

       I've been a subscriber to the Corbett Report for years now. While I appreciate their independent angle, it's clear they are heavily partisan. They're farther right than Fox news, and have freed themselves from the chains of any journalistic integrity. I have been put off many times by right-wing speculation presented as fact, especially during the 2016 election.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, their coverage of past conspiracies like 9/11 and JFK is pretty good.

       Thank you, for a brief moment I was second guessing myself...
      </p>
      <p>
       I skimmed that account to find an agenda. 5 yr acct who first started posting on linux &amp; tech subs 2 yrs ago. All up until 1yr ago when it discovered T_D:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Long live our God Emperor!
       </p>
       <h1>
        I don't care! If Puten helps elect our god emperor, we all win!
       </h1>
       <p>
        I DON'T CARE. THEY DON'T BELONG IN THIS COUNTRY. SEND THEM ALL BACK!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       up until 5 months ago it went all in on Seth Rich/RussiaGate/complaining about right-wing'ers.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It does seem this sub is being brigaded to promote the Seth Rich distraction.
       </p>

        I can't believe the irony. This sub just got used a tool. After a solid week of mindless parroting the Fox news "Seth" narrative, now this sub is going after MSN for "professionalism", after their partisan hit-piece was retracted?
       </p>
       <p>
        LOL. What a joke. The entire story was a fabrication created by Fox News for Fox News to distract us from Trump selling arms to Saudi Arabia.
This sub was a tool of Fox news. And now that they have retracted their right-wing fairy tale, this sub is attack WaPo and NYT for using anonymous sources in the Trump-Russia scandal. LOL what a joke.
       </p>
       <h1>
        It's a conspiracy that Fox is not reporting on the largest conspiracy since Watergate. If the Trump-Russia collusion is proven, our president would have committed treason. And Fox was trying to hide this. Sounds legit to me.

       He is certainly one of the most objective, thorough, and unbiased sources available today. There are a few areas you will need to study more to get a complete picture of the world as it really is, particularly the history of secret societies and oligarchy, because these are the "powers behind the throne."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to attack Corbett, because he likes to stick to verifiable subjects and secret societies are not a subject with a lot of facts that are easy to verify. However, their importance is hard to understate.

       I'm not saying he's unbiased (actually listening to his episode on the myth of journalistic objectivity is an eye opener), but to imply that the Corbett Report falls on the left/right political spectrum is missing the point.

       A question for James: "When do you think we get genuine politicians and candidates?"
      </p>
      <p>
       By "genuine politician" being defined as in
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/60ey93/is_xxxxx_legit_stepping_back_from_controlled/">
        this redditor's post
       </a>
       :
      </p>
      <p>
       Is a candidate/politician/etc. legitimate? The best way to find that out is to ask them if they agree with the truth tellers who were assassinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, you should pose questions to potential leaders as such: JFK tried to issue greenbacks and Lincoln did - both were shot for it. Will you promise to issue debt and usury free currency as a president of the people right now?
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can't get a straight up "yes" it means one of two things:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        they are cowed by fear, and therefore not worthy of your support
       </li>
       <li>
        they are on the side of the banking cabal
       </li>

       QUESTION: Why dont you speak about the "zionist" (we all know its just a "shielding" term, but ok) more...? Why do you try to "invent" terms as kakiostocracy etc. and focus on those...? Is it because you are afraid of them, or do you think that touching them, would make you "toxic" and prevent the spreading of your message? So you try to stay clear of it?
Or are you (partly) member of the chosen ones :-)?

       No... No... of course he does, you know why? Cause he isnt stupid... SO the question is why not talk about it... I believe and hope, its the first choice (he knows it would cast him in "shadows" and prevent the spreading of his message).

       yes anyone who has a different opinion is an idiot... some people think that anyone who doesnt believe that reptilians control everything are stupid, some think anyone who doesnt believe the house of black nobility control things are stupid. maybe you are the stupid one?

       Q: Have you ever renounced a previously held position on a conspiracy theory because new facts came to light? (i.e. turns out it was not a conspiracy after all).
      </p>
      <p>
       Following from that, how important do you think it is that people interested in independent media are willing to change their beliefs based on new evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess the core of the question is: if we can't accept our positions are wrong sometimes, how are we any better than dogmatic MSM followers?

       Recently I've seen a couple of your pieces on climate change where you seem to be indicating that it is some kind of a hoax.  Please explain.

       He actually has a lot on this subject that is easily accessed on his site or on Youtube. Like the other commenter said, you can start with '

        How Big Oil Conquered the World

       ,' but there are many more to help explain that the idea of anthropogenic climate change is highly disputable.

       Big fan James. Thank you for the AMA.

      <p>
       My question is, about conspiracy coverups and how they stay hidden even tho many ppl ha e to remain silent to keep the charade going. I have a hard time seeing smaller scale terror attacks like Manchester and London bridge are staged bc it requires so many ppl involved to keep their mouths shut.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess my question is, do you know how the powers that be keep ppl from speaking and letting the secret out?

       Perfect time for this. With the "conspiracy movement" under heavy fire for supposedly lacking any critical thinking or analytical skills, Corbett is the perfect individual to supply a retort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of my very short list of impartial truth seekers, he is at the top. His articles/videos present sourced material with professional journalistic integrity.
      </p>
      <p>
       He asks the logical questions and works hard to supply us with pieces of the puzzle that allow us to find answers to those questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Corbett Report and NewsBuds do a great job of setting the bar.

       James-
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a long time consumer of your content (like, very long). Over the years I have come to notice a trend which I am here today to inquire about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you, or has anyone within your media/correspondence inner circle (Sibel Edmons, James Evan Pilato, Paul Craig Roberts, etc.), to your knowledge, received tangible financial support or payment, in a lump-sum or ongoing basis, from Russian-affiliated sources or operatives?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask because I've noticed a trend, which you are better than concealing than the others, of a pro-Russia bias. For Sibel this included conspicuous avoidance of any discussion whatsoever about Russian geopolitics in
       <em>
        The Lone Gladio
       </em>
       (I believe the only line, when the agent's loyalties are being discussed was something like, 'and as for Russia, well, simply f
       <em>
        ck Russia' - thanks, that is *so
       </em>
       educational). This includes omission of including Russian interests when discussing broader issues which should include Russian interest considerations.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, as have aforementioned members of frequent guests/co-correspondents, been accused by various 'independent media' entities as potentially affiliated thusly. While I will be the first to say that this should be, to some extent expected, what have you to say to people like me who have noticed a consistent, ongoing pro-Russian bias (mostly via omission) within your content for many years, and for whom such accusations serve to complement conclusions we have reached independently? Is it simply coincidence that Newsbud's launch logo originally resembled the Russian flag? If so, when was the decision made to change it, and who made that decision?
      </p>
      <p>
       Follow up question: What are your thoughts regarding the ongoing, developing indications of Russian affiliation with and monetary influence upon various 'identity politics' wedge issue groups/campaigns operating primarily within the United States. do you believe there is an ongoing, covert 'active measures' campaign ongoing to foster identity politic tensions between groups of U.S. citizens? Would you consider such a campaign an act of war, or merely business as usual? How do you believe patriotic Westerners who believe emergent chaos to be unacceptable should orient themselves to resist such foreign activities if they are ongoing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again, and always, regardless.

       Question:  James has on multiple occasions and dedicated a video advocating agorism and libertarian ideals.  However, James has chosen to live and prosper in Japan, a Constitutional Monarchy.  Japan is arguably less open to capitalism and it's government heavily influenced by a small number of major corporations that enshrine loyalty from their employees.  How can James claim his preferred economic and governmental ideology of agorism while choosing to live in a country that has an economic system that is less "free" than the US

       If that's his reasoning then he's full of shit.  Far sunnier climes such as Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, UAE, Chile, Taiwan, USA, Israel, Columbia, Spain, Mauritius, Malaysia, South Korea, Macedonia, KSA, El Salvador, Domincan, and Brunei all are higher ranked in economic freedom.  Japan is ranked 40th in the world ahead of Jamaica and Mexico which are faaaar sunnier.  He's just another libertarian hypocrite that throws shade at the system but prefers to be coddled by a secure safety net rather than the agorism BS he preaches.

       What are the keys, in your opinion, for journalists to investigate and deliver authentic reporting on questionable matters like the Las Vegas shooting, for example. The reason I ask is because I find the mainstream media unreliable in their reports on such matters, and I find the majority of "independent" reporters equally unreliable- or it seems like they are trying really hard but just don't have the skills to pull off reliable reporting.
