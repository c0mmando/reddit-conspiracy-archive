        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><ol>
<li>No online presence whatsoever. Literally nothing.</li>
<li>Neighbors didn&#39;t really know him well. He moved constantly, kept to himself.</li>
<li>His dad was FBI most wanted, and the FBI would have been in contact with Paddock often as a child.</li>
<li>Lived in border-ish states. FL, TX, NV.</li>
<li>Pilot. Owned two planes.</li>
<li>Seemingly rich, because FBI paid for much of what he had.</li>
<li>Smart.</li>
<li>No family.</li>
<li>Supposed jobs all bland. &quot;Accountant&quot; for big, faceless government contractors.</li>
<li>Foreign girlfriend - someone who wouldn&#39;t ask too many questions.</li>
<li>Gun enthusiast (supposedly unknown even to his brother - why would he hide than unless he was actually hiding something else?)</li>
<li>White.</li>
<li>Nothing whatsoever on his history.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think what happened is Paddock was running guns for the FBI. Like Fast and Furious. They&#39;d use these guns to track bad guys. Paddock was also doing this on his own, though, to get rich. That&#39;s why he was buying so many guns and storing them in his home.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s why he brought such a huge number of guns up 32 stories. Why would he need that many if he knew he&#39;d be taken out after a little while? Why go to all that trouble? He was going to sell them, probably illegally. And instead of doing it in a remote location where the FBI can see what he&#39;s doing, he did it in Las Vegas on &quot;vacation,&quot; where no cameras or GPS trackers would suspect anything besides a few too many suitcases.</p>

<p>He knew the FBI was tracking his whereabouts, so he tried to sell these guns in a location that wouldn&#39;t raise any suspicion. Not in the desert.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know what happened in that hotel room, but the FBI is not going to announce that they were in any way involved with this. Whether he was the shooter or not, he was the guy the police found, and the FBI will never come out and claim responsibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he is an FBI agent, he works under Jeff Sessions.  It’s just an undisputable fact.  Jeff Sessions may not have orchestrated this, but if the shooter was in the FBI, Jeff Sessions is absolutely aware at this point.
