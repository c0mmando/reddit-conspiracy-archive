Actually now the FBI agent is up on stage and he&#39;s saying the same vague shit. &quot;We&#39;ve looked at 1000&#39;s of pieces of evidence&quot; and &quot;We ask you for help on the investigation&quot; and &quot;We have hundreds of agents in Las Vegas working on the case&quot;. Fuck sakes this briefing is garbage so far.   </p>

<p>Edit: WOAH, THATS FUCKING IT. That was the fucking briefing. Sick &quot;press conference&quot;. There might as well be no press.   </p>

<p>Edit 2: Blah blah blah blah blah triage blah blah blah we ran out of bandages blah blah blah they saved the gunshot victims blah blah blah thank everyone that helped blah blah blah   </p>

<p>Edit 3: Blah blah blah we&#39;ve looked at the evidence blah blah no ISIS (still) blah blah blah blah (still no proof Campos is a real guard)  </p>

<p>Edit 4: Anyone catch when the fed said &quot;We have 100s of agents &#39;globally&#39; working on the case&quot;. What does that fucking mean? You have 100s of agents restricting media in foreign countries too?  </p>

<p>Edit 5: My favorite quote from Lombardo is now &quot;There are no conspiracies, we&#39;re just incompetent&quot; (That&#39;s pretty much what he said)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shot at more, only hit once. I guess I worded it poorly but the &quot;timeline&quot; they are trying to mash together would mean that Campos was shot at more than once... That claim comes from the maintenance guy&#39;s  TV interview where he claims that he arrived, was told to hide by Campos, so he got into a doorway alcove as more bullets whizzed by. Then once the firing stop, they ... went back down the hallway I guess? IDK. </p>

Is that something you actually do? Just take a glance at someones brain? Is anyone able to gain anything from that? So, now they are sending it off for microscopic evaluations to look for &quot;abnormalities&quot;. Is this how they figure out he was a right wing extremist, gun nut? Didn&#39;t he literally blow his brains out?</p>

<p>Also funny detail; maybe nothing. At 7:10 he calls him Mr. Paddock and then after a short bit regrets and simply refer to him as the suspect.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shot at more, only hit once. I guess I worded it poorly but the &quot;timeline&quot; they are trying to mash together would mean that Campos was shot at more than once... That claim comes from the maintenance guy&#39;s  TV interview where he claims that he arrived, was told to hide by Campos, so he got into a doorway alcove as more bullets whizzed by. Then once the firing stop, they ... went back down the hallway I guess? IDK. </p>
