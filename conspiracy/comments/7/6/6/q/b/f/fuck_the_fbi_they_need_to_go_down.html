    <div class="md"><p>No group has your best interests in mind, by definition, all organizations only have THEIR best interest in mind which is why people like myself believe in limiting all government to the local level, run and overseen by the citizens of each community. </p>

<p>Fuckery can only happen when you give other people control over your life, to expect others to care about your well being is childish and insane. Some people don&#39;t even get a mother that is willing to put the child&#39;s interest first and we expect perfect strangers to worry about us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the government has their hooks into the radio, television and communications system such that they can hijack it whenever they want to.  Supposedly this was done to emergency purposes but they didn&#39;t use it for that in the California fires.  Apparently someone decided not to do it in the beginning in order to not cause panic.  Then it quickly got way out of control and took down cell towers and electrical lines.  I can&#39;t say that they never issues the alerts but certainly not until it was too late and Larkfield or Coffee Park was burning down.  People found out by hearing exploding trees, smelling smoke or seeing an orange sky.  I&#39;ll say that the street level individuals did the best that they could but where was the centralized help??  They can hijack all of our communications infrastructure but then can use the &quot;not cause panic&quot; excuse to not actually alert us.  Of course long gone are the days of the fire siren to actually alert the community.  Its a change of mindset.  Now we are panicked cattle.  It might be a matter of just the specific personalities in charge of the infrastructure decisions when the events happen but really what is the purpose of this centralized system?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The FBI was giving weapons to the Cartel, who would then bring them across the border to Mexico.  The FBI thought they would track these guns, but that is an impossible task, so they lost track.  Come to find out months later, a U.S. Border Patrol agent was actually shot and killed using one of these FBI guns.</p>

<p>As if they learned nothing, in 2015 the FBI provided weapons to and encouraged ISIS agents to &quot;Tear up Texas&quot; and then watched while these guys opened fire on a crowd, only to be shot by local PD.  This happened in Garland Texas.  Look it up.  It is shocking how reckless they were with American civilian lives.</p>
