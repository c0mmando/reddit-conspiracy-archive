       Do they believe people died? Because, if so, then they believe the single most important element of the official story. This will come as a shock to some people but
       <a href="http://fakeologist.com/blog/2017/10/03/fac367-vegas-hrdpar-baby/">
        there exists a group of intelligent, articulate people

       Yes, we must be helpful, not hurtful.  We all fell down the rabbit hole, and have went through what they will go through mentally, physically, and emotionally.  We have to be there to help them channel their frustration.

       We don't. We can't. But we can take a look at the evidence around us and use that to build an understanding. Never before has the corporate media struggled to maintain control over the masses. Their manufactured consent appears to be waning, but you wanna act like that's a bad thing?

       Yep, and I noticed how the wall of victims, which had a subset of super-victims highlighted throughout the US MSM media with dry-tear interviews of bewildered baby boomer parents, maybe like 7 or 8. That group was reduced to maybe 2 for the elite-victim national highlight phase. If you study the content and images (all owned by the AP, btw) it's not enough to depart from something that could be easily staged.

      <p>
       Who has a visitation/funeral at a high school? Never ever seen that in real life. The images show people weeping, 100% of which have dry eyes, squeezed tight, and zero tears in every single image. Zoomed-in shots of a couple piles of flowers and a black curtain backdrop and like 6 people standing over a casket. There are zero photos I am aware of that show something legit. cheeers

       Just wish I could be hopeful for this. But what I see in my circle of acquaintances and social media 'friends' is disheartening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Surprise -&gt; outrage -&gt; 'thoughts and prayers' -&gt; blindly accept MSM narrative to suit political bias -&gt; repeat. Saw it with terror attacks, with the hurricanes' aftermath, with Las Vegas. Zero critical thinking, automatic mocking of any dissenting opinion, then drop it liek a hot potato as the next scandal is promoted.
      </p>
      <p>
       To many, Las Vegas is a closed case, lone nut with zero political intent, nothing odd about daily shifting timelines or no sec cam footage from the surveillance capital of the world. Right now it's all about that PIG and the BRAVE victims and cheering and hollering as the late night comedians and MSM bundle this with Trump any which way they can.

       Well, if there's an ancient cabal of people that have been in power for longer than the US then I'd say they've had a long time to plan. They've studied our reactions and understand group dynamics/psychology well enough as exemplified through advertisements/propaganda/public relations and they certainly have the resources. Just speculating.

       To orchestrate the chaos, to make seizing control a lot easier. Perhaps a culling to make for a more manageable population. Say if the flow of information is allowed and a lot of people start to get upset at the current state of things then at a certain point I would think mass rioting is a possibility. Who better to upset people than our current president? We also have the resoirces and the laws in place to flip the switch to a state of emergency. I don't know, it could also be an economic crisis or a natural disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, I believe it's coming to a head at some point, all great civilizations and paradigms come to an end and we are not quite that special.

       I'm inclined to agree. This shit has been going on since the industry began. Shirley Temple even spoke out against it. So why now? Why'd Weinstein get thrown under the bus? It was too sudden and widespread to not be orchestrated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could also be a sign that Hollywood as a whole is dying. People aren't as eager to shell out more for one single crappy remake of a remake than a whole month of something like Netflix. It's also a lot easier to get a movie made nowadays and the big shot producer is almost a thing of the past. Same with the music industry.

       There's a theory that humanity is coming into a mass awakening right now that is going to happen whatever TPTB do. We've been lied to about who/what we really are and we're naturally becoming aware of that. TPTB know this and they want to direct in such a way to suit their own ends, i.e. in a negative way. But there is huge potential for humanity to awaken in a positive way. There are powerful groups right now vying to help awaken the masses in different ways, some good groups wants us to awaken to a positive new world in which we have free energy, amazing medical tech, no more monetary system, a space faring civilization etc, and those who want us to awaken to the evild eeds of the cabal only to replace them with another cabal, who, unbeknown to us, has actually been the real cabal running the whole thing anyway.

       Honestly, it sounds like you're trying to describe a sci fi novel by Heinlein or Asimov rather than predict the future. Have you ever stopped and considered that what you're saying is probably more wishful thinking and projecting than realistic?

       their medical technology or absence of a monetary system is in the form of complete and total control: carbon credit type things. We want to be off centralized currency and the federal reserve and everything but they want to centralize it even worse than that while presenting it as ending the monetary system. And if you trust their medical technology you will die. no disrespect to the theorizing though

       Even if they are so well established, knowledgeable about human nature, etc... it's hard to imagine that they could have accurately predicted the effect the internet wold have. It has drastically changed human communication, and it also creates a feedback loop that adds new aspects to mass psychology. Technology is changing the world in ways that I don't think anyone is in control of.

       It does, but I think it's a double edged sword. Easy to spread information and connect, but also easy to confuse and manipulate with intentional false information, not to mention people in general. Not everyone is correct, but I don't claim to be either.
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, we may be advanced somewhat technologically but spiritually/mentally/consciously we are underdeveloped. Technology is a double edged sword as well - depends on who's using it for what.

       I read the rest of your comments and decided to reply to this one, I think you can add to "the reveal" the fact that if they do reveal they're evil and whatnot they'll just ask "what are you gonna do about it?" and it is almost certain not many will act against them

       Realistically, people need to stop thinking the unravelling of the underbelly of our world is just going to happen without is taking action. Nobody does much, yet have come to the defeatist conclusion that there is nothing left that we can do and we must sit back and endure our further enslavement, but no action has been taken on a personal level by most people to stand up and fight this. No, they will not expose themselves, and it's up to us to take action, to protest, spread information, boycott, and so on. Don't expect the ceilings to come crashing down without a genuine storm.

       My post in another thread just now:
Coincidentally (or is it?) LA Times also reported on Rose McGowan's criticizing Jeff Bezos. It's as if today LA Times woke up and decided to report things that should be looked into. Normally this sort of news would be rejected as conspiracy drivel.

       Unfortunately, most of them will be lulled back to sleep by the so-called media.  Either that or we'll bomb NK to get their minds off of the fact that our gov't lies to us in a magnitude thousands of times greater than they tell us the truth.

       Dude, I enjoy conspiracy theories simply because people are thinking outside of the box and frankly they're thought provoking or just plain entertaining.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've only started following this sub this past week or so because the whole Vegas shooting thing just doesn't make sense to me - at all! I've been interested in other people's facts and theories.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conveniently this whole Wienstien (sp) thing and a bunch of Hollywood pedo stuff starts coming out. I see the masses start to shift their focus on this instead - something that frankly we all subtly knew about all this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a conspirarist in any way, but something smells fishy here and I can't help but think this is a way to get people's minds off of Vegas. Whatever happened in Vegas is...well, we'll never know in all honesty.

       How many people
       <em>
        honestly
       </em>
       live like this, though? I have shown this
       <a href="https://www.johnlebon.com/articles/37-things-normies-believe/">
        list of things to question
       </a>
       to a few people who have
       <strong>
        promised
       </strong>
       me that they are open-minded, and yet they get triggered just like TV believers when you question them about things like 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me like even people who believe they are 'skeptical' are not really, they accept so many things on face value.

       When domestic spying became public knowledge, that was my big moment of deliverance. We had been right on that issue for twenty years or more before it became publicly acknowledged. I had this weird fantasy about the headlines "Public Owes Apology to Conspiracy Theorists." So yeah, that didn't happen but nonetheless society has definitely changed and acknowledged that there really is something to all this secrecy business. Still, this whole sexual predation thing is a much more volatile issue. I think in general the topic is far more widespread in society than even we are comfortable with.

       Do you think they make mistakes? Makes ya think they did all of this just to make the rebellion grow even more.  They want that conflict. They'd  love for local type woke militias to grow in large number so they can label everyone of them as terror cells and have something real to fight, asking for more funding, grow police state tech which benefits the elite, etc.  Military industrial complex need to absorb the police, its good business for them and the elites.

       Perhaps they are experimenting, seeing what pisses people off. Studying how quickly ideas spread. Leak some things then "try" to erase/censor them off FB, or google. They know how easy it is for people to screenshot and save information. Trying to take things down Streisand effects things. They're not stupid,  people are starting to open their eyes but its not enough yet.

       The fact that I can barely find information on the Las Vegas Strip shooting outside here is insane.  Crazy convenient how this Harvey Weinstein thing comes out right now after it's been known about for years.  It's the perfect distraction story, it's got sex, celebrities, scandal, secrets.

       Beautiful! Reading top comments in the main-stream media, on our national news (extremely left wing, NWO-ish) makes me smile. Almost every single time the top comments are against trusting the government and believing their lies. Good times indeed!

       The Hollywood realization is at least a decade too late. And most people still don't think there is pedos, they just believe its sexual abuse and prostitution (not underage). As for Vegas, not sure if you've been visiting normie reddit and social media but Vegas has been forgotten.

       what youve got to realise is that you have to stop being a consumer, which is fucking hard when you live in a consumer world where "what you have is who you are".
we're typing up some awakening bullshit in the threads but still grab fast food on our lunch break. we still turn to the big pharma when we get the flu. we still shop in supermarkets. and we still watch hollywood films when they come out at the cinema.
      </p>
      <p>
       if you want to be dedicated to creating a revolution, you have to work hard on excluding a lot of "normal" things from your life- otherwise youre no better than everyone else. take away their bread, which is your money. spend it at independant businesses (markets, farms etc), pay a homeopathic doctor/dentist instead of the healthcare system. only watch independant films made by low budget directors. 
when we all stop relying on the system and nourishing it with our time and money, it will collapse by itself. of course they will take all measures to brainwash us, make up all sorts of laws that will stop us from thriving. but im hoping by then, we will be healthy and educated enough to fight back

       I agree, stop losing focus guys/gals.  This whole pedophilia/rape/Weinstein story is just a way to distract us from the LV mass shooting.  We need to keep questioning this crime.  And what about Bellagio?  Why isn't anyone talking about that?

       Even if they are so well established, knowledgeable about human nature, etc... it's hard to imagine that they could have accurately predicted the effect the internet wold have. It has drastically changed human communication, and it also creates a feedback loop that adds new aspects to mass psychology. Technology is changing the world in ways that I don't think anyone is in control of.

       I read the rest of your comments and decided to reply to this one, I think you can add to "the reveal" the fact that if they do reveal they're evil and whatnot they'll just ask "what are you gonna do about it?" and it is almost certain not many will act against them
