<p>I was doubting it was actually going to happen all day. But then I saw it directly on Fox news right before 9pm. It was then not mentioned again. The thread is now deleted talking about it. What&#39;s going on?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was all predicted like 20 hrs ago for those unaware. On a mere knitting message board some friend of the involved parties posted to watch hannity tomorrow (Oct 12th). He says Campos will flip the script and reveal whats really going on. Trump met Campos and suggested he go on Hannity to reveal the truth. He said the public will lose trust in the agencies over this. I can do a screenshot post if no one is doing it. Then at end of Tucker tonight a brief commercial had the text that Campos was Hannitys guest. Show ran zero mention. Now Hannity tweeted &quot;He backed out&quot; which IMO 99.5% confirms the post yesterday was legit. <a href="https://imgur.com/Nm01soc">https://imgur.com/Nm01soc</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Prediction type posts? Lmao. It&#39;s fiction. I used to follow rabbit holes of nonsense for hours. I am realizing to look at all as political fiction, for the most part. Example- Did Hillary really run an underground pedofile ring and recruit kidnap children from Hati? And Podesta is a serial child molester? Is Trump really a Russian puppet? </p>

<p>See how extreme both sides take it. One side thinks pedos while the other side thinks Trump is legitimately Russia/Hitler. </p>

<p>Now if you want to link some or talk about facts. and the connection to the case. I keep hearing Soros shorted Mandalay Bay stock. The Narrative keeps changing and Mandalay is disagreeing with timeline. Those are facts. Who was the security guard who who was shot? His story keeps changing. What facts are out there about him? </p>

<p>Pol and prediction posts are Fun to read, but it&#39;s important to realize they are 99.9% fan fiction and when looking into stuff separate fiction from facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my reply was to your sarcasm implying that I would think fox would do some shit like this directed at this sub specifically which is nonsense, of course they wouldn&#39;t do that.  but they def would promote an interview with the key character of this play that they knew wouldn&#39;t take place in order to generate buzz and chatter. Maybe this was all Loomer&#39;s doing in the first place but that seems like a pretty big ledge to climb on for fox without verification or knowing in advance what the plan was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong.  No one fucking shot guns from a hotel room window.  It didnt happen that way.  We have yet to see proof it actually happened that way...anything. zip. Nada.</p>

<p>If anything, this guy was the hit man that shot stephen, whom was told to wait in the room.  larry jesus campos showed up and shot stephen probably with help, staged the area and SOMETHING went off...soemthing went wrong and they switch to some other plan.  I dont believe jesus was really even shot.  I think this guy proves that the feds are covering it up and the police have their hands tied.  Drills were occurring at the same time.  Thats why the feds all happened to just be there all ready for the exact event they were training for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also suspecting Campos as the hit man. But I think he may have been shot in a struggle/fight when Paddock realized he was being set up.

<p>My view is that the leg shot only complicates things. If he wasn&#39;t shot, he wouldn&#39;t have had to explain himself in the timeline. But since he (allegedly) was shot, now the question of where and when comes up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well at least people are actually acknowledging this is all shady. It&#39;s one thing after another with this investigation. You can tell that victims statements are suppressed because the only things showing up are social media post from people there that night. Campos either saw something or hes involved. I don&#39;t buy Isis bs. This is a govt set up. My question is.. while we&#39;re scrambling to figure out what happened in Las Vegas.. what is really going on rn..?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know, I really don&#39;t envy that guy. Imagine if he genuinely has nothing to do with it, and he saw something that indicated FBI involvement, imagine how terrifying that would be, you&#39;d have no idea who to talk to. Which is why the best thing to do would be to go on TV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The timeline would have had to be changed again because campos would have let some stuff slip. FBI got to him and stopped the interview. They told fox hannity to pull the interview. Since hannity is such a &quot;pro govt&quot; he won&#39;t say why it was really pulled. He&#39;ill probably make something up </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Doesn&#39;t anyone think that Campos may possibly not be involved at all? Perhaps the FBI had their prongs in this guy from the jump. When a photo of him finally rose (if it was Mr. Campos, the pic with the sign) me &amp; my brother both felt he looked incredibly uncomfortable. If not downright scared. Maybe he really did have a bombshell to pass to Hannity. Maybe he wasn&#39;t remembering his &quot;lines&quot; very well. Or, if he&#39;s reall y not involved like he&#39;s said to be, maybe as soon as he got a second where the FBI wasn&#39;t in his fucking mustache, he really did attempt to take off. Do NOT be surprised if Campos story arch ends in a tragic/easily explainable death. It&#39;s clear that they have kept a tight lid on Campos more than anyone else. Stay alert. Stay focused on this story. I feel like this is one of the very few times in recent nationwide stories that are riddled with lies &amp; inconsistencies that, I&#39;m sorry for the term, but Sheeple, have opened their eyes to &amp; actually asked..what the hell is going on? Apply pressure. Demand answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>my reply was to your sarcasm implying that I would think fox would do some shit like this directed at this sub specifically which is nonsense, of course they wouldn&#39;t do that.  but they def would promote an interview with the key character of this play that they knew wouldn&#39;t take place in order to generate buzz and chatter. Maybe this was all Loomer&#39;s doing in the first place but that seems like a pretty big ledge to climb on for fox without verification or knowing in advance what the plan was. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No need to screenshot it. There is plenty of proof that the promo is real and the interview was supposed to happen. Hannity didn&#39;t say &quot;what interview? I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about&quot; when asked about it. He said Campos cancelled.</p>

<p>And there are other &quot;verified media people&quot; who back up the story that interviews were supposed to happen, from multiple networks. They have no reason to defend Fox / Hannity.</p>
