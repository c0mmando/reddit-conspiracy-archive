<p>They see Harvey is weak and exposed, so they are taking their shots, but if they had any dignity, any self respect, they would have stood for themselves years and in some cases decades ago. </p>

<p>Everyone cheering on people like McGowen and Judd make me sick, read the stories, each shows picture after picture with them smiling and touching Harvey long AFTER he assaulted them. </p>

<p>They criticize men for not speaking up, but they themselves did the same thing, playing nice to keep the money and fame rolling in. </p>

<p>Weinstein was pushed out by his own brother so he could take over the company and every woman in Hollywood is running to get as much fame from this as they can </p>

<p>These supposed child and adult victims are all richer then of you and will live lives of amazing luxury- so they sucked a dick or got fucked in the ass, they are fucking millionaires from it</p>

<p>And I can understand not feeling sorry for actresses who are old enough to know better, but child stars? Come on dude. It&#39;s not like they willingly do anything in Hollywood. 9/10 times it&#39;s their overbearing parents that drag them to auditions and shit. You don&#39;t feel bad for them if they&#39;re taken advantage of by pedos in powerful positions? Shame.</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt feel anything for the poor little rich boys and girls taking loads of Hollywood cum so they can become millionaires </p>

<p>Elija wood is not giving away his money and devoting his life to fighting rape</p>

<p>Neither are the Olsen twins who said they got fucked </p>

<p>Why? Cause they said yes and are happy for the money and don‚Äôt want to admit they would never ever trade that Hollywood cum for poverty and living like a fucking ass like the rest of us</p>

<p>Fuck them</p>

<p>I don‚Äôt cry for millionaires </p>

<p>I hope they are fucking tortured by that rape every day! Because I have my own shit life and it‚Äôs never ending till I die, so let them suffer and cry and have drug overdoses and fucking die- cause they are rich and that money is not earned- it‚Äôs Hollywood cum money </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m glad it&#39;s coming out, but I&#39;m disgusted by the source, not to mention how they all seem to blame the men in the industry for not stepping up to the plate.</p>

<p>A lot of those men were prostituted as well, not to mention, Mcgowen took a payoff from Harvey after accusing him of rape, and then for years after can be seen laughing in pictures with him, until her career dried up and guys don&#39;t find her sexy anymore, now she&#39;s a voice for women.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s far worse the general public let&#39;s them play the victim card, you took money, you played along, you hugged and kissed these people in photos while you knew they were raping and assaulting young girls left and right, how are you brave? sick. </p>
