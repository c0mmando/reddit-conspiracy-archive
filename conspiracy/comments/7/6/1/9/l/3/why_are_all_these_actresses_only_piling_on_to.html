       My son and I were just asking that?  And why now?  It sounds like it's been an open secret for decades... and now men are coming out saying they too were treated inappropriately ...but no names... 
I'm kinda shocked no one has photoshopped Harvey Weinstein's face on the predator from the movie ..

       Just so we're clear, these actresses are scum, most of them prostituted themselves and held down other actresses.
      </p>
      <p>
       They see Harvey is weak and exposed, so they are taking their shots, but if they had any dignity, any self respect, they would have stood for themselves years and in some cases decades ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone cheering on people like McGowen and Judd make me sick, read the stories, each shows picture after picture with them smiling and touching Harvey long AFTER he assaulted them.
      </p>
      <p>
       They criticize men for not speaking up, but they themselves did the same thing, playing nice to keep the money and fame rolling in.

       Weinstein was pushed out by his own brother so he could take over the company and every woman in Hollywood is running to get as much fame from this as they can

       You seem to value money far above things like mental health or human decency.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I can understand not feeling sorry for actresses who are old enough to know better, but child stars? Come on dude. It's not like they willingly do anything in Hollywood. 9/10 times it's their overbearing parents that drag them to auditions and shit. You don't feel bad for them if they're taken advantage of by pedos in powerful positions? Shame.

       I don‚Äôt want any help and even if I fucking did- you paying for my therapy? For my medication? For me to go to a nut house?

       Nope! Because I am a grown man and I don‚Äôt get fucking shit till I whip out a gun and make clear my problems are now YOUR fucking problems

       I don‚Äôt feel anything for the poor little rich boys and girls taking loads of Hollywood cum so they can become millionaires
      </p>
      <p>
       Elija wood is not giving away his money and devoting his life to fighting rape
      </p>
      <p>
       Neither are the Olsen twins who said they got fucked
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? Cause they said yes and are happy for the money and don‚Äôt want to admit they would never ever trade that Hollywood cum for poverty and living like a fucking ass like the rest of us
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck them
      </p>
      <p>
       I don‚Äôt cry for millionaires
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope they are fucking tortured by that rape every day! Because I have my own shit life and it‚Äôs never ending till I die, so let them suffer and cry and have drug overdoses and fucking die- cause they are rich and that money is not earned- it‚Äôs Hollywood cum money

       Ye I get you, I wasn't implying my sympathy for those actresses in my comment. They haven't been vulnerable young girls for quite a while and they kept their mouth shut knowing that it is happening to other young girls.

       I'm glad it's coming out, but I'm disgusted by the source, not to mention how they all seem to blame the men in the industry for not stepping up to the plate.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of those men were prostituted as well, not to mention, Mcgowen took a payoff from Harvey after accusing him of rape, and then for years after can be seen laughing in pictures with him, until her career dried up and guys don't find her sexy anymore, now she's a voice for women.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's far worse the general public let's them play the victim card, you took money, you played along, you hugged and kissed these people in photos while you knew they were raping and assaulting young girls left and right, how are you brave? sick.

       Abuse isn‚Äôt a Hollywood issue, it‚Äôs a societal issue. From the church to the YMCA to locker rooms and doctors‚Äô offices. For that reason this will never really end. In any environment where you have subordinates in vulnerable positions, especially the young, abuse will occur.

       They realize Harvey is screwed already so since he is doomed already he makes the perfect sacrificial lamb. Everyone throws him under the bus to make it look like they are opposed to the abuse and that it is only a very few who engage in this type of behavior.

       Because not everyone learns every life lesson. Not everyone is strong.  Not everyone is brave.  These people are human. They have flaws.  They have fears. They have views on the world and their environments that you may not agree with. Its possible that it's safe to be open about Weinstein but not safe to be open about others. We don't know.
