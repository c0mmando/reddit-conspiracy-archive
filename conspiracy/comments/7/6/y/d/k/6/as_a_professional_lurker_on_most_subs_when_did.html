    <div class="md"><p>I noticed a MAJOR uptick in the lead-up to the election last year. &quot;The cabal&quot; was out to get Trump, who was going to &quot;clean the swamp.&quot; LOL. Now of course &quot;the deep state&quot; is still out to get him. What a load of crap. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a very good form of misdirection, because it allows half the population to dismiss conspiracies as the ravings of the &quot;gun nuts&quot; or &quot;libtards&quot; or pick your favorite epithet. Meanwhile both sides are working for the same team and laughing at us because the gullible masses fall for it every time. </p>

<p>My thoughts are that we bring our bias with us everywhere. Just accept it and be happy...I’m more in the center and I see posts from that perspective.</p>

<p>A lot of the Trump stuff kinda fizzles out right now but it’s here. Although I am no fan of Trump, the Clintons are slightly more interesting to read about for the time being.</p>

<p>The whole MSM, Casting Couch thing and Pedo’s appears to be on the Left Side of the political spectrum but there are lots of articles that call out Right Wingers too.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re asking at a weird time and by time mean in years.  Under Bush, alot of conspiracy theorists were on the left.  You also have ro realize, reddit wasn&#39;t made till 2006 and shortly after, as Reddit grew and Obama came to office, it all shifted.  The left were then the ones who had to defend Obama continuing to do the same business as usual that Bush did.  Now the playing field has completely changed and you have groups on both sides pushing conspiracies and partician politics due to Trump everything becoming polarized.  In this sub, you will see both side coming in and argueing for their political identity.  If I point out Trump raising troops level in Afghanistan, Cambridge Analytics, or that him praising Jeffery Epstein, I&#39;m a Clinton support.  If I point out Hillary lost tge election because she didn&#39;t campaign and was flawed, CTR, how she was a war hawk, I must be a T_D user onpy trying to bash Clinton.  I personally think the people who really pull the string are sitting back enjoying their devide &amp; conquer and creating new problem, action, solutiond (higalian dialect) to further their agenda.  I find real conspiracies like the Awan situation, military budget, foreign pilicy isn&#39;t discussed/criticized by politicians on either side of the isle.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do believe there is more to the picture and most of the time we can’t see the forest through the trees. In saying that, is this the real issue? The division and aggression that we all feel to people with different ideologies that is created through false narratives.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>For sure, it&#39;s a huge part of the problem, especially here on reddit.  As I mentioned before, the Awan situation is really the best way to show it.  20 House Democrats accused the Awan brothers of stealing electronic devices and data, this was reported by <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/02/house-staffers-investigation-equipment-234586">Politico back in February</a>.  I personally think that Politico had thought they stumbled onto some RNC conspiracy, but once it was clear it wasn&#39;t, the story changed to it being a witch hunt because the Awan&#39;s were from Pakistan and Muslim (<a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/house-democrats-it-staffers-hina-alvi-imran-awan-235569">pushed by Meeks who also employed the accused</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“As of right now, I don’t see a smoking gun,” Meeks said. “I have seen no evidence that they were doing anything that was nefarious.”</p>

<p>“I wanted to be sure individuals are not being singled out because of their nationalities or their religion. We want to make sure everybody is entitled to due process,” Meeks said. “They had provided great service for me. And there were certain times in which they had permission by me, if it was Hina or someone else, to access some of my data.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Meeks &amp; Politico created the narrative that 20+ democrat house members were causing a witch hunt because they were requesting an investigation into their own IT staffers...  </p>

<p>Since then this story has evolved quite a bit but with little to no coverage from the MSM.  Infact, when it is brought up either the initial crime and investigation isn&#39;t discussed or it&#39;s marginalized. </p>

<p>Now this is my point, you would think people who care about Russia Gate/DNC hack would also care about congress being hacked by foreign employees.  You would also think politicians on the Right in congress to be screaming too high heaven, but you don&#39;t see that either.  This whole story should make everyone say WTF and it should be reported by other news outlets besides the Daily Caller (who I never source), but it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s truly fucked up.  </p>

<p>This is only one example, another would be <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2017/07/14/most-house-democrats-just-voted-for-a-defense-budget-far-bigger-than-trumps/&amp;amp;refURL=https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6tseh3/60_of_house_democrats_vote_for_a_defense_budget/&amp;amp;referrer=https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6tseh3/60_of_house_democrats_vote_for_a_defense_budget/">60% of the House Democrats voting adding an additional $80 billion to the defense  budget</a>.  Or the fact that the left went from anti war under Bush, criticizing PNAC&#39;s plans for the middle east to supporting interventionism all over the middle east... Which Trump has now signed on to, and the Right don&#39;t want to admit it, or they will just take it and act like they support it... T_D had to do some purging over the past couple of months, because his supporters started noticing the change and talking about it.  Can&#39;t have that in their echo chamber...  Sorry for the diatribe.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Put simply none of this is a political issue though but instead is a big business issue. All decisions lead to large donors getting larger contracts. Which in turn leads to large business donating more to the people who get them the large contracts. This in turn creates oligarchies which are too big to fail. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, I stand by my last comment, but thought it was a different thread.  Yes and no, I personally think there are groups, and I&#39;m sure if you&#39;ve lurkered here long enough you know thr various one people point to, that run the show.  Most of what I see is yes, what you discribe, but an even larger agenda with foreign policy that is largely ignored for the most part in MSM.  Kind of like when MSNBC fired Phil Donahue back in 2003 during the lead up to the Iraq invasion.  They couldn&#39;t have a anti-war host for their most popular show on the network, heaven forbid someone with a non-interventionist view point be on tv.  I agree with you, we live in an oliharchie and the partisan politics and wedge issues are rammed down our throats by MSM to keep the masses busy in fighting.</p>
