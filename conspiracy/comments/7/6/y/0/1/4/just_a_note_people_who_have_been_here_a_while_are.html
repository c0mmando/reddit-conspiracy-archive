        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I see so many Hillary supporters on here (probably paid for by ShareBlue or just radicalized on their own) claiming that we are Trump supporters. And then, on the other end, we get brigades from Donald supporters. It&#39;s strange that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> has become the battleground for the political ideas on Reddit since <a href="/r/politics">/r/politics</a> has become a place where you just get the DNC establishment narrative and has been abandoned by people who want to find the truth.</p>

<p>But let me try to explain the slight support of Trump that comes naturally here compared to the disdain toward Hillary. Hillary is a proven swamp monster. She is proven to be above the law. With Trump, there was a slight hope that the swamp would be drained. He ran on that, although he may have just been lying. We&#39;ll see, but he wasn&#39;t a proven swamp monster. He may be one. If so, he is just more of the same to us conspiracy minded people. Nothing different. Nothing to be more outraged about than we were before. But he may not be a swamp monster. With Hillary, we have a proven swamp monster of the greatest sort running free from any justice. </p>

<p>As if anyone can speak for the conspiracy community as a whole, but we are generally a group for justice. And we wouldn&#39;t be upset if Trump would be prosecuted for wrongs that he does. But we would really like to see the swamp monsters prosecuted and not just use the justice system used by the powerful to go after their political opponents while they get off for equal or worse crimes. </p>

<p>So if Trump is prosecuted for Russian interactions, then Hillary should be too. And whoever else was involved in the bribes for uranium through the Clinton Foundation. We don&#39;t want to see justice unfairly given toward one side or the other. </p>

<p>So the post trying to connect Trump more to Epstein than Bill Clinton who was actually a frequent flyer comes across as very disingenuous. Although, it has received a lot of traction here for some reason. But it&#39;s hypocritical to be outraged at Trump&#39;s connections to him and not totally outraged at the Clintons, who are, unfortunately, still relevant to our political environment.</p>

<p>But the mainstream media only pushes for justice to be given to Trump, and that keeps our conspiracy antennas on high alert. If they were also going after crimes committed during the Obama administration the same way, you wouldn&#39;t feel that we were taking a side. We just want equal justice. We desire a society free or corruption. At the core, I think that is what most of us conspiracy people are about. </p>

<p>TLDR: We just want justice. Equally served.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is this post real? </p>

<p>You realize Trump is a globalist? You realize Trump is also a sexual predator? </p>

<p>Honestly, it doesn&#39;t really seem like you want equal justice at all. It&#39;s just another post claiming the president who is letting people die in Puerto Rico is vilified by the media. The opposite is happening actually: Fox News champions him, all the liberal stations hate on him. When Obama was pres, Fox News lit him on fire and the liberal stations championed him. So, it really is even if you think about it. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a supporter of neither and disagree with your entire post. </p>

<p>Pilgrimboy stood by his view of equal justice (one side would just be damaged more by applying true scrutiny and resulting justice to their actions).  Just because the outcome wouldn&#39;t be equal doesn&#39;t mean the actions taken aren&#39;t equal.  He wrongly admitted fault imo. And Jesus here celebrated prematurely as though he won the Internet. </p>

<p>Either way, it doesn&#39;t prove the other facts wrong.</p>

<p>But, for example, you can try to chase down a picture of Krugman&#39;s Type I team (do you even know what THAT is?) at Jackson Square base Camp during Katrina where we were all sporting AR 15s and you can find a picture of me... one of the dudes NOT in green kevlar pants, but in black kevlar pants is me. And I&#39;m wearing a badge.</p>

<p>Kleep in mind, though, badges are generally temporary for me, depending on what incident I&#39;m responding to.</p>

<p>Your attitude is pretty disgusting. I&#39;m anti-war and pro-transparnecy and I&#39;m a lot more informed about the subjects at hand than you, but you want to pretend like I&#39;m something other than I am so you can feel better about your completely incorrect stance?</p>

<p>Quote from DJT:</p>

<p><em>You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful — I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.</em></p>

<p>Basically, Trump is saying he can grab women by the pussy because he is powerful, and women should just accept it if they want to move up in the entertainment world.  This sounds awfully close to what Weinstein was doing to young actresses.</p>

<p>The other is in comparative Lit.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked closely at texts for about ten years. American, world, native, aa, the whole nine. I also took a lot of journalism and creative writing courses. My masters degree was interdisciplinary, so it combined sociology and psychology with a lot of what I did before. I made a creative project for my thesis and got a masters in liberal studies. I made my own program. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You should start acting like you’re that educated if that is the case. Im not disputing what you’re saying, Im saying as someone with a degree in Rhetorical Studies and Communication, you speak as if you’re dumbing yourself down. Quite frankly, I don’t see how your “training” applies to discourse if you talk the way you do or why it was impossible to obtain a masters in sociology combined with psychology, equalling interdisciplinary. Underneath all your training is a fragile ego held up on a pedestal by a few pieces of paper. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I first started to get her through the Benghazi hearings.  She tolerated/handled that situation incredibly well and showed her endurance.  From then I have been impressed with her ability to write pragmatic policy that can get passed. It doesn&#39;t pass the purity test the left likes to use, but it gets closer to progress.  I also think she surrounds herself with advisors that are experts in their fields. Also, I just generally think that criticism of her is inflated.  There are issues for sure, but definitely not anything that made me consider my vote for her. </p>

Losing reproductive rights, shit maternity leave, we&#39;ve all witnessed the harassment they are dealing with.  Having a female president would do a lot to push progress.  In theory, anyway.  I suspected it would be the same as having a black president and bring out ALL the misogynists as it has the racists.</p>

<p>But yeah, that&#39;s what the vast majority of my smart lady friends were hoping.  Because far too many Republicans won&#39;t be happy until women are back in the kitchen, worshipping our savior Jesus Christ and having lots and lots of babies.</p>

<p>T_d hates GOP and DNC.  Very anti-establishment and red-pilled.  The only place they&#39;re lacking is in their refusal to condemn Trump for his inappropriate behavior and poor decisions, but it&#39;s kind of expected in a fan-boy sub.  At least there&#39;s no false pretenses like other political subs pretending to be neutral while being completely biased. </p>

<p>inb4 - Anyone who promotes T_d is a bigot and all -ists (racist sexist etc).  They&#39;re fighting against the same establishment we are, they just won&#39;t admit Trump is part of it. </p>

<p>Other great things he’s done:
-Renegotiating TPP and NAFTA
-Ending CIA arming or Syrian “rebels” (ISIS)
-Destroying regulations (most important). Economy already booming because of this.
-Jobs coming back
-actually dealing with NK
-Got other countries to increase their defense spending 
-Cracking down on illegal immigration
-merit based immigration (!!!! Needed for decades)
-Handled natural disasters very well
-Proposed Tax code is excellent</p>

<p>and don&#39;t forget that anthropogenic environmental factors extend beyond climate change. look at flint, look at the marathon plant in detroit. in areas where air or water is polluted, be it through governmental or corporate bodies, grave consequences are observed on human health. it&#39;s not fake. it&#39;s observable fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m a left libertarian. communism isn&#39;t my shit try again. </p>

<p>I believe in not just climate change but the anthropocene. i believe that our oil and natural gas resources are dwindling and if we continue to invest in oil and coal like we do now, we&#39;ll be blindsided when we realize it&#39;s all gone. </p>

<p>oil dependency contributes to climate change. you can argue about the extent of the contribution but it&#39;s there. but environmental issues go far beyond the changing climate. there are pollutants in our air, water, and food. species are going extinct at a truly unprecedented rate. even if climate alarmists are exaggerating, the point still stands: global industry is damaging our environment. ecologies require homeostasis to function; even the biggest natural disasters haven&#39;t destroyed homeostasis like human factors have. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t believe in monetizing climate change. it&#39;s not that I support the EU, but I support the government bodies that currently exist in regulating emissions and building permits. not just because climate change, but because oil dependency is damaging in other ways as well. </p>

<p>The consensus is that the earth is warming, and that humans have contributed to it.</p>

<p>There is no consensus that humans cause the warming, or are even the largest factor in temperature changes. No one knows how much humans contribute to warming. </p>

<p>Further it’s ludicrous to say that taxing carbon in the us  will stop warming, since carbon dioxide is already in the atmosphere ,  while china and India are not gong to stop increasing their emissions exponentially so how would trump “acknowledging” it help anything?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I made a post last night because I see this sub dominated by anti Hillary everything, and some of it is definitely a conspiracy theory (just figured out that&#39;s what you meant by CT), but a lot of it are actual cross posts that actually are posted by the same user that posted it in r/t_d. Many aren&#39;t CT&#39;s at all, simply news. Not news that supports any conspiracy theory either. Those are what I have a problem with.</p>

<p>So my post was about the relevance of Hillary versus Trump. If either died, was murdered, or arrested.. what would be the result?</p>

<p>Someone made a pretty good point, that if she&#39;s arrested it could change policy.. but even that&#39;s a political explanation.</p>

<p>Downvoted to hell, attacked, called a shill, when the entire idea I was trying to make is that there&#39;s a difference between actual conspiracy theories, and news.. and people posting with an agenda.</p>

<p>I absolutely agree with OP on just about everything, but they ignore the difference between posts that have zero to do with a conspiracy theory, that actually belong in a political sub, hence why they were posted in t_d.</p>

<p>Just like you made a point, who&#39;s saying &quot;fuck yeah, Hillary&quot;.. there&#39;s not a single post I&#39;ve ever seen here that makes her look good, because it&#39;s safe to say, no one likes her. Fuck, that alone is reason enough she lost.</p>

<p>There&#39;s obviously an agenda, I definitely don&#39;t play party politics, and while the OP might be right that most of us aren&#39;t biased, we want Justice.. there&#39;s definitely many of those that not only push, but attack based purely based on right wing politics.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t even seem to be that many people actually commenting, they&#39;re just all over the every post.. and t_d definitely votes strongly here.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Someone posted a link to the Kymberley Suchomel thing (which has been re-posted here about 50 times) and titled the thread &quot;Witness to multiple shooter found dead?&quot; </p>

<p>Anyone who actually read Kymberley&#39;s Facebook post would know that she didn&#39;t &quot;witness&quot; anything related to multiple shooters. She said she &quot;felt&quot; like there was more than one shooter, but that&#39;s it. It was arguably the most insignificant multiple shooter testimony on social media. So I asked OP if s/he&#39;d actually read Kymberley&#39;s Facebook post. Got downvoted (that&#39;s right, downvoted for asking &quot;did you actually read the testimony you&#39;re posting about?&quot;) but no response from OP. </p>

<p>A different user (&quot;User X&quot;), who&#39;d already commented elsewhere on the thread (pointing out the lack of conspiracy here), replied to my comment with a parody call-out. I reciprocated, copying User X&#39;s comment and then modifying it slightly to one-up the absurdity. User X hit back with a parodied attack, so I reciprocated, copying User X&#39;s comment and then modifying it slightly to one-up the absurdity. And that last comment was removed for violating Rule #5 (&quot;No stalking or trolling&quot;). </p>

<p>This was the actual exchange: </p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p>OP: &quot;Witness to multiple shooter found dead?&quot; </p>

<p>Me: Did you actually read her Facebook post?</p>

<p>User X: Oh, you don&#39;t think the word of a lady who said she thinks she might have seen some things that maybe would nearly lead her to believe there may be multiple shooters would hold up in court?</p>

<p>Me: Oh, you don&#39;t think the word of a lady who said she thinks she might have seen some things that maybe would nearly lead her to believe there may be multiple shooters would be worth sneaking into her house at 4:30am and covertly murdering her in her sleep? What kind of shill are you?  </p>

<p>User X: You&#39;re a dumbass dude. They clearly shot her through her window with a heart attack gun. That&#39;s why no one heard her get murdered.  </p>

<p>Me: You&#39;re the dumbass. They clearly murdered her whole family, liquified them, and then hired crisis actors to play her grandmother and doctor. That&#39;s why the grandmother is saying she had pre-existing health conditions and died of natural causes. Because it&#39;s not her actual grandmother.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>My last comment was removed for violating Rule #5 (&quot;No stalking or trolling&quot;). </p>

<p>It was very, very obvious that we were joking around with each other, no trolling or stalking. The only reason I can think for why I&#39;d have that comment removed is because someone reported me. No idea why. </p>

<p>Politics came up kind of a lot in conversations last year and I always asked, non judgmentally, &quot;Why do you like her?&quot; and it was always, always, always either that she wasn&#39;t Trump.</p>

<p>I mean there were a few whose reasons began and ended at the sexist &quot;Because she&#39;s a woman&quot; but that&#39;s not really being excited about her.  That&#39;s literally the nicest thing I heard anyone say about her.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also educated and had a large amount of respect for Hillary.  She&#39;s a bulldog.  She&#39;s taken shit for 20+ years and kept going.  I think she really does care about the little man - well, as much as any politician who does.  She showed progress in her politics - and while perceived by many as flip-flopping, I perceived it as growth and expanding her perspective.</p>

<p>Is she shady as fuck?  Maybe.  Is she a politician?  Absolutely.  But I don&#39;t think she was the she-demon many believe.  And while I&#39;m not a fan of the woman card - I do think she has gotten more shit because she&#39;s a woman, when male politicians skirt by on the very same issues.</p>

<p>I see this on the reg now here. I was wondering, is this some back handed acknowledgment of the conspiracies at the time ? OR a childish effort to put some conspiracies on trump ? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Same, my reasoning is that both parties are nearly the same corporate garbage.
There is no left, center or moderate right in the two party system.
We had Bernie who was slightly left of center and a moderate left libertarian (Europe would consider him directly centrist)....but the DNC rigged the primaries against him.</p>

<p>We just have EXTREME right NEOliberal vs EXTREME right NEOliberal.
A shitty NEOcon/NEOlib coin with snakes on each side.</p>

<p>TLDR: the Dem vs Repub thing is an artificial
constraint.....zoom out and you see the rest of the actual political spectrum:</p>

Understanding the system of Blue vs Red does not mean we forgo the opportunity to point out severe corruption, lack of Justice, and undeniable tyranny from persons of either parties while in office.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is what always irritates me, is that people hate Trump, and rightly so in my opinion, but the thing about Trump is that whatever he is, he is quite blatant about it, and whatever he is, he isn&#39;t ANY WORSE than any of the others. The thing that&#39;s ever so slightly better about Trump is that he is more honest about what a sleazeball he is, he lies blatantly so that everyone can see it, and his lies are picked up on and pored over by the press, and rightly so. The problem is that when Hillary lies blatantly, the MSM doesn&#39;t pick up on it or hammer it home to the public nearly so much, because her fingers are more into the media pies than his are, I presume. And the problem with that is that way too many people still think that the media more or less tells the truth.</p>

<p>Trump acts in ways that have people gasping and horrified, but what they don&#39;t seem to realise is that the main difference is that with Trump they can see it, with the others, they made an effort to hide it while being at least as corrupt and slimy as he is, if not more. We should all be horrified about ALL OF THEM, and we should prefer the crimes and misdeeds of our presidents and politicians to be out there and reported on by the mainstream media and not have this pathetic media that covers up or just doesn&#39;t bother to investigate those people who put on a false face to the public. </p>

<p>It blows my mind the people that come here and talk about the Russia-Trump connection and the Russia meddling in the US election stuff as though they haven&#39;t actually looked into it any deeper than the mainstream reports on it. Everybody, if you&#39;re new here, the first thing you have to realise is that you cannot base your assessment of a story on the place it is reported. Places can be corrupted, no matter who they are, whether the NYT, Washington Post, CNN, Fox, Infowars, Russia Today, BBC, Buzzfeed, Snopes, your favorite independent media youtube channel, etc. You have to look at the evidence, not at where it&#39;s being reported. You have to use your own brain to connect dots and ask yourself whether a story makes sense. And engage with communities of citizen researchers who are much more likely to include people who aren&#39;t corrupted or easily corruptible, and the nature of crowd sourcing is that the bunk information will often get found out and sink to the bottom of relevance or get challenged time and again until a consensus is reached, based on evidence provided. EVIDENCE. It&#39;s the most important thing, along with your own brain.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know. I can&#39;t think of one thing he&#39;s done that would make me say &quot;hmm, this is the right direction&quot;. I have legit never felt more divided as a country until Trump came along. The tax plan, the healthcare, it&#39;s literally all just handouts to the rich. I have no idea why someone thought a 71 year old 3rd generation millionaire turned billionaire who lives in a gold tower and has literally bragged about quid pro quo on the debate stage, would stick it to the establishment and stand up for us. I get the Clinton hate, I hate her too. But literally the only criticism of Clinton that doesn&#39;t fit Trump is that he isn&#39;t as boring as her. I have no idea how someone who was against Clinton for being close to wall street, or too war hawkish, or shady with her money, or thinks that she is complicit with sexual assault, looks at Trump and goes &quot;Hmm he&#39;s the opposite of that&quot;</p>

<p>Like they are both shit but it&#39;s frustrating that Trump is getting <em>so much</em> wiggle room and leeway and the bar set for how he preforms is so low. I just want people to hold everyone accountable and not turn a blind eye because he&#39;s the one they voted for. </p>

<p>I have a purely conjectural theory that the reason we won WWII is that the experiments in Nazism and Communism as ways for the power greedy elite to rule absolutely failed.  the over-concentrated power was too vulnerable to being taken over by a single charismatic individual.</p>

<p>The US style system gets around that by having three stated branches of government plus many other defacto branches (The press, Education, Intellegence, Federal reserve and others)  Making it much more difficult for a single individual to really wield power even as the president.</p>

It&#39;s a bullshit position built on lies and broken promises and time and time again people fall for it. The amount of Trump ballwashing going on in this place last year was fucking embarrassing. Anyone who felt like he was an outsider or feel like he deserves a chance doesn&#39;t belong here.
The very position of President is corrupt and anti-American. They don&#39;t like you. They don&#39;t respect you. They think you are trash and they toy with your emotions to get elected (if you even believe in the process of elections) and then toss you aside. It happens every. Single. Time. And yet no one ever learns a thing. I feel like this is Conspiracy 101. It&#39;s a big club and YOU AREN&#39;T PART OF IT. You never were, never will be. The entire system is designed to fuck you but tell you that you can make a difference.
Trump this, Trump that. Put Hillary in that position and its the same outcome. America is built on a war economy and all they care about is keeping that going for as long as possible. Nothing else matters. And they sure as shit aren&#39;t going to let an &quot;outsider&quot; in a position to fuck up their plans. The fact that this has to even be discussed is ridiculous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what it is.</p>

<p>But if you happen to have an interest in conspiracies and power then The Powers That Be is a practical definition to use.</p>

<p>&quot;haves vs the have nots&quot; is in my opinion a definition that will lead to a less complex understanding of the issues at hand, you will have a hard time discerning which parts of the &quot;haves&quot; that are NOT part of a this shitshow. You will also have issues &quot;seeing&quot; when the &quot;have nots&quot; is making powerplays.</p>

<p>It is a static defintion that works very well in understanding the global system (we can call it capitalism) but it is - IMO - inherently flawed when it comes to understanding conspiracies.</p>

<p>The global system is not dependent on any one person. You cannot combat it by attacking specific people, even the president. It is the &quot;way things work&quot; and to change it you have to change how a lot of people think about life.</p>

<p>Conspiracies on the other hand, ARE depending on specific persons. It makes sense to use the term, The Powers That Be because it inherently tells us what the subject of our &quot;investigation&quot; is.</p>

<p>Who did it? why did they do it?</p>

<p>My reading comprehension is just fine. Myself and plenty of others looked right through his bullshit.

    <div class="md"><p>This is such a terrible post. &quot;With Trump, there was a slight hope that the swamp would be drained&quot;. Really, there was? Seems to me we have a case of an out of touch billionaire real estate mogul with a history of using eminent domain laws to take people&#39;s property for his own profit. He makes several lofty campaign promises (build the wall and have Mexico pay for it, Lock Her Up, Drain the swamp) which he has almost totally dropped or done the opposite. He threatened to shut down the government if they didn&#39;t put funding for his wall in the budget, it took him about a week after being elected to praise Clinton&#39;s service and say she suffered greatly, and he has filled his cabinet with billionaires and political insiders (Devos, Mnuchin, Tillerson, his kids, etc). He is a pathological liar.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t even get me started on the sex stuff. Trump has a history of sexual assault and harassment allegations going back 30 years, but the sub that goes through leaked emails looking for anything &quot;suspicious&quot; that could be code for child molestation thinks every allegation against Trump is made up. &quot;So the post trying to connect Trump more to Epstein than Bill Clinton who was actually a frequent flyer comes across as very disingenuous&quot;? Really? How about they&#39;re both connected to a known pedophile? Why do you deflect so hard for him when you claim to be non- partisan? I&#39;m so fucking sick of these BS posts where people claim to &quot;non-partisan&quot; but end up defending our lord and savior dumbass. Rant over</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.</p>

<p>Part of that is the mainstream media increasingly painting all conspiracy-minded folks as...</p>

<p>1) right-wing libertarians (especially post 9/11 with the &quot;truther&quot; label)</p>

<p>and</p>

<p>2) racists (especially since the second term of Obama, and that whole birth certificate thing didn&#39;t help)</p>

<p>It&#39;s also telling how the mainstream narrative has completely turned against Wikileaks once it released documents unfavourable to their candidate of choice, to the point where many have forgotten that Wikileaks also released docs unfavourable to the Russians so that they could paint Wikileaks as a mouthpiece OF the Russians.</p>

<p>It&#39;s quite infuriating that half the discussion in most &quot;conspiracy&quot; places is focused on wading through party politics nonsense.</p>

However, they can be a bit much with their blind support for a man they don&#39;t know and that haven&#39;t lived in the real world for his entire life.</p>

<p>I want him to do good. And while he can pat himself on the back for bringing back jobs, the real problem today is the widespread corruption and the cults they represent.. 
And changing that means changing the perception of the people, not the so called leaders. Humans deify others way too fast, especially if it&#39;s a person they have never met. The human mind has a sick way of filling in the gaps with bullshit to better suit their image.</p>

<p>We really should get back to creating strong societies again, smaller ones where your leader is a person who knows you by name. Not by your slave number, medical records and taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel like if there was anything there we’d have seen it by now, especially before the election. I’m all for an investigation into the Russia connection, as if he did something blatantly egregious he’d lose my support.</p>

<p>But talking with foreign diplomats for oppo research, while not exactly a good look, is not only common... but pales in comparison to the people who have the majority of their fundraisers outside the US.</p>

<p>I don’t think the portrait of trump supporters by this sub is often completely fair. Speaking for myself, and the ones I know, we know Trump isn’t by any means perfect. everyday one of my closest friends and I waver between him being the greatest Trojan horse of all time, and an admittedly optimistic view of a man tactically trying to undo a 25 year metastasized web that has hollowed out our government and essentially left us circling the drain. </p>

<p>This is where I think the community, or at least the outspoken ones, misunderstand at least a large percentage of trump supporters. Most of us browse this sub, hate the establishment, agree in that most elections are a facade giving the illusion of choice, and subscribe the same nefarious motives when it comes to “lone shooters” and “terrorist attacks”.</p>

<p>It saddens me because I think that the absolute darkness of what we see on a daily basis often overwhelms the important moral grey areas. Most of his supporters are as worried as you are about many of the people in Trumps cabinet, and aren’t just blindly following the administration. But it’s about a broader movement which finally has an electable spokesperson. Whether he was using everyone remains to be seen, but at this point the rationalizations that can sometimes seem grasping, and borderline myopic hope, is not from a place of ignorance, but rather a pessimism in that if he can’t reverse this course, then we’re all fucked.</p>

<p>It’s like yes we admit trump could’ve been the greatest Trojan horse/Manchurian candidate in political history, put not only are the stakes are greater, but a light has been shown on what we have suspected for decades. There’s no going back to how things were. </p>

<p>This isn’t to convince anyone to be a trump supporter, or not shit on the annoying cross posts. But rather to help understand why communities like this have such a crossover, and the vital role you all serve as one of the only communities that isn’t infected with a polarizing paradigm. Therefore you are some of the only people who can keep us honest, so continue to do so; but without the assumption that we are ignorant, misguided, and/or dismissive - because that only further divides and subsequently increases the absolute black or white fanaticism</p>

<p>That being said, neither of them were responsible for Kennedy&#39;s assassination. Neither of them were responsible for the entry into Vietnam. Neither of them were responsible for Senator Mccarthy&#39;s Communism witch hunts. </p>

<p>And in the long game - he bet on being able to do more good staying in the system rather than blowing it up.  I mean, the Clintons have weathered some serious scandals and come out fine - odds weren&#39;t in his favor.

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t disagree at all.  But look at the state of the conservative party these days?  They are tearing themselves apart.  McCain was one of the most highly respected Republicans and the party (and this sub) are foaming at the mouth to take him out for calling bullshit on Trump (which is right, necessary and important).  I think we all know, right or wrong, McCain is going to lose in the short term because Trumps supporters carry so much weight.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s what would have happened to the Democrats and he knew that.  Hillary carried more weight than Bernie.  I have no idea why, but it would have only damaged him in the long run and he rightfully didn&#39;t want to risk it.  And in the end, he was right.  Hillary lost anyway and he still has the respect of the party (and now has the weight since Hillary is OUT), and earned even more supporters in the process (in my opinion).</p>

<p>The reason I voted for Trump was like you said, I want to see the swap drained. I also agree with a lot of his ideas about making America great again.

    <div class="md"><p>few points:</p>

<p>1) I find this sub to be a place for a proxy war between pro Trump and anti Trump posters. In the politics sub, u say anything that isnt hardcore left, downvoted to hell instantly, with a possible ban. At T_D, anything vaguely anti-Trump is dealt equally harsh from what I have observed. Im not saying this is right or wrong, those subs are partisan, so be it. But here the sub is at least supposedly neutral politically, so trumpers can literally argue with anti trumpers. I enjoy this.</p>

<p>2) in general, agree with OP premise, justice should be equal. However, although I agree with the OP conceptually, lets be serious and frank. There isnt a shred of actual evidence, and hasnt been, that Trump has done ANYTHING that is deserving of &quot;justice&quot;. It has been a sham, lock, stock, and barrel, for nearly a year now. Disgusting and pathetic, but its been 100% establishment mediaplex narrative-pushing. The evidence that is now coming to light about various HRC related persons ACTUALLY &quot;colluding&quot; with various foreign entities is substantial and just being covered up due to corruption. Im somewhat sanguine about &quot;justice&quot; mainly because I dont think any will be done, but to try and equate Trump with HRC on the issue of &quot;justice&quot; is somewhat comical.</p>

<p>I mean, if you trust CNN as &quot;news&quot; then I could see demanding &quot;equal justice&quot;, but I didnt think there was anything left that thought MSM is anything other than what it is, modern west Pravda/Tass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>THANK YOU. Now let the hillbots and brainwashed fools out themselves with their ridiculous posturing. &quot;If you agree with ANYTHING trump, you don&#39;t belong here&quot; lol GTFO BOTS. </p>

<p>This is a forum for critical thinkers, where everything is to be considered and discussed, your propaganda has no place here. The bottom line is a lot of interesting things have gone down in this administration, and it&#39;s only getting started. The shift in public conscience alone speaks volumes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been to <a href="/r/The_Donald">/r/The_Donald</a> and it&#39;s nowhere near as horrible as SOME PEOPLE make it out to be. Is it pro-trump? yes, will they censor you? sure. It&#39;s fucking reddit, what did you expect. But the BOTS on here will probably label me a &quot;trump supporter lol&quot; just because i&#39;m not willing to slant his every move in a negative way. I didn&#39;t even vote for the dude, some people are mistaking partisanship for real ideological differences. </p>

<p>Again, this sub is for rational discussion. &quot;Trump is rich you dumb sheeple&quot; has no place here and is besides the point. </p>

<p>I see so many Hillary supporters on here (probably paid for by ShareBlue or just radicalized on their own) claiming that we are Trump supporters</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have never voted, although I did consider voting for Ralph Nader in the first election I was old enough to vote in and might have voted for Bernie if he had won the primary. I think Democrats and Republicans are 2 sides of the same coin and members of both parties are corrupt to the bone.</p>

<p>That being said, it should be clear to anyone that in the last 6 months thus sub has become T_D 2.0. They are the ones responsible for making this sub so divisive by trying to put all the blame on one side. The page constantly has posts bashing Hillary, instead of focusing on the big picture and the problems with the system as a whole. Most of the alt-right posts I see here don&#39;t even have anything to do with a conspiracy.</p>

Currently McCabe and Rosenstien who work with Trump along with Muller have been found guilty of corruption in the past. If they get fired, then we know he&#39;s fair for both sides. If they don&#39;t, then I&#39;m gonna start questioning where his real loyalty lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said OP.  I think the support for Trump that happens on here is due to the continued hope that he will help take down corrupt individuals in DC.  If people here were blindly in support of Republicans, than people would be defending the Bushes whenever they come up, but that&#39;s not the case.  People here hate The Bushes as much as the Clintons, and rightfully so.  I&#39;m sick of people here acting like you don&#39;t belong on this sub unless you follow the conspiracy narrative that everyone in DC is equally evil.</p>

<p>So Ron Paul or Dennis Kucinich or Cynthia Mckinney are just as bad as George HW Bush or Hillary Clinton?  Bullshit.  Hillary is a proven swamp rat.  Trump is not.  I don&#39;t know why some people here insist on pretending that they&#39;re both equally bad and if you don&#39;t agree that they&#39;re both equally bad then you&#39;re an idiot and a pawn.  That line of thinking is retarded.</p>

<p>I use to be partisan but with gender, race, religious and sexual politics pushed onto us and our kids, don&#39;t you think you need to grow up and choose a side? That is the real world we live in and you need to fight evil with evil is around. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You say that like you genuinely believe Trump isn’t part of the establishment, like he’s not ‘The Man’  or the machine that we rage against.</p>

<p>He’s been involved in politics for years, he was in bed with the Clintons up to a certain point, he hasn’t drained the swamp, he’s just replaced it like for like.</p>

<p>They’re all one in the same. He might be ruffling up feathers in the GOP but they’re all part of the same pie and bedfellows with each other. They’re the true 1% and they don’t let outsiders in, no matter how much Trump convinces you he’s not accepted by them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is what I subscribe to.  The whole process is bullshit.  I have been repeatedly let down in my time.  Never changes.</p>

<p>People were so happy to get Obama....the first black president.  Surely he will exact some justice and right wrongs in our time!  Wrong.</p>

<p>People were so happy to get Billy Clinton because he was so &quot;down to earth&quot; and a real person!  Surely he will represent us the way no one else has!  <em>buzzer sound</em></p>

<p>People actually wanted Dubya in because he ran on a zero war, zero intervention policy.  Surely he would follow through or take measured steps before commiting to such things if he were &quot;forced&quot; on him!  <em>wet fart sound</em></p>

<p>It is a game and we keep getting fooled or we keep believing the hype and keep being manipulated by the media.  </p>

<p>Everyone thinks everyone else will be working hard to have a voice and stand up for everyone else.  Everyone thinks everyone else is doing the work.  Everyone thinks someone else is representing them.  Where does that leave everyone?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m a left libertarian. communism isn&#39;t my shit try again. </p>

<p>I believe in not just climate change but the anthropocene. i believe that our oil and natural gas resources are dwindling and if we continue to invest in oil and coal like we do now, we&#39;ll be blindsided when we realize it&#39;s all gone. </p>

<p>oil dependency contributes to climate change. you can argue about the extent of the contribution but it&#39;s there. but environmental issues go far beyond the changing climate. there are pollutants in our air, water, and food. species are going extinct at a truly unprecedented rate. even if climate alarmists are exaggerating, the point still stands: global industry is damaging our environment. ecologies require homeostasis to function; even the biggest natural disasters haven&#39;t destroyed homeostasis like human factors have. </p>

<p>i don&#39;t believe in monetizing climate change. it&#39;s not that I support the EU, but I support the government bodies that currently exist in regulating emissions and building permits. not just because climate change, but because oil dependency is damaging in other ways as well. </p>

I think she really does care about the little man - well, as much as any politician who does.  She showed progress in her politics - and while perceived by many as flip-flopping, I perceived it as growth and expanding her perspective.</p>

<p>Is she shady as fuck?  Maybe.  Is she a politician?  Absolutely.  But I don&#39;t think she was the she-demon many believe.  And while I&#39;m not a fan of the woman card - I do think she has gotten more shit because she&#39;s a woman, when male politicians skirt by on the very same issues.</p>
