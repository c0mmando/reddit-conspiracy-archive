    <div class="md"><p>One thing people fail to realize is how (relatively) recently the Soviet Union dissolved and was replaced by the Russian Federation. During the time of the transition, does it not stand to reason that US politicians would attempt some manner of contact with the Russian government, or maybe use super wealthy oligarghs to chip away at the power Soviet leaders had in an attempt to exert American control? Wouldn&#39;t these relationships still potentially exist? And wouldn&#39;t some have been made during Bill&#39;s tenure? </p>

<p>Good point. However, Bush Sr. was in office during and prior to the collapse. It makes sense that both American dynasties would cut deals with desperate Soviets of renown, though.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>First published in 1971, Rules for Radicals is Saul Alinsky&#39;s impassioned counsel to young radicals on how to effect constructive social change and know âthe difference between being a realistic radical and being a rhetorical one.â Written in the midst of radical political developments whose direction Alinsky was one of the first to question, this volume exhibits his style at its best. Like Thomas Paine before him, Alinsky was able to combine, both in his person and his writing, the intensity of political engagement with an absolute insistence on rational political discourse and adherence to the American democratic tradition.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read it in depth, or any of the original works, but Alinsky&#39;s work doesn&#39;t seem nearly as sinister as it&#39;s portrayed here. And Rules for Radicals was written two years after Hillary&#39;s thesis. And the rules don&#39;t seem to include &quot;blame the other guy for what you&#39;re to blame for&quot;. </p>

<p>As for idealizing,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The thesis was sympathetic to Alinsky&#39;s critiques of government antipoverty programs, but criticized Alinsky&#39;s methods as largely ineffective, all the while describing Alinsky&#39;s personality as appealing.[4] The thesis sought to fit Alinsky into a line of American social activists, including Eugene V. Debs, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Walt Whitman. Written in formal academic language, the thesis concluded that &quot;[Alinsky&#39;s] power/conflict model is rendered inapplicable by existing social conflicts&quot; and that Alinsky&#39;s model had not expanded nationally due to &quot;the anachronistic nature of small autonomous conflict.&quot;[4]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump undermines himself by being in the executive office of our country and not even knowing how the &quot;rules&quot; (laws) work. That&#39;s why he calls news he doesn&#39;t like fake or deflects by using Obama or Hillary as a scapegoat. You don&#39;t get to claim some moral high ground when you&#39;re abusing the powers of your office.</p>

<p>Trump has violated constitutional law, misused government funds, abdicated his duty, in turn violating his oath, he&#39;s obstructed justice, he&#39;s lied about making deals in Russia when we know for a fact his family and campaign manager both were doing so, they have still yet to separate themselves from their assets and who knows if their business are being used as access points for corruption, the list goes on and on. You can keep trying to swat the Russia stuff away, but its going to keep coming back because Trump is chin deep in his own bullshit.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, but its every day with some of you. You look silly and ridiculous trying to say this person has committed a crime or that person committed a crime without really even knowing or understand the &quot;laws&quot; which you are referring to. And then you act like the Justice Department is a dog on a leash in the hands of the President? Some people calling for Clintons arrest or egging Trump on to bullshit. Go ahead, have fun, piss 250+ years of the Constitution down the drain because Trump, a lying lazy criminal, doesn&#39;t know what the fuck he&#39;s doing.</p>

<p>I&#39;m leaving this here. If this doesn&#39;t totally apply to you that&#39;s fine because it might to someone else. GG you did it fellas. You managed to elect the most corrupt President in U.S history. </p>

<p>What the hell did you just say to me? The Dialectic? Really? Did you just pull that out of your ass to make what you said sound cool?</p>

<p>&quot;They knew..&quot; </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry man, but I believe in the profit motive and tribalism and greed and that&#39;s about it. They are from the same ilk, rich and powerful, doesn&#39;t mean they &quot;get along.&quot; Or all have some master plan. Each group has its own agenda, each individual, each entity, some align, some don&#39;t. This grandiose scale of deep secret society and mind control stuff just boils down to rich people wanting more money and power. Big surprise? Also, Trump is not manageable. 10:1 He&#39;s been on fucking Xanex for the last couple months. Or some kind of mood stabilizer ever since Charlottesville happened because he can&#39;t handle the stress. The saddest and scariest part is that I&#39;m pretty sure none of this is really planned, the CIA does their thing, but that&#39;s about it. Washington is broken because dumb people elected dumb people to work their. Period. You can have paper ballots if you want and count them yourself. </p>

<p>Nothing will change until stupid people do or the smart ones outfuck/outvote the dumb ones. I believe in this generation more than I believed in the last one. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.
They also obtained an eyewitness account — backed by documents — indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton’s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.
The racketeering scheme was conducted “with the consent of higher level officials” in Russia who “shared the proceeds” from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.

<p>Trump&#39;s not a Manchurian candidate really, he was just the dumbest and most divisive outcome. It makes plenty of sense that our geopolitical rivals would do all they could to nudge a divisive idiot into the Oval, especially one who was promising warmer relations and a possible revocation of sanctions (money).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least the numbers in the republican primaries matched the exit poll numbers.  Are you familiar with the double digit differentials in the dem primary official tallies vs exit polls?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve learned the worst thing you can do is support/hate a candidate based solely on the letter than comes after their name.  Though if you&#39;re trying to make a point with your last statement you might want to give it another go, because it&#39;s pretty nonsensical.</p>

<p>And yet here you are, going to bat for the Republicans and attacking Democrats over and over. Weird how that works out!</p>

<p>It&#39;s silly to pretend the parties don&#39;t represent anything. 99 times out of 100, a Democratic candidate is going to throw more bones to minorities and poor people than the Republican would, if only for branding purposes, and that&#39;s where my political interests are in spite of not being completely poor or at all a minority. I realize they&#39;re both going to try and hoodwink and leech me as much as possible in the meantime, but bad and worse isn&#39;t a hard decision for me.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reading it back and I think it makes sense enough. Basically, there&#39;s a lot of messed up stuff in our politics people don&#39;t want to reckon with, so they blame the Russians when they hold up a strategic mirror every once in a while. It&#39;s mostly a way of pretending Hillary didn&#39;t <em>really</em> lose to a jackass and that the country isn&#39;t <em>really</em> full of people willing to celebrate or at least overlook what they saw as Trump&#39;s disqualifying flaws. Basically, &quot;Am I so out of touch? ...No, it&#39;s the Russians.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Lol I&#39;ve never done anything to support the repubs in my entire life.  &quot;Their exit poll data matches their results&quot; isn&#39;t praise, it&#39;s just stating a fact.  </p>

<p>That makes a lot more sense than what you previously wrote.  I don&#39;t think it has anything to do with it being American though, the media has stepped up how much it lies to the US public a hell of a lot recently.</p>

<p>As an example, see: projected outcome of the last presidential election based on a cherry picked sample set instead of one that would more accurately represent the US.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, looking at the story, there&#39;s three main threads:</p>

<p>1) Russian company paid kickbacks to U.S. truckers; perpetrators were later arrested, charged and sentenced.</p>

<p>2) The same Russian company sought to purchase shares in a Canadian Uranium company during the Obama Administration.  The U.S. can veto such deals, though it usually doesn&#39;t, and it didn&#39;t in this case.</p>

<p>3) Russian oligarchs, including some connected to this company, have given donations to the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>That stuff is all verified.  What&#39;s complete speculation is any connection between them.  I.e., no evidence the committee reviewing the deal knew about the kickbacks; no evidence the DOJ knew it should be informing the approval committee of the kickbacks (not even clear they had an obligation to); no evidence Clinton was really involved in the approval.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously did you read the article? They literally say they funneled money to the the Clinton Foundation and used extortion, and bribery to get the deal to go through. Ontop of that it was implied the FBI sat on evidence that should have destroyed any chance of the deal being approved. If that is what globalization is, count me out. I don&#39;t think globalization is bad, but this is not a shining example of it. </p>

<p>No evidence Clinton was involved in the approval at all.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the official who was the State Department&#39;s representative on CFIUS at the time, Jose Hernandez, told Time magazine that Clinton did not participate in the evaluation of this deal: &quot;Secretary Clinton never intervened with me on any CFIUS matter,&quot; he said.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the <strong>FBI in fact had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee’s decision that Vadim Mikerin</strong> — the main Russian overseeing Putin’s nuclear expansion inside the United States — <strong>was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.</strong></p>

<p>Then-Attorney General <strong>Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time</strong> the Uranium One deal was approved. <strong>Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.</strong></p>

<p>yeah it looks bad, but doesn&#39;t prove anything.</p>

<p>if anything, it shows that the russians were kinda stupid if they thought that the clintons had control over this decision.</p>

<p>everyone keeps forgetting that like 15 people outside of the state department had to sign off on this deal. it wasn&#39;t &quot;hillary&#39;s decision,&quot; she was just one of many department heads that had to sign off on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s it? That&#39;s the bombshell? Come on. We already knew this shit. It was obvious. Nothing happens in our government unless money is being passed around. We&#39;re certainly not going to be making a huge uranium deal with fucking russia unless someone is getting rich off of it. I guess it helps that there is more open proof and discussion for this but it&#39;s kind of lame that they were hyping this up so much. </p>

<p>Foreign lobbying is literally legal in our government anyway. This whole collusion arc has been ridiculous from the beginning. We openly accept money from foreign powers to influence our government but somehow it&#39;s a big deal to think a campaign had cables with one or our politicians were bribed to influence policy by one.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re going to start taking issue with this we need to get money out of politics from the ground up. Stop lobbying. Stop predatory regulations used as extortion. Be more transparent and honest and get rid of the people who are obviously full of shit just in it for the money and power.</p>

<p>This is about Russians using influence and kick backs, like every country and businesses does, to get an upper hand in buying Uranium. Its a bit shady, but nothing that is being investigated into Trump.</p>

<p>Trump and his Son in law are both accused of using russian influence, and bots, especially on forums like T_D to influence the election and also hacking and compromising election voter booths. Both have been proven allready, they are just finding a comprehensive amount of to which degree. </p>

<p>So some russian influence on buying uranium that happened to take place during two democratic administrations VS proven Trump buying influence to win an election, and you word it as if trump is innocent and clinton and obama were in bed with the russians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know the saying: You accuse your enemies of what you, yourself, are most guilty.  It especially applies to the our own country (the U.S. government, specifically) accusing the Chinese or Russians during the Cold War of a monolithic communist conspiracy to control the world.  The conspiratorial monolith was actually the evil, genocidal CIA.  As examples, Vietnam was the CIA&#39;s war.  Between 3 and 6 million innoncent Vietnamese died in Vietnam.  Probably 4 or 5 million Iraqis died in Bush Senior and Bush Junior&#39;s 2 wars against Iraq.  Probably 8 million Koreans died in the Korean War of the 1950s.  Those are genocidal numbers.  Hundreds of thousands of Central Americans died in the CIA&#39;s quest for domination and subjugation of that region.  The list goes on and on and on.</p>

<p>The CIA and the Military Industrial Complex are destroying our country, strangling our economy, limiting the greatness of the American People, of each and every liberty-loving American and peace-loving American citizen.</p>
