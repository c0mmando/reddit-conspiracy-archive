       People are weirdly expecting to find proof of a second shooter or a government conspiracy to kill the president.... I don't know why people think ANY of this evidence would be kept, especially from a time where the internet was there to back everything up into the cloud and save for eternity.

       Seriously! People really think the government will just come out and say, "Yes we took out JFK because he wanted to dismantle the CIA and Johnson's Vietnam policy was far more profitable. We take out leaders all the time if they don't fall in line."

       There's two most probably outcomes I think we can agree on. They release damning info or they release non-damning info. What's the benefit of each scenario? They release damning info? There's a huge hit to the current institution's credibility. They release non-damning info? Status quo as normal... You seriously believe they are releasing damning evidence?

       I can't find a sauce at the moment because I am on the road, but I am almost certain that I saw an article back earlier this year that said that a certain number of files from the JFK investigation were 'accidentally lost and/or destroyed'.

       I have seen a few things around here indicating the elder Bush was a part of the JFK assassination. Makes sense why we would want that file immediately upon becoming president. Yeah, any juicy info is long gone indeed.

       Even more likely is the event that the date of declassification is extended. Besides, it takes a few months to get a response when asking for copies of the declassified info. For example, info on the Roswell incident was recently declassified a little over a month ago. No news yet.

       This guy is right. I remember when the film came out and wondering why they’d lock the files for so long. Can only be so the inside people involved are retired / deceased and thus can’t be charged.

       Imagine, he gets shot in the back of the car.. everyone freaks out, 2 minutes later he bites someone.. slowly creating a hungry army that's only goal is to find the deep state that had him murdered and exact revenge..

       That's my point. It's hard to take anyone here seriously because you don't know if they genuinely believe these outlandish and insane ideas, or if it's more of an ironic mocking of the ideas. The crazier the conspiracy put forward, the more likely other people are to just dismiss anything and everything that person (or even the whole sub) says.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do believe there are definitely some conspiracies that are very possibly true, but I also believe that there are groups or organisations that are shilling subs or message boards and sharing the more crazy ideas to discredit the community and throw a real discussion of a more likely conspiracy into chaos. The whole sub is just a shitshow because I can't tell who's real or not, and which conspiracy is likely to be true or even possible.

       One important thing to educate people on here is that the OFFICIAL word from the government is that the Warren Commission was bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's step 1, because all over reddit and elsewhere you still have blowhards citing that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next step is to let them know that the last big congressional investigation's, Assassination Records Review Board, director had this to say about the investigation:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "There is substantial evidence that points toward Oswald and incriminates Oswald," he says, "and the only person we can name where there is evidence is Oswald. But there's also rather important exculpatory evidence for Oswald, suggesting he didn't do it, and that he was framed."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Along with this to say about the Warren Commission's Panel:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        they wanted to write the document in a way that would reassure the American public that it was a single gunman acting alone, somebody who's a little bit unstable, and that that's the explanation for what happened
       </p>

       I don't see how you could be excited by this. Anything meaningful will have been long gone. It will probably be lots of time-wasting material for the hard-core researcher, if there are any left alive now.

       As with any profile event look at the news before and after. Track the stories that get a mention/paragraph now and see what morphs into a full fledged multi paragraph stories, exposes and/or hearings.

       I remember in spring/summer 02 I started seeing seeing single paragraph page 13 stories in the news about Pentagon feasibility studies/scenarios on invading Iraq. It's the news that raises in profile and coverage that has an end game.

       Someone in some country most people can't pronounce, will do something not even remotely controversial and garner a little more media attention than what seems reasonable, and it will be considered a "distraction". They don't need to make a distraction. They can remove entire volumes of documentation and no one does anything.

       It'll probably lead to some half baked conclusion that points to a conspiracy but not a government conspiracy so the MSM can "close the book" on all JFK discussions. Reasonable normal people will just assume the case is closed, not like it matters to them anyways. In a few decades they'll do the same thing with 9/11.

       I am def in agreement that we can't really know if these docs are legit. Why trust a govt to release accurate docs on an assassination that we know they likely had part in and at least participated in disinformation and cover-up

       It doesn't matter if there's a distraction or not.

       All the good parts in the JFK files are probably redacted so we'll never know the truth anyways.

       Anyways, I forgot what documentary I saw but there was a guy who claimed that Russia did an investigation and believed that Lyndon Johnson was involved in the JFK assassination.

       Trying to discredit. Tells us it's mainstream enough for them to have to make articles like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if it's only a couple of new clues, it may be enough to reignite the JFK investigation in many people who might not have looked deeply into it before.

         Lets not forget that its 9 days until the Classified JFK assassination files become declassified. I'm sure a "distraction" will happen a day or two before.

       I see no reason for an elaborate false flag or bullshit news story as opposed to just, you know, not telling us the truth? Did they make a deal with a genie or something that assures us the info will be 100% complete?

       But it was the Armed CIA guard in the car behind JFK, right? Oswald opened fire and as the motorcade sped up to evacuate the president the guard accidentally fires from the unexpected jolt from the vehicle, killing JFK.

       I’m not from the US, so I might be missing some context, but how does it come to be that we’d trust a declassification event, but distrust “TPTB” enough that we would expect a distraction to happen at the same time?

       Other way around, OP. Anything informative about JFK that would get people talking is a distraction from the real events. JFK conspiracy is meaningless at this point except as an academic study of deep state activity.
