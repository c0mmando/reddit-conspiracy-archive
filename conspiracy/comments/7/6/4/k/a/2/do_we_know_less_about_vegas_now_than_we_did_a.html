        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>No pics of Campos, and he was a no show , literally disappeared from the Hannity segment.</p>

<p>We know Jack shit about paddock. Just a psycho-rant from his &#39;brother&#39; is the only background we have from a family member.</p>

<p>Sheriff gives conflicting information and has to change story a couple of times.</p>

<p>Not a single casino camera capturing paddock even being in the casino that night. Even though that would satiate the public for information of the paddock plot. Just one image. Don&#39;t even get that.</p>

<p>Paddocks house somehow broken into, despite neighbors being aware, and police weren&#39;t even watching the place?</p>

<p>More and more shifting timelines leaves us reaching for alternative theories like the Mandela effect to try to explain it.</p>

<p>Trump meets with maker of Metal detector while in Vegas, instead of the hero Campos, who wasn&#39;t feeling well enough to meet trump during trumps visit.</p>

<p>We have no motive, the Campos timeline shows he should not even be inside the Mandalay , nor have an access key for all rooms, because he was there or the harvest fest security outside and across the street.</p>

<p>Msm favors Weinstein event in favor of doing any investigation into Vegas, at all.</p>

<p>So what do we know about Vegas? Nothing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Except that the only reason anyone believes he wasn&#39;t supposed to be inside, is because they think they found proof he was supposed to be working somewhere else.. and nothing I&#39;ve seen has me convinced. </p>

<p>The hotel has in multiple ways referred to him as an employee, and a screenshot of a search (used to prove the other search was wrong) isn&#39;t the most convincing evidence for me when compared to that.</p>

<p>If someone has something more solid, I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing it. I&#39;m just thinking people are too easily accepting things as facts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Csc employees dont work on the hotel room floors. I lived in vegas for 10 years and never saw csc up in the hotel areas, only suited security went up <em>if they were called up</em>. Trust me, i went to a lot of hotel parties that got broken up by security. Rarely saw csc on the casino floor too, they mainly work at events and concerts. Bright yellow jackets, super easy to spot. </p>

<p>Have they referred to him as Larry Campos? Are all the press conferences using his middle name, all the news using his middle name.. because why? He doesn&#39;t like the name Larry?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He wasn&#39;t part of harvest fest security, it&#39;s been confirmed that he is MB security, pictures just went out of him with the Union manager the rep them.</p>

<p>At least that is what is being presented to us!</p>

<p>What we don&#39;t really know is why police/security was on floor 31, it&#39;s also strange that Schuck (maintenance guy) wouldn&#39;t be notified there is a shooter on the floor he was sent to, but I&#39;m guessing everything happened so fast that if they don&#39;t use the same radios it would have taken a minute.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who says Campos called anyone, and if he did... who did he call? I&#39;ve never heard that referenced really, and especially not made public.  Why did maintenance guy not dial 911 himself, vs calling down to maintenance/front desk? He says he saw Campos taking cover in corner, and he warned him that there was a shooter. The press conference today should clear it all up, I&#39;m sure (sarc).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They didn&#39;t dial anyone, they used radios, appearantly the maintenance guy radioed a hotel dispatcher, it has not been said who Campos radioed, and it is not known if they channels are linked.</p>

<p>If all radios only go to dispatch, and can not be heard by others than it would explain why response times for everyone were slow.</p>

<p>Something that does strike well with me though is in the maintenance guys interview he says he was in the hall way and heard shots, but the shot where not in the hallway yet, it wasn&#39;t until Campos told him to take cover that shot came down the hallway</p>

<p>How does that work? Paddock was switching back and forth from shooting down the hallway and outside or what? Maybe Dual wielding bump stock AR-15s? I dunno maybe I misunderstood him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, the maintenance guy&#39;s radio call was released. Are radio calls usually recorded? Isn&#39;t that odd? It wasn&#39;t a 911 call. Why would hotels record radio calls, especially ones coming from a maintenance guy? Is it standard procedure to record every single radio communication that goes on in a hotel? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Radio calls? Usually not. Unless there has been a lawsuit that could have been avoided if they were taped. What would most likely be taped though is phone calls. </p>

<p>The only time, in my experience, for radio calls to be recorded are for liability purposes because you have a habit of things going wrong. Not saying it doesn&#39;t happen. I&#39;ve worked for one property where we recorded all radio transmissions because of liability purposes. We had people saying inappropriate comments over the radio where guest(s) could hear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, security at casinos seem to be a different beast.. liability seems to be their biggest issue, so recording the radio seems like a simple way to avoid situations where you need to know exactly what was said, when it was said.. turns out to be important in this case for sure. It wouldn&#39;t be expensive, or hard to implement, and I remember reading an article about their security upgrade costing millions..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That was a case of a landlord who thought the crime scene had been released back to him opening up the house to the media, which rummaged through the place like hungry rats.</p>

<p>Paddock&#39;s house was a legit break in.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They&#39;re both crime scenes that you would expect the police and FBI to have a very close eye on, and they were both compromised. It&#39;s something that should be impossible, yet it&#39;s now happened twice. </p>

<p>There&#39;s been 3 mass shootings in the US where more than 10 people died in the past 4 years. In 2/3, the crime scene at the shooter&#39;s house was compromised. I don&#39;t know what that means, but it seems strange enough to be worth pointing out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we know more now. We just don&#39;t know if any of it is true other than the gunshot sounds captured on many videos which I have heard many times now. I have pieced what happened from those sounds.</p>

<p>We do have photos of Jesus Campos. We just don&#39;t know about him. Was he hotel security? Was he an agent?</p>

<p>Schuck, was he maintenance? Was he an agent?</p>

<p>If they were agents, it would explain everything. The multiple caliber gun fire, the delay in shooting. The 2 pistol shots fired at the end. Not calling the cops.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A similar thing happened after the San Bernardino shooting, it seemed really weird then and it seems really weird now. Their house didn&#39;t get broken in to, but less than 1 day after the attacks their landlord opened up their house to reporters which compromised the crime scene. </p>

<p>It really seems like the police and FBI wouldn&#39;t leave one of these houses unguarded, super weird.</p>
