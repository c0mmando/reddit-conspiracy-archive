        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My husband tried what was done in this simple/short video.  It seems as if, in the Paddock released photo, they photo copied and pasted a small image that dropped on his nose area (that is why the photo released has those dark weird areas on his nose).  When zoomed in and enlarged, the area is a perfect rectangle of a small image, that when enlarged fit Paddock&#39;s nostrils. In the released photo his nostrils are nonexistent, or what is there is all weird and odd looking.  I saw this video, and then my husband did what the person did in the video from a good on-line photo that was released by the media.  Try it.  Find a the best released photo you can, zoom in on the nose, remove the rectangle, enlarge it to size and paste down the proper nostrils.    </p>

I&#39;m almost afraid to post here, I am getting down voted so much just for asking others to try it and see how strange this is.  I wouldn&#39;t post the question if I didn&#39;t actually see it done.  That rectangle is a tiny image of nostrils.  Why is what I want to know.  Thank you.</p>

Then my h tried it out and said it was too strange for words.  If you try it you&#39;ll see that it is a perfect rectangle that just seems out of place.

<p>There&#39;s no evidence for that. Someone thought the two dark bits looked like nostrils while smoking a fat one. We&#39;ve all been there... take a nap it&#39;ll all make sense when you wake up.</p>

<p>Feel your own nostril in that area and you will most likely find that there is an overhang where the shape of the nostril is actually smaller than the cavity itself. It&#39;s hard to explain in words but you should easily find what I&#39;m referring to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have to take it on a case by case basis like you said.  This particular thing is just compression artifacts that are very common in pictures.  Especially screencaps from youtube.  With Photoshop you don&#39;t have to cut and paste a nose from someone else on top of an existing nose.  They can use the already existing nose.  Not to mention anyone with a little experience could make it so squares and lines like that don&#39;t exist.  This wouldn&#39;t be a case of oops we did a bad job, this is a case of oops we used MS Paint to change this photo. </p>

<p>Just think about it.  How many times when you look at a swimsuit models closeups in a magazine do you see artifacts like this?  We know they heavily Photoshop those types of things, yet you see very little evidence of Photoshop other than how perfect they make them look.  </p>

<p>Again, this just appears to me to be people who don&#39;t understand photo compression and Photoshop jumping to some pretty wild conclusions.  Especially when the original photo does not have the same artifacts, and it has been posted in this thread numerous times. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, thats true. But this isn&#39;t one of those cases. </p>

<p>Is there a reason to photoshop the nose? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Not really.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If it was photoshopped, would it be so painfully bad? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No. I have never used photoshop. I have maybe 30 minutes of experience with gimp, and I could do better than OP&#39;s supposed shop. Paste image of nostrils on face &gt; use blend &gt; compress. Done. Takes less than a minute.</p>

<p>Is there a logical explanation? </p>

<p>Yeah.</p>

<p>On what possible metric? You just keep spouting nonsense. That&#39;s the problem here. Let&#39;s take a trip down memory lane.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh, the nose is photoshopped, see the rectangle?! Expand it and its a set of nostrils when there should be one!!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>-That&#39;s a compression artifact. Here&#39;s a HQ image that shows it&#39;s just a shadow next to a nostril.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Oh, that high quality image is clearly photoshopped! Look at the eyes!!&quot;</p>

<p>-That&#39;s more compression artifacts. Compression ratios vary. Just because its a higher quality image doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not compressed.</p>

<p>&quot;NO, THE WHOLE THING IS A PHOTOSHOP!! I CAN TELL BY THE PIXELS!!&quot;</p>

<p>You need to realize that you are the problem here. Either you&#39;re so dumb that you can&#39;t understand this basic concept, OR you&#39;re so adamant about being right that you refuse to actually think about what you&#39;re saying. Which one is it?</p>

<p>The content of the quotes is what you conveyed. No, they aren&#39;t direct quotes. But you did defend OP&#39;s &#39;rectangle&#39;, you did say the eyes looked fake, and you did then say the whole thing looked photoshopped. So tell me, where were you misquoted?  </p>

<p>Irrelevant. It&#39;s compressed. It doesn&#39;t matter what your opinions are. And just to laugh at your absurdity again, let&#39;s take a look at a google search of Donald Trump. Here are some images:</p>

<a href="https://www.donaldjtrump.com/">DonaldJTrump.com</a>
Massively compressed background photos with visible artifacts without even zooming in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Maybe you’re a PhD candidate writing a thesis on digital artifacts, and you have a deep understanding of things. But in reality, this level of degradation is not that common any longer.</p>

<p>Irrelevant and an unsubstantiated opinion that serves no purpose other than to distract.</p>

You can see similar sharp lines on the bottom right of his ear and on his left eye as well. </p>

<p>2) If that small rectangle truly is his nose why would we be seeing the inside, dark portion, of his right nostrils (The left side of the image) from the angle that he has his head turned?</p>

<p>3) There are way too many compression artifacts in that image for me to draw any reasonable conclusions from it</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I like threads like these, because they show that people here are able to logically refute ridiculous claims. Compression artifacts do look sketchy to those unfamiliar with them, and now those people know how to recognize such things in the future. Regardless if OP&#39;s intentions were trolling or genuine curiosity, this has been a learning experience for us all.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As time goes on and the vegas thing gets stranger and stranger, I am thinking that its a distraction from the Anwan scandal.  It ia huge and has almost zero scrutiny and coverage.  It may not have 58 people dead but the damage and the potential crack in the very thing our world is built on, an orchestrated by very high level people.  DWS anyone?  All the spotlights are on vegas and a hollywood abuser.</p>

<p>If the vegas and weinstein thing has captured your attention, that would be the point.  Consider the media is playing us.  Especially when the media has jumped on the bandwagon and is torpedoing one of the people they would normally protect.  </p>

<p>Consider this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a shill post. Look at the guys history and then look at all the shills in here feeding off of it. It&#39;s a bait post meant to forum slide. We as people need to start coming together and talking face to face. If anyone wants to be a citizen investigator, or at least wants to discover the truth. The only way is to meet face to face and interview. Until then, disinfo and misinfo will be posted on here dozens of times after a legit post to forum slide. Many of the current shills are pedo&#39;s that made there way here from some terrible pedophilia subs on reddit and voat of which the majority of users were doxxed by a hacker. </p>

<p>You&#39;ve already been shown that:<br/>
* OPs image was faked<br/>
* compression artifacts are all over<br/>
* the rectangle around the nose isn&#39;t actually part of the picture<br/>
* the second dark spot is actually a shadow</p>

<p>You come back and say, &quot;well if the nose was actually an artifact, then EXPLAIN HIS EYES!!!&quot;</p>

<p>Uhh, well, his eyes look totally normal. Aside from the compression artifacts that are still all over.</p>
