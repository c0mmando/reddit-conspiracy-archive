       The Food Pyramid.  Ever hear of it?  Of course you have.  It taught us that a diet consisting of mostly carbohydrates and low fat is healthy.  That we would live longer with less health problems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why did they do this?  Why did they flat out lie or at the least, push an agenda that they had no idea about?
      </p>
      <p>
       Money.  It's always money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Back in the early 1900's, farmers had huge sway in governments.  It was literally the "Bread and Butter" of political influence.  They paid off the USDA to push the "grains are healthy and too much fats are bad" narrative.    It seemed to work back then because there were hardly any processed food.
      </p>
      <p>
       And then the real bad guy "High Fructose Corn Syrup" was invented in 1957 and everything went to hell.  It was put in to virtually everything we consume and everyone started noticing that people's health was declining.  Sure we were living longer due to medical advances, but obesity was rising at an alarming pace and is now an epidemic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Research now shows that diets high in fat and low in carbs is the real healthy diet.  Literally the complete opposite of USDA guidelines.  But why are people still unaware of this?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a conspiracy.  The USDA was created by and for grain growers.  High Fructose Corn Syrup makes so much money in any given year that they are able to squash any kind of information getting out.  And yet, people believe that farm subsidies are still necessary.  All the while, Americans suffer from ever growing waist lines.
      </p>
      <p>
       P.S.  The small farmers are not responsible for this and I support subsides for them.  It's the mega-rich agricultural corporations who process these foods that are the ones in power now.  It is them we have to investigate.

       You can look up Ketosis or Keto diet and get tons and tons of research.  But the best interview I've ever seen on the topic is here

       fat sticks to and blocks the functuons of your arteries and organs.  The REAL answer is a plant based diet.  We arent omnivores like your led to believe.  its about huy bacteria and how they operate within the eco-system that is us.  Id tou eat meat, your cultivating the wrong types of gut bacteria which keads to inflammation of all kinds.  This in turn leads to disease due to your immune system being weakened.  Plant based diets are much healthier for you because they foster the best bacteria in our gut and there are so many nutrients in plants especially when combined.  Dairy is also bad because it is made with the hormonal juices from another species.  You cant drink it and expect to not have any side effect.  Yogurt has even been shown to increase the risk of death of breast cancer by 50%. There are many reasons you shouldnt eat meat and pushing the keto diet is just stupid because not inly are you hurting people your advocating the slaughter of.more animals to suit your dietary needs.  It should be a treat, if anything, to eat meat.  It shouldnt be the every meal staple it is now. We have no reason to kill animals, nutrition just doesnt depend on eating meat.

       Dude stfu this is bullshit. Humans have never been plant eaters. Literally the only reason we ever evolved to have our PFC which is what separates us from the apes, is BECAUSE we ate meat. But keep eating all those carbs and telling everyone how you are vegan.

       Bro look up your history. As posted before we cured my father's cancer without following your line of thinking. Minimal meat needs to be consumed to survive, but bottom line is you need to eat was grows around you. A African shouldn't have a diet high in Canadian beaver.

       I'm glad you cured your fathers cancer but it was likely because he cut out all processed foods rather than whether he was eating meat or eating plants. I eat both and I'm doing fine. I do agree that if you are from Africa you should probably be eating things native to Africa because it just makes sense BUT that's not really what we are talking about + I'm pretty sure cows and salmon as well as fruits and veggies are native enough to USA. I will look into that diet bc I always love learning new stuff

       thing is the fucker never stopped eating candy.. he just couldn't. That's what kept me stressed for 6 months and some how the results still came as 99% gone for the lungs, and lymph node having massive reduction as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is still eating candy to this day and I hate it. Also drinks a lot of juice which is high in sugar (not always natural sugar - see all peach juices out there that have 0% vitamin.

       tou can lol all you want but if you look at humans from an objective perspective youll notice we are much more suited for plant consumption.  not saying tou cant eat meat or that it causes anything but if you can get nutrition without having to murder animals then i think as himans, who claim to be superior, have an obligation to "lesser" creatures to appreciate thier life and not murder them.

       You won't find critical thinkers when it comes to nutrition most anywhere on reddit , the bacon cabal is too strong here and people's brains are not working at 100%, largely due to poor diet, no matter what people find out about how the meat industry is destroying the planet or the main cause of heart disease, the number one killer in america. That said the keto diet can be done using a plant based diet, hell, your body can go into ketosis after just three days of water fasting.

       Things didn't really get out of hand until after WW2 when corn production spiked hard though. Big agricultural interests where already corrupting things before the mid 40's, but it got really bad around then. That's about when arms manufacturers realized they could get into the corn business and when the diet heart hypothesis started to gain steam iirc.

       Possibly. A big part of the economics had to do with nitrogen based weapons plants realizing they could develop nitrogen fertilizer and corn is a particularly responsive crop to nitrogen fertilizers. The weapons plants literally shifted to making fertilizer for subsidized corn and the surplus of corn gave rise to hfcs and other junk food that undercut other foods on price. That's the out in the open version at least.

       Of course, once you get into the realm of insidious conspiracies to sicken the populace from the shadows you end up in all sorts of wild places, but even just the surface level stuff wrt food is pretty damning even without bringing in the more elaborate narratives featuring illuminati/nazi/whatever stuff.

       Took my body about a year of the KETO diet before it started failing. I wish you luck. We have over 100 years of keto research, the overall message is very clear if overreached properly. But thanks for linking this off brand web-md with with ads funded by: nutri-system! "AMERICANS FAVORITE DIET PLAN"! "Don't learn how nutrition works, we'll do it for you!"

       Keto is fought and discredited by nearly everyone in the food industry. Not to mention, a real keto diet consists of very moderate levels of protein. The belief that "you just eat all meat" is keto is completely inaccurate.

       Just laughably ignorant. A simple Duckduckgo search will provide you with a substantial amount of scientific studies showing the benefits of a ketogenic diet. And any "major study" cited by the MSM about why keto is unhealthy is based on shitty scientific practices and doesn't account for key variables that make all the difference (like allowing for subjects to let their bodies become keto-adapted before beginning a study). There's a really interesting book called Keto Clarity if you're interested on the good and bad science around ketogenic diets.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       While a plant based diet is certainly a better option than the modern food pyramid, claiming that it's "MUCH healthier in every regard" is untrue. There are a lot of key vitamins and amino acids that you get from animal proteins that can be EXTREMELY difficult to incorporate into an all plant based diet (while not impossible, many people who are vegetarian or vegan do not go the extra lengths required to truly have a well balanced diet).
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying that you are, but it sure sounds like you're buying into the vegan communities propaganda a little too hard. Just like that stupid "What the Health" movie on Netflix, straight up propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have just been listening to the vegan community tell you about ketogenic diets, I highly recommend that you do some research on your own.

       I researched it for a few months &amp; went Kito for a year, I had to take more supplements of a keto diet than I did a plant based one.. Sodium potassium and magnesium need to be integrated daily on a KETO diet and a little after hitting the year mark I was getting terrible muscle cramps, but being sold on the diet I ignored them until I went to the doctor and was told I had renal tubular acidosis, one of the common side effects of the diet... Keto fucked me up and it took about half a year before my body and gym gains got back on track because of it. I could never suggest it to ANYONE personally, which Is why spoke up.

       There is no "placebo", you either follow the diet correctly and take the proper precautions or you don't and you run into certain complications. Clearly, there was a lot more research needed on your end to maintain your body at its correct levels. There is no "one size fits all" approach with this diet and it takes dedication, knowledge, and maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the keto diet is definitely not about is being "sold" and then ignoring your body. You had the freedom to change your macros and take less of an extreme approach, you had the ability to experiment with supplementation and max carb intake levels, but instead of taking responsibility for the possibility that you weren't ready and properly maintaining your body and diet, you blame Keto.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, what you're sharing with us is that you didn't maintain your car correctly and you're shocked that it's not working properly.

       That's not at all what I'm saying, more so that I took my car to a dealership and the mechanic told me the fuel I was putting into my body was shit. I'm athletic and race every other weekend, I tried very very hard on a keto diet, obviously I tried many different options when I got crazy muscle cramps, I thought I had the muscle cramps fixed and the issues behind me but it was followed by tubular acidosis, and was told by both a doctor and nutritionist that the diet was the root cause of my issue. Only sport I've ever hear the word mentioned is with boxers trying to qualify for lower weight classes and stuff like that. I'm simply leaving my personal experiences in the comments like everyone else who's tried the diet. Don't know what your going on about.

       All good thanks for the reply. For a year I didn't supplement everything was fine. Followed the diet by the book. Felt good until right around the year mark, started getting really bad muscle cramps, started researching if the diet could be the issue. Found that it was a common issues, learned about the daily supplements everyone SHOULD be taking on the diet, thought that was the issue. Kept ignoring the cramps started taking supplements, after a few months of no change, developed more issues and the nutritionist very quickly told me my diet was likely the key cause for the tubular acidosis, as it is a common side effect. Switch up the diet within a week or two the muscle cramps went away. I certainly tried everything I could on the diet, &amp; enjoyed it for about a year before things went south. Happy to hear if its working for others, I just can't with an honest heart personally recommend it.

       Law of thermodynamics is not applicable to humans because calories are treated differently based on macronutrient source. Calories in/out is a false paradigm for people because it assumes a vacuum system that treats energy equally.

       I can't believe people upvote this kind of shit. Sorry but there are multiple studies confirming macro nutrient source is irrelevant to weight gain/loss and caloric intake determines this. Find me a legitimate study supporting this and I'll read it and analyze it to it's full extent. Mind blown people still haven't realized CICO is everything. In terms of health that's another concern.

       From this study "Consuming a low-carbohydrate (approximately &lt;47% energy) diet is associated with greater likelihood of being overweight or obese among healthy, free-living adults. Lowest risk may be obtained by consuming 47% to 64% energy from carbohydrates."

       For anecdotal research I have done a few studies on myself. A McDonalds/fast diet for a month, (I lost 6.5lbs, was in a 500-700 caloric deficit daily)
      </p>
      <p>
       I did a high sugar diet for a month consisting of around 80% carbs mostly coming from candy and fruit with very little fat and rest protein. (I lost 8lbs that month but was also heavier when I did this one).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now I'm bulking on a 300 caloric surplus gaining 3lbs a month with moderate carbs, high fat (115g), and moderate protein.

       I get it. Calories in/calories out sounds like it makes sense, because it's intuitive, it's simple. Guess what? The human metabolism is
       <strong>
        far from simple
       </strong>
       . Look up the metabolism of fructose vs glucose. Both carbohydrates by definition, yet with wildly different results in metabolism. See how something seemingly intuitive gets all wrong?
      </p>
      <p>
       You want to find studies disproving CICO? Here's an easy to understand NYTimes (oh no!) article reporting on a Harvard study I can't get to at the moment:
       <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/health/19brody.html">
        http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/health/19brody.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Seeing as you'll likely ignore the chemical jargon of any published work (or even Wikipedia for that matter), I'll link you to a lecture by a professor of endocrinology at UCSF detailing how vastly different carbohydrates are metabolized in the human body and their effects. If you can watch and understand it, and yet
       <strong>
        still
       </strong>
       believe that the type of macronutrient doesn't matter, you're lost.

These are your beliefs, you have no studies of substance to produce, to prove what you're saying.

       An hour+ long lecture by a professor that did a fucking study on metabolism? Oh it's on YouTube it's irrelevant? An article that SOURCES the study simply because I didn't want to waste more of my time?

       You're posting shit that doesn't even explain what you're trying to say to begin with. I have posted studies contradicting exactly what you said and you post studies unrelated to what you're saying. A calorie is a calorie in terms of weight gain and loss.

       Here's the study you ordered (which is completely gone over by the author of it in that YouTube video you refuse to watch):

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Concerns surrounding the role of sugar consumption in chronic disease have previously focused on its caloric equivalence and its role in fomenting increases in weight. Furthermore, previous clinical studies have relied upon excessive sugar administration, which introduces experimental artifact. This study mitigates all three of these concerns by intervening in children who are already sick with metabolic syndrome and by adjusting for effects of calories, weight gain, and adiposity.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can see you now, "lol yeah sugar is bad." Sugars are calories. "But that's talking about health not weight loss." Weight gain and loss is related to health. You vehemently argue this gross oversimplification when it's not only false, but dangerous misinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I'm done with you. You can shout your dogma as much as you want. I've posed relevant challenges to your ideology. I've asked that you ask relevant questions about the way you think. I've done my best to help you and everyone reading to understand that biology is not as simple as we would prefer. Have a good day man.

       That fat you inject not only becomes energy (ketone bodies) but hormones, cells, the cell walls (hell even cholesterol strengthens membranes), neurotransmitters, etc.  Carbs turn purely into an energy source. If you're just think about it in a sterile way like a car engine, it doesn't transfer sensibly into a human.

       Right. Let’s get some real world evidence then from YOU. What’s you’re current weight, body fat, and strength numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
       I already said that yes keto works. There’s also an EXTREMELY small amount of ATHLETES who use keto in any effective manner. An large example being PALEO falling to the wayside in the crossfit community, which is generally a very low carb diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       You’ve provided little to no evidence that it’s a fucking conspiracy. The only thing that’s been shown is the dairy industry being pushed by gov since it’s subsidized.

       the body converts multiple things into energy including protein, fats, and carbs. After your body takes protein (involved in making ATP) to use for energy, it will hit your carb and fat storage. Your body needs a minimum amount of long term energy storage (fat) or it can really fuck with your endocrine system.

       None of these "sources" point out why carbs are bad. The first study promotes ketones which more likely summarizes preference as I have pointed out already. Never did I state carbs are essential to the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second isn't even a study, not to mention its core point is about added sugars. Are you serious? Yea lets throw in a bunch of links unrelated to what we're saying to fuel our bullshit arguments. I mean that's what you did here. Theres a big difference between getting your carbohydrate sources from soda rather than a potato.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its like you just Googled carbs are bad and grabbed whatever you could off the first page. Because none of your links contradict what I've said in this thread. So no, it seems you have no fucking idea what you're talking about. Stop being lazy and grab some studies that actually counter what I say instead of throwing in "added sugars" and "ketosis" to support you abysmal argument. Keto is NOT superior to a moderate carb or carb filled diet. Keto is a preference to lifestyle, like vegetarian, or intermittent fasting.

        None of these "sources" point out why carbs are bad. The first study promotes ketones which more likely summarizes preference as I have pointed out already. Never did I state carbs are essential to the human body.

        Second isn't even a study, not to mention its core point is about added sugars. Are you serious? Yea lets throw in a bunch of links unrelated to what we're saying to fuel our bullshit arguments. I mean that's what you did here. Theres a big difference between getting your carbohydrate sources from soda rather than a potato.

       This.. actually makes me think you were in a discussion with someone else about a different aspect of sugar-carb. I'm arguing against sugar, not carbs.

        the carb scare is retarded and has no scientific basis.

      <p>
       And the fact that solid science exists and has shown that the overabundance of the simple sugars in carbs have negative effects on health.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even in someone doing high intensity cardio, lifting, and eating at a caloric deficit, simple sugars are a negative when compared to the alternative fuel, fat.

       Ok in that case my bad. I actually cant really tell on my phone currently. The fact is when studies usually conclude something its usually from the a sense of something else. For instance, high sugar diets are no good for obvious reasons. But at the same time, lack of fiber plays huge role when combined with sugars. Usually people main health problems are a lack of fiber, water, sufficient protein and healthy fats. After experimenting for years, I found a balanced diet with more health conscious foods that take up about 70-80% of the entire diet was best. Lifes to short not to be able to fit in even sugary foods such as cookies or icecream. Theres a middle ground for everyone depending on their life style.

       Keto is the only things that gets my blood sugar down and keeps it stable. Also eliminated 99% of the aches, pains and chronic joint inflammation I'd had for years. And I experience the happy feelings of wellbeing, and 100% improved emotional control.

       I've been at it about a year, and I don't think I'll ever go back.

       I did an 80% vegan plant based diet for over a year with daily juicing (mostly dark greens) and it exacerbated my prediabetes and physical pain. Dr was trying to prescribe medication.
      </p>
      <p>
       One month on keto (which I protested heavily before I tried it myself because I LOVED CARBS and could not imagine a life without them) and I felt so good I literally could never eat a carb again. Mentally and physically, wonderful. I had very healthy blood test results after 6 months, I lost over 20 lbs and looked good, when I was never overweight to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I haven't had a flu or cold in a year whereas I usually have one every few months and I shaved 1:30 off my mile. I quit recreational drinking after about 6 months also because I just feel so good every day that ingesting something that makes me feel bad just seems stupid.
      </p>
      <p>
       All while feeling mentally clear and stable in mood.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a study came out that said I would most definitely die 10 years earlier from keto, but I get to feel this good and energetic and pain free every day I think I'd go with the keto.

       Interesting situation. Myself, I'm a powerlifter and a major part of my diet is carbohydrates. Roughly 2000 of my 3500 calories comes from carbohydrates. I always feel energized and strong when full of carbs. Low carb diets make me feel slow, tired, and brain foggy. While high fat diets work for some it isn't for everyone!

       How long did you give yourself to adapt? It takes a week, possibly two, to fully transition. People call this period the "keto flu". Low electrolytes can also be a culprit depending on your diet: if I supplement potassium I don't get this "flu" period at all.

       I did it fit about a week and stopped because my strength dropped dramatically and felt very light headed and sluggish. I tried to offset the absence of carbs with more protein and fat but it was difficult because I don't care for meat. So I wasn't consuming the usual amount of calories plus I want eating the quantity of carbs I was used to so that was probably why I felt so bad.

       Do you have any sources for this? I've seen sources for the claim OP made about the food pyramid, but I've not come across anything regarding keto being pushed by the meat industry and I'd love to get informed if you have any links to share.

       I hope I'm not coming off as condescending because that's my intent. What I'm wondering is, so in my situation, I'm an active powerlifter who consumes 400+ grams of carbs a day to gain weight and strength and staying at a caloric surplus. How would a keto diet be effective for an athlete? Glucose is the most efficient method of using energy in the body especially when it comes to athletics.

       Keto and its entire movement is industrial funded by animal agriculture, no nutritional science behind it. If your looking for an alternative food pyramid, a plant based diet is MUCH healthier in every regard.

       You don't need to

       carbs to create glucose. Your body can create glycogen(5 glucose molecules) from other carbon substrates using a process called gluconeogenesis.

       Vegan is ideal as well. It's not meat vs veggies, that's a moral argument, but as far as health, a diet with meat and veggies or a diet with veggies and beans etc is just as healthy for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with meat diets in the US is you are ingesting shitloads of hormones, steroids and antibiotics. It's unrealistic that most people currently are close to local free range farms or can shoot their own deer meat, but the meat in the grocery store is poison.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will put on muscle, you will feel a million times better than a high carb diet, but you are still fucking with your hormones and cells.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you switched to game meat only from a grocery store paleo diet you will feel superhuman. A chicken breast shouldn't be the size of your head, that's filled with nasty stuff.

       I don't get how vegan is ideal. Just because I can"t imagine how removing eggs or cheeses amounts to anything of a plus. Whh not expand the options and still eat a primarily (but not strictly) vegetarian diet at that point?

       Had a meeting with an endocrinologists and he told me it was junk science, that the food plate is real science. It was such a contentious few minutes than I just gave in.
      </p>
      <p>
       I went to see him after finding out my testosterone levels are very low, well below even the "low" threshold number and I'm not even 30. I told him I've had such low energy and fatigue for years now and it's ruined so many things in my life. He acted as if it's not an issue. He said I most likely have sleep apnea instead (I don't even snore) and to focus on a Mediterranean diet. He tried to cell me on purely CICO. What the fuck.   I've been reading papers, anything I could get on my hands on about ketosis and none of this "fat is bad" narrative makes any sense to me at this point.  I don't know what to do about the low T now.

       I mean this is cute and all, I get you’ve been recently redpilled and I’m guessing you’ve been trying to lose weight, but it’s certainly not the ONLY way to eat. You can eat high carb perfectly fine if your performance calls for it.

       It's definitely good info, but...  He is emphasizing exercise
       <em>
        and
       </em>
       diet.  Just saying keto without a good exercise routine is potentially harmful.   And, not all bodies metabolize in the same way.  So, my point is:  look for solutions but don't isolate in one approach as the
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       while ignoring the complexities, as human bodies are very complex,  and human populations even more complex.

       If you continue to work out and are on Keto. Make sure you eat a high fat before you work out. Also, if you get headaches it can be due to a lack of magnesium.  So,  take a supplement of magnesium and enough water.

       “Morning, Bullet proof coffee or tea” is a staple of this diet. People pay boatloads to buy it. However, you can make it yourself.

       Coffee or tea
1 tablespoon of coconut oil, slap of butter, heavy heavy whipping cream
Blend or mix

       Then why are you making fun of the OP and not attacking the corn lobby/sugar lobby that currently IS subsidized? Why are you not attacking the laws that allow corporations to write off income and subsidize people's hobbies (professional sports)?  Libertarians in the US are pretty strange. They don't seem to understand the way the power structure works and often attack the wrong targets. Though it is easier to make fun of people than actually enact change against the entrenched corporate interests that are currently subsidized by our system.

       Pretty much. People see an initial benefit with a keto diet because they can't consume as many of the highly processed foods on the market, however the real killer is animal protein (at least in the amounts that we are currently consuming it). WHO even published findings about this, but the general public still doubts.

       Can you share diet recommendations? Specifically what you think is best for macros and what type(s) of foods would be best for someone who wants to maintain weight or gain weight like bodybuilders.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not fond of keto/paleo or any specific diet. I just try to research objectively and find whatever foods offer the best health benefits. But as you know, this is a big rabbit hole and there's so much information out there it's tough to draw conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can both agree plants and greens are a huge necessity for good heath. But you can't lift weights &amp; try to consume 3500 calories/day just eating broccoli and kale and green beans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Starting from the premise that we need to eat A LOT more greens... what other foods do you think should be consumed to create the "best" health-focused diet?

       So are fruit sugars bad for you too? Seriously, what kind of keto circle jerk did I just walk into? There is no healthier diet for people AND than planet than a plant-based diet. Do you guys think meat grows like plants? We don't have the resources to feed the world meat, much less meat that requires land, water and destroys our atmosphere with its methane gasses. For a group of people who have sooo many theories about conspiracies with little evidence its really sad to see that there is tons of evidence on the proper diet, yet many go complete cognitive dissonance. Meat is not sustainable. It doesn't matter if you think its healthy or not or if your friends buddy went keto and his cancer went away, its not sustainable for the planet.

       I don't think the point here is to eat only meat, but to avoid processed sugars and eat more fat.

       You can still do this by eating fruits and vegetables.

       Yeah I agree, I think meat is a bad thing to eat and I used to eat it, but it destroys the environment, the animals are treated so appallingly you're basically eating sadness when you eat meat, and things like berries and nuts and avocados and eggs (from your own happy chickens) are hopefully ok to live off. Berries particularly are good. I felt so amazing when I ate lots of berries for a week. Apparently it's something called polyphenols in them.

       Keto and its entire movement is industrial funded by animal agriculture, no nutritional science behind it. If your looking for an alternative food pyramid, a plant based diet is MUCH healthier in every regard.

       Like seriously, the keto circle is so god damn ill informed and annoying. Like if they realized carbs aren't bad and they just prefer keto that would be completely fine. But spouting bullshit left and right like it's the only way to be healthy is where they lose whatever argument they had. A nutritional balance destroys keto and any diet. What's funny is they usually don't have any studies to support what they're saying. I've read the studies. Keto should be strictly preference.

       Cow farts don't destroy the earth, mans excessive exploitation of the planet destroys the earth, and animal agriculture is apart of that. And government subsidies are apart of that. Thats where the conspiracy comes in, but no one wants to talk about things that would raise the price of their steak and bacon, lets talk about sex scandals instead.

       Glad to see some sense in this thread, all the keto-loving up top was scary. We're in the conspiracy subreddit and yet one of the biggest conspiracies of them all is in regards to the meat industry, and how bad it is for the people and the planet. Noone wants to know if it affects what they eat. I'd really recommend documentaries like Cowspiracy if anyone is interested.

       There is NOTHING good about fructose. It should be considered an anti-nutrient.  Fructose is ONLY metabolized by the liver and is highly linked to fatty liver, visceral fat and metabolic syndrome. Yeah, that's "fruit sugars".

       Do you use grocery store coupons? There are HUGE discounts on dairy lately and across all brands (especially cheese but milk/yogurt/coffee creamer too).  Combined with store sales you can find cheese for like a dollar a pound ... they're definitely trying to get us to buy more dairy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another interesting thing is the WIC nutritional program is almost entirely dairy/grain based. A few years back, when I was hit with no job plus two kids and I think we qualified for 8 gallons of milk a month .... plus just so much cereal. In contrast, we got about 7 dollars a month of produce for the three of us...

       That part is incorrect. (And I notice no cite.) Raw, high
       <em>
        simple
       </em>
       carbs, low fat is the ideal diet -- put simply, raw fruit and dark leafy greens, as that's what the pre-tool, tropical human body was designed for and thrived on for millions of years before the invention of fire. Although I'd say some
       <em>
        minor
       </em>
       adjustment is necessary, depending on heredity, as we've been pretty far from the ideal diet for thousands of years now.

       Also probably important to mention that animal products and the food pyramid greatly increase risk of cancer, heart disease, diabetes -- i.e., money for the medical industry and control for politics.

       No. Not how it works.  The enemy is insulin.  When you eat carbs, the insulin levels spike and research shows that fat storage can only function when insulin is present.  Without glucose as a source for energy, the body will produce Ketones that uses fat directly as a source for energy.  In short, it's eating the bread WITH butter that is very bad for you.

       butter on the bread  slows the absorption of carbs , which can lead to a lower insulin spike , which leads to lower inflammation, which is better for your body, less insulin resistance. from what i recall.

       This would be accurate if carbs weren't turned to sugar and then digested as such, prompting an insulin response.
      </p>
      <p>
       The real concern is how your liver turns carbs into sugar, and then into cholesterol

       missing a vital component. the lobbying of the government by the ag companies to subsidize farming. then those companies bought up all the small and medium farms. then if those companies  have a bad crop, you get paid from subsidized farming.. have a good crop that year ? you get paid from selling your crop. . who doesn’t want a win win situation with money.

       well when you have all this exceeds corn sugar, what do you don with it? 
perhaps we could extract oil out of it.?  Japanese
 researchers extracted oil out of corn, them that is pit in everything.

       also what is corn fortified with vitamins ? cow feed? what is corn fortified with vitamins and feed to children? formula. 
it’s sick.

       Great question.  It is because the crop industry vastly outperforms livestock industry in the US.  Remember, corn is not only used as a grain/vegetable, but also to make Ethanol and, the king of all cash product, high fructose corn syrup.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is only half the story.  Remember, the enemy, as reinforced over and over again by the govt, is fat.  But notice how they don't attack protein?  Because meat is mostly protein and a bit of fat.  Simply trim the fat and use it elsewhere, and nothing goes to waste.  Overall, the benefit of pushing sugars as good and fats as bad is much more profitable than the other way around.

       I don't think the point here is to eat only meat, but to avoid processed sugars and eat more fat.

       You can still do this by eating fruits and vegetables.

       Yeah I agree, I think meat is a bad thing to eat and I used to eat it, but it destroys the environment, the animals are treated so appallingly you're basically eating sadness when you eat meat, and things like berries and nuts and avocados and eggs (from your own happy chickens) are hopefully ok to live off. Berries particularly are good. I felt so amazing when I ate lots of berries for a week. Apparently it's something called polyphenols in them.

       Like seriously, the keto circle is so god damn ill informed and annoying. Like if they realized carbs aren't bad and they just prefer keto that would be completely fine. But spouting bullshit left and right like it's the only way to be healthy is where they lose whatever argument they had. A nutritional balance destroys keto and any diet. What's funny is they usually don't have any studies to support what they're saying. I've read the studies. Keto should be strictly preference.

       Keto and its entire movement is industrial funded by animal agriculture, no nutritional science behind it. If your looking for an alternative food pyramid, a plant based diet is MUCH healthier in every regard. &amp; like you mentioned also amazing for the earths well being.

       As every decade passes some new group of idiots will have a new boogeyman to blame for health problems still ignoring the fact that balance is everything. If your diet is 80% sugar based of course you're gonna be unhealthy, you're lacking sufficient macro/micro nutrients.

       Do you have any sources for this? I've seen sources for the claim OP made about the food pyramid, but I've not come across anything regarding keto being pushed by the meat industry and I'd love to get informed if you have any links to share.

       From this study "Consuming a low-carbohydrate (approximately &lt;47% energy) diet is associated with greater likelihood of being overweight or obese among healthy, free-living adults. Lowest risk may be obtained by consuming 47% to 64% energy from carbohydrates."

       For anecdotal research I have done a few studies on myself. A McDonalds/fast diet for a month, (I lost 6.5lbs, was in a 500-700 caloric deficit daily)
      </p>
      <p>
       I did a high sugar diet for a month consisting of around 80% carbs mostly coming from candy and fruit with very little fat and rest protein. (I lost 8lbs that month but was also heavier when I did this one).
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now I'm bulking on a 300 caloric surplus gaining 3lbs a month with moderate carbs, high fat (115g), and moderate protein.

       And uses nytimes and youtube as his sources of studies. Seriously, do you lack proof? Or do you just enjoy using other people to make yourself seem intelligent. Peddling my "BELIEFS"? These are your beliefs, you have no studies of substance to produce, to prove what you're saying. The fact that you even use other people to support your argument only proves how little you know to begin with.

       I hope I'm not coming off as condescending because that's my intent. What I'm wondering is, so in my situation, I'm an active powerlifter who consumes 400+ grams of carbs a day to gain weight and strength and staying at a caloric surplus. How would a keto diet be effective for an athlete? Glucose is the most efficient method of using energy in the body especially when it comes to athletics.

       Glad to see some sense in this thread, all the keto-loving up top was scary. We're in the conspiracy subreddit and yet one of the biggest conspiracies of them all is in regards to the meat industry, and how bad it is for the people and the planet. Noone wants to know if it affects what they eat. I'd really recommend documentaries like Cowspiracy if anyone is interested.

        None of these "sources" point out why carbs are bad. The first study promotes ketones which more likely summarizes preference as I have pointed out already. Never did I state carbs are essential to the human body.

        Second isn't even a study, not to mention its core point is about added sugars. Are you serious?

       And the fact that solid science exists and has shown that the overabundance of the simple sugars in carbs have negative effects on health.

      <p>
       Even in someone doing high intensity cardio, lifting, and eating at a caloric deficit, simple sugars are a negative when compared to the alternative fuel, fat.

       There is NOTHING good about fructose. It should be considered an anti-nutrient.  Fructose is ONLY metabolized by the liver and is highly linked to fatty liver, visceral fat and metabolic syndrome. Yeah, that's "fruit sugars".
