       I started off trying to identify each officer and their voice but it was too tough to transcribe this as well as identify voices.  I have timestamps throughout.  I sort of failed for the first minute or so but then I got the Hang of it.  Other people can help me out with this project. I worked on this for over 5 hours to get this far.  I thought it would be a quick project, turns out it wasn’t.  Thanks.
