       Kymberley is full of shit.
       <a href="http://rense.com/general96/unhurtdies.html">
        Her story
       </a>
       about what happened defies belief. This is her description of her and her friend escaping the venue via a fence that had been knocked down:
      </p>
      <p>
       “But the gunfire wasn’t stopping this whole time. It wasn’t ceasing. It wasn’t slowing down. And It was directly behind us, following us. Bullets were coming from every direction. Behind us, in front of us, to the side of us. But I know, I just know, that there was someone chasing us. The entire time I felt this way. The farther we got from the venue, the closer the gunfire got. I kept looking back expecting to see the gunmen- and I say MEN because there was more than one person. There was more than one gun firing. 100% more than one.
      </p>
      <p>
       “As we were running, we kept changing direction, because it felt like no matter what direction we took, we were being followed. So we ended up running in a weird triangular path. The first place I remember getting to was a parking lot, and I told Casie (who was slightly in front of me) we needed to get under one of the trucks. She turned to me and started her way back to me, and that is when the gunfire got even CLOSER than ever before. It was RIGHT THERE. It was within the parking lot. Everyone around us was panicking once again. So we ditched the idea of getting underneath a vehicle, and we continued the run for our lives. If you know me, you know I am a big girl, who is out of shape, and who definitely does not run for any reason. But I can tell you I ran like I have never run before.”
      </p>
      <p>
       If the gunfire was coming from in front of them, why were they running towards it? If she said the gunmen were RIGHT THERE, then why wasn’t she able to see them? And weirdest of all, if they were running like hell, surrounded by gunmen on all sides, would she really take out her phone to call her husband and grandmother while still running (that was in a part of her description.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, she says they ran towards Hooters casino but people were running out of that casino and so they assumed there were shooters in there, too.
       <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/10/02/555170283/hooters-casino-dealer-describes-scene-near-las-vegas-shooting">
        But here is a story
       </a>
       from blackjack dealer about her experience at the Hooters casino. Her account of hundreds of concert goers taking refuge at the casino completely contradicts Kymberley’s story, where people were running out of Hooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kymberley continues her story: “at some point, we ended up at the airport &amp; even entered the building for safety. Everyone as we entered were screaming at the staff “IS IT SAFE IN HERE?” but we weren’t getting anyone to answer us, so after running about 30 feet into the building, not getting the answers we so desperately needed, we decided it, too, wasn’t a safe spot, so we got out of there quickly and continued running.”
      </p>
      <p>
       This is completely absurd, not just because it doesn’t make any sense, but because to enter the airport they would have had to go all the way around the runways and then down towards the terminal. This is not a situation where they would just “end up” at the airport. They would have had to go a mile East along Tropicana, totally exposed, then another mile South on Paradise to get to the terminal. So after running for two miles to the airport, they just decided to turn around and run a mile back the way they came because nobody was answering their questions?
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, it doesn’t make any sense to run to the airport. The most obvious thing to do would be to seek shelter at the nearest spot, which in this case would be the MGM grand that is right across from Hooters, or the hotel 6 nearby on the way to the airport, or one of the many gas stations and convenience stores and other places along the way. Just go on google maps street view in front of Hooters and trace their alleged route. It defies belief. I don't care how panicked and irrational you are. This is simply a non-starter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then she says they continued running. They crossed an intersection to get a limo driver to help them, then a cab driver who wouldn’t allow all five of them in. But wait a second, they were just at the airport. Why didn’t they get a couple of taxis at the airport? It’s Vegas for crying out loud — there’s a line of taxis a mile long waiting at the airport.
      </p>
      <p>
       She says they then ran passed (sic) a liquor store where the workers gave her group some water. Well why didn’t they just stay in the liquor store with the friendly, helpful workers? But no, they were on a mission I guess. Which included passing by UNLV. And then, “I don’t remember at which time, but at some point, Ricky was reminded by Cassie that his Uncle Manny lived in Vegas. He called him, and we made a plan to meet him at a grocery store a couple miles away to get picked up.” Why couldn’t uncle Manny just come pick them up where they were? They had already run a good 3 and a half miles by this point, at least. She says they were exhausted and vomiting. She admits she was a heavy woman who was totally out of shape. Why choose to run another couple of miles? They felt it would be safer to run down the street for two miles than seek shelter inside a store or building waiting for their ride?
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, one more absurdity stands out. If you read her post, you see that she was totally in shock after the incident. Just a complete mess. But according to this newspaper report, her “final Facebook photos are a pair of cowboy boots with an American flag and her new Harvest 91 Festival tattoo that includes the date of the shooting and the text ‘Country Strong.'” Really? Apparently, that was her way of coping. I don't buy it. Too soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice that the evolving narrative around Kymberley is that she is dead, either from a seizure perhaps induced by post-traumatic stress or killed in a plot to bury her story of multiple shooters. Both narratives want to sell you the idea that she is dead and that the shootings were real, either from Paddock or from multiple shooters. But the truth, as usual, is that Kymberley is basically just another crisis actor designed to confuse the narrative and bury this massive hoax in a thick layer of fog and uncertainty. In other words, Standard Operating Procedure. She's a special type of crisis actor since her death was faked. I wonder what she got out of the deal. If she really had terminal cancer, maybe she was willing to trade faking her death for financial security for her husband and daughter. I guess we'll never know...

       There were many characters in on this hoax including the crazy woman who warned people they were all going to die as well as the young girl who gave the interview about the crazy woman.  If you watch her interview you can see she cannot hold back her duping delight.

       that the Paddock we are seeing on TV isn't even the guy they say he is. So why would I waste my time on some fraud "channeling" some guy that never existed? The thing that is really ultra-bizarre is that you somehow think those videos have anything at all to do with this post. Unless of course you're trying to drown my signal with your noise.

       Hey, it only took you 15 years to realize 9/11 was an inside job, congrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In January 2016, I clicked on a link to the documentary, September 11 – The New Pearl Harbor in the list of ‘related videos’ list on YouTube. The scales fell from my eyes. It all seemed so obvious. It wasn’t as if the perpetrators had done a good job of hiding the fact that it was “an inside job.” I felt that even a cursory examination of the evidence would be enough to show that we were lied to. So the only way I could have gone nearly 15 years without realizing it was simply by ignoring it or telling myself “it couldn’t be.”"

       On the other hand, I wrote a term paper in high school on how FDR provoked then allowed Pearl Harbor to happen, so in some ways I was slightly ahead of the curve.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here, allow me to finish
       <a href="https://cuttingthroughthefog.com/about/">
        the quotation:
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I decided that I would never again allow myself to ignore or reject any theory on the basis of plausibility. I swore to myself that I would pursue the evidence for any idea or any theory, no matter how absurd it seemed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was thrust into a couple of months of intense reading up on many different conspiracy theories, trying to sort fact from fiction. I’m still at it. And although I don’t intend to retrace these discoveries in great depth, as time goes on I hope to fill out parts of the blog with links on relevant subjects.
       </p>
       <p>
        I’ve come to the conclusion, mainly thanks to others’ research, that much of what we see on TV or read in the newspapers is fake and phony. We’re being manipulated and duped on a grand, almost unimaginable scale. Our thoughts and passions are being molded and orchestrated. It’s sort of like in the Matrix movies, except that instead of a computer simulation, our Matrix has been created by a group of living, breathing human beings using mass media as their primary tool. Waking up to this realization was psychologically difficult at first. A bona fide ontological rupture. But I would not trade my newfound perspective for anything. I’m wide awake inside the Matrix, and I’m not going back to sleep.
       </p>
       <p>
        So much of the world we think we live in is a sham, a conjob. But it’s not just mainstream or “consensus” reality: many if not most of the conspiracies we read about are either fake or filled with false leads and misdirection. Puncturing through consensus reality does not lead directly to the truth. Waiting for us on the other side of that membrane is a dizzying and disorienting fog of disinformation and misdirection. The mainstream lies are themselves wrapped inside of lies, inside of lies, inside of lies, inside of lies…
       </p>
       <p>
        The Powers That Be do not want anyone to discover the truth about how this world works, and so they cover everything in a thick, suffocating layer of fog so it is nearly impossible for us to find our way to the truth. Will we ever reach the truth? I don’t know. All I know is that we can try to cut through the fog, a little bit at a time.

       Really? That's funny: I just tried finding footage and the first thing that came up on Youtube was this video:

        Las Vegas shooting everybody locked in @HOOTERS!

       Let's see: we've got one eye witness and one video from Hooters showing people taking shelter inside and no shooters.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have one video from outside Hooters (apparently), with some guy standing by a door (for some reason) telling people to come inside, then someone says there is a shooter inside, and they all run. But note that there are also no gunshots to be heard at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are they both true? I concede it's possible. Hard to determine the time lines here, but you could argue that Kimberley et al. showed up at Hooters as people were running.
      </p>
      <p>
       But note also that many of the people at the beginning of the video don't look like they're running for their lives. They are walking away from the concert area, to be sure, but they hardly look panicked. Or at least most of them don't. This is not consistent with Kimberley's 'shooters everywhere' narrative. Also note that the cameraman runs across the parking lot into a covered parking garage, which makes sense. He did run two miles to the airport terminal, then turn around and run another mile back the way he came.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my opinion the planting of this kind of contradictory evidence is deliberately done to confuse us and make it more difficult to discern what happened -- and what didn't happen. All the reports of shooters at various casinos are part of this attempt to confuse.

       Not disagreeing with anything you said, just showing that there was in fact some video evidence of people claiming there were shots being fired inside Hooters, and people running from Hooters.

       If you want to go down an even deeper rabbit hole, here is something else I did not include in my post, (but did write in a comment on my blog.](
       <a href="https://cuttingthroughthefog.com/2017/10/09/notes-on-the-route-91-shooting-on-101/#comment-135">

       ) Read the comment, then check out the paper I link to on the Dreyfus affair:
      </p>
      <p>
       The first thing I did was check Intellius to see if she existed. She does appear, and the details match the published account. She struck me at first like a normal person leading a humdrum life. She works in SoCal as an ‘inventory specialist’ for Aero-Zone, a privately owned company that supplies parts to the aero-space industry. I went to their website, clicked on their ‘about’ page, and what do I see but an open letter from the company’s founder and president, Alfredo Dreyfus. When I saw that, I shouted out loud “You’ve got to be kidding me!” If you don't know why I reacted that way,
       <a href="http://mileswmathis.com/dreyfus.pdf">
        check out my research on the manufactured scandal in 19th Century France surrounding Alfred Dreyfus.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Alfredo’s back story is unknown. His LinkedIn profile does not include any education history. It just says he founded aero-zone in 1994 and that’s it. The company’s website says that “Aero-Zone was founded in 1994 by a small team of dedicated industry professionals with a small office in Chandler, Arizona (a suburb of Phoenix)….By making sound business decisions, and resisting the urge to rely on excessive financing, Aero-Zone has grown at a trend-setting pace. In January of 1998, as a result of our growth, Aero-Zone moved from our first office and warehouse to a 6,000 square foot facility nearby. We again saw several years of tremendous growth, despite significant adversity in the industry. In March of 2004, Aero-Zone moved into a 30,000 square foot Headquarters and Inventory Control Center…”
      </p>
      <p>
       How were they able to avoid relying on financing and grew during despite industry downturns? No chance they relied on nepotism and connections, right? What kinds of connections? Well, just look at the Wikipedia page for the LouisDreyfus company. It has historically been an agribusiness company, but it also is involved in finance, oil, weapons, etc. You can bet old Alfredo has called in a few favors over the years. Now I suppose they asked for something in return.

       Sounds lol me your typical super annoying fat girl who wants attention. Thinks she’s cool cause she was there. Has to make up super dramatic story to let everyone know she was there. Wants everyone to ask her if she’s ok, etc... all past tense since she’s dead but whatever.

       Hey, it only took you 15 years to realize 9/11 was an inside job, congrats.
      </p>
      <p>
       "In January 2016, I clicked on a link to the documentary, September 11 – The New Pearl Harbor in the list of ‘related videos’ list on YouTube. The scales fell from my eyes. It all seemed so obvious. It wasn’t as if the perpetrators had done a good job of hiding the fact that it was “an inside job.” I felt that even a cursory examination of the evidence would be enough to show that we were lied to. So the only way I could have gone nearly 15 years without realizing it was simply by ignoring it or telling myself “it couldn’t be.”"
