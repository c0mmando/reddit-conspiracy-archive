    <div class="md"><p>Quality compilation. That fake moulage leg is all anyone needs to see.</p>

<p>Look at it. it&#39;s not real. Look again, look really closely. It&#39;s obviously fake horror movie gore. Say it out loud: they used fake gore at the Boston Bombing. This leg photo was taken at the event, right after the explosions. It wouldn&#39;t even be there unless foreknowledge was involved.</p>

<p>If they used fake gore once, on this one leg, and they quite obviously did just that, then they used it on everyone at the scene. Nobody died, nobody was seriously injured. It was a stage-managed event.</p>

<p>The news went along with the big show. They are all in on it too.</p>

<p>If the organisers and the news channels were prepared to do it once, then they have done it every time. There&#39;s no reason to think otherwise at this point. All those traumatic events you recall seeing on the news are likely all faked as well.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right. It&#39;s all fake, it&#39;s all a big joke. None of these events are real. Instead of doubters demanding proof of fakery, why not demand proof of the claimed events instead? Just a thought...</p>

I have sent him videos of bullets hitting the ground, yet he still claims thereafter that they didn&#39;t happen. He&#39;ll claim the blood was too bright. &quot;When you see blood outside the body it is usually a dark red. This blood is from the veins. Sometimes you may cut an artery. This blood is bright red.&quot; He&#39;ll claim the people were saying it was fake.. you mean drunk people denying a crisis as it happens because they truthfully have no fucking clue what was going on? Has any witness claimed afterwards it was fake? He&#39;ll claim the gunshots were played over speakers.. that&#39;s just sad. 15 years in pro audio and if those gunshots were the results of a sound system, I&#39;d like to inspect it, because it&#39;s <em>way</em> ahead of our time. </p>

<p>The &#39;i had friends there leave the victims alone&#39; ploy is emotional leverage to censor others. Just like you can&#39;t mention 9/11 or sandy hook.</p>

<p>Its a disservice to the victims to stand by and let the truth be covered up.</p>

<p>Eyewitness accounts via social media are the only actual sources we have for this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I met Susan Smith several years ago and she was a real person who worked at a real elementary School in my hometown and I know for a fact she is really &quot;missing&quot; from her life now. I absolutely believe she was killed in Las Vegas, but the only thing I know for 100% sure is that her co-workers and friends all believe she is dead.</p>

<p>The conspiracy around Vegas is NOT that people weren&#39;t actually murdered you fucking dolt. </p>

<p>Go ahead and call me a shill, but I&#39;ve been here forever and I don&#39;t recognize your username...</p>
