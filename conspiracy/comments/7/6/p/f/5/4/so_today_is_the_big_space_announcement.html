       If it was anything most people would find interesting you'd already know the details. Contrary to popular belief, it's nearly impossible to get a group of people to keep their mouths shut. My guess is that it'll be something involving gravity waves. They're all the rage with the nerds these days.

       I think that's a fair point, but it's a much different situation. First and  foremost, it was war, not something as profound as discovering alien life, so it's a bit easier to keep that secret.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thousands of people who worked in the enrichment facilities lived in specially built isolated cities that had little contact with the outside world. None of these people had any idea that they were even enriching anything, let alone what it would be used for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The scientists were holed up at Los Alamos and it wasn't easy to leave. All of their communications were monitored. All mail coming in &amp; going out was first perused by government censors. The work there, too, was highly compartmentalized. This was actually a significant stumbling block as a lot of the people there had no idea what they were even working on, and most people weren't allowed to reveal details of their group's research to other groups.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Manhattan Project wasn't even all that well-kept of a secret. From the general public, sure, but Axis countries knew what was up. What they didn't know was how far along the Allies were in their research.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was much more difficult to leak back then. No email, no Twitter, no Facebook, there were just three TV news outlets, it was before the Pentagon Papers case, etc.

That is what Im talking about, after the patriot act is like the US is at war, so it is really not that hard to hide big things

       It's not hard to be anonymous. Plus, American law doesn't apply to the entire world. This space announcement is coming from a European entity.

       I mean, I agree that FISA courts are scary as hell, and that they are responsible for shutting some people up.  But TPTB can't even keep their own email from leaking.
