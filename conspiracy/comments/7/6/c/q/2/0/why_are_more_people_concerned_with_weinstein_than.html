       Look at the ratio of pedophile threads in comparison to the Paddock shooting — sure seems like people are just moving on. On the news it’s the same: Weinstein drama everywhere and barely anything about Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is one of the most botched investigations I can remember. It involves a mass murder on a massive scale, motive unknown, account of events unknown. Bizarre overall circumstances surrounding planning, execution, and investigation of events. Yet here everyone is concerned about Hollywood pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m not saying WeinsteinGate doesn’t deserve its own attention, but the ability of people to so quickly forget about things that should actually matter to them is alarming.

       Ya, I got it. What is your goal here though? I'm actively engaged in at least 10 different conspiracies right now. I don't need to have my priorities set for me. I'm not being combative here, just saying this post dilutes both other conversations.

       My goal is to encourage more inquisition from the general population about this shooting. It should be dominating headlines and there should be an urgency to get down to the bottom of what the hell happened. It’s unacceptable for the sheriff’s department to have completely confused their timeline of events a week following the shooting. We don’t know when Paddock checked into Mandalay, when engagement from Campos (or other officials) truly occurred, whether or not any surveillance of Paddock has been obtained, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone’s contentment with moving on from an event that was as catastrophic and unresolved as Vegas ought to be questioned. You may be engaged, but you would be an outlier.

       Dude, if you're looking to encourage the general population to pay attention to things that actually matter, you're in the wrong place.   People here already get it.  You should be sending this complaint to your friends and family who have already moved on with the news cycle.

       Shifted away because now there's the worst fires in California. The stuff still happening in Puerto Rico. News never stops because there's all kinds of things happening and needs to be covered. They do periodically come back to this case to update it, but they just won't continue to repeat stuff that they have been for days when it first happened.

       They haven’t reported on the inconsistency of the investigation whatsoever. It’s one thing to have redundant reporting, it’s another to have underreporting.

       That's probably because the average person isn't micro-analyzing every detail about the Vegas shooting. The average person knows that people's memories get confused in the panic of an event like this, and they know that investigations take time to get all of the details right. The only people who want the media to analyze "every inconsistency," are people who already believe that the event was a "false flag" (in the broad sense of the term). Which is kind of ironic, given that those same people would dismiss any analysis that came from the "MSM" anyway.

       While I'm with you about this sub being taken over (more so the last 2-3 days) by repeated spam posts, mostly saying the same thing, if not the exact same thing..
      </p>
      <p>
       News wise, they need something to report. They didn't say when the next one is to the best of my knowledge, so unless something is discovered in the public domain, there's simply nothing to report, they can only speculate.
      </p>
      <p>
       At first I didn't believe that Campos was really missing, but besides a few day or older articles, there's nothing about it.. or here, which I find odd. Is he actually missing still?

       Weinstein has definitely been released
       <em>
        now

       to cover over the disaster in Las Vegas. They were just holding on to the story until they needed a distraction.  Somehow, Harvey must have pissed off people higher up than him.

       You also have to understand, that for the average person, HW is a lot more exciting because it involves celebrities.

       The LV shooter is a more difficult to wrap your head around. FBI, ISIS, Gun running, money laundering. You need charts and string and wall space.

       Most people aren't. This whole uproar over the entire Weinstein thing is a total fabrication. If you went up to 100 people on the street and asked them about it they wouldn't know. They might have
       <em>
        heard
       </em>
       about it in passing, but it's not some huge issue that's eating up the general public.

       Because think of the children! Not to take away from the fact that the Weinstein scandal exposed the deviancy at the top level of Hollywood, but things of this nature tend to take preference in politics and the media because it's almost impossible to argue against. 'Wait you're not covering the child abuse scandal? That must mean you condone it/it's low on your priority list'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another reason is that mass shooting are almost normalised in American media now. The general public are more interested in their celebrity icons and the news that revolves around them.  Sheep

       Yeah I agree, people need to make a fuss about Vegas and get  Vegas back in the news again. Stage a protest, storm CNN during their news broadcast. Do something, citizens of the US. They're clearly lying to you, and who knows who's next? Whether it's rogue ISIS operatives now loose and armed in the US, or some FBI or CIA/intel agency false flag or just sheer incompetence, the fact is that there is a real danger if you don't get it sorted out and get to the bottom of it, it's a danger that threatens everyone.
