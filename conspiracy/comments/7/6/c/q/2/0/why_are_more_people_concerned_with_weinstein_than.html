        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Look at the ratio of pedophile threads in comparison to the Paddock shooting — sure seems like people are just moving on. On the news it’s the same: Weinstein drama everywhere and barely anything about Vegas. </p>

<p>This is one of the most botched investigations I can remember. It involves a mass murder on a massive scale, motive unknown, account of events unknown. Bizarre overall circumstances surrounding planning, execution, and investigation of events. Yet here everyone is concerned about Hollywood pedophiles. </p>

<p>Why? </p>

<p>I’m not saying WeinsteinGate doesn’t deserve its own attention, but the ability of people to so quickly forget about things that should actually matter to them is alarming.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My goal is to encourage more inquisition from the general population about this shooting. It should be dominating headlines and there should be an urgency to get down to the bottom of what the hell happened. It’s unacceptable for the sheriff’s department to have completely confused their timeline of events a week following the shooting. We don’t know when Paddock checked into Mandalay, when engagement from Campos (or other officials) truly occurred, whether or not any surveillance of Paddock has been obtained, etc. </p>

<p>Anyone’s contentment with moving on from an event that was as catastrophic and unresolved as Vegas ought to be questioned. You may be engaged, but you would be an outlier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s probably because the average person isn&#39;t micro-analyzing every detail about the Vegas shooting. The average person knows that people&#39;s memories get confused in the panic of an event like this, and they know that investigations take time to get all of the details right. The only people who want the media to analyze &quot;every inconsistency,&quot; are people who already believe that the event was a &quot;false flag&quot; (in the broad sense of the term). Which is kind of ironic, given that those same people would dismiss any analysis that came from the &quot;MSM&quot; anyway.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;m with you about this sub being taken over (more so the last 2-3 days) by repeated spam posts, mostly saying the same thing, if not the exact same thing..</p>

<p>News wise, they need something to report. They didn&#39;t say when the next one is to the best of my knowledge, so unless something is discovered in the public domain, there&#39;s simply nothing to report, they can only speculate.</p>

<p>At first I didn&#39;t believe that Campos was really missing, but besides a few day or older articles, there&#39;s nothing about it.. or here, which I find odd. Is he actually missing still?</p>

Not to take away from the fact that the Weinstein scandal exposed the deviancy at the top level of Hollywood, but things of this nature tend to take preference in politics and the media because it&#39;s almost impossible to argue against. &#39;Wait you&#39;re not covering the child abuse scandal? That must mean you condone it/it&#39;s low on your priority list&#39;. </p>
