        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On the 10th is when the MSM started to reporting that Jesus Campos was shot 6 minutes before (not after) Paddock started shooting.  Also the same day they gave Campos an award (or the 9th, debatable).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-las-vegas-guard-20171010-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-las-vegas-guard-20171010-story.html</a></p>

<p>Then MGM, not the police, not Campos, started saying it wasn&#39;t 6 minutes before, but 40 seconds before (12th).  This is the part I find really interesting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-mandalay-20171012-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-mandalay-20171012-story.html</a></p>

<p>The fact the Casino, after a week and a half is correcting the official story and the Police follow suite, as we saw yesterday (13th) when they changed the story to meet MGM&#39;s.  </p>

<p><a href="http://ktla.com/2017/10/13/las-vegas-police-agree-with-hotel-that-guard-was-shot-40-seconds-before-45-victims-still-being-hospitalized/">http://ktla.com/2017/10/13/las-vegas-police-agree-with-hotel-that-guard-was-shot-40-seconds-before-45-victims-still-being-hospitalized/</a></p>

<p>This whole thing reeks.</p>

<p>If they were providing an award to Campos, the only eye witness, you would think they already got his statements  </p>
