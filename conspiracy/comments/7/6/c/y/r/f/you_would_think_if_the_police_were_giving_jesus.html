       On the 10th is when the MSM started to reporting that Jesus Campos was shot 6 minutes before (not after) Paddock started shooting.  Also the same day they gave Campos an award (or the 9th, debatable).
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Then MGM, not the police, not Campos, started saying it wasn't 6 minutes before, but 40 seconds before (12th).  This is the part I find really interesting.
      </p>

       The fact the Casino, after a week and a half is correcting the official story and the Police follow suite, as we saw yesterday (13th) when they changed the story to meet MGM's.

       This whole thing reeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       If they were providing an award to Campos, the only eye witness, you would think they already got his statements

       Sorry, didn't realize that, thanks for the correction.  Even so, you don't think they had already interviewed him prior to the 10th?

       They did have his timeline down, likely from the beginning, they have made it very clear they are only going to give the public information as they see fit!
