        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Within days of the 01 October event, reports surfaced and LEO stated that Paddock had multiple cell phones in his room. Specifically, LEO initially thought one phone charger they found didn&#39;t match &#39;any of the cell phones Paddock had in the room&#39;. They later stated they were able to match all chargers to the multiple cell phones in the room.
Those of us curious minds have been frothing over who is JC, to the point we&#39;ve probably been distracted from some of the more interesting and potentially troubling aspects of this event. One aspect that has gone largely overlooked, is the &#39;multiple cell phones&#39; declaration.
LVMPD indicated invetstigators compiled over &#39;200 instances of Paddock moving in and around LV before the attack, and he was always alone.&#39; If this guy was a loner, why would he need multiple cell phones?
The low hanging fruit theory that many will grab at, is the &#39;multiple people involved&#39; - sure, that fits your confirmation bias, but given there&#39;s little if any credible sourced info that could indicate such, let&#39;s expand our little fuzzy brains and think what else could have been going on?
Personally, I&#39;m curious to see if investigators will find that these cell phones were never intended to make calls to people, but perhaps were related to the chemical compounds found in the guys&#39; car, and the attempts to ignite fuel tanks at the nearby airport fuel depot.
What say you, /conspirites? Annnnd go........</p>

<p>Mr. Paddock gambled as he lived, his brother said — methodically, always weighing the odds. He was cautious and liked to plan ahead, Eric Paddock said, and didn’t like leaving things to chance. He always carried two cellphones, each with a different carrier, in case one network was down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dave newton states he saw quite a few phones (more than two). Who knows. He just went through a pretty crazy ordeal. But he states a few phones, a couple laptops and monitors set up. That sounds like more than a guy who decided he wanted to shoot people. But who knows right now. </p>

<p>One point that is just crazy to me is, they have someone saying the night before he was gambling next to them and told them good job over a poker hand. It&#39;s crazy to think he was just going about usual business, gambling/walking around when he had the plan he did for the next night. Knowing the person he just congratulated may be in his crosshairs the next night </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good call out - but I don&#39;t see LEO saying &#39;multiple&#39; cell phones rather than saying &#39;the charger didn&#39;t match either of the phones&#39; if he just had two.

    <div class="md"><p>There is no such thing as a cell phone &quot;charger&quot; anymore. The police probably just found a USB cable. It&#39;s not uncommon to have an extra USB cable in your laptop bag for another device you might not have brought with you. I keep at least two variations of USB cables in all my bags but only usually have one cellphone, the extra is just incase I bring a kindle or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. The point I made initially, which unfortunately isn&#39;t getting much steam, is why so many mobile phones? I could have left out the &#39;charger/usb cable&#39; (call it whatever you want) bit but I didn&#39;t, because that was the context in which LEO/MSM brought up the multiple cell phones.</p>
