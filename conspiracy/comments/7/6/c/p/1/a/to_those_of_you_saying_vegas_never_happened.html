Say what?! You realize killing real people at that concert is a lot easier to do than to pull of some massive coordinated performance event. And my gut says they&#39;d prefer the easier way. Powerful shadow groups have no issues with the death of innocent people if it&#39;s all for the cause/agenda/greater good of society. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah people dont realize they have been doing this for a long time.  I personally think trump, LV, politics, hollywood, is all meant to seem like all these seperate things are happening at once but really they orchastrated all of this to look like the bad things are finally coming to light and people are feeling vindicated.  This way before the dust settles the true elite can take a step back into the shadows and re organize thier efforts.  I dont have any proof of this but I say this from the viewpoint of the fact that we know someone is pulling the strings.  Who they let us see are all disposable for them so it doesnt matter who gets blamed.  You dont have to even be smart to do this stuff, just rich.  if i were that rich I would hire smart people to firm think tanks of all varieties and use manipulation at all levels if my end goal was world domination.  It isnt hard for me to think this is possible if this is the mindset of these &quot;elites&quot;.</p>

Well guess what, it&#39;s been happening throughout history. It&#39;s a fact of life, there are crazies who want to kill hordes of people...YIKES!

    <div class="md"><p>No no no. It is NOT easier to pull-off an event with real deaths. The lawsuits, subpoenas and private investigations would be in the THOUSANDS!! Why is this so difficult for people to grasp? There are thousands of videos that depict how staged crisis events are produced and are for sale by real companies that do this shit professionally! </p>

<p>You hire some crazy, narcissistic sociopaths to fall to the ground with blood packets in their pockets and mouth when the gunshot noises are piped through the sound system, and it&#39;s over in one hour.</p>

<p>There hare no ballistic reports out there. Of the countless videos I&#39;ve seen from people on the ground, NOTHING indicates <em>real</em> gunfire with <em>real</em> ballistics hitting the ground. That&#39;s why the fake grass was put on the ground in front of the stage, to obfuscate the ballistics, that would otherwise be super evident if it was just pavement. They purposely laid the astroturf down for this reason. Shit wasn&#39;t there up until recently.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And why would a powerful national/global group give one shit about the collateral of a real event? Lawsuits, suboneas, investigations etc...that doesn&#39;t involve them, they&#39;ve already moved on by this point and left the pieces to be picked up by local/state authorities. Again, you are admitting there is a shadow group powerful and nefarious enough to stage MASSIVE events with thousands of people but they just aren&#39;t evil enough to kill real people for the agenda? Huh. And ya I&#39;ve watched Vegas videos of bullets hitting the ground around people and I&#39;ve watched them with my brother in law who served 3 tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan and he had no issues with the ballistics occurring in the videos. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>best theory I have is that the FBI/the powers that be were aware of shooters intentions and let it happened and observed from a distance. All the strange circumstance surrounding the shooting is from power that be covering their tracks here and there of their foreknowledge. Just a reminder that 60 minutes did a story earlier this year about the terrorist shooting in Garland, Texas and that there was an FBI agent monitoring the terrorist who drove away right before they were about to attack. So we know there is standing policy for this type of action.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say they did,  I said &quot;some unknown person&quot;,   and them saying they were shot, plus the police saying Stephen Paddock did it

    <div class="md"><p>I dunno if that would do much good. First off, the vast majority of victims were from out of town. So once better, they are going home. The other reason is I would be leveraging my professional experience as a paramedic to assess how much like actual gunshot victims these patients present.

<p>You seriously think they are going to let you inspect their wounds?  </p>

<p>Hoaxers are right that it&#39;s pretty difficult to physically prove that it took place .  It&#39;s just a matter of whether you could get that many people to lie/fake something like that including probably media, law enforcement, and hospital personnel.  It seems very unlikely to me, but I suppose technically possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Las Vegas was a hoax just like Sandy Hook.  Notice how all of the Sandy Hook &quot;lawsuits&quot; were settled out of court and all the evidence destroyed.  The same thing will happen for the Vegas hoax.  It&#39;s not that they value the lives of the people they would rather fake than actually kill.  It&#39;s that fake victims and their imaginary families who launch fake lawsuits that supposedly get settled out of court are a lot easier to deal with than stubborn real victims who won&#39;t settle for money and demand to know the truth in court.</p>

<p>It is absolutely less hassle to coordinate a hoax than to deal with the cover-up aftermath from real victim&#39;s families who demand the truth.</p>

<p>What do you hoax deniers say about Sandy Hook?  You think is was a real shooting?  Do your research.</p>

<p>They hired crisis actors to scream and incite panic.  From a distance it looks like panic.  On closer inspection, it&#39;s an orchestrated drill.  In interviews these crisis actors are so incredibly bad:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dQ17_LWFZs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_dQ17_LWFZs</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>best theory I have is that the FBI/the powers that be were aware of shooters intentions and let it happened and observed from a distance. All the strange circumstance surrounding the shooting is from power that be covering their tracks here and there of their foreknowledge. Just a reminder that 60 minutes did a story earlier this year about the terrorist shooting in Garland, Texas and that there was an FBI agent monitoring the terrorist who drove away right before they were about to attack. So we know there is standing policy for this type of action.</p>
