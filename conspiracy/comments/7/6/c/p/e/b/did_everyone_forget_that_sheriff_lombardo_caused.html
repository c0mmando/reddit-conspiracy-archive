        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In April of 2014, Bundy led a fight against the federal government over the court ordered seizure of his cattle which were illegally grazing on public land. Bundy refused to remove the cattle or pay fees.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Land Management put together a complex operation to round up the cattle, but on April 12th, Bundy supporters showed up and some of them were armed.</p>

<p>BLM agents and local law enforcement were outnumbered. <strong>Sheriff Lombardo</strong> helped negotiate the release of cattle so that the standoff would end peacefully.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the full paragraph you are quoting from for anyone who didn&#39;t bother to read the article. Lombardo is mentioned twice farther up in the Wikipedia article but not at all during the negotiations or de-escalations section not in the linked <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/13/nevada-bundy-cattle-ranch-armed-protesters">source article</a>. It sounds like OP is trying to make a story where there isn&#39;t one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Las Vegas Metro Deputy Chief Tom Roberts defused the situation by announcing that Bundy&#39;s cattle would be returned within 30 minutes.[63] The BLM announced that it would suspend the mass roundup,[1][82] citing safety reasons. Clark County Sheriff Gillespie mediated the agreement between the Bundy family and the BLM, saying, &quot;[W]hen a group of protesters threaten civil unrest or violence in this county -- it is my job to step in and ensure the safety of citizens.&quot;[74] BLM Director Neil Kornze said that &quot;Based on information about conditions on the ground, and in consultation with law enforcement, we have made a decision to conclude the cattle gather because of our serious concern about the safety of employees and members of the public.&quot;[79][80][83][84]</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, I knew nothing about this Bundy standoff and now I&#39;m researching. 
OP I think there is something here, it makes more sense than any gun-running/ISIS connection. </p>

//But near the end of &quot;American Patriot,&quot; we see portions of undercover video filmed by FBI agents who posed as documentary filmmakers in an effort to infiltrate the Bundy family.//</p>

//In October 2016, a federal jury in Portland found Ammon and Ryan Bundy, along with five co-defendants, not guilty of conspiracy and gun charges relating to the Oregon standoff.//</p>

<p>Paddock supposedly start stockpiling weapons in <strong>Oct. 2016.</strong></p>

<p>Cliven Bundy was arrested Feb. 2016 and is supposed to go on trial this year.

<p>FBI agents lied in the 2nd Bundy standoff in Oregon:

//The FBI agent charged Wednesday with lying about firing his gun during a deadly confrontation during the 2016 Oregon-Bundy standoff may be only the tip of the iceberg.//</p>

<p>Bundy is considered part of the &quot;sovereign citizens&quot;:
&quot;The FBI considers sovereign-citizen extremists as comprising a domestic terrorist movement, which, scattered across the United States, has existed for decades, with well-known members, such as Terry Nichols, who helped plan the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, bombing. &quot;

<p>&quot;The FBI considers the sovereign citizen movement the nation’s top domestic terrorism threat.&quot;

<p><strong>some possibilities:</strong> 
- FBI set up the shooting as payback for Lombardo releasing the Bundy&#39;s cattle. They don&#39;t care about telling the media Paddock&#39;s motive b/c they want to embarrass Lombardo. The name &quot;Paddock&quot; is just so damn literal.... </p>

<ul>
<li><p>It&#39;s not an FBI conspiracy at all. The Bundy family or some other &quot;sovereign citizens&quot; did the entire shooting. The FBI is floundering/pretending they know nothing when they are still investigating this angle. (They&#39;ve lied so much though, I don&#39;t trust anything they say)</p></li>
<li><p>FBI was undercover within the Bundy family/their connections, Paddock was working for them undercover, things went bad (I think this is more likely)</p></li>
<li><p>Entire shooting was staged by the FBI and they will say Bundy and co./sovereign citizens did it. This will later be used in Cliven Bundy&#39;s trial. </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thoughts? Theories? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is a forgotten point and connection:</p>

<p>The 2014 Las Vegas shootings occurred on June 8, 2014 in northeastern Las Vegas, Nevada, when a married couple, Jerad and Amanda Miller, committed a shooting spree in which five people died, including themselves. </p>

<p><strong>During the April 2014 Bundy standoff, in which the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) attempted to round up cattle belonging to rancher Cliven Bundy, who refused to vacate public land, Jerad Miller was said to have been among the armed protesters who joined Bundy during the incident.</strong></p>
