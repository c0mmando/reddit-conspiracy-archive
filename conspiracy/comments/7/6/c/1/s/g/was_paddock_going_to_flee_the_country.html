        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I don&#39;t think Paddock was suicidal. I think he was planning on fleeing the country. <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/10/06/vegas-shooter-haunted-senior-center-looking-for-cheap-meals/">This article talks about how Paddock went to a senior center he frequented and asked a lady for her enchilada recipe.</a> If he was going to kill himself why would he ask for a recipe? <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/stephen-paddock-las-vegas-king-microaggression-eric-brother-shooter-background-life-a7987826.html">He was going to Las Vegas where his brother talked about him being comped 1000 dollar sushi plates.</a> Asking for a recipe would seem to indicate that he was planning ahead. Why would he need an enchilada recipe if he planned to off himself in Las Vegas? <a href="http://dailycaller.com/2017/10/04/sheriff-paddock-rented-different-room-through-airbnb/">Was he going to make enchiladas in one of the many houses he seemed to rent on airbnb that he never actually visited?</a> He had sent his girlfriend 100,000 dollars and she was off in the Philippines. He had a lot of money and 2 planes he could use to travel. </p>

<p>Paddock was suppose to be really smart, so what was with the gas tanks? Blowing up gas tanks with a gun is something you see in movies. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4n--xOOoWE">It took the Mythbusters a gatling gun with incendiary rounds to blow up a gas tank.</a> He had 30 pounds of tannerite in his car. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVSecWR5YgY">Here is what 30 pounds of tannerite does to a car.</a> Instead of moving his explosive filled car near the gas tanks, he decides to just shoot at them? This is why I think this is a gun deal gone wrong. The shooter/s were going to blow up the car near the gas tanks but something spooked them and they killed Paddock before he could trade his car or tell them where it was parked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly.  Paddock wasnt on our payroll.  Like Barry Seal, he was allowed to smuggle and launder to his heart&#39;s content, so long as he was giving us info.
Given that, it is easy to see how he could be turned, as his allegiance depends on his current situation.  The govt hung Barry Seal out to dry when they were done with him, and maybe Paddock saw slmething similar coming for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not seen that movie yet but I must watch it. The reason is that Tom Cruise is in it. Now hear me out. Tom Cruise made &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot; and now Harvey Weinstein is exposed. Because he made &quot;American Made&quot; 2017, it may be the collective subconscious giving us clues as to the character of Paddock. This sounds weird, but in my experience, it is worth looking into.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s why i have guessed that Paddock was one of the CIA agents providing the girls and kids to the Hollywood/DC sex ring.  That would possibly tie Weinstein, Pizzagate, and Vegas together.</p>

<p>When the orders for girls stopped a 6 months ago and his handlers quit returning his calls, Paddock would have figured that it was all going to come crashing down, and he acted first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess that too. Paddock was on a suicide mission. A personal bet with himself that he could outdo the evil of his father and punish the agencies that used his criminal services over the years. He was drinking too much. He couldn&#39;t sleep. He was aging. He got paid by ISIS and he gambled his life. I bet he was going to explode himself in his car when police shot at it. But Jesus and Schuck stopped him. They were agents?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think he was planning to escape. But was prepared to die. He booby-trapped his car so that if police shot it, the car would explode.</p>

<p>I think Jesus and Schuck interrupted Paddock&#39;s plans.</p>

<p>Just a few questions.</p>

<p>Was Paddock planning to shoot up a Trump rally in Phoenix, Arizona?</p>

<p>Were Jesus and Schuck undercover agents who were trying to sting Paddock before he murdered those people? Did they have automatic weapons and that explains the multiple shooter theory? They shot at Paddock as he was beginning to murder people and they messed up the sting.</p>

<p>Paddock was a criminal smuggler who obviously did work for government agencies. He was a rogue asset that went crazy, like Tommy Lee Jones.</p>

<p>This is the most plausible scenario from the gunfire I heard multiple times from different videos.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If it was a gun deal gone wrong, why shoot up the concert? Why not just kill Paddock and take the guns? You’re telling me the shooting was an act of opportunity and not planned out ahead of time? Seems really unlikely considering the shooting seemed to require quite a bit of planning.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, that&#39;s why i have guessed that Paddock was one of the CIA agents providing the girls and kids to the Hollywood/DC sex ring.  That would possibly tie Weinstein, Pizzagate, and Vegas together.</p>
