       The only man who actually had contact with the alleged killer.  The man who has not given a single interview since the shooting.  The man who has never been video recorded since the incident.
      </p>
      <p>
       This very man gets an award in public for being the hero of the night during the biggest mass murder in modern US history and NOT ONE SINGLE REPORTER IS THERE TO RECORD IT?  Really?  All they release is 2 bad quality pictures with 4 guys around him?
      </p>
      <p>
       You save a drowning kid and you'll be SURROUNDED by reporters.  And this guy?  Nothing?  OMG.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has the world gone insane?  They accuse us of being conspiracy theorist and wearing tin foil hats.  But my god, how blind do you have to be to not be able to see that something is wrong here.

       I hear you and folds in the community argue back and forth about it being a false flag not a hoax all over the place. The whole event is a drill or faked imo and I don't believe anyone was shot regardless if the (1) LiveLeak video that is what everyone tries to force as the definitive proof.

       And the evidence you're going off of is what? so you're saying the gov or some shadow group is nefarious enough to stage a mass shooting to push gun control but they aren't nefarious/evil enough to just kill real people? You know it's 100% easier to just do the real event and kill real people instead of trying to get thousands of people all on some sort of act....think it through

       Are you joking? It's absolutely easier to send in a "squad" of guys to shoot up a concert instead of a massive performance with thousands of people all in on it..think about all the loose ends they have to make sure they cover. One guy or a squad is much easier to pull off.

       Listen to me, the US government has no problem executing Americans. Hell, they do it all the time in foreign countries. They are not going to spend millions to hire "crisis actors" and use fake blood and pray everyone keeps their mouths shut. Instead they just kill people. Everyone needs to accept that.

       I had a friend who was there, and she has been posting about it. Well haven't seen her in years, but what's interesting is she used to(still probably) goes to Disneyland all the time(we're 27). What matters is that she attends that club 33 each of those times and her family is loaded of course. Just insinuating that if you were to meet a Hollywood type pushing an agenda it could be there. And not saying she's a crisis actor, and that her being at the shooting makes it all the more real to me, but if someone I knew would be one it'd be her lol.

       I have a good friend who lives in Las Vegas who knows some of the people who were injured and died. So you’re telling me my friend is lying to me? I know there have been hoaxes like Sandy Hook but this wasn’t a hoax. This was something else that I’m still trying to figure out just like everyone else questioning here.

       No I'm not but the person I was responding to was. Im saying I do believe it happened cause I had a friend there(and the wife of the police captain for my home town died there) but if anyone I know was a crisis actor it'd be her. However I don't like to go too deep down that rabbit hole besides with sketch Sandy Hook. I think by all accounts this seems like a mistake or made to look like it.

       So what's the evidence your going off of? You're telling me that the entire LVPD and LV hospitals and thousands of people who had friends or knew someone that was killed are all in on if? This is a seriously massive event and they got everyone on the same page? I am all for conspiracies about the shooter but to say the event was staged/faked is so mind numbing my stupid.

       The lack of evidence. O media coverage for burials of the 'victims'. obituary and burial site locations. Shit like this Jesus Campos supposed hero story..wouldn't Trump have visited the hero of the psyop? People at the concert saying it sounded like it was coming from the speakers. No real pictures of injuries from gunshot wounds. No proof Paddock ever entered the casino released. Yeah I'm stupid.

       Ya agree there is a lack of evidence at the moment to support the current narrative being pushed in the media. Agree. But your only evidence to support it never happened is that people said it sounded like it came from the speakers? Eh. And there are PLENTY of videos/photos of real people with real wounds dying on the ground. Go look around. But again, you're saying the players behind this are nefarious enough to stage a MASSIVE coordinated event but not quite evil enough to just kill real people at a real event? Huh

       I don't disagree there are super weird circumstances surrounding both Vegas and Sandy Hook. But think this through logically. You admit their is a shadow group of some sort that is powerful and nefarious enough to stage MASSIVE events with the coordination of thousands of people (and an entire town in SH case) but they just aren't evil enough to send a small group of like 5 guys into Vegas and shoot real people. What's the easier thing to do between those 2 options? Thousands of people versus a small elite group of killers? And on top of all that, don't forget that there are just evil POS people that want to kill hordes of people for whatever reason...it's been a repeating theme through history.

       Look we can both agree we are being lied too right? I'm not going to be able to prove anything more than you can here. I think the whole story is falling apart and for me I look at it like a court room. When the judge catches you in a lie your whole testimony is questioned for truthfulness.

       What other evidence have we seen to thoroughly disprove this theory? Or any theory at all? Cant_have_any_puddin could have said his personal belief was that Stephen Paddock was actually xenu and Scientology was behind it. We don't know?

       I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and respond to your statement "I don't believe anyone was shot" as something you truly believe instead of a remark to upset people by letting you know that you can in fact prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that several people died- all you have to do is search on any search engine (I'd post a link but I don't want to seem like I'm just showing info to support my claims) for the names of those who died and then search for them on Facebook or other social media/search engines and you will in fact see they were real people and are no longer alive.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mention Facebook first because it's one of the quickest ways to confirm someone is deceased- once they receive official notice (like death certificate) that persons page is changed from a regular profile to a remembrance page, which ONLY happens when that individual is absolutely confirmed to have passed away. I personally know several people who were killed in the shooting and all their Facebook pages have been converted to remembrance pages, but what's key here is that you can still see lots of information about them (not just pictures) including their workplace, school, full names of people they knew which can all be verified as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't like Facebook then you can still check other social media, search engines with their full name, or local newspapers reporting the deaths (my local newspaper dedicated a significant amount of space on each of the 4 victims from the area with plenty of verifiable info and quotes from their loved ones and coworkers etc.) to name a few things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line is there are several different ways (which are both quick and easy) to get definitive proof that the victims were in fact real people that are now deceased, so there's truly no reason anyone should be claiming that no one was hurt, unless you're just trying to upset people. 
So if you sincerely are seeking the truth here, the best way to start is by confirming or denying things you believe before forming opinions... you'll get a lot closer to the truth that way.

       You really are pitching Facebook for a confirmation source? Facebook is a media magnet tar pit. Anyways let me ask you what you think about summer of the hero's like Jesus and Mike Cronk who's buddy survived 3 to the chest. Do you believe these people are genuine and their stories are factual? How about the woman who was interviewed that was on Dr. Phil? Coincidences? Would you do an interview a day after being shot with nothing but smiles? I'd like to hear your thoughts.

       Facebook is definitely not a source of purely factual information and I wouldn't believe most of what I read there, I'm pitching it as one thing- a way to connect the names of the deceased to their pages containing their connections to other individuals, their workplace, school, etc. so that it can be confirmed the names are of real people, and that those people have in fact passed away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the people allegedly present have displayed "unusual" behavior and done things contrary to what we believe people should do in these situations, but it's very true that you never know how you or anyone else will respond to a situation like that until you're in one, often due to shock that some experience where their brains protect themselves by not processing emotions right away... and who's going to be responding to requests for interviews and making statements? Not the traumatized people responding the way we expect, but the ones in shock that feel good enough to- strange behavior certainly does not automatically = lies, but it does absolutely mean we need to find out more.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be, need to be skeptical of all facts presented to us, but while accepting everything as truth is bad, being overly skeptical can be just as harmful. In response to your questions, I have more questions than answers and I do believe we have been told untrue things- All I am saying is that certain things, like the fact that several people died, can definitively be proven which I know because unfortunately I knew many in attendance, but don't believe that because a random person on the internet said it's true- because it can be proven with very little time and effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       If we all focus on looking in the right places there's a very good shot we can figure some real truths out which is why I took the time to explain in the first place. But to figure anything out we need to take the provable facts and set them aside we can focus on the real unknowns and put the pieces together to find the truth, but we can only find truth from truth, or we'll be chasing around ideas not rooted in reality and get nowhere. That's why this is important. First step in finding out what really happened is separating and accepting the facts, and these deaths are indisputable facts. 
Happy to help with information searching to anyone interested.

Another news outlet reporting on her death. There are several more as well, just wanted to include more than one here.
      </p>
      <p>
       So there you go. This is just one person I chose, could have done it for several more as well if I had the time but as mentioned this is not information only I have access to, anyone interested can do the same research.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anyone's interested, I have included a link below which has the names of all victims who perished during the attack:

       Battery died on a DSL camera I owned years ago, had lost the manual and had no idea how to reset the date.  I was taking pictures that had year 2000 time stamps and could give a shit less because who looks at that shit?

       EXIF used to be very important in the professional photo world, most MSM photos online still carried their editing EXIF, then 2012 happened and scrubbing time. back to the stone age of potato cameras and no EXIF.

       They are waiting for us to proclaim this an ISIS event. Instead we are saying there is no link and that Jesus, their convert, is actually an American hero.  Eventually they would have to say, "no, he is with ISIS" and we have the evidence to prove it. Maybe they want to be able to trace that evidence.

       Oh, that would explain the name Jesus. They are totally trolling ISIS and trying to make them powerless. Terror attacks don't work if no one knows who actually did it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They hate the idea of Jesus, and consider Muhammed the only true prophet. Jesus wasn't even listed as an employee until a few hours after people on the internet noticed the database (they added a Larry Jesus Campos retro-actively into the employee network just 4 hours after people started going "huh?").
      </p>
      <p>
       ISIS: "Weee did this infidels! Feel the wrath of Muhammed!!"
      </p>
      <p>
       US: "Nope. Lalalala. It was a nerdy retired white guy on vacation. Our hero Jesus took a bullet and saved countless lives! Praise Jesus! LOL no one believes you anymore. U mad???"

       Doubt it the officials ruled out terror groups in the first few hours. If they switched now after the sheriff made grand sweeping statements like there were no other people on the loose. Interesting phrasing he didnt say in the last press com that there was no one else involved just no one else involved who might be a continued threat. That statement was legalese and allowed things like dead more bad guys or bad guys that they know are finished with whatever the op was. The sheriff saying that the purpose of the press conferences was to calm the public not explain the criminal investigation. Yet during the week they were putting up billboards asking for help. Usually more details and footage would be released. Why cant they produce a pic of him gambling and going up to his room?

       Thats why the guy who posted about upcoming interview said Trump did meet when in Vegas but of course we have no way of knowing much other than the videos / photos available. The fact the wife wasnt allowed to even confirm if he is alive or safe is pretty wild.

       It's not about wanting to be in the public.  He already is. Campos was within the events of a massacre. Sorry Jesus the public wants to meet you and until they do nobody will trust any of this narrative. Supposedly this guy even wouldn't meet trump . A few hours of his life is not going to kill him, he has to suck it up and get out there.

       Lol at this post. He doesn’t have to do anything he just survived a mass shooting. Idk about you but even me jesus wouldn’t want cameras asking me a million questions after surviving that and many Americans wouldn’t want to meet the poor excuse we call a president. Why don’t you go get shot and suck it up and take some interviews since your a fucking hero

He doesn’t give a fuck about money he gives a fuck that he’s alive and is probably still copping with what happened use your fucking brain.  Just put yourself in his shoes for half a second you are a regular security guard and just went through what he did I’m sure you would be happy to even go home and visit family the last thing on your mind is let’s give an interview because I’m focused on money after a mass shooting. Why the fuck didn’t every sandy hook parent with a dead kid give an interview maybe they had bigger things to deal with than money after witnessing such a traumatic event.

       Unless you are him. I'm not sure how you can confidently say he doesn't care about the money. And believe me the offers are all rolling in. The only reason he may still be in recluse is to drum up suspense and possibly save all of the interviews for a after he releases a book to... drumroll please.... MAKE MORE MONEY.

       You are assuming on the same level as I am just assuming different things so if my points invalid your is just as invalid. I’m confident in saying money doesn’t drive everyone the way you are making it sound and I am confident one doesn’t go through what he did and not be mentally shaken.

       No assumptions. I'm just saying if it were about the money. Going into hiding and riding the suspense wave is a great way to increase it.

       Jesus is the only witness who (supposedly) saw the (alleged) shooter in action.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had the (alleged) shooter survived, Jesus would have to testify against him in court, but because the (alleged) shooter did not survive, he is presumed guilty. Case closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I guess you're right, Jesus doesn't have to do anything. He'll probably retire in Honduras or Nicaragua or wherever.

       Their main argument is that governments are too stupid to keep a conspiracy well-hidden, so we would find out about it. Then when you point out a mistake, they say there's no way they would fuck up that badly. "They are smart enough to conspire and keep it hidden from the public, but they also make dumb mistakes?" This line of reasoning doesn't make any sense. The reality is that it's a little of both. People are fallible. Even intelligent people fuck up sometimes. Maybe they didn't have enough coffee or sleep the night before, or maybe they were having a bad day. Skeptics will use whichever argument is more convenient. It depends on the thread. That way they can dismiss anything they want out of hand.

       I mean that's why the term "conspiracy theorist" was invented. So that when they do make one or two small fuck ups, people who perceive themselves to be "normal" will ignore the obvious conspiracy in front of their eyes because they aren't "one of those crazy conspiracy theorists".

       Here’s what I think. It could be as it has been explained. Campos could be camera shy or hiding something that is unrelated or the government is the conspirator. Let me challenge that with a more insidious plot.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if it was all a ploy by weapon manufacturers and weapon accessory makers. Guns are like a precious commodity. Hell its even like oil, when there is speculation the prices can soar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about it. If anti gun activists make a big enough stink, laws will be written to ban bump fire stocks and high cap magazines (for example). When a law is implemented for weapons, it always states that anything built/manufactured prior to the law is exempt and anything built after said date is a federal crime. Well then you can say a typical 30 round mag which sold for $25, now sells for $75 dollars. These bans come and go. Only thing that changes is the bank accounts of those vested in weapons and arms manufacturing. Also surplus will always be there, banning further builds is pointless.

       I’m not saying that’s what happened or has happened. Whenever I read anything about an incident, regardless of it coming from multiple sources it always falls right on to the government (by no means am I saying they don’t do things). No one ever looks into these interest groups or other organizations. When I was overseas, my job put me in contact with a lot of those groups that have zero accountability. I’ve seen very bad things happen and how they were swept away. Nothing of this magnitude but nonetheless people lost lives.

       That's ridiculous. For one, the gun industry is thousands of smaller manufacturers. The big ones make their money from war and gov contracts mostly. Also, possibly getting your product banned for a small bump in sales is terrible business.

       On archive.org the 2 snapshots have empty data on the photo. So there's no way to actually prove this guy is telling the truth.

       I think the FBI knows Campos was in on it.  Campos is either dead or incarcerated and the FBI is using the narrative that he's a hero and not at all under suspicion in order to use him to flush out the other members of the cell.

       It's way past the point of being fishy.  It's conclusively fraudulent.  These people who call themselves "jounalists" and companies who call themselves "the press" are lying about their job titles and their functions in society.  They should really be called "state propagandists".

       It was the FBI that released the crime scene that let the reporters in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The FBI determined that the shredded documents (and everything else) they left behind were in no way relevant to their "investigation". How did they determine this without even so much as lifting the shredded documents out of the waster basket. How could they tell these were not relevant the the investigation until they pieced the shreds together unless the "investigation" was a sham?

       This.  Just because a family member tells Laura whatever her name is that they can't talk to her right now doesn't make it a gag order.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've used that line on countless telemarketers and door to door salesmen and it has been because I did not want to talk to them; not because I couldn't legally.

       Ya, the media is letting everyone assume he's Latino because of his name.  The facial hair is a sticking point for me too.  The big vegas resorts have grooming standards, and I don't think that would fly with most of them unless it was for religious reasons.

       I was thinking about him possibly being held hostage as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       My line of thinking is that he is known to be an accomplice. The FBI is holding him in custody and "interrogating" him because they know this was not a two-man job. They want it to appear like they are not looking for anyone else so as to not alert the additional accomplices. Make Campos out to be a hero to fool the responsible people/organization into thinking they got away with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps he disappeared before the interviews because he
       <em>
        escaped
       </em>
       . The FBI didn't want to draw suspicion, so his "bodyguards" were not present, at least in the immediate area. Jesus saw his chance and booked it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to go a step further and say the FBI
       <em>
        wanted
       </em>
       him to escape. Maybe he just wasn't talking, and they are following him to see if he leads them to whoever it is they're looking for.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe he was an FBI agent. He looks like a corpse in every picture. I could imagine that if I were being tortured for information that I wouldn't look very alive in pictures my torturers forced me to take.

       Yeah, if this were a CIA op they have excellent actors they could use to convince the world this guy was a hero. But this guy looks like a corpse, like a prisoner being forced to do things. And his family appears to be under a gag order - that does not happen if he is a victim.

       3rd party or not, there would simply be more functions on the website.. the only people that have access in large companies like that would work in HR, and each field would have a button in order to change the information there. There would also be more fields, full time, part time, event staff.. that shit is just plain fake..

       I have personally managed several businesses and I can tell you the personnel records were very bare bones and some had fields that were hidden unless you are in management. I'm not making a judgement either way, just adding in my personal experience.

       And I've worked in fields at a large corporation where I had bare bones access to employee data, and simply put, the bigger and more complex the organization is, the more complex the data on employees is.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, the simplest proof would be how many times we've heard how important liability is. Them having such a simple system would be idiotic. They'd need to be able to show who added that employee, with a timestamp, it would be linked to other records, are they full time, part time, event staff? There's just so much data a large company would need.. and that guy would have been able to pull it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The odds of them outsourcing to a shitty 3rd party is simply closer to 0, because all their investments are based on liability.

       I doubt this information was supplied by a manager or higher-up with access to that information. It is likely a compartmented system with information access restricted. I would be interested in who supplied this and what their authority level is.

       My point was that I've worked in IT(at more than one large company), where I needed the most limited access to the HR database, and there were edit buttons and plenty of functionality, that when interacted with would simply have greyed out words. All the information stated was there, just not information like social security and whatnot that would require someone with higher level access.
      </p>
      <p>
       To have an entirely different scheme isn't how businesses or 3rd parties typically do it, the layout would be exactly the same, functionality is what would be different.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, this ultra simple WordPress looking site simply wouldn't be what a large casino would be using in a high liability environment.

       Best stuff? As in the best evident and sources? That's such bollocks. This video proved nothing at all. Nothing. He had no verifiable evidence and no credible sources.

       Fair enough i guess, i don't see why the need to be mean about him as a person. I did learn of the forensic audio analysis video through him so there is that. But also he talks about nibiru. So eh. If he's another Alex Jones then so be it.

       No. He had someone who he refused to reveal as a legitimate source send through screenshots. Or fabricated them himself. Or it's real. It's not as clear cut as 'This random guy on the internet says he has these pictures from a reputable source'. Why is Scott fucking Binsack the go to guy for 100% guaranteed, undeniable Vegas shooting evidence?

      <p>
       You guys have a penchant for not believing things you see and hear.... And then this guy shows you in video an incredibly easy to fabricate screenshot of an employee database.
      </p>
      <p>
       The beauty is, he's just showing you video footage of the pictures so you can't even check they are real.

       To me, it doesn't indicate that the CEO has added him to the records. I don't remember seeing a specific time it was added either. I was skipping through a long video though so may have missed it. The other guys titles should be easily verifiable.

       Nothing about it really indicates staff personal log. I'm not familiar with how you do it in the US but I'm pretty sure companies I have worked for don't have a shitty website/PowerPoint presentation for a log.

       There's more fields than that, it would be handled by someone in human resources, each field would have an edit button.. it's absolutely bullshit. Plus, Laura Loomer claims he was hired at the end of June, not sure which is lying, or is it's both.. but clearly they can't both be right.

       I mean, even though sheriff has speculated that this old guy would have likely needed help, and I've always been willing to entertain that. I mean, if he was drilling when the security guard was around, then how did he see him? I understand there's a camera, but it's kind of hard to drill while looking somewhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that he hadn't finished preparing (drilling) and that there's all that unused explosive in his car could just as well be indicators that he didn't have help, and couldn't accomplish everything in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty open minded about most of it, but there's nothing that's even come close to convincing me there was another shooter.

       From what I've read the concert was almost over. He was pretty far behind schedule if that was the case. Maybe he was spooked, realised he just had to go for it and did. The second shooter audio has been debunked as far as I'm concerned. The sheer volume of reports that were initially given clearly can't all be taken as fact, not in the chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't want to draw conclusions before we have all the facts. Therefore, I'm not willing to believe anyone who say they have a concrete idea of what happened.

       It might be worthy of its own post, but what about the drilling? They just backtracked on the whole "Campos was there before he opened fire on the crowd", but they had said on Monday that he heard drilling.. but they also said he was shot at some point while he was already shooting at the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
       When and how did he hear the drilling, which they confirmed Monday that he did and that it wasn't complete.. it makes no fucking sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was definitely behind. But what they said at the press conference yesterday is Campos was shot sometime after he started firing into the crowd, is he running back and forth looking at the camera footage?
      </p>
      <p>
       Just nothing that's been admittedly said by the guard checks out, much less the engineer that was supposed to be there too. It just makes zero fucking sense.

       Basically, they're saying that Campos reached the barricaded door at 6 minutes before the shooting, and reached the floor where the shooter was 6 minutes later. They don't specify when he was shot, just that he was shot before police arrived 12 minutes later (which means it could be anytime during the shooting).
      </p>
      <p>
       He gets pretty emotional, he talks about how offended he is that people think he's lying, he says people need to stop making conspiracy theories, officially says no one is lying.. it's worth a watch.

      <p>
       And an important part, they allowed no questions.

       I agree! no way he was just a security guard. He wasn't registered as one, he wasn't even in the database as working there. No one has really seen him. An independent journalist went to his house and it was being guarded by a private security company. These guys were clearly alphabet agents, the company's website was super shady. No traffic, address was for a virtual office, dud links to social media and no valid business license.

       If he was an illegal, the CEO would not be having his name in the database as the one who added him.  It would have been tagged with someone disposable and given the CEO plausible deniability.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, if the FBI or CIA  (or other) had approached them, saying they needed an operative on the system - to enable system security access and provide a cover.  Then the people who would have known would be limited to the top management, e.g. CEO and security head.  And they would be held to secrecy, probably under the Defense Secrets act.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except it looks like they might of done a little insider trading along the way.  But if held under the DS act, they are probably not legally allowed to disclose that anyway, save they indict themselves.  Convieniently.

       Award received in secret following covert or black op - but I'll take that back as it seems more like part of the charade to maintain that he was a security guard.
      </p>
      <p>
       He doesn't look too bad for a man who was recently shot at 200 times, taking one in the leg.
      </p>
      <p>
       He must have overdone it that night though, given he could not make it to his own press conference and had to check into a quick clinic before disappearing.

       That wouldn't be too crazy, especially if it was updated by HR. But it was updated by the CEO... which you can clearly see in the screen shots. It was either him, or someone logged in as him.

       Solid post with common sense. Yes people are absolutely insane if they don't think something seriously wrong is going on.

      <p>
       People who have been shot in the neck have been doing interviews on CNN..but the guy who supposedly took a bullet to the leg through a door can't do interviews. I guess he doesn't want to do a 60 minutes interview and make 6 figures. He must be balling on his salary. I need dat security guard money!!!!!

       6 figures for home movies of a lady in a story not as big as the Vegas shooting. This guard could make 250,000k easily. But I'm sure he is just sooooooo shocked and needs time to recover. Security guards make a killing!

        Also last week, ABC announced that Diane Sawyer had secured the first-ever interview with Jaycee Lee Dugard, the young woman held captive for 18 years in California. ABC declared that it had not paid any fee for the interview, but last year, according to a longtime ABC News executive aware of the deal, the network paid a six-figure sum for rights to home movies of Ms. Dugard.

       My apologies. I said the hardly line because I thought you were coming at me lol. My second part wasn't condescending to you at all but rather the shadiness of the situation in general.

       Gag order. If he's the only one that had contact with the shooter, then the authorities will prevent him from speaking about it because of an active investigation. Seems plausible.

       I think Campos is an agent, one of our guys, and we knew an attack was happening (hence him roaming Mandalay).  We stopped something bigger.  I fully do not believe that Paddock was supposed to be a shooter at all.  I think he was there to exchange guns for actual shooters.  Campos interfering changed the plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I think Campos probably got an award for his service but since he is probably an agent they are keeping real hush hush about all this.

       They claimed responsibility via a militant with the kunya/ nom de guerre Abu Abdul Bar al-Amriki, who they describe only as a 54 year old man (presumably American, judging by the name) who had converted 6 months prior. In the announcements they sent out, I have not seen them ever specify that AAB is Paddock; people have made and reported that assumption. And to be fair, it is a logical assumption - but the statement that is widely reported- that ISIS have claimed Paddock- is not accurate. They claimed some 54 year old guy who may or may not be him.

       Your wrong he has given a phone interview with ABC news. You said he has not given an interview to anyone at all. What's your reason for hating on him getting an award by a union that he works for? I'm sure he will talk in due time, but this is crazy that people are "blaming" him for what? Damn security guard was unarmed and got shot through a door then directed police to the room, but police have strict protocol getting others out before getting swat to breach the door due to not knowing at all if something is setup to explode or if another room has someone else waiting to kill them. Its not like you can  just run to the room enter and kill whosever inside in minutes. That's not reality.

       This guy is a hero who was shot a whole 6 minutes before the carnage started. A Las Vegas casino decided not to help him, or stop the shooting? LV casinos are more guarded than the Pentagon. They can tell when someone is counting fucking cards in their head, but can't help a supposedly unarmed security guard who was supposedly shot for no reason? They can't get there for over forty fucking minutes?
      </p>
      <p>
       They lied about why he was there (fire alarm from gun fire is not true given timeline), the FBI axed the FOX interview, and he's being kept from going on camera.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of that makes you wonder what the fuck is going on here? None of that makes you ask if he's actually a hero?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd put money on him being the second shooter, and the FBI knowing. I suspect they're playing dumb while they build their case. Keep him "safe" from the media, but really it's just them detaining him without him knowing.

       Your saying that in however many minutes is just enough time to do everything right given now you know a lot about this case. Imagine putting yourself in that situation not knowing anything and getting shot at while figuring out what is going on and if there could be more than one shooter in another room. Now your saying that they couldn't get there in 40 minutes. Do you realize that your dealing with more than one room at the Mandalay Bay? Do you know how many rooms are in that hotel? If you are being serious with these claims I think you need to wait a little longer and see what'll happen next. You just don't make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The alarm was not the fire alarm. It's the alarm from leaving a door open. Isn't that why he first went there? The guy couldn't even get to the room from the stairs because that was barricaded shut. So he had to enter from down the hallway which Stephen was watching with his camera he had setup on a food cart adjacent to his door. It makes sense to me. Not sure why everyone is having trouble understanding this or what people are choosing to believe over what not to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI didn't axe the interview. Give me proof on that. The security guard gave a phone interview with ABC news. I'm sure he will talk about what went on in person.

       Um, you will be removed from the casino within seconds if they think you're counting cards. Taking over 40 minutes for security to show up is absolutely significant.

       And there was a journalist, forget her name, who found out that the FBI axed. Seeing as she's been the only one

       You don't understand what I said, and that's okay. Security monitors card games in the casino they have cameras everywhere. Security doesn't monitor what goes on inside of a hotel room they don't have cameras all over inside of a hotel room. So that's why I'm arguing this. And if you wanna say "well how do you know they don't have cameras in all hotel rooms watching what people do?" Lol. Seriously?

       You don't understand what I said. The story is Jesus notified hotel security when he was shot. You're attesting that hotel security is so lax that it's not unreasonable for them to wait over 40 minutes to respond.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying that's extremely unreasonable, IMO, and certainly calls the current narrative into question

       Hotel security should never respond to an active shooter. Especially one who shot tons of bullets out of his door and luckily didn't kill this guy Campos. How do you know Paddock could have setup bombs to trip off. You need the swat team for this type of matter! What is hotel security gonna do? You don't understand protocol, and that's what has me questioning your thought process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Swat team breached the door. Why? It's so obvious that all of the proper steps BEFOREHAND were followed in their pursuit to MINIMIZE any sort of CASUALTIES inside the hotel. It's called being SAFE. Not amateur.

       It seems the opposite to me - If she's the only one doing any reporting then it is probably in her best interests to make the story sound exciting so she gets better ratings and more people want to click on her bait.

       I don't want to offend anyone with this comment and please HahThatsSilly please don't take it personally, as I am saying this is in a general sense-
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone truly considered that a reason why he may not be very public right now is because everyone is frustrated, angry and suspicious about the quality of information released, causing amongst other things lots of speculation, so being out in the public eye before an acceptable explanation has been given he's worried anything he says or does could cause people to form ideas and turn against him? 
Sorry that's a bit of a run on, but you know what I mean- This guy is allegedly just a regular security guard, never been in the spotlight and who knows how he comfortable he is with public speaking, and then suddenly he's a key person in the biggest mass shooting of modern times, thrust into the spotlight, his name and picture everywhere and everyone wants to speak to him- imagine how most would feel about that in itself! Most wouldn't go running towards the interviews even with $ because that's terrifying (public speaking is feared more than death studies have shown) - that in itself is a lot for anyone to handle, but he also has the traumatic experience that got him to this place... and if you've been shot at or seen someone get shot, you know how traumatic it is and how you don't know how you'll handle it until it happens to you. 
So all I'm saying is everyone frustrated about him not being more public, giving interviews, etc. just really truly stop and try to imagine what he must be going through and what the smartest thing to do would be- do you give interviews? Which may come with money but one wrong word, one nervous mannerism misinterpreted, any little mistake could result in assumptions being made that can and will ruin your life and put the safety of your family at risk as well. So yeah you could do that... or, you could lay low, focus on moving forward from the traumatic incident and staying safe which means staying out of the spotlight. 
We ALL want answers and we deserve them.  All I'm saying is remember the people involved in this that may hold some of those answers we want to badly are just that, people, regular people that are likely in survival mode themselves so let's channel our energy in the right places so we can get those answers.

       Maybe the guy has survivor's guilt and feels bad he didn't do more.
      </p>

       He did skip interviews and go to a clinic. He might have a hard time facing people because he feels he should have done something more and lots of people died.

       I'm new to this- had no conspiracy thoughts whatsoever on sandy hook, pulse, etc. I do believe the shooting in Vegas happened knowing people who were there- who both were and were not injured. I am very confused about the details of how many shooters there were, why campos is so out of the public, and why the family of the shooter is so strange. I feel like there had to be more violence in his past- hence the several moves. And gambling anywhere from 10-100k a night with the real estate income he had isn't kosher. I want to know what people in this thread think happened. I'm not laughing at tin hats- I'm thinking and I'm curious and I'm not getting the answers I want from msm

       Campos has nothing to gain by giving an interview. If he says the right things, he looks good. If he says the wrong things, he will be vilified and everyone will turn on him immediately, including the hotel management who will look for as many things to blame that aren't themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Compound that with all this confusion now of contradicting timelines, and this guy will be grilled on questions he probably doesn't even know the answer to. His name may be Jesus, but he doesn't need to be publicly crucified like this.

       What about a massive check from CNN/FOX/Dateline - whoever is getting to air this interview - he would probably get more for doing the interview than he makes in 2 years in regular job.

       That check will mean nothing if his statement somehow ends up with him getting sued by families of victims or the hotel. He will probably get a lot of money out of this through some settlement with the hotel. His lawyers are almost certainly telling him not to talk, and the guy is wisely listening to them.

      <p>
       It seems to be going by the original timeline.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        WHEREAS, as a first responder he approached a hotel suite
        <strong>
         where a gunman was firing automatic weapons into a crowded concert,
        </strong>
        and...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The wording makes it sound like the gunman was already firing on the crowd when Campos approached, but the revised timeline says that wasn't true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe the award was already made before the revised timeline came out, I guess.

       IMO the most likely thing is Campos has some mental defficiency. Perhaps bad social anxiety mixed with poor English skills. So he doesn't really want to speak and the hotel doesn't really want him to speak because he will not do a good job.

       I'm not totally writing off conspiracies with him. It's definitely possible. I just am waiting to see.

       He could of been 1 of the shooter's, He could of died in a gun fight and maybe our government is pretending like he's alive and a hero taking pic's so the other's involved get scared that he flipped and is working and maybe come out of the wood work to find him or have him killed. It's hard to tell honestly, our gov does some gangster shit I've seen with my own 2 eyes.

       If you got shot in the worst mass shooting in US history would you want the media all up in your shit broadcasting all of your identifying information to an emotional country looking to point at something or someone to blame for it? I sure as fuck wouldn't. That's probably why he's got limited media coverage. You can't just assume something is a cover up because it seems weird without looking at it from different angles

       The pics of him from the other day all have a  large and poorly photoshopped area on the right side of his forehead.  Earlier pictures do not have this anomaly or a scarring. Photoshopping over a bullet hole or traumatic injury maybe?

       The theory suggests that Campos and Paddock were both in the suite prior to anything happening and this would explain the ticket charged to Paddocks room just moments earlier with obviously more than one person in mind on the purchase receipt.

       Don’t believe anything being said about timelines and the events taking place during them. MGM knows exactly what took place as well as the FBI. The true evidence will never become public for civilians to see. The reason for this is because, Americans cannot know the truth about how dangerous it is becoming within their own country

       I have a good friend who lives in Las Vegas who knows some of the people who were injured and died. So you’re telling me my friend is lying to me? I know there have been hoaxes like Sandy Hook but this wasn’t a hoax. This was something else that I’m still trying to figure out just like everyone else questioning here.
