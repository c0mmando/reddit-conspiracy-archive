       I'll be honest, I don't consume as much British propaganda as the average Brit... but wasn't there a scandal involving every single corner of British government &amp; media covering up for one of the world's most connected and prolific child rapists for decades, that was exposed just recently?

       That case seems like regular old child abuse, not the systemic shit seen in other countries. Maybe there's a reason Iceland doesn't have that, they seem particularly resistant to corruption. They were like the only country that gave a shit about the Panama Papers.

       They brought up a very good point. This whole HW deal was probably ready to collapse before the election and a decision was made to keep it hidden because it would damage Hillary Clinton.

       If Trump hadn't been elected, we would have never heard about any of this.

       just saw a clip of it - and they also referenced Weiner and his wife, the IT dude, email servers,etc. etc. - Hilllary = controversy everywhere. Trainwrecks look up to her. And yet she can't fathom how she didn't win the election and blames that on the Russians.  Yeeeeshhh

       It's insane how Hillary and so many democrats are just burying their heads in the sand and screaming "BUT TRUMP!!!" rather than facing up to their mistakes. Every time she's spoken after the election, I think she's come across like a petulant child that genuinely believed she was entitled to be the president and had it stolen from her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Shit like this interview, calling out Trump for the potential sexual assault while dismissing Bill's because it's history. Especially since the Trump/Billy Bush tape is over a decade old as well. The hypocrisy is so obvious and everyone can see it unless their heads are completely in the sand too. It being in the past doesn't make what Bill did OK and it doesn't make Trump's comments OK, but as soon as she applies her rule to one but not the other she just comes across as bitter and vindictive and it makes her message worthless.

       That tape also doesn't prove sexual assault.  Trump is a multibillionaire, there are plenty of skanks who would love for him to grab their pussy.

       This is something I don't see often, despite thinking it myself.

      <p>
       I have not read the transcript, nor listened to the audio, does he say something akin to "I have just walked up and grabbed women by the pussy, because I'm rich and famous and they don't do anything about it." or more like "When you're as rich and famous as we are, women will basically let you walk up and grab them by the pussy."?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because one is more or less admitting assault, and the other is a commentary on women's freedom of choice.

       He was bragging about how women will just let him do anything since they want to be with him.  It's the only real dirt anyone could find on him so the media twisted it the best they could.  Fooled some people, but those people are easily fooled so it's not surprising.

       Yeah,  that's just not true.  Trump has ruined every business venture he has been involved in.  He went bankrupt so many times that American banks stopped lending him money because he would never pay it back.  That's when he started laundering Russian cash.  His entire family's wealth is based on lying,  cheating and stealing.  Trump is a con-man,  and you are his mark.

       Wait,  so you consider Trump University successful because he never filed for bankruptcy on it?  You know,  the one where he scammed Americans out of their life savings and then bribed the Florida AG so he wouldn't be prosecuted for it.  You've gotta be stupider than you sound if you think simply filing for bankruptcy is the only way to gauge how much of a lying con man failure Trump was at business.  Just wit till you see what Mueller has on him.  What am I saying,  we both know you'll keep sucking down trumps Maga Kool aid.

       I don't get the Trump university thing. When you went to that, you had like a week to get a refund if it wasn't for you. Maybe I'm uninformed on that particular case but what's the issue? By the way, that bribery complain you talked about was found to have insufficient evidence. Guess you're still drinking that kool-aide eh?

       Mueller? Yeah let's see where he's standing in a week. I hear even more is going to drop about his involvement with the uranium one scandal. You know he personally delivered the uranium sample to the Russians? This should get interesting...

       That rocktogether guy above commenting trump is dumb, why not just give more money to the banker elites he is saying above(index funds)? Seriously? Invest in index funds and do stuff with banks? I have a feeling rocktogether is just a random shill who wandered in here. Nobody in this sub should advocate for giving more money to banks, ffs rocktogether.

       I have been on conspiracy about 5 years. And I did not advocate it, I just stated that he would of had more money. He won't turn over his tax records, because he does not have the money he says he does. How the hell could someone on conspiracy support an elite like Trump. You must be some new jack shill.

       This is from 1990,  when the banks had to basically take control of his finances because he was such a shitty businessman.

       This would require you knowing your history of course,  which you have proven you don't,  but Trump even wrote a book about it,  where he lied and portrayed his complete failure at business in a more flattering light for him:
      </p>
      <p>
       "It was, the real estate developer admits in his 1997 book The Art of the Comeback, the darkest period of his professional life. In his telling, it’s a story of redemption, of resilience, and proof of his exceptional negotiating skills and shrewd thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Six people who participated in the loan workout negotiations have a different recollection, raising questions about a key part of the personal narrative that many of Trump’s supporters have found compelling as he campaigns to be the next president of the United States on Nov. 8. On the campaign trail he has portrayed himself as a survivor and a master negotiator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump says his comeback began when he recognized a downturn in the real estate market and quickly asked banks to renegotiate his loans. “That decision was perhaps the smartest thing I did,” he wrote.
      </p>
      <p>
       The six bankers and lawyers involved in the talks say the bailout wasn’t based on any overture Trump initiated with the banks – and the terms of the deal were dictated by what was best for the banks, not Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       Three of the participants say Trump didn’t acknowledge he had a problem until his lenders reviewed his books, realized he was on the brink of collapse, and summoned him for debt restructuring talks."

       You will find just by doing some of your own research,  that Trump has a long long history of scamming people.  Even his Children resorted to fraud at the Soho and might actually be in jail right now if it weren't for bribing the AG.

       Speaking of stupid people,  those are usually the people defending Trump without actually knowing anything, like you it seems.  Lets talk about how deep Ole Donnie is in with the Russian Mob now.  And how Russian Mob money helped build Trumps business empire

        You do realize Trump is enabled by a lot of politicians and corporate interests right? Why would they back him if he "ruined every venture he was involved in". Stop just saying things because they sound right to you, thats not how facts work, thats how stupid people work.

       Yep,  a lot of those politicians are either hoping they can use Trump to pass legislation that benefits them and a lot of them have taken lots of cash from Russian themselves.  And others helped Trump steal the election,  and know that if/when Trump ends up in Prison they probably will too.   Corporate interests are interested in getting their taxes lowered and regulations gone.   Its not hard to understand.   None of this good for the country or its people.

       Do you want to start with the Iraqi lives stolen during the continued Iraq war, or do you want to talk about the lives stolen (including civilians) during Obama's drone war? Do you want to talk about the Yemen lives stolen and continue to be stolen thanks to drone bombing and advanced weapons being given to Saudis? I'm sorry if you are clueless and don't count these because it doesn't involve trump, but these are very real instances. Not to mention Obama DOUBLING the national debt, thats stealing from the American people plain and simple. And as far as Trump and the Russians, you do realize there is tons of evidence coming out of Obama and the Clintons being involved in selling and being bribed in the Uranium One deal right?  ...but you don't want to talk about that  despite this entire board going crazy about that, you are going through cognative dissonance.

       Way to move those goalposts comrade.   We were talking about how Trump was a failed businessman and how his business empire was built on Russian mob money.   If you were actually interested in the truth you would be educating yourself on how Trump and his family are beholden to the Russian mob (Putin).
      </p>
      <p>
       Obamas use of Drones in the GWOT that he didn't start,  but inherited,  (Besides being a stupid comparison to Trumps corruption),  actually saved lives.  This is one of those topics that requires you to understand nuance and to think of the world we live in where things aren't always black and white.  If you are actually interested in educating yourself,  here are two links you can read.

       To compare the national debt to the way Trump has personally benefited from stealing from Americans is really stretching.  I'm beginning to think you aren't very serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now you wanna change topics and push the debunked uranium story even though I am quite certain its been explained to you already how its a bunch of BS.  This makes you deceitful and intellectually dishonest.  I'm not expecting to change your mind,  you don't seem to be actually interested in the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is,  Trump disdains the rule of law. He’s trampling norms of presidential behavior. And he’s bringing vital institutions down with him.  Putin couldn't have asked for a better bitch.

       Just because Hillary says a story is debunked doesn't make it true, please say that anywhere else on this board besides this dead thread and see what happens. "Saved lives" is such bullshit, thats only true if American troop on the ground lives are the only lives that exist, and guess what they aren't, there are millions of foreign lives as well that would take up issue with you saying they were "saved". And Obama didn't inherit a lot of these wars, he started new airstrike operations as well as expanded wars. Obama made trillions for weapons contractors, TRILLIONS, and Trump will continue that. Sounds like a great business man to me, just like Obama and Bush before him. Blood on all of their hands.

       Your dishonesty continues.   What Hillary has or hasn't said on the Debunked Uranium propaganda has nothing to do with the facts of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your inability to understand the nuance of using Drone Strikes and Special Forces over Ground Invasions is noted.   If you had actually tried to educate yourself on the facts,  you would see that the use of drones has actually saved CIVILIAN lives as well.  Again,  this would require you to use some critical thinking.   If you think simply doing nothing would be better,  then you'll have to explain that to the people that are routinely murdered and brutalized by terrorist groups like ISIS that would be continuing to kill CIVILIANS had we done nothing.   You have a very naive view on this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a problem with people who disagree with using drone strikes,  but at least educate yourself before you spout this bullshit.

       It's like I see how bad evangelic religions and crony capitalism are, and have always wanted to move away from it.

       A dozen women have accused Trump of sexual assault.  There is video testimony of a girl claiming that trumped raped her when she was 13.  There are witness depositions,  actual court documents of people who witnessed Trump raping a 13 year old girl.  There are many articles and witnesses to trump using the girls in his modeling agency as whores for parties.  There is substantial evidence that Trump was involved in trafficking women from eastern Europe/ Russia into his modeling agency,  for the purpose of being escorts/prostitutes.

       The mental gymnastics one has to do to pretend they're not buying into anti-American propaganda. If you believed Putin was working to destroy America, you would more logically believe he was behind this "Russia stole the election" fantasy. Just look around at how much damage this is doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides, not everyone forgot the left didn't even pretend to hide their disdain for America before they considered it "theirs" once obama came in and set up shop.

       Yeah,  Putin with the help of Trump and many members of the Republican party did steal the election.  The left doesn't have disdain for America,  it's the right wing idiots like yourself who keep pushing lies and Russian propoganda because it helps your political ideology.  You are being played.  Propaganda is similar to fast food,  easy and cheap to get, Makes you feel good for a moment but it Leaves you malnourished And ruins your country.  And yes,  Trump is ruining this country.  It's time for you to pull your head out your butt.

       I'm glad you brought up Wisconsin and Michigan,  since those were the two key states targeted by Russian Propoganda fake Facebook ads.  And here is the real fun part,  the Trump Campaign directed them to those states.  There is also some rather strange voting irregularities in Wisconsin and Michigan.  You ever wonder how the polling could be so wrong?   Well maybe it wasnt.  We will see the extent of Trumps Treason soon enough.

       Hahaha oh Lordy. How does that even make sense? So trump colluded with Vladimir himself to target those two states?  Why the fuck would he need some "From Russia with love " plot to spend 50 fucking grand on facebook ads? None of this makes any sense and it's so fallen apart that you can't even keep straight how this "collusion" was supposed to have occurred. You're wrong btw, the FBI has come out and said oops actually the voting rolls

       Don't get me wrong, best-case scenario he's a mental midget with pretty regressive and demeaning views on women. But the way the corporate media report on anything related to him is staggering, even for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Fake News" is used as a pejorative against people claiming the media is biased. It's a fairly reductionist phrase, but in essence, it's accurate. Can anyone argue with a straight face the mass media has reported accurately/fairly on him? Failing that, can you honestly argue the mass media reports fairly/accurately on everyone? Many people who think reporting on Trump is fair (or more absurdly, "too soft" on him) probably think coverage of Obama or Hillary was unfair. Either the media is slanted/biased, or it isn't. Truth and fairness isn't a "sometimes" thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the reporting on "Russian interference/collusion"; Glenn Greenwald (no Trump fan, by any stretch, but a solid journalist) did a piece on this a week or two back. The media breathlessly reports any possible "news" implicating Russia and/or Trump. The sources are always anonymous government agents, providing zero actual evidence, just allusions to unseen data. The media uncritically reports this as 100% accurate. Within days, upon the most basic investigation, the claims are disproved or without merit. The "correction/retraction" is usually just a minor update or note to the story, and they move on to the next manufactured (or at least overblown) "scandal". It's like they've given up on even attempting to keep up the illusion of journalistic integrity.

       Trump has a record of serial abuse of women extending farther Weinstein or Clinton and you flat out defend him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean he is a despicable human being without his sex acts, but come on.  I can't even imagine how you get to point in life where you see a man literally brag about being able to molest women and turn right around a condone him because he shares your political views.
      </p>
      <p>
       8 women have come forth with allegations against Weinstein.  11 accused Trump, whose legal defense was that he was

        too busy to be sued
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       And that doesn't count his cheating on multiple wifes, his rape of his wife, peeping on underage girls changing at a pageant, joking he would date his daughter, and literally hundreds of ridiculous tweets a day messages to media, friendships with all types of pedophiles and womanizers (Weinstein, Epstein), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       For subreddit that claims to care a lot about sexual abuse and pedophilia, there is a LOT of rationalizing and dismissing Trump's actions.

       All that has happened inside the DNC for the last few years is them trying their best to keep this promise and the public not playing ball.

       As I see it, the problem with Hillary, and with so many people who manage to weasel their way into power in this country, is that they don't believe in consent.  Whether it's the consent of the governed, or the consent of the owner of that body they're touching, they think that their power, money and influence make their wants more important than the consent of another.  This lack of respect for consent can be seen in everything from her slut-shaming the women who Bill harassed/slept with to her openly insulting anyone and everyone who didn't vote for her.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time she pretends to care about someone giving consent is when it's politically expedient for her.  Likely the only reason she's speaking out against Weinstein now is because not doing so threatens any political future she has left, and she waited days to see where the political winds fell before doing so - because she cares far more about the money and influence he can give her than the trauma he put so many through.  Hillary literally can't understand why no one voted for her, just like she literally can't understand the trauma of a sexually harassed or attacked woman, because she doesn't know what consent is.  It's the ultimate expression of entitlement.  It's disgusting, but you see it over and over and over again in politics.  And from what I've seen, most of Hillary's supporters share this same lack of understanding.

       You do realize most people think that people who use the term straw man are idiots right? They can't make an actual argument, so they overuse a term most don't even understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, are you people capable of independent thought? You all use the exact same (stupid) talking points, is like you spent the first half of your life learning to color by number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, just like the rest of you, you make false assumptions (that are usually wrong) about people who say anything negative about Trump. So I must be anti Trump? And on the left?
      </p>
      <p>
       Sure, go through my comment history, see me educating people about gun laws yesterday, referring to my liberal friend that owns 8 guns.. make assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       But do tell me, what political figure is it on the left that's advocating for 5 year old trans kids? I'd love a quote, so I don't vote for that person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you talking about that
       <em>
        1 individual person
       </em>
       who thinks they know what's best for their child, that no politician came out in support for. And if I'm wrong, please, show me this person who represents

       Well, he's kind of in a position where he can't really denounce it without looking like a total tool.. but I'll look into it. I don't think that shit is right, kids should be allowed to be kids, and not make choices before they're old enough to really decide, or have something so important decided for them
      </p>
      <p>
       But just like Antivaxers, I don't think it's on anyone else to tell someone how to raise their kids. Let people make bad choices, and suffer bad consequences. Trust me, I know plenty of liberals that Saw that shit and recoiled, even my parents.

       Defense attorneys are supposed to defend their clients to best of their ability. You're asking for a shithole society if you think people shouldn't get a proper defence.

       The problem is that she's also a politician. You can't claim moral authority over somebody else if your own morals bend for a dollar value, in this case, legally in the same subject.

       Providing a defense at the request of a judge is the morally superior position.  You are supporting a system where everyone has a right to a defense.

       Yes, everyone has a right to an attorney, it's a compromise we make within our legal system so that courts don't convict innocent people of crimes they didn't commit. The convicted child rapist asked specifically for a female attorney to represent on appeal because he knew the psychological effect it could have on the courts. She was under no legal obligation to be that female attorney, she could have easily cited conflict of interest just based on the fact he requested a female attorney and she said yes is creepy as fuck. No convicted criminal is entitled to choose the sex of their lawyer, yet she aquiesed to his demands and now sits in an interview and calls the president of the united states a sexual deviant while screening pussy power at the end of a career built on the coattails of her infamous husband. Give me a fucking break.

       I agree with you as far as a lawyer's job is to do everything legally possible for there client.
The more damning part to me is she seems to have no remorse about it and is even recorded laughing about it after the trial.

       Sorry I'm late. But seriously dude I never said anything like you accuse of me of, but my response was long will deduct enough that anyone skimming through would never read it thoroughly but they will read your little bullshit answer and if it confirms there own confirmation bias, they'll nod their precious little noggin and downvote me and upvote you even though your answer is completely full of shit and you know it. At least I hope u know it, cause if u don't then you should know dude, reading comprehension is critical and shit. But then again, that's just like my opinion, man.

       I'm saying there should be a verdict reached and then a hearing on the issues at hand and determine if those issues did affect the rights of the defense, not just the judges decision. This way the arguments can be made and documented for both sides.

       Stand down orders for benghazi, discrediting of rape victims of bill Clinton, money laundering, selling state information, illegally selling weapons, embezzling money from relief efforts, manipulation of the democratic primary system, murder.

       You mind is warped by emotion,  that you can't argue facts.  Hillary is no saint,  but you clearly lack the capacity to judge her based on your inability to look at each issue objectively.  You are forgoing facts in this case because of those other issues,  but if you are willing to forgo facts here,  everything you believe is suspect.

       That should also apply to the district attorney. They should prosecute and let the defense do their job. If there's no case then the defense has an easy job. If there was a crime committed the evidence should be brought to light. Victims rights are my argument. They have as much right to accuse as someone has to defend. This is what let's pedos and rapist run wild as long as they have the money to pay for good attorneys.

       She could have worked as hard to recuse herself from the case as she did to get him off the hook. She didn't have to go on a radio interview and brag about it in a fake southern accent while cackling about how clever she for by exploiting a technicality in our legal system to get the W and showing absolutely no remorse for the victim. She could have kept tabs on the young girl and maybe even offered some assistance to help her with the struggles she faces for the rest of her life. Deplorable indeed.

       She should be expected to do any of those things.  A defense attorneys job is to use the law to the best of their ability to defend their client.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is an absolute must for a civil society.  Do you want the lawyers deciding who and who isnt qualified to be defended in court?  Asking them to jump through a bunch of moral hoops to do their job will degrade the quality of their work.
      </p>
      <p>
       No,  the moral position for society and her to take is to support a moral justice system.  Denying people the right to a fair defense is an immoral action.  Defense attorneys are doing a moral service.

       I'm sure there's a ton of blackmail that can be used on him. He's been a congressman for decades. If he was blackmailed, it's because he allowed for it in exchange for wealth and political power. Bernie is dirty!!

       He seems to care very deeply about his wife and brother. A simple threat against their well being would make Bernie fold like origami. I personally believe this is what happened just before the democratic convention. Around the same time DWS stepped down.
      </p>

       Does that exonerate him from letting down millions of followers who actually believed in his message? Maybe not, but I can't say I would have done any different if Hillary had threatened the well being of my loved ones.

       Congress is a giant mud pit. It's hard to believe anyone could spend any amount of time in there without emerging filthy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if Bernie is as squeaky clean as he appears, however, I believe his net worth speaks for itself. In 2014 he had a net worth of approx $430,000. After so many years in congress.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is now worth over a million due to book royalties, but I find it very interesting that someone could spend more than two decades in congress (16 years in the house and in the senate since 2006) with a net worth under 500k. I believe you'd be hard pressed to find another senate or house member with a net worth that low.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm still holding out hope that there is some logical reason Bernie betrayed us. His campaign was the first time in a very long time I actually had hope that the American oligarchy could be challenged and even defeated. It's hard to let go of that dream and accept that it was just another elaborate ruse.

       how quickly and quietly he folded &amp; immediately attempted rallying his base to support Hillary made it feel like he was in on it from day one. he could have fought, and if he had everything might be different. instead, his purpose was to rally the segment of the population that wanted Bernie into voting for Hillary. instead, many of those Bernie supporters flipped to Trump instead, because one of the central issues for Bernie supporters was "Anything but Hillary," which they shared in common with Trump.

       i'm surprised you've never heard this before... it was the hivemind's interpretation of events at the time, as they were unfolding. Reddit and the internet at large were all-in on Bernie until this debacle... and then everything changed.

       it's around that time period that Reddit got really weird. shareblue, cambridge analytica, the women's march, BLM, Russians, the morphing of T_D from meme-factory to weird idolatry propaganda machine, the censoring of T_D and rise of inorganic anti-Trump subs, the attacks on this subreddit...

       nah, youve got it twisted. its obvious that the DNC chose to put Hillary in the general.  Bernie never really had a chance against them, but that doesn't mean he was a stooge.  he campaigned  his ass off and went around the country filling arenas and creating a huge movement that was straight up ignored by the DNC.  he didnt GIVE her shit, she took it from him. the DNC took it from him.  should he have fought harder against the corruption that took him out of the race? YES! but he wasn't a stooge...what would have been the point?  for him to bring all these progressive ideas into the forefront of the political discussion and then to hand over the nomination to someone who wasn't on-board with his motivations?  it doesn't make sense at all.

       Admitting sexual assault? So if a woman is interested in me and approaches me and then I touch her completely consensually that's sexual assault? Keep reaching, you don't have a leg to stand on. People really don't understand the difference anymore, and that's sad. Maybe that's why people like Weinstein are able to get away with it for so long because idiots like you are more worried about people talking about it then people actually doing it.

       Lol did anybody pick up on how stupid her last statement was. She talked about how Trump shook Theresa May's hand but wouldn't shake Merkel's hand and that this was misogynistic and sexist..if a man didn't like another man he might avoid shaking his hand..don't women want to be treated the same way?

       Don't kid yourself though, the reason this was swept under the rug was Bill Clinton's involvement. They knew they couldn't call attention to Trump riding the Lolita Express without showing the Clinton's hypocrisy.

       A real conspiracy wouldn't be a theory would it? He was friends with the head of a pedo ring. He was accused along with him. He rode his pedo plane at least once according to Epstein's brother. He lied about being such close friends. He's been accused of strange and illegal sex acts with minors and prostitues and is on the record talking about how aggressively he pursues women. And now he's the leader of the free world and untouchable.

       The case vanished. Altright conspiracy fans prefer more far fetched theories about pizza.  These are facts.

       To go into actual theories it's been said that Trump's modeling agency and pageant connections would easily allow him to traffic in women from Eastern Europe as well as possess knowledge t blackmail powerful world leaders and businessmen who partook. His "billionaire"many presidential status affords him great power.

       Consent is two parties agreeing to do something. Not stopping something from happening isnt the same as agreeing to do something. Example: Trump is rich, has powerful friends, and has enough fuck you money to sue you into the ground so you better not do anything to stop his advances because of the implications.

       So if your working class it's consent?  Is that why he said he failed with the married lady he took furniture shopping?  Let's not act like there are not some women who are digging for gold.  His wife is called that daily.  It doesn't imply it's not consensual either.  It implies he's a perv.

       I am sorry you are trying so hard to defend him. But he doesnt make that distinction. He says "when you are rich the let you do anything". No that "when they are attracted to you the let you do anything".

       This is your daily reminder that MaraLago member, billionaire and convicted pedo pimp Jeffery Epstein was very close friends with Trump who played in tennis tournaments with him, road his airplane dubbed the "Lolita Express" (along with Bill Clinton) ate dinner at his house and trusted him with all of his personal contact/security numbers which were found in a special section of Epstein's Rolodex.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Epstein himself claimed the 5th when asked to testify as to Trump's involvement with the pedo ring his brother testified Trump was on the plane but the manifests showing that are gone. I guess being the most powerful billionaire in the world has its perks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump and Epstein would later be named when a girl came forward to say she was raped by at age 13 by The Donald and Epstein facilitated it. That case disappeared too.
      </p>
      <p>
       While Trump lied about his relationship with the convicted sex offender thankfully his 2002 interview shows the truth:
      </p>
      <p>
       After calling him a "terrific guy" and friend of "15 years" Trump said
"he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it" which needs no explanation.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes I agree. Comparing Weinstein to Trump is a stretch unless Harvey likes them young.

       He seems to care very deeply about his wife and brother. A simple threat against their well being would make Bernie fold like origami. I personally believe this is what happened just before the democratic convention. Around the same time DWS stepped down.

       Does that exonerate him from letting down millions of followers who actually believed in his message? Maybe not, but I can't say I would have done any different if Hillary had threatened the well being of my loved ones.

       It's like I see how bad evangelic religions and crony capitalism are, and have always wanted to move away from it.  But the left nowadays is the worst at crony-capitalism and has there own SJW religion to shove down throats.  And then they say they're fighting the evangelicals and extortionists.  The hypocrisy is Disgusting.   Atleast the GOP tells you loud and clear they plan to fuck you.  The dems try to act like they're looking out for us.  I hate it!

       She could have worked as hard to recuse herself from the case as she did to get him off the hook. She didn't have to go on a radio interview and brag about it in a fake southern accent while cackling about how clever she for by exploiting a technicality in our legal system to get the W and showing absolutely no remorse for the victim. She could have kept tabs on the young girl and maybe even offered some assistance to help her with the struggles she faces for the rest of her life. Deplorable indeed.

       Just because Hillary says a story is debunked doesn't make it true, please say that anywhere else on this board besides this dead thread and see what happens. "Saved lives" is such bullshit, thats only true if American troop on the ground lives are the only lives that exist, and guess what they aren't, there are millions of foreign lives as well that would take up issue with you saying they were "saved". And Obama didn't inherit a lot of these wars, he started new airstrike operations as well as expanded wars. Obama made trillions for weapons contractors, TRILLIONS, and Trump will continue that. Sounds like a great business man to me, just like Obama and Bush before him. Blood on all of their hands.

       Your dishonesty continues.   What Hillary has or hasn't said on the Debunked Uranium propaganda has nothing to do with the facts of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your inability to understand the nuance of using Drone Strikes and Special Forces over Ground Invasions is noted.   If you had actually tried to educate yourself on the facts,  you would see that the use of drones has actually saved CIVILIAN lives as well.  Again,  this would require you to use some critical thinking.   If you think simply doing nothing would be better,  then you'll have to explain that to the people that are routinely murdered and brutalized by terrorist groups like ISIS that would be continuing to kill CIVILIANS had we done nothing.   You have a very naive view on this issue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't have a problem with people who disagree with using drone strikes,  but at least educate yourself before you spout this bullshit.
