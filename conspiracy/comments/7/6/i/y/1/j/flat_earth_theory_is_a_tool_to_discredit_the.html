        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry if this has been posted before. I am new to this subreddit, though not to conspiracies. BTW, I&#39;m not trying to distract from Vegas which seems to be priority number one right now. </p>

<p>I have had this idea for awhile but what prompted me to post was this comic in r/politicalhumor: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/766ngv/its_a_conspiracy/">https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalHumor/comments/766ngv/its_a_conspiracy/</a></p>

<p>I find it interesting how people tend to make blanket dismissals of all alternative theories by lumping weaker theories and stronger theories together so that the really crappy theories tarnish the reputation of the good theories by association. I recently saw a friend post about Vegas conspiracy theories on fb and one of his other friends mocked him by posting something about flat earth. I&#39;ve seen this happen more than once! Awhile ago I thought, wow Flat Earth makes the ultimate discrediting engine against the entire conspiracy movement.</p>

<p>I have tried to research the origins but have not found any direct connections that Flat Earth is a PsyOp. I have found others who think similar to me though.</p>

<p>I would appreciate hearing your thoughts on this idea and if you think it is worth looking into more? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah there&#39;s a lot of psychology being used.</p>

<p>Even in that comic they mention a lot of legitimate investigatable conspiracy in with nonsense so you equate them all as nonsense.</p>

<p>Flat earth is easy to disprove but a great psyop since I imagine they rope in a lot of creationists etc. Which give it steam.</p>

<p>Other times they can take legit conspiracy and slide or subvert the message essentially setting up a strawman; this has happened with Monsanto Gmo&#39;s and health concerns around vaccines pushed through by the Fda.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find it somewhat annoying to see pseudo sciences poppin&#39; up so much in this sub.  But I do believe earth ain&#39;t a perfect sphere.. I think Earth is more oval; or pear shape. Tomorrow we might find out more with that announcement about those gravitational waves! Personally quite excited over said announcement :) Since that theory seems to check out; it only makes sense that it has stretched Earth. Which is why I think it&#39;s more pear shape than a sphere.. </p>

<p>Thats how knowledge works... Dont get pissed at me because you havent studied every facet of every science. Im willing to bet you never bothered to do research into virology or bacteria but you most likely believe they exist. Im also willing to bet you have never been behind the wheel of an electron microscope but you probably dont think computers are magical. Have you ever seen an electron move through a logic gate in a CPU? How can you know for sure that is whats happening? Youve never bothered to look deeply into it have you, but you still believe that bacteria is real and your computer is powered by pixie dust, right? </p>

<p>Show me how you calculated the shape of the Earth and why your methodology is superior. </p>

<p>I know more about this than you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The fact that you are trying to discredit the flat earth movement for being a tool to discredit &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; on a whole is absurd.  What you have done, like many people, is been able to see the falsehood of an narrative given to you by your government(Vegas).  This is good, however what you and many people tend to do is fail to connect the dots and see how it and MANY (not all) conspiracies are actually connected together.  And what I mean by that is if you look into the Apollo 11 moon landing and see how it was indeed faked (just like all NASA propaganda) you will then wonder why?  This will lead you to the cusp of the rabbit hole of truth.  If you are hung up on flat earth being false that is fine (for now) but continue to research and use your common sense to further educate yourself on the other branches of Conspiracy.  Once you have exposed enough truths you will be able to understand some truths you refused to see.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe Flat Earth is deliberately there to discredit legitimate theories, yes. I investigated the Flat Earth thing because once I&#39;d workedout I&#39;d been lied to by the media about everything, I was genuinely like &#39;anything could be true.&#39; So I looked into it, and I think Flat Earth is different from legitimate theories in a number of ways.</p>

<p>The biggest thing about Flat Earth that first of all suggests it just isn&#39;t at all true, just from a reasoning stand point (not even looking at all the evidence of a spherical Earth, of which there is an enormous amount) is that there would be nothing to gain from lying about the shape of the earth. The shape of the earth has not impact on anyone&#39;s day to day life, it doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s round or flat, there&#39;s no reason to lie about it, much less expend inordinate resources and manpower on keeping the lie going for centuries. The only explanation I ever get when I point this out, is that it&#39;s to convince us that god isn&#39;t real. Which is ridiculous, because why does a round earth mean god isn&#39;t real? The two things aren&#39;t mutually exclusive and billions of people believe in God while accpeting that the planet is round.</p>

<p>Secondly, the number of people who pressure alternative media to talk about Flat Earth is insane. So many channels on You Tube who report on genuine conspiracies and genuine state crimes and genuine lies end up feeling they have to mention something about Flat Earth to capitulate to the number of comments they get from people telling them they&#39;re shit or they aren&#39;t really telling the truth etc, because they&#39;re not talking abotu Flat Earth, which obviously makes some YouTubers feel they have to address the subject, even if they find it ridiculous, because they&#39;re seeing so many comments about it and they fear losing subscribers. No other &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; gets so much of this in Youtube comments as does Flat Earth, and that leads me to belive that it&#39;s deliberately there to both force legitimate channels into mentioning it and also so that &#39;normies&#39; who might be thinking &#39;hey this guy/gal is onto something&#39; will then look at the comments and see that this is the type of people who watch and believe this stuff, and will automatically retreat from opening their minds and dismiss everything else the channel puts out, or similar channels talking about other &#39;conspiracy&#39; issues, tarring it all with the same brush. The brush of being insane and having lost your grip on reality to such an extent that you believe the government will lie to you about absolutely anything, <em>just for the sake of lying.</em> because if Flat Earth were true, that is what would be going on - TPTB would be lying about the shape of the Earth just for the sake of it. So of course it&#39;s insane, and people are driven away from legitimate subjects by the mention of it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are some people who really believe it&#39;s true, but they must be people who&#39;ve never gone in a plane or thought very hard about it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s see the enormous amount of evidence for a sphere earth. This is one of the things flat earthers debate. The lots of accepted and unquestioned facts about the sphere model, or heliocentrism fall apart under scrutiny. And the sphere earthers do the least amount of work to prove their own theories, just accept it as a unconditional fact. And then project their own absolute trust in the theory to find faults in the flat earth community. Not every one trusts the same things. Though it&#39;s not the flat earthers fault they exist I. World where people do just blindly accept what they are shown, and can&#39;t fathom they would be being lied to on a mass scale. Ironically when on a forum that&#39;s sole purpose is to expose how we are being lied to on a mass scale.</p>

<p>Is the possibility that the earth is flat a Frightening concept to some? Personally I find the current Theories in play that are accepted to be frightening, and detrimental to the human consciousness. Evolution, big bang, and heliocentrism, in addition to a fake space agency has a actually made the world a dystopian perception.</p>

<p>Such as? I find FE debaters seem to confuse holes with the current model and simply not being educated on the subject. </p>

<p>Whats the biggest flaw with the Spherical heliocentric model?</p>

<p>I would argue that we dont need NASA or the government to understand the shape of our Earth. </p>

<p>Then add to that we have multiple private space corporations who corroborate the current paradigm. If the world were flat you would think the power that be would discourage space travel as much as possible, not hand out contracts to source the next generation of rockets. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>It frightens me that people can research the Earth to the level we have now and still think the earth is flat. That is what scares me about the FE movement. </p>

<p>Control. They get to control the &quot;truth&quot; and it will then allow them to construct the knowledge of the future as they see fit. Hence the systemic corruption of institutions such as education, science and politics. </p>
