<h1><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/elijah-wood-claims-hollywood-is-gripped-by-a-jimmy-savile-style-sex-abuse-scandal-a7042241.html">[May 2016] Elijah Wood claims Hollywood is gripped by a Jimmy Savile style sex abuse scandal</a></h1>

<blockquote>
<p>Elijah Wood claims Hollywood is in the grip of a child sexual abuse scandal similar to that of Jimmy Savile in the UK.</p>

<p>The 35-year-old said paedophiles were shielded by powerful figures in the film industry and claimed that the abuse was organised.</p>

<p>He said his mother protected him from abuse when he arrived in Hollywood at the age of eight and he didn’t attend the type of parties where such incidents occurred.</p>

<p>“You all grew up with Savile – Jesus, it must have been devastating,” he told The Sunday Times. “Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organised”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/8u6FdyCDXdY?t=13s">link to video</a></p>

<p>Natasha Leggero asked Courtney Love if she had any advice for young actresses trying to make it big in Hollywood. According to TMZ, Courtney hesitated for a moment before speaking out for fear of a lawsuit. Then she proceeded anyway.</p>

<p>“I’ll get libeled if I say it,” Courtney Love began. “If Harvey Weinstein invites you to a private party in the Four Seasons, don’t go.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a video unearthed by the Daily Wire, back in 2013 Feldman appeared on an episode of &quot;The View,&quot; where he once again claimed to have been the victim of sexual abuse for years. For saying this, then-host Barbara Walters accused Feldman of &quot;damaging an entire industry&quot; with his claims. Walters appeared to dismiss Feldman outright.</p>

<p>[...] This is absolutely not how a survivor of sexual abuse should be treated. While claims of pedophile rings preying on famous child actors may seem like something from a conspiracy theory website, in light of recent revelations about Harvey Weinstein, they&#39;re more than just a little plausible now. And given that seemingly everyone in Hollywood knew for years about Weinstein&#39;s predatory nature, it&#39;s mind-boggling how Walters, a seasoned industry professional, can respond so callously to Feldman&#39;s very serious accusation. </p>

<p>^ if anyone can find a direct source for this, especially video, I would appreciate it. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1dBZxsmG3M">Angelina Jolie secretly filmed talking about ritual abuse</a></p>

<p>^ pending confirmation. it&#39;s an obviously edited video, and people are telling me to watch the unedited version, but having trouble finding it. anyone have a link?</p>
