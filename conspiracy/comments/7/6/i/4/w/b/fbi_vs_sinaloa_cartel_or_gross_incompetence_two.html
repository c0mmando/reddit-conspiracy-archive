        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Our biggest clue that the shooting was cartel related is Jesus Campos. From mixing up his story, to bailing on interviews, to going missing, it is obvious Jesus is either an agent, an informant, or an accomplice.</p>

<p>The FBI is known for aggressively recruiting informants. They find their informants by arresting them for certain charges and offering them a chance out of the charges by being an informant to them. This privilege is only bestowed to people they believe have high connections to their targets, not some random criminal with no ties. The FBI stalks potential informants, searching their homes, bugging their cars and neighborhood, basically making their life hell until they accept the offer. Jesus could&#39;ve been a direct agent working for the FBI, but it is more likely he was an informant now turned against the Sinaloa cartel. </p>

<p>The FBI is not going to use an Arab informant to catch cartel members, they are also not going to use Latino informants to catch ISIS. Jesus Campos as the agent or informant and being a Latino, implies heavily that we are dealing with aspects of the cartel and not ISIS. </p>

<p>The Sinaloa cartel does have a presence in Las Vegas: </p>

<p><a href="https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/aug/07/mexican-drug-cartels-try-establish-direct-ties-las/">https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2012/aug/07/mexican-drug-cartels-try-establish-direct-ties-las/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/t/newsmax/article/447942?section=US&amp;amp;keywords=mexican-drug-cartel-las-vegas&amp;amp;year=2012&amp;amp;month=08&amp;amp;date=08&amp;amp;id=447942&amp;amp;aliaspath=%2FManage%2FArticles%2FTemplate-Main">http://www.newsmax.com/t/newsmax/article/447942?section=US&amp;amp;keywords=mexican-drug-cartel-las-vegas&amp;amp;year=2012&amp;amp;month=08&amp;amp;date=08&amp;amp;id=447942&amp;amp;aliaspath=%2FManage%2FArticles%2FTemplate-Main</a></p>

<p>The Sinaloa cartel is also at war with the FBI: </p>

<p>The FBI has arrested 22 cartel members in a sting: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.ae/amp/www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-sinaloa-indictment-20170609-story,amp.html">https://www.google.ae/amp/www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-sinaloa-indictment-20170609-story,amp.html</a></p>

<p>It would be interesting to know if Jesus Campos was involved in any of these arrests and was turned, and given the name Jesus Campos by the FBI for the media. While his real name is different. </p>

<p>The son of the leader of the Sinaloa cartel was recently indicted in the US: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.ae/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/damaso-lopez-serrano-indicted-u-s-drug-charges-mexico-cartel/">https://www.google.ae/amp/s/www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/damaso-lopez-serrano-indicted-u-s-drug-charges-mexico-cartel/</a></p>

<p>Look at the dates on those links? July and August 2017. Recent. </p>

<p>The Sinaloa cartel might be lashing back here as revenge, or they intend to use the Las Vegas shooting as a bargaining chip by exposing the FBI&#39;s incompetence in this specific sting. Basically blackmail the FBI against the American public.</p>

<p>The FBI is obviously in panic control mode right now. I believe they were outsmarted and outdone by the cartel here.</p>

<p>I believe the picture of Paddock dead was purposely leaked to reaffirm their lone wolf narrative. I also believe his car was planted with the explosives to further reaffirm he was a lone wolf with a plan of destruction. </p>

<p>One of the first parts of the FBI narrative to come out was that the stairwell was sealed shut by Paddock. This was discovered by Jesus Campos. Nobody has questioned why he was in the stair well to begin with. He gets called for a door alarm and takes 32 stairs up to check it out? Doesn&#39;t make sense. They want us to believe the stair well was shut for a reason.</p>

<p>What&#39;s important is that there are NO CAMERAS in the stair well. This was the exit for the shooters. And the FBI told us it was blocked off, as one of the FIRST pieces of info in their narrative to show nobody could&#39;ve possibly escaped.</p>

<p>The FBI fed us this locked stairwell narrative to show that if there was any other shooters they would be locked up on the 32nd floor and could only take the elevator down--in which case they would be caught on camera and met by police downstairs. </p>

<p>Also, Campos never tells any police that the stair well door was shut down. It&#39;s never radioed in. It was the closest door to Paddocks room. One would think this would be critical information to have during the shooting yet nobody hears about it until after the shooting. </p>

<p>No cameras in stairwell are mentioned here in Bellagio: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.ae/amp/nypost.com/2013/10/08/big-brother-is-watching-you-in-vegas-except-in-hotel-hallways/amp/">https://www.google.ae/amp/nypost.com/2013/10/08/big-brother-is-watching-you-in-vegas-except-in-hotel-hallways/amp/</a></p>

<p>Would be safe to assume there were no cameras in the stairwell in the Mandalay Bay as well. </p>

<p>They could&#39;ve easily left trough here, down a few stairs, and back into the hall ways and rooms they would&#39;ve checked into. Absolutely no camera would be able to catch this. The FBI knows this, so they give us the narrative that the stairs were locked to let people know this couldn&#39;t happen. It was one of the FIRST things they told us, for good reason. It squashes the extra shooters exiting in the stairwell idea. The only other outlet is the elevator which has cameras, or visibly dead bodies. We have neither videos of people escaping in elevators or pictures of dead bodies on the 32nd floor. So they tell us the stairwell was &quot;shut dow&quot; as well. The only remaining exit the extra shooters would most likely use. Thus reaffirming Paddock was a lone wolf. </p>

<p>They also say Paddock intended to escape. How would locking a stairwell door shut help him escape in a fluid situation of a shooting? He would&#39;ve wanted to keep all exits open... Especially the ONE EXIT without a camera to follow him in those most critical minutes after the shooting. </p>

<p>This is what I believe happened. The Sinaloa cartel is thirsty for revenge or a bargaining chip as they are being attacked by the FBI. They might&#39;ve even known Campos had turned in a recent arrest and use this to their advantage. He could&#39;ve even been a double agent still working for the cartel. </p>

<p>The cartel finally contacts (or finally responds) to an FBI&#39;s attempt to sell them guns. Jesus could&#39;ve been this person contacted. </p>

<p>The FBI has been known in the past to use fake bombs and fake guns in these stings, but such a high level sting would need live guns as assurance they are &quot;not FBI.&quot; </p>

<p>I think the cartel somehow persuades the FBI into believing this gun deal is not an actual deal yet, but a viewing of the merchandise. As such, the cartel would only be sending 1 or 2 people to view the merchandise to make sure the dealer could deliver and in the large amounts needed. Very manageable for the FBI if things go haywire if they were expecting 1 or 2 people. The FBI could&#39;ve had agents in the next room for support, and they would&#39;ve been monitoring the room from surveillance vans outside. As such they thought it was a controlled environment and decided it&#39;s best to use &quot;live&quot; merchandise as a showcase to the potential buyer, so they don&#39;t blow their cover down the line when the real deal happens. I think the cartel verified with Campos that all the guns were in place along with ammo. </p>

<p>Here is where I think things went haywire. There were many cartel members staying at the Mandalay Bay that night unbeknownst to the FBI. </p>

<p>As Jesus and Paddock are in room 32 waiting for the 1 or 2 guys to meet them there, there&#39;s a handful of cartel members lining up in the stair well with ski masks and probably heavy duty weapons (machine guns) ready for the ambush. The cartel members ambush Paddocks room, and instantly the FBI realizes they have messed up. They may have a few agents in the next room in that floor but they are told to stand down as it would be a suicide mission with more dead agent bodies in the hotel floor which would completely give it away that it was an FBI sting to the public. The cartel kills Paddock, and shoots Jesus in the leg and lets him go. As he&#39;s running away he sees the maintenance worker. This is when the shots open fire through the door. The cartel intended to kill the maintenance worker. </p>

<p>The cartel members finish the spree, and in the chaos escape through the stairwell and back into their floors and into their rooms. I don&#39;t think they would be able to bring their own weapons into the hotel unless they actually checked in with suitcases, let alone escape with heavy duty weapons. Plus there would be cameras catching them running away if they didn&#39;t simply stay inside the Mandalay Bay and leave when things winded down the next day or later that night. I also believe the FBI told agents and cops to stand down from engaging the cartel members staying in the hotel, as this would be a blood bath and confirm a bunch of dead Cartel members along with a dead old white male with a secret life (basically they would blow their cover if they pursued the cartel members inside the hotel). The American public would go nuts. They let them escape and do their best to monitor them. Be on the lookout for any arrests made of Sinaloa cartel members in these last few days and coming days. These might be the shooters. </p>

<p>Campos is in custody. He is being hidden. </p>

<p>Campos is probably fearing for his life from both sides, the Cartel, and FBI. He scheduled an interview with Hannity because he must have a narrative that supports Trumps views as Hannity is extremely pro Trump. What does he have to say? </p>

<p>That cartels are active in the US and responsible for the worst mass shooting in US history supporting Trumps wall and anti immigration stance. And that the FBI was involved showing the FBI to be incompetent who have been after Trump. </p>

<p>Campos has probably been stopped from speaking to anyone and thus why he is missing now. FBI does not trust him to give any interviews or speak with anyone. </p>

<p>I think the only other possible explanation for the discrepancies is that gross incompetence on the part of the LVMPD, Mandalay Bay, and FBI. They are all covering up for each other. </p>

<p>Basically FBI had reason to believe Paddock was planing an attack, and he was under their surveillance, but they didn&#39;t stop it due to incompetence, so their hands are dirty and if this gets out it would be terrible for the FBI. </p>

<p>Mandalay Bay didn&#39;t call police for minutes after Paddock shot at Campos, BUT, they did call before he shot into the crowd. So their lack of quickest response possible had their hands dirty with litigation. </p>

<p>And the LVMPD--that a cop or two from the LVMPD were on the 32nd floor in time before the shooting started into the crowd, but knowing he had what was thought automatic weapons at the time, they didn&#39;t dare approach the door as it sit would be suicide. The image that cops were on the floor while Paddock shot at citizens would ruin the LVMPD. Each one is covering for the other, FBI, LVMPD, and Mandalay Bay. </p>

<p>When the narrative tried to throw Mandalay Bay under the bus, MB responded full well knowing FBI and LVMPD were to blame for incompetence as well, so they didn&#39;t hesitate to defend themselves. LVMPD and FBI then change the narrative again so that they are all clear from this disaster. Campos knows they all messed up in their response and that&#39;s why he&#39;s being hidden and there&#39;s discrepancies in his story. He&#39;s probably extremely nervous and not trusted enough to be capable of giving interviews with their narrative. </p>

<p>The FBI takes the lead and sends everyone on a wild goose chase for extra shooters, agents, informants, meanwhile taking attention away from the simple matter that there was gross incompetence on all sides involved in responding to the shooter. </p>

<p>That or cartel. Can&#39;t decide. </p>

<p>&quot;The cartel kills Paddock, and shoots Jesus in the leg and lets him go. As he&#39;s running away he sees the maintenance worker. This is when the shots open fire through the door. The cartel intended to kill the maintenance worker.&quot;  </p>

<p>uhhh yeah cartel&#39;s dont let people go who double cross them, but randomly try shoot a maintenance worker.</p>

<p>&quot; I don&#39;t think they would be able to bring their own weapons into the hotel unless they actually checked in with suitcases, let alone escape with heavy duty weapons.&quot;</p>

<p>Just before that you said they were waiting in the stairwell with machine guns waiting to ambush the room </p>

<p>There&#39;s more holes than the official story, id focus your intelligence which you clearly have elsewhere...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your second point makes no sense. It seems you misread. They can&#39;t just barge into the hotel with duffle bags and weapons and head for the stair well. They check in, weapons inside their luggage, take weapons to room, and all meet in the stairwell when time is right. So I fail to see your point?</p>

<p>Regarding Campos. He is an informant, but probably double crossed the FBI. He is the cartel&#39;s guy on the inside. Why would they kill him? They don&#39;t want to blow his cover so they shoot him in the leg. </p>

<p>Please give more holes... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They wouldn&#39;t have to check in to carry bags. They is more than one entry and check in desk. No one would know if they were guest or not..the same person doesn&#39;t work a 24/7 shift so the people at the check in desk would assume they checked when they weren&#39;t on shift. Either way this theory doesn&#39;t hold water. It is too sloppy. To grandiose. Way too public. Zero motive and no pay off. The cartel can get any gun they want...they don&#39;t have to get subpar guns from some elderly gambler. Heavy gambler equals bad decision making...cartels tend not deal with unstable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Such a pity that this sub is now controlled, fake accounts posting consistently, causing good posts like this to get lost. Down voting LV posts. I’ve also noticed on certain posts  that the amount of upvotes can not be seen until you click into the actual post. This is another way of manipulating by reddit and those trying to control the narrative. Also when I see 30-40 comments and a disproportionate amount of votes this alerts me to Vote manipulation. From now on if I upvote a post in conspiracy I will also make a quick comment like “up vote from me” or something like that, if every upvoter did the same it would help show the real problem of fake down voters. Imagine a post with 40 comments of “up vote from me” and a net zero in votes? It would be very clear what’s going on. 
      This post it offers another plausible explanation as to why this happened.Post should  be voted to the top so people can see it and make up their own minds. I strongly recommend that everybody browse using the “new posts” filter. It’s the only way to make sure you see posts like this. Thanks for your research OP keep up the good work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The big cartels don&#39;t need some local Vegas dealer to get weapons for a large operation. They can get all the weapons they need in/into the USA whenever they want.</p>

<p>Neither are they interested in a large pubic action in the USA because that would lead to a public blowback they don&#39;t want. If they have some personal feud they deal with that somebody personally and their families.</p>

<p>Neither options are likely here. ISIS, a CIA/Mossad mercenary op like Al Quaida, would be &quot;possible&quot; as a pretext to get the USA into Syria if the narration after the event would be guided that way. It wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Outside of this ISIS is just a bogeyman to confuse the US population with more fear porn and give the MSM some shallow content.</p>

<p>The FBI has a 5 million dollar reward for a top Sinaloa cartel member. They&#39;ve been busting their gang members left and right last few years. Hell, the leaders son got indicted recently. What happens when you corner a rat? It attacks. I don&#39;t think the leaders of the cartel would care about public backlash if they are cornered.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes when you listen to the police scanner audio at the point where the LVMPD team are about to go up to the 32nd floor, they radio a guy who is already up there, a guy who had earlier mentioned &#39;the C.I..er snipers&#39; being up there. They radio him to say they&#39;re about to come through, just to confirm so he knows not to shoot at them or anything. No mention of any blocked door. The guy does not respond. They call to him twice and finally he responds and asks them to repeat, which they do. He then whispers that they should stay back, there might be booby traps, and kind of stalls them, eventually they decide to stay put and don&#39;t go up to the 32nd floor, he says he has enough men up there. </p>

<p>So there is enough time there for them to get people out and it sounds like there are things going on which is why he doesn&#39;t respond right away. His slip up and almost mention of the CIA is weird, as is a mention of snipers. Why would they need snipers if they are going into the actual room where the lone shooter is?</p>
