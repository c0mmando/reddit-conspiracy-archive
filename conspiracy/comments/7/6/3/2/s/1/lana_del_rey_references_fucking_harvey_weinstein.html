       Meh, I think saying 'my pussy tastes like Pepsi' would be a bigger trigger for triggerable people.
      </p>
      <p>
       God I hate that triggering is now an acceptable term for offending people/making them think or face something/being creatively shocking- and that we have to warn people before everything we express in case they get feelings hurt.

       I don't see how the lyrics changed -- as a MAJOR Lana fan, her official lyric book has ALWAYS said "Ah he's in the sky..." but fans have always heard "Harvey..." and speculated on their own after she was seen at lunch with him in 2012. Yeah it was probably about him, but it could be about a lot of other men too. This theme is prevalent in ALL of her discography. She's always singing about getting caught up with a bad boy running from the law, an older rich man or the one that got away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, fans can edit the lyrics on those sites very easily and Lana fans always fight over what they hear in her songs because she mumbles
       <em>
        a lot
       </em>
       . Lana plays on the Lolita genre quite frequently in her songs... I would list them but there's like almost 100 at least where she sings in babytalk, references her "daddy" and everything in between. She even has a song called "Lolita" and references the book in her first album's lyrics. She also has a song called "Hit and Run" that was never released about sleeping with a movie producer that was written well before she met Harvey.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I love a good conspiracy, this really isn't a conspiracy at all... this is just her schtick.

       Are you seriously claiming you can't hear HARVEY in the song? You can hear a hard V when she sings it. It's always been Harvey. The song is literally about him so that makes sense.

       lol I don't disagree with you but this is what Lana fans argue about always... her official lyrics have always said "Ah he's..." and we've always heard "Harvey..."
      </p>
      <p>
       Watch any of the live versions of Cola being performed and it even looks like she's saying "HAR-vey" so it's easy to see...

        https://youtu.be/Hqm9z6Riov0?t=25s
       </a>
       &lt;-- is a great up close example of her singing "Harvey" and I even started it at the line before for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying there's no conspiracy here, those lyrics have been fought over since she released the song and fans are currently editing the lyrics database to edit out Harvey and match the official lyrics because of the HW scandal.

       I was wondering this myself. Why would an individual feel compelled to Astro turf the lyrics to a single song without instruction? There is no reasonable answer there.

      <p>
       Someone is intentionally altering the lyrics.

       It's crazy Lana fans... the average age is about 16 and female so you can just imagine the antics in that fandom and they have been fighting over this particular song since 2012 and I'm wouldn't put it past some to use the HW scandal as an excuse to "win" this debate lol

       Hon, don't be offended, I'm in my 30s... But you have to admit, if you visit Lanaboards, we're a minority. While lana attracts all types, the average age of fans on her boards are in their teens and they seem to fight over everything and are rude little shits.

       Weinstein offered Lana for a role in a movie. But she rejected that offer. 
In fact Lana never acted in any movie.
Page six website posted that Lana also rebuffed Weinstein's advances against her becuz she already had a boyfriend. 
Cola song was made to depict irony about scandalous nature of Hollywood.

       She also has a song with Dre and Eminem (I need a doctor), which is the first song I personally had heard her on, and Eminem has ties to Harvey after working on the Southpaw soundtrack

       Ew, Natasha. 
Just because a female is attracted to older men does not mean that she is a skank. 
I'm not sure if you are jealous that Lana is beautiful in and out or that she is rich or if you just are one of those women who have to put other women down to feel better about your life. Either way it seems you might be projecting. Maybe one day you will understand that age is just a number if you have feelings for someone.

       I was just talking about this with my boyfriend.  Any girl who is having sex to get power, a job, money, a gig, or anything other than because she simply wants to, isn't doing it for the right reasons.  That doesn't make her a slut, it makes her someone that got the wrong idea about sex early on, and used it to her benefit instead of letting it destroy her.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why slut shaming is bad.  A girl can have sex with whomever she chooses and whenever she chooses, but it should be out of her own enjoyment; not a tool to get her to where she wants to be in life. That's not what sex is for, and anyone who thinks less of you because you won't have sex with them is a very twisted and negative individual. Sex is not an obligation.

       It wasn't changed so not to trigger anybody, it's a poor attempt at 'backing away slowly' from her lyrical brag about it. 
Right now outing Harvey and coming out with a story on him is hot stuff. No one will want to be known as someone who gleefully fucked her way to the top in a scenario like this.

I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows

       [Pre-Chorus]
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he’s making me crazy
(I come alive, alive)
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

      <p>
       [Chorus]
Come on baby, let’s ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side

       I can post a picture if anyone wants. I bought the vinyl of the album this song is on, when it came out and it has an official lyrics page. It says “ah, he’s in the sky with diamonds and he’s making me crazy” nothing about Harvey. It is a reference to Lucy in he sky with diamonds.
