<p>No camera footage of paddock whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>yes because it&#39;s an on-going investigation and the cameras may show the staff unknowingly helped Paddock.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Change timeframe on major witness, 7 days later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, could be because the major witness is lying, trying to protect himself</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Major witness/hero doesn’t do one interview.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>possibly a gag order or he&#39;s lying.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>New witness, maintenance worker, comes forward a week later, gives interview.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>there was always a maintenance worker there. you just here 40 different stories of the same event. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>FBI reports wrong date of paddocks check-in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>FBI reports correct day of room that he paid for, but not the room he was comped. FBI would have been given this information by the hotel so it&#39;s very possible the hotel is attempting to cover this up or at least lessen the blow it would do in the courts</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Witness reports he was occupant of room #134, recants his claim days later.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>People lie for attention. Happens all the time.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Suspect, clean history, mentally and criminally.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mentally? His father was a confirmed psychopath, very possible he inherited the disease as well. GF said he would in middle of night screaming. Prostitute said he frequently had dark thoughts (could be lying but neither of us know) and an autopsy wouldn&#39;t be able to confirm if he had some kind of mental illness as far as I know. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>No motive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He was nuts, didn&#39;t need a motive.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Room key used as paddocks car left the property.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Prostitute possibly. Not a big stretch.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hundreds of eyewitness claims that counter main narrative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eyewitnesses are notoriously terrible at remembering details. There are also videos out there of people saying the shooting was coming from a window at the MB. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hotel even questioning main narrative.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If their staff unknowingly helped Paddock, they&#39;d for sure want to reduce the damage they&#39;d take in the courts. Especially if they were informed there was a shooter on the 32nd floor and did not report it immediately. That&#39;s a lot of liability. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate you addressing each point. </p>

<p>I could be on board with a couple of your answers but they (FBI/LVMPD) haven’t provided any evidence of prostitute or even paddock. Just a couple segments of camera footage, not a big deal, he was there for 6-7 days, I’m sure they have something that wouldn’t effect investigations. Prostitute even said they drank all night and Steve Wynn said that Stephen and girlfriend didn’t drink alcohol. </p>

<p>As far as evidence of mental illness there really isn’t anything. I haven’t heard about night terrors but everyone who knows paddock including Vegas says he was a rational person.  Father a psycho, yes, but that doesn’t tell me much without evidence of Stephen being even a little psycho.</p>

<p>At the very least the story should be somewhat straight which it is not, doesn’t implicate any conspiracy but it sure gives fire to them. </p>

<p>This is pretty sad. I wonder what kind of tiny bubble of reality you must inhabit where you can&#39;t imagine any reason why people distrust, in your words, &quot;actual journalists.&quot; Or, perhaps you are aware of the multitude of scandals involving your &quot;actual journalists&quot; but you choose to retain that cognitive dissonance -- surely that must be uncomfortable?</p>

<p>I think the real answer, of course, is in your own words: &quot;I&#39;ll never understand.&quot; It&#39;s not that you <em>can&#39;t</em> understand, it&#39;s that you&#39;ll <em>never</em> understand, <em>because you refuse to.</em></p>

<p>I love this. The most popular tactic for disinfo agents to attempt to discredit someone or something is to take something that they said, and then alter it until they are able to reframe it into something they can try to argue against. Usually, however, they don&#39;t shine a spotlight on their dishonest tactics like you have here. Thank you for making this ultra simple.</p>

<p>Might I ask how you separate your &quot;actual journalists&quot; from your &quot;corrupt journalists?&quot; Does it involve some kind of after-the-fact determination? If so, at what point do you think it&#39;s fair to start scrutinizing what you&#39;re being told <em>before</em> it&#39;s revealed to be a lie? Or do you just give everyone a free pass until they are shown with egg in their face? What about the organizations that empower and protect these &quot;corrupt journalists&quot; and oftentimes continue to employ them despite a proven history of ethical violations? Is a journalist (perhaps from pressure from their corporate overlords) who maintains a corporate agenda and &#39;toes the line&#39; an &quot;actual journalist&quot; or a &quot;corrupt journalist?&quot; If the latter, might it be fair to speculate that this list of &quot;corrupt journalists&quot; dwarfs the list of &quot;actual journalists?&quot;</p>

<p>Unironically, they don&#39;t point out or realize that they are indeed leaking.</p>

<p>So if this is an approved leak (?), why can&#39;t they just say who they are? If it&#39;s not an approved leak, then they are just as guilty.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if MegaAnon is supposed to be an approved leak or whether she is sufficiently trusted that she can disclose those things as responsibly as she seems to try, or whether she is just an intriguing LARPer. Again, for me, the Jury is still out on that.</p>

<p>Of course, it is. Who would dispute that an anonymous forum with virtually no taboos is a splendid place to seed misinformation or to troll?</p>

<p>But again, if you read the material that is verifiable insider information, the benefits of learning those things far outway the energy that was wasted on weeding through misinformation. That&#39;s my experience at least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This all makes sense to me, except for using Weinstein as a distraction. How coud they be that stupid? The main sticking point for the genral public in believing any of these conspiracies is that they just don&#39;t believe so many people could know about such awful things and yet say nothing, for it to not come out. And yet Weinstein is proof that that has and does happen, it&#39;s proof of how these power structures operate, and how a few despicable people can get away with heinous crimes while a whole boatload of other people know, and hate it, yet say absolutely nothing.</p>

<p>So now everytime someone feels suspicious about some of these things not adding up with whatever it is that &#39;the swamp&#39; is lying about, where they used to be able to shrug it off and say &#39;naaa, too many people would have to know, someone would&#39;ve said something&#39; now they&#39;ll remember, or be reminded of, Weinstein and how major political players, the media, and hundreds of other people knew, covered up, said nothing.</p>

<p>It also emboldens people to come forward about other moguls, it emboldens people to ask about pedophilia, people aren&#39;t going to forget pizzagate, and anytime there&#39;s an opportunity to show people how it&#39;s real and how it&#39;s possible, people will be there ready to ride on the back of a scandal like Weinstein and expose it to as many as possible.</p>

<p>So they must be really desperate or just really dumb to do this. I wonder what actually happened in Vegas and what went wrong with their plan. Thank god it did go wrong. These people are the most evil of all evil. And they&#39;re not that bright either, they seem to have kept secrets mainly due to the fact that most people are just too decent to be able to conceive that other human beings could be so depraved.</p>

<p>Wait a minute.  How did Las Vegas go wrong?  A shit ton of people got murdered.  That was the goal of the shooter - whoever it was.  That seemed like a terror event (likely false flag, but a terror event all the same) that went exactly as planned, no?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so &#39;paddock&#39; was an undercover FBI agent, and the operation was a setup to try to entrap and ensnare some ISIS people. (pst, hey kid.. want to bomb a federal building?) type stuff. well... isis has figured out how the FBI works, staging their own attacks to stop so they can be the hero.. All the guns where part of a weapons deal like fast and furious that was connected with a larger plot to blow up some bombs. well.. instead of sticking around to get arrested/blamed for the whole thing, supposedly the ISIS people murdered the FBI agent, opened fire on the crowd below, then fled... the shooting wasn&#39;t supposed to happen as it did.. it was supposed to be a gun deal followed by bombings... but isis had no plans to really bomb us.. they just let the FBI believe so to get their undercover agent to go along with the set up long enough to turn on him and humiliate the FBI. This is what I&#39;ve been able to piece together so far from megaanon and the facts discovered so far. it makes more sense than the official narative even if it does sound slightly bonkers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;... I&#39;m trying to convey the broadness and scope of what will be publicly disclosed. My only point is that after it&#39;s all over, no one will be able to turn away from the truth. The masses will never again be able to claim with 100% certainty that 9/11 DIDN&#39;T have inside, US sponsored and funded, department/agency coordination, allocated resources and assistance. No one will EVER be able to NOT believe that our own fucking agencies and departments and former admins. didn&#39;t play a huge role in shit like JFK, OKC, 9/11, ISIS, Pizza, Vegas, etc. They won&#39;t be able to turn a blind eye to what they consider &quot;conspiracy theories&quot;, today simply because the MSM told them to.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The goal is that when it&#39;s all said and done, there will be no room for question, when it comes to the people. He won&#39;t have to disclose shit like 9/11, OKC, Vegas, Voter Fraud, Russia hacks or collusion, elections rigging, etc. specifically. When he&#39;s done, it will be a literal &quot;mic drop&quot; on the world&#39;s stage and you will no one ever again, will have the ability to question who&#39;s responsible for, involved coordinating, etc. ANYTHING that has ever happened and been considered a &quot;conspiracy theory&quot;, ever again. When he&#39;s done, the entire world will just KNOW IT ALL. It really is THAT all-encompassing. Like Trump says, &quot;you&#39;ll see&quot;. It just has to happen. We cannot be derailed. Ever again.&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly possible the people who control media have latched on to HW as the &quot;big story&quot; to push Vegas away &quot;in the moment,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t feel like a co-ordinated thing. </p>

<p>Could Ronan Farrow actually be the real deal? First Woody Allen, now Harvey Weinstein? </p>
