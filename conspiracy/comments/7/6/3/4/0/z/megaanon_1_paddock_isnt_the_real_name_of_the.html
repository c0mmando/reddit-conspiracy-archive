       Is it really that big of a fuck up though? I mean they changed the timeframe slightly but that could easily be explained by Campos and Mandalay Bay staff giving false statements so they don't look as liable as they could be. He pretty much gives himself an out by saying he can't be too specific because he'd be accused of larping lol.

       FBI reports correct day of room that he paid for, but not the room he was comped. FBI would have been given this information by the hotel so it's very possible the hotel is attempting to cover this up or at least lessen the blow it would do in the courts

       Mentally? His father was a confirmed psychopath, very possible he inherited the disease as well. GF said he would in middle of night screaming. Prostitute said he frequently had dark thoughts (could be lying but neither of us know) and an autopsy wouldn't be able to confirm if he had some kind of mental illness as far as I know.

       Eyewitnesses are notoriously terrible at remembering details. There are also videos out there of people saying the shooting was coming from a window at the MB.

       If their staff unknowingly helped Paddock, they'd for sure want to reduce the damage they'd take in the courts. Especially if they were informed there was a shooter on the 32nd floor and did not report it immediately. That's a lot of liability.

       I appreciate you addressing each point.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could be on board with a couple of your answers but they (FBI/LVMPD) haven’t provided any evidence of prostitute or even paddock. Just a couple segments of camera footage, not a big deal, he was there for 6-7 days, I’m sure they have something that wouldn’t effect investigations. Prostitute even said they drank all night and Steve Wynn said that Stephen and girlfriend didn’t drink alcohol.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as evidence of mental illness there really isn’t anything. I haven’t heard about night terrors but everyone who knows paddock including Vegas says he was a rational person.  Father a psycho, yes, but that doesn’t tell me much without evidence of Stephen being even a little psycho.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the very least the story should be somewhat straight which it is not, doesn’t implicate any conspiracy but it sure gives fire to them.

       Give me the name and number of the funeral home and the person in charge of the service you attended.  I will call that person, I'm serious.  If you are serious you will give me the contact.  If you don't then you are a joke.

       I've already responded to your other comment about showing proof, all you need to do is get your mom's permission to fly to Las Vegas to see it. Have her drop you off at the airport in her minivan and maybe she'll give you 20 bucks to buy her a nice souvenir shot glass. She can use that shot glass to drink away her sadness over having such a miserable failure of a child.

       The rule is "pics or it didn't happen". In other words, don't post a claim that you "know someone" and shout about it not being a hoax while you're a complete rando stranger on reddit and expect that to be evidence.

       This is pretty sad. I wonder what kind of tiny bubble of reality you must inhabit where you can't imagine any reason why people distrust, in your words, "actual journalists." Or, perhaps you are aware of the multitude of scandals involving your "actual journalists" but you choose to retain that cognitive dissonance -- surely that must be uncomfortable?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the real answer, of course, is in your own words: "I'll never understand." It's not that you
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       understand, it's that you'll
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       understand,
       <em>
        because you refuse to.

       So you’re telling me that random anonymous sources from 4chan who have proven to be wrong time and time again are more credible than actual journalists? Please explain how so I’m genuinely curious. Is it because the LARPers are telling you what you want to hear?

       I love this. The most popular tactic for disinfo agents to attempt to discredit someone or something is to take something that they said, and then alter it until they are able to reframe it into something they can try to argue against. Usually, however, they don't shine a spotlight on their dishonest tactics like you have here. Thank you for making this ultra simple.

      <p>
       Might I ask how you separate your "actual journalists" from your "corrupt journalists?" Does it involve some kind of after-the-fact determination? If so, at what point do you think it's fair to start scrutinizing what you're being told
       <em>
        before
       </em>
       it's revealed to be a lie? Or do you just give everyone a free pass until they are shown with egg in their face? What about the organizations that empower and protect these "corrupt journalists" and oftentimes continue to employ them despite a proven history of ethical violations? Is a journalist (perhaps from pressure from their corporate overlords) who maintains a corporate agenda and 'toes the line' an "actual journalist" or a "corrupt journalist?" If the latter, might it be fair to speculate that this list of "corrupt journalists" dwarfs the list of "actual journalists?"

       I'm just going to point out something that requires very little critical thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       First link makes kind of crazy attempt to explain why 11 people are going to be fired for leaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unironically, they don't point out or realize that they are indeed leaking.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if this is an approved leak (?), why can't they just say who they are? If it's not an approved leak, then they are just as guilty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, that you'd accept this as true, when you have no way to verify, considering they are doing the very thing they claim others are getting fired for doing..

       I didn't claim that this one is true. The jury is still out on MegaAnon.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a handful that can be verified, albeit not very easily. HLI, being the most notable example. A couple of the FBIanon posts were remarkably accurate too, but I think there were plenty of disinfo copy-cats as well.

       And the point, that they're sitting there claiming that people are going to get fired for leaking, while
       <strong>
        they're
       </strong>
       actually leaking (provided it's not some 12 year old with an imagination).. what fucking sense does that make?

       4Chan is the greatest misinformation tool there is, and it's the source of 75% or more of the most bat shit theories you'll see on here.. when we know there's people being paid to spread fake info and push agendas/narratives, why do any of you not realize that's the perfect place for them to do it!

       I wasn't clear about your point before, but I see what you're saying now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if MegaAnon is supposed to be an approved leak or whether she is sufficiently trusted that she can disclose those things as responsibly as she seems to try, or whether she is just an intriguing LARPer. Again, for me, the Jury is still out on that.

       I would say Facebook and Reddit are close behind - if not ahead at times.

      <p>
       Of course, it is. Who would dispute that an anonymous forum with virtually no taboos is a splendid place to seed misinformation or to troll?
      </p>
      <p>
       But again, if you read the material that is verifiable insider information, the benefits of learning those things far outway the energy that was wasted on weeding through misinformation. That's my experience at least.

       I don't know about it being worth the effort.. and Reddit is behind, that's why you don't see such blatant bullshit run rampant here. Yes, if someone gets caught lying or whatever, they can just make another account.. but at the same time, the only people that would actually bother are the people actually trying to spread propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook is iffy, sure people can share bullshit, but you can also call them out on their bullshit, it's not like they're going to make a new account, add 100+ friends, upload all the photos again, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       Twitter is an absolute gold mine off bots and people paid to push a narrative.. I'm feeling tired and lazy or I'd post evidence where this guy found a Russian propagandist, and he thought the last 8 digits in the username were auto generated, but actually referenced numbers and a year that's related directly to important Russian history (and he didn't even realize it)..

       The phone story to finally break and get the last of the swamp out of the WH, I can't believe their are so many obama hold overs.. so much 'trying to work with the other side' when historically the 'other side' just fires everyone and brings in their own people... their was lots of controversy back in the clinton days because they extended that policy even outside of the WH and into several executive organizations, (travel office most famously)

       This all makes sense to me, except for using Weinstein as a distraction. How coud they be that stupid? The main sticking point for the genral public in believing any of these conspiracies is that they just don't believe so many people could know about such awful things and yet say nothing, for it to not come out. And yet Weinstein is proof that that has and does happen, it's proof of how these power structures operate, and how a few despicable people can get away with heinous crimes while a whole boatload of other people know, and hate it, yet say absolutely nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now everytime someone feels suspicious about some of these things not adding up with whatever it is that 'the swamp' is lying about, where they used to be able to shrug it off and say 'naaa, too many people would have to know, someone would've said something' now they'll remember, or be reminded of, Weinstein and how major political players, the media, and hundreds of other people knew, covered up, said nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also emboldens people to come forward about other moguls, it emboldens people to ask about pedophilia, people aren't going to forget pizzagate, and anytime there's an opportunity to show people how it's real and how it's possible, people will be there ready to ride on the back of a scandal like Weinstein and expose it to as many as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they must be really desperate or just really dumb to do this. I wonder what actually happened in Vegas and what went wrong with their plan. Thank god it did go wrong. These people are the most evil of all evil. And they're not that bright either, they seem to have kept secrets mainly due to the fact that most people are just too decent to be able to conceive that other human beings could be so depraved.

       Wait a minute.  How did Las Vegas go wrong?  A shit ton of people got murdered.  That was the goal of the shooter - whoever it was.  That seemed like a terror event (likely false flag, but a terror event all the same) that went exactly as planned, no?

       Ok so 'paddock' was an undercover FBI agent, and the operation was a setup to try to entrap and ensnare some ISIS people. (pst, hey kid.. want to bomb a federal building?) type stuff. well... isis has figured out how the FBI works, staging their own attacks to stop so they can be the hero.. All the guns where part of a weapons deal like fast and furious that was connected with a larger plot to blow up some bombs. well.. instead of sticking around to get arrested/blamed for the whole thing, supposedly the ISIS people murdered the FBI agent, opened fire on the crowd below, then fled... the shooting wasn't supposed to happen as it did.. it was supposed to be a gun deal followed by bombings... but isis had no plans to really bomb us.. they just let the FBI believe so to get their undercover agent to go along with the set up long enough to turn on him and humiliate the FBI. This is what I've been able to piece together so far from megaanon and the facts discovered so far. it makes more sense than the official narative even if it does sound slightly bonkers.

The masses will never again be able to claim with 100% certainty that 9/11 DIDN'T have inside, US sponsored and funded, department/agency coordination, allocated resources and assistance. No one will EVER be able to NOT believe that our own fucking agencies and departments and former admins. didn't play a huge role in shit like JFK, OKC, 9/11, ISIS, Pizza, Vegas, etc. They won't be able to turn a blind eye to what they consider "conspiracy theories", today simply because the MSM told them to."

When he's done, it will be a literal "mic drop" on the world's stage and you will no one ever again, will have the ability to question who's responsible for, involved coordinating, etc. ANYTHING that has ever happened and been considered a "conspiracy theory", ever again. When he's done, the entire world will just KNOW IT ALL. It really is THAT all-encompassing. Like Trump says, "you'll see". It just has to happen. We cannot be derailed. Ever again."

       I'd love to believe that, but it seems way too big. I mean in time, if we are walked to it. But, then again, if they have the information, this could turn this country, and world around. Perhaps they are going to go for it. The timing of Vegas and Harvey is too odd. And Vegas itself is too odd. Like another mistake ridden 911. But we learned from 911, deep state probably too, but they didn't think Hillary would lose. I think they got blindsided.

       Not that I wanna suggest that we previously used to all agree here on this sub, far from it, but it seems as though the average opinion (as represented by early comments and early vote counts) suddenly shifted a great deal towards the mainstream, doesn't it?

       The last one from FBIanon I believe totally came true. It's why everyone hangs on these. Because in between the bullshit larping there are some real gems posted.

       Considering Ronan Farrow's been working on the HW story for almost a year and NBC tried to kill it, I'm finding the "it's a distraction" angle hard to believe, at least intentionally.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's certainly possible the people who control media have latched on to HW as the "big story" to push Vegas away "in the moment," but it doesn't feel like a co-ordinated thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could Ronan Farrow actually be the real deal? First Woody Allen, now Harvey Weinstein?
