       I need to find out if this is true, 
I was told the media and EMS have been lying to the public , there is almost 1k people reported missing still. After 4 days idc how bad cell coverage is there should be no reason in this day and age that , that many people are still missing. 
I was informed by two people lastnight that we're being lied to about the casualties. 
I was told there was tons of people trying to evacuate in Santa Rosa whom got caught in traffic when the fires came thru and wiped out those nieghborhoods and that many were stuck in their cars and were burned alive in their cars. Many , Many of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm asking anyone with info that can back this up come forward with evidence of some sort but please use discretion we're here for truth not gore.
      </p>
      <p>
       29 so far is the official count.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was up listening to those scanners that night it all started my own family was effected thankfully everyone is safe and good but if it were not for the actions taken neighbors would have died .
      </p>
      <p>
       I can definitely see this is a possibility but instead of assuming it as true there would have to be some local redditors out there that can chime in and provide some insight.
      </p>
      <p>
       As most locals know most roads are closed to the public view and limited to those who live(ed) there and gov. officials.
      </p>
      <p>
       stay safe everyone out there effected by this tragedy my thoughts are with you all

       It basically tells you the numbers about how bad it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's bad. It's going to burn another week, before full containment, a lot of Type I teams are deployed... between the hurricane and the fires. (Type I teams are the largest team to send.)
      </p>
      <p>
       This means resources are stretched thing and the only salvation, compared to some of the larger fires I've been on, is that technology has drastically improved even in the last 5 - 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Information is tough on a fire. The GIS guys make the perimeter maps and they are the drop point for all GPS data. So, there is always a delay between the Public Information Officer getting the information from the map guys, because the map guys are busy filling in incident command, while the news and public just have to wait.
      </p>
      <p>
       Point being, they probably aren't hiding the number of deaths... they just don't have a ton of information and the information they do have takes a bit to sort through.

       Why would they be trying to hide anything though? Wouldn't it be in their best interest to have this distract from Vegas? (I of course am assuming the same people are in control)

       Ive seen a lot of stuff on here and Voat or 4chan talking about the fires being cause by lockheed laser weaponry and the reason why there seems to be so much shit going on at once is just to throw people into a chaos and confuse us since "THEY" are losing control and desperate. We got, Cali fires, Hurricanes, Vegas, N Korea, Hollywood Pedos, Puerto Rico.. a lot of things going on

       I can understand a few dozen people falling off the radar due to evacuation. Also, it seems reasonable there could be several people actually missing but I cannot fathom 1000 + people dying in this fire. That seems very high but why would rescue workers lie to you? Very strange. These are all small communities which makes it even more dubious imo.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm also in Northern California but San Francisco so not in the line of fire. These fires are horrific and the wind has made them difficult to contain but I think folks evacuated most of these areas in plenty of time. I've read of many people saving their own homes. 
Regardless, I cannot think of a reason this type of natural disaster would prompt deception. Is there some fault being tossed around?

       People are not reported dead until they are confirmed to be dead with an IDed body, that's why in bad disasters it takes quite along time after the even for the death toll to be accurate.

       The intensity and speed of the wildfires are turning homes into dust. The fires have changed direction quickly. For people in the area what kind of notice do they have to evacuate? It must be difficult searching for remains given destruction of homes versus the usual structure fire. What remains of the body would be left when the home is turned to dust?

       I read that the fast moving wildfires knocked out cell towers which precluded a ton of people from getting Amber Alert style notifications on their phones.  Essentially tons of people got blind sided by the fire.

       I heard that the weed farms are starting to burn now. From my knowledge, many people work as "trimmers" on farms, and the locations are so remote that they're there for several months without internet connection. If it's true that there's mass casualties, I can see why it would affect secluded farmers who don't have enough information to escape on time.

       Yeah, this is a fact. Especially in the Santa Rosa and more northern areas. Cartels hire undocumented folks, rich white guys hire young/shady folks. Get them in a secluded area and they spend most of the day trimming. The weed farms out there are humongous, and very secluded (talking thousands of plants, not a home grow of 50-100). It's harvest season right now so there's a lot of bud being pulled/trimmed/cured etc

       1k is up there with 9/11.  A natural disaster killing that many people would detract from the effects of mass shootings.  58 people is a drop in the bucket when you're talking about 1k people dead from wild fires.

       Yeah, this is a fact. Especially in the Santa Rosa and more northern areas. Cartels hire undocumented folks, rich white guys hire young/shady folks. Get them in a secluded area and they spend most of the day trimming. The weed farms out there are humongous, and very secluded (talking thousands of plants, not a home grow of 50-100). It's harvest season right now so there's a lot of bud being pulled/trimmed/cured etc
