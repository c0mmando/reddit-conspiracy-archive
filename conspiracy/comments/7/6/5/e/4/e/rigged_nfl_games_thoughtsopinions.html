Bucs game the other night and start noticing some bizzare penalties being called away from the play completely so then I go and check the betting line on the game and realize that the penalty called back a touchdown and would make sense if Vegas or whoever wanted to keep the game within the point spread. Idk could be coincidence but nowadays I be questioning everything. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When pressure is coming so fast, he has to move the ball. Everyone was covered usually, so he had to pick his poison. And the blown throw to Benjamin was a miscommunication. Benjamin was supposed to curl in versus out, which is where he threw the ball, so it was a pick. Romo talked about why that happened, and alleged it was largely due to the weird safety line up in cover 0. </p>

<p>Just my 2 cents. Could be totally wrong. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. All I know is the Eagles practically handed the game to them on a silver platter after being in control for like 52 minutes. Then those last two drives by the Panthers were filled with really bad plays by a single player who had been carrying them until that point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look at the Bears Super Bowl XLI between the Colts and Bears. If the Bears scored a final touchdown, they would&#39;ve covered the spread. Think about how many Bears fans probably had money on the game, for their team to win/cover. Now look what Chicago did: they let the clock run out. It was absolutely mind boggling to me that their coach wouldn&#39;t at least go deep for an attempt at a touchdown to cover the spread so that their fans at least had some form of monetary consolation. But they didn&#39;t. That is when I realized that the stuff is rigged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a huge Peyton Manning fan and I felt the same after Super Bowl 50 that they gave him one more knowing he was retiring. Cam Newton backing away from the fumble instead of diving to recover was a huge givaway. I also believe Tom Brady has been gifted several SB&#39;s for playing nice with his deflate-gate scandal. Matt Ryan continued to drop back and take sacks in SB 51 in order to take the Falcons out of field goal range at tge end when they were in range and 3 pts would have won the game. Like the WWE, the NFL is all about storylines and will fix games to get the best story going.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Home teams definitely get better calls. I don&#39;t know if this is rigged/fixing, could be. I think it might be psychological, except for the Chargers, the refs hear and see fans and are inundated with one team. They had to be football fans to become a ref and probably had a favorite team. I don&#39;t care how impartial you say you can be, everyone has their favorites. </p>

<p>Basketball at both college and pro had its problems. The NFL really has to much to lose to fix games. Look what an under inflated ball caused (in not a patriots fan, hate that guy, he&#39;s really fucking good). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The pats have a history of some questionable shit, so don&#39;t pretend they are Choirboys. I actually don&#39;t have a problem with a slightly less inflated ball for older QBs. I&#39;m sure a lot of QBs did it, they just aren&#39;t going to have the grip they used to, didn&#39;t mean they can&#39;t still sling it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think all major sports are rigged to some degree. Yes it&#39;s impossible to have everyone, all players and coaches, and refs in on it. But I do think there is corruption. This has been uncovered time and time again in every professional sport. The ones who were caught only scratched the surface  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if the NBA is rigged, which I’m sure it is, I will always enjoy watching it because of the amount of skill on display almost every play. The outcome might be decided but, people still make amazing plays and displays of athleticism. A lot like WWE. It’s all nothing but entertainment. </p>
