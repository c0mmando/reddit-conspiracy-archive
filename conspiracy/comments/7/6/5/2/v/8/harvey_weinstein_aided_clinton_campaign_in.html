    <div class="md"><p>DCLeaks published an email leaked from Clinton confidante Capericia Marshall who worked with Clinton&#39;s in the White house, and Hillary at the State dept. and on the 08 campaign.</p>

<p>An email from Harvey Weinstein stated that the Clinton team needed to &quot;Silence&quot; Bernie Sanders on the Eric Garner case (black shot by NYPD) as it could swing minority support to Sanders.</p>

<p>Two months later two &#39;activists&#39; who previously had no contact or association with BLM started a BLM Seattle Facebook page, and the same day were in national headlines for somehow getting past security and storming the podium as Sanders spoke in Seattle.</p>

<p>The national media coverage helped fix Sanders image as weak even as the official heads of BLM condemned the action of Marissa Johnson ( Christian extremist, 1/2 black one time Sarah Palin supporter?!?) and Mara (Willaford) Jaqueline.</p>

<p>Was the whole thing theatrics orchestrated by Weinstein?</p>

<p>This is not true. You are mis-attributing a quote from an interview Weinstein did with Gabriel Garcia Marquez. It was Marquez who called himself the &quot;Chief White House Projectionist&quot;:</p>

 Please stop with the BS.</p>

<p>Back up an accusation with a fact please.
 If you&#39;re talking about the parade of bimbos that disappeared into the woodwork without anyone ever trying to substantiate their claims, they didn&#39;t even claim rape.</p>

<p>But, chances are that if he were threatened, it would be with some blackmail that he exchanged for some political influence or wealth in his past. The man has been in Congress for decades, and I find it hard to believe that he is clean.</p>
