        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Let&#39;s look at the ridiculousness of this case thus far.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Stephen Paddock was a professional gambler who made a living off of video poker.  A successful casino gambler can only be found riding unicorns.  Supposedly a rich real estate guy, but no one knows of any holdings or transactions in his name.  Throughout his employment career, he worked for the post office and the IRS.  It seems they pay extremely well since real estate investing needs quite a bit of seed money. </p></li>
<li><p>Jesus Campos was security guard who was shot when he knocked on the door of Paddocks room.  But only, he wasn&#39;t shot then, but 6 minutes before the shooting began.  And didn&#39;t bring the police/security to the room until 58 people were dead and nearly 500 people were critically injured.  Update 10/13: the timeline has again changed so now the story is Campos encountered Paddock 6 min prior to shooting start, and was shot 1 minute before actual fire began.  Make what you will out of this.</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus Campos house is guarded by someone who works for a possibly fictitious security company with no physical address and who&#39;s license to operate ran out last year.  Why does a witness to a mass killing, with the killer dead, need protection?  Why hasn&#39;t he given even ONE interview to anyone?</p></li>
<li><p>Stephen Paddock&#39;s house gets robbed while the FBI is combing over it for evidence....  No further words needed here.</p></li>
<li><p>Jesus Campos disappears right before he is to give 5 interviews, including Hannity.  No one, including the FBI, knows where he is.  So the FBI has lost the KEY witness to their investigation.  Meanwhile, scary guys guarding his house 24 hours a day.  <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/reporter-visits-home-mandalay-bay-hero-jesus-campos-armed-security-guard-shady-firm-meets-yard/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/reporter-visits-home-mandalay-bay-hero-jesus-campos-armed-security-guard-shady-firm-meets-yard/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Jesus Campos drives a Corvette with no license plate and whose registration points to 2006, on a security guard salary.  <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/LauraLoomer/1DXGyOWAQQVxM?t=55">https://www.pscp.tv/LauraLoomer/1DXGyOWAQQVxM?t=55</a></p></li>
<li><p>Hotel casinos, the single most extensively surveilled buildings in the world, can not produce even ONE clip of Paddock going on about his business.</p></li>
<li><p>Has 23 guns and dozens of loaded magazines.  But takes over a minute between volleys of fire.</p></li>
<li><p>No trails of social media exists for Stephen Paddock.  Nothing at all.  Paddock must have not known that the internet existed.</p></li>
<li><p>The media is continually pushing the narrative &quot;we may never know his motives&quot; over and over again, as if they&#39;re trying to tell us something. hmmm...</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Is anyone buying this?  Is anyone foolish enough to think that this was a planned mass murder by a crazy guy? </p>

<p>Anyone wanna add to the list?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, they did this to ban semi-automatic rifles like the ar-15 which is a subset og a rifle. The only reason they would conduct a false flag like this is to slowly pass state legislation to ban rifles, attachmemts and ammo amounts whilst then down yhr road introducing a blanket ban. Why pinpoint something so insignificant??</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So let me get this straight, you need a highly sophisticated network to pull of this atrocity but a network dumb enough to not realize gun control isn&#39;t going to pass after the attack. You realize how dumb that sounds right? We don&#39;t even have to look that far back, I know where I am posting but the majority of America knows Sandy Hook happened and if a bunch of dead children wasn&#39;t the line America doesn&#39;t have a gun violence line that can be crossed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>don&#39;t worry, fully understand and know the conspiracy belief some have. I have my own beliefs and I respect yours.  But we were talking about reality construction and how something cannot exist if it isn&#39;t experienced. My question is how can something not exist when we have people who have experienced it. If anything, imagine having a loved one who dies in some manner and then all these people are like &quot;that never happened&quot; and &quot;that person didnt really exist&quot; and then ask yourself where you feel the conspiracy really is... </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ve brought up an interesting point on grief and our social construct of what a grieving person &quot;should&quot; look like. Too little,  not believed. Too much, not believed or seen as over the top/hysterical. I&#39;m trying to think if I&#39;ve seen a &quot;just right&quot; for grief moment illustrated in the news. I mean, as a society overly outward emotions bother us and when you think about the gendering of emotions, a dad might not cry but show anger where a mom might cry more only due to allowing women the emotional space we deny men as well as how we feel these matters should be &quot;performed&quot; within our society. Just neat stuff to think about</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They should&#39;ve gotten better crisis actors, there were no visible tears in all the parents who were interviewed. Most parents would be crying hysterically on the day and days after their child died, not smiling and laughing like <a href="https://youtu.be/M8t8mSt14Ng">Robbie Parker</a> and in all of the interviews I&#39;ve seen of Sandy Hook parents, I&#39;ve yet to see a single tear shed. If anyone can find a clip of a Sandy Hook parent shedding even one single tear, that would give me reason to believe the official story more than I currently do.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, for you, the only way grief can be properly performed (and please note my use of the term perform does not relate to actors but to the roles and feels whatever our society dictates are the proper ways to express. Realize: this is different culture to culture and person to person) is through shedding of tears. </p>

<p>Again, I&#39;m not denying your belief. I&#39;m discussing a flaw within a reality construction definition by another user and how we, not just actors, perform emotion and what we deem to be authentic emotion during events like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One single tear is all the proof I need. 20 dead children means there were 40 parents who lost a child that day. If you can find me a video with even one single tear coming out of the eye of one of the parents who lost a child on 12/14/12 in Newtown, CT, then I will believe that children died at Sandy Hook. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The shooter had an IMDB page because he spoke as a security guard in a documentary about the BP oil spill a few years ago. And he spoke actually like a real person:</p>

<p>&quot;The man behind America’s deadliest shooting was working security for the company G4S when a filmmaker from “The Big Fix,” Rebecca Tickell, drove up and asked about the cleanup operation.</p>

<p>Mateen asks her if she has a badge, and Tickell responds, “I’m actually just wondering what’s going on here?”</p>

<p>When she asks if she can talk to anyone, Mateen goes off, saying, “No one gives a s—, no one gives a s— here.”</p>

<p>Without being prompted, he continues:</p>

<p>“Like, everybody’s just out to get paid. They’re, like, hoping for more oil to come out and more people to complain so they’ll have job. ‘Cause once people get laid off here, it’s gonna suck for them. They want more disaster to happen. That’s where they’re money-making is.”</p>

<p>But yeah, lone gunman killed all those club goers for ISIS.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what happened because to my knowledge no CCTV footage has been released (which many of us on r/conspiracy had called for when the event happened). I feel that SWAT teams took people out when they stormed in, and Mateen was the patsy and tagged as the lone shooter. You ask for definitive proof of what happened, when there is none accessible to us. There is a narrative. That has been chosen to be accepted, or not accepted. I choose not to accept it. I&#39;m not going to believe some guy strapped with weapons and a trenchcoat in summer Orlando weather is too far-fetched to be believable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>O I agree the cops took people out when they stormed the place. I&#39;ve had this convo with other people. There were so many people packed in a small dark place they had no way to tell for sure they didn&#39;t hit anyone. The SWAT uses 5.56/.223 and so did he so they would say it was his rounds plus they would pull the whole the rounds fragment so they can&#39;t tell etc....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Either this was a gun crazed psycho who went to great lengths over many months to orchestrate mass murder and he just failed to leave a clue as to why OR this was a precisely planned event by a organised group to achieve a hidden purpose.</p>

<p>Which sounds most plausible?</p>

<p>My money is on the latter and the theories you mention are connected along with others.
Just think not about motive, but who and how stakeholders will gain.</p>

<p>Gun laws aren&#39;t going to change, at least not significantly.  Some minor stuff to appease some lobbiests maybe, but that is just good PR.  Give them a win and they will go away.</p>

<p>Gov and gun / ammo companies won&#39;t let that gravely train stop.  This event has already boosted sales, that&#39;s direct revenue. But the big bucks came from the insider trades.  Look at the stock movements and who was selling before the event and who then bought back. Can you spell CEO and CFO?</p>

<p>Don&#39;t stop at the gun and ammo companies. MGM and similar groups have the same characteristics on their share movements.</p>

<p>Now, it&#39;s all good having everybody armed to the teeth, but it is still a problem.  How do you stop someone wandering into somewhere and shooting up the place - a la Paddock?
Simple, scanners at entrances to all public places.</p>

<p>Body scanner manufacturers are stand to make a fortune selling body scanners once building owners see no other option.  Part of the lobbiest appeasement mentioned above will be mandatory scanner installation in a number of key places.  Soon it will be accepted as normal because it is expected then law grows that all buildings need a scanner.  At the same time, private scanners are marketed and people feel they must have one to be safe &quot;like how big businesses do it&quot;.  (This is how private CCTV came to be in many homes today)</p>

<p>So, where is the Gov link? Well some is in the money but more importantly, all those scanners will bizarrely be necessary to link to the cloud to function (WiFi and IP connection).  Once they become part of the IoT, then gov have just expanded their surveillance network massively (because those scanners will do more than detect metal).</p>

<p>The alphabet agencies involved are also gaining valuable feedback.  There is a view that this event was a botched false flag.  But I think it was a false flag that went exactly as planned.
Precisely placed and outlying variables and zero information release except for a fine trickle to coerce public investigation.  Why? So they can thoroughly test their information control systems and gauge the public&#39;s investigative abilities.
Fake news pushed out all over the place and real news / leads suppressed.</p>

<p>There are major unavoidable events on the horizon globally and control of information is going to be key for keeping control of the masses.  These events are both manmade (global economic failure) and natural (pole flip and dehabitablisation of huge areas) meaning the only way to survive is depopulation.
(PS. They are not interested in WW3 as that will lead to nuclear devastation and even more uninhabitable lands - and is why Clinton got dropped in favour of a navigable business man)</p>

<p>We are all getting desensitized to the idea of depopulation presently and the new movie &quot;small world&quot; is just the next part of that.</p>

<p>For all the rebels who don&#39;t conform, you&#39;ll get to visit a fema camp for neutralization.  And the conformists get to continue life in the freshly depopulated and sustainable environment (until you mess up - got to maintain that lower people level!)</p>

<p>Now, you might like to make a run for it or you might expect some outside intervention but unfortunately there will be a big wall in the way on one side and barren land on the other. Beside, you will not want to go there anyway because the  world is financially crippled back to the dark ages and the grass is not much greener on the other side (except Mexico and C.America.  Look at all the disaster movies - where do US Americans flee to each and every time?)</p>

<p>It&#39;s a scary world we are living in with scarier times ahead.  They will keep pushing these false flag events until they get what they want then move onto the next agenda item.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Passing gun control law isn&#39;t the goal.  You have to look at the two party system as really one big party.  On the right, gun attacks mean more people go out and buy weapons for fear that they will be taken away, which helps the gun lobby.  On the left you have a narrative of always trying to ban weapons but needing more support to do so. This cause drums up campaign support and lobby dollars.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes.  The world runs on incremental progress.  The economy runs on marginal progress.  It&#39;s called &quot;leverage.&quot;  That&#39;s how it all works.</p>

<p>You have to understand what is going on here, and how it fits into the larger political picture.  Nevada just flipped from red to blue.  It is a &quot;battleground&quot; state.  We are talking about gangs that are literally fighting for their survival, at this point.  Their entire programme depends on this level of total control.  And this is how these leftist gangs operate.  They come from indebted, overpopulated states.  They invade and take over neighboring, wealthier, growing states <em>just long enough</em> to alter the political climate, to push out their rivals, and to begin to take over.</p>

<p>Nevada is easy pickings.  Las Vegas is a high growth real estate market.  Just like Connecticut, if they can get Nevada to pass gun control regulation, they start to win there.  Their opponents start to pack up and move, or get pushed out.  Every time some individual gun owner with a couple of houses gets set up, or killed, or sent to jail, they collect.  They leverage one instrument of control to gain five others.</p>

<p>You seem to think there is some kind of &quot;risk/reward&quot; calculation involved, but there isn&#39;t.  They aren&#39;t ever going to get caught, because they make sure to control all the appropriate agencies of government before hand.  They don&#39;t even care if you know.  It&#39;s the &quot;big lie.&quot;  They are criminals.  They have nothing to lose.</p>

I&#39;m a fan of both but really love my AKs and I remember when they were considered junk and sold all day long for $200-$400 while ARs were selling for $1000+ easy. Now you can get a decent AR for $400-$500 and if you can find a good well built AK it will cost you upwards of $1000 or more. Hell Chinese AKs used to be considered bottom barrel and now they are highly priced collector guns and finally known as some of the best factory built AKs out there. The PolyTech Legends will always be the nicest AK ever brought state side. Hell, a bottom tier WASR or YUGO will cost you $550 or more these days when they used to go for $150-200 10yrs ago or so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would be the point of staging something like this in order to ban certain guns/mods though?</p>

<p>If you&#39;re worried that these guns and mods are dangerous and want to avoid a big mass shooting, shooting 500 people seems to really go against that ideal. Why not just wait for it to happen naturally if you&#39;re so sure that these rifles, attachments and ammo amounts lead to mass shootings? What&#39;s the big rush to get them banned if you don&#39;t give two shits about loss of human life?</p>

<p>I can understand the reasoning people think that 9/11 was staged - the US government profits a ton off of war. It did wonders for Bush&#39;s approval rating and gave us an excuse to go bomb a bunch of shit, which we love to do. I can see and understand a possible motive, which I think is the only thing that particular conspiracy really has going for it.</p>

<p>I feel like this event sucked for both sides. Will the people who want to ban guns really profit that much if guns are banned right now instead of a year from now when the next Joe Shmoe shoots up his school? It seems like the pro-gun people make money when guns are allowed, but neither side benefits much if they&#39;re banned (except for the anti-gun people who actually care about loss of human life, but these people wouldn&#39;t shoot 500 other people). </p>

<p>What am I missing here?</p>

<p>I definitely think it&#39;s possible, but I&#39;m no expert on anything involved with that. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s enough evidence to say for sure one way or the other. I know that it was a tragedy and that whoever did plan it was an incredibly fucked up individual.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t seen any evidence yet of anything else exploding, but I have seen evidence of two planes hitting the building. I&#39;ve seen demonstrations explaining how a huge jet filled with fuel could cause such catastrophic damage to such a tall building, so right now I lean towards feeling like it happened as it seems. I feel like if it was impossible for these buildings to collapse due to plane strikes, and the planners of this atrocity knew that they had to plan and execute other explosions somewhere, why would they bother with the planes in the first place? I&#39;m not really one to ever say &quot;this is definitely what happened&quot; though unless I&#39;m confident I know the whole picture. I just like asking questions and am always open to new evidence and opinions!</p>

<p>I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but saying there&#39;s not enough evidence confirm or refute the official story is the kind of thing that would destroy the possibility of any real knowledge.

<p>That said, in some cases it&#39;s true that there&#39;s not enough evidence to come to a conclusion. I&#39;m not convinced either way at this point that Paddock planned this event, for example. But refuting the official story of 9/11 is not one of those cases. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t see how that&#39;s relevant since there were certainly explosions. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s many bombs that would be easy to smuggle in to the WTC unnoticed that would do much more damage than a plane smashing in to the side, and if they did go off there would have been people seeing/hearing them. I guess the main disconnect between me and this theory is that I haven&#39;t seen even a little bit of evidence of something else happening. Again though, I&#39;m no expert in skyscraper construction nor am I an expert in explosives, so I feel like it&#39;s more rational to draw my conclusions from the multiple different experts I&#39;ve seen who all explain/demonstrate how the collapse was possible. Do you have anything more to go on than saying &quot;it just doesn&#39;t seem likely to me that two planes would cause these buildings to collapse&quot;? Do you have any real experience or education that makes your opinion regarding this more viable than the professional scientists I&#39;ve seen? If so I&#39;m totally open to it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Personally, I think that faith is more destructive to knowledge than seeking evidence. Neither are perfect 100% of the time, but unless I see evidence of something else I like to default to the simplest explanation. It&#39;s just my way of viewing the world, and everyone is welcome to their own views.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Predicting the future is a bit different than drawing conclusions based on something that already happened, plus we actually have pretty solid evidence that the sun will come up tomorrow morning. We have tons of simulations and models of our solar system, we&#39;ve seen evidence of the sun&#39;s gravity that keeps us in orbit, we&#39;ve seen plenty of proof that the Earth rotates, and we could even ask an internet buddy on the other side of the planet if they can observe the sun setting in the sky, on it&#39;s way to our half. It&#39;s true that there might be a really really really tiny chance that the sun could like explode or something (though surely there would be some kind of warning first), but there&#39;s still plenty of evidence that it will come up tomorrow.</p>

<p>The NRA appears to be non-existant.  If things are looking shady on the investigation, that should be the cue to the NRA to start the push against the narrative.  Instead their stance is: &quot;NRA Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre let Dianne Feinstein, Chuck Schumer and their anti-gun minions know that the NRA will not tolerate their use of a tragedy in their war against the Second Amendment.&quot;</p>

The point is that it is absurd that he would agree to 5 interviews and cancel all of them at the last minute and no one knows where he is.</p>

<p>As far as the Corvette goes, the video of the livefeed from the reporter who visited his home sites those points and unless you have proof that the reporter is wrong, I&#39;m gonna go with it.

<p>This just shows how inadequate armchair investigators are at... well, investigating. It took me like 5 minutes of research to confirm that this claim is false. Yet people like OP are <em>still</em> repeating it as if it were true.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no wonder authorities don&#39;t want to let out any evidence (e.g. security footage) during the investigation. Real damage can be done by some confused individual who believes misinformation like this.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not typical in my experience. I know people who work part time in a union and they don&#39;t even pay full dues. They definitely get perks too. Anecdotes aside I don&#39;t even see what benefit it would be to the union to insist only full time employees are allowed...they would benefit from more members receiving less assistance from them. </p>

<p>In the case of security unions it seems especially unlikely to me that they would require full-time to join. Security is an industry where you have uncertain hours for a lot of jobs. Would unions just not be interested in unionizing these people doing shows or details and such? That doesn&#39;t seem very likely to me given that unions want everyone to join pretty much...they want every industry unionized because that gives them more power and money.</p>

If you think that isn&#39;t him (Larry Jesus Campos) then there is no Jesus Campos registered in nevada and he can&#39;t be an employee of mandalay bay. If you do believe that&#39;s him then it says he&#39;s currently active as an employee. Bonus: Larry Jesus Campos was allegedly not even on these security registration list of nevada and was added on the 10th AFTER people were talking about it.

    <div class="md"><p>The day after the shooting people were posting about the license requirement stuff and linking the &quot;Larry Campos&quot; stuff.  So you&#39;re mistaken about him not being listed until the 10th.</p>

<p>It lists him as being employed at the time his license was issued by CSC.  That in no way means he couldn&#39;t have changed employment since receiving his license.  The licensing fee is a one time fee good for 5 years.  He could obtain the license and change employment without getting a new license.  </p>

<p>You&#39;re jumping gaps based off false information.  </p>

<p>That&#39;s not how conspiracies work.  The &quot;Not an employee of Mandalay Bay&quot; narrative is easily explained.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s definitely not true. They were talking about jesus campos. &quot;Larry&quot; didn&#39;t pop up until the name showed on the list. </p>

<p>You can look it up if you want he is listed as active with CSC. I think the confusion here is that there are two different things here. One is the license for nevada as security personnel and the other is being listed as an employee of CSC. CSC listed him as an active employee and he was also on the list for nevada security personnel after being added retroactively.</p>

<p>There could be any number of explanations for this. I don&#39;t know the answer. I&#39;m just saying that the story isn&#39;t coherent enough to believe he works for mandalay bay and there are several reasons to question it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, that&#39;s totally possible. But then he still apparently wasn&#39;t registered as a full-time security guard until the 10th and even then it was as Larry Jesus Campos if that&#39;s even supposed to be the same person.</p>

<p>Would be nice if this dude actually went to his interviews so we could get a solid story pinned to him...and then likely see it fall apart like everything else they tell us.</p>

<p>Look, I&#39;m not 100% satisfied with the &#39;facts&#39; we have been given, and I can appreciate questions about the series of events that unfolded, who was behind it etc... But it is really is clutching at straws saying an attack didn&#39;t happen. I just can&#39;t work out what agenda you are trying to push.</p>

<p>As for the only evidence being available to us is the video evidence, a lot of is will have been confiscated, deleted, removed, grainy, bias, unverified, pushing a narrative... So we can&#39;t build a clear picture of the situation based on what we have, drawing any conclusions is pure conjecture and theory. </p>

<p>Why do you insist on seeing up close, graphic, privacy invading pictures of bullet wounds? I can&#39;t honestly see why that is the ONLY evidence that will change your mind. Go to Vegas, visit a victim and just please stop pushing the toxic idea no one was shot.</p>

<p>If the casings were there before he killed himself, there would be blood on top of the casings.  Agree?  Since the top of the casings are clean, they must have fell there after he killed himself.  Agree?  Therefore, he could not have been the one who shot those casings.  Agree?</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Blood splatters at close range. Where is the splatter?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sorry, you added this edit after I responded so I didn&#39;t see it. </p>

<p>First, it is spatter, not splatter.  As for where it is, I have no idea, as I am not sure where he was standing or how his body fell in relation.  But from what I understand of what you are saying is that we are seeing the spatter, that the spatter in this case is one giant pool that blew from his head, fell to the ground in a neat pool that his head fell on top of.  And of course, then someone fired some rounds that landed on top of it.</p>

<p>Because if it was blood that slowly leaked from his head and pooled around the casing, it wouldn&#39;t have blood on top of it.</p>

He praised the Taliban and the Pakistan spy service, and called for the removal of Afghanistan leadership at one point.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m surprised this isn&#39;t a bigger deal. Why bring body armor unless you planned to go out shooting? Or shoot your way out. If he had cameras watching the hallway and he could see it was only an unarmed security guard (and now a maintenance guy has been added to the narrative), why wouldn&#39;t he put the body armor on before the cavalry arrives?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think he was alone in that room and was probably popped by someone he knew and trusted who then carried out the shooting and escaped down the service elevator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The original person said having 20 firearms is a red flag, not having them in a hotel. If you know any pro gun people, 20+ is pretty common. My liberal buddy who&#39;s pro gun is about to get his ninth weapon. It isn&#39;t a red flag.</p>

<p>Reasons to have them in a hotel room.. you&#39;re traveling with guns and you want to make sure they&#39;re more secure than being left in a vehicle. Perhaps you&#39;re going to a gun show, going on a hunting trip, etc.</p>

<p>Having them, isn&#39;t inherently a red flag of anything, regardless of where you are.. until/unless you commit a crime.</p>

<p>no 8. I forgot the shotgun</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I do that too and it&#39;s good example of why people should never make statements to the police or the press. Being when I rattle off the guns I own, due to family members passing away and hand them down etc it&#39;s 6. Yet I forget that technically a commemorative edition firearm is still a gun even if you never load/fire it. So that moves the number up to 8 and oh yeah my dad owned (so I now own) a .22 rifle so now it&#39;s 9. I also only bought one gun myself so if the question was &quot;How many guns did you buy&quot; it&#39;s just one. </p>

<p>Then here it comes, why did I forget about owning gun!?! Who does that?! Why are you hiding how many guns!? Why do you own unregistered firearms? Being it was bought at a gun show 30 year ago. Ok where was that gun show? My local highschool&#39;s gym out here in California. It all sounds like total BS. I love conspiracy theories but man if you start to look at even your own life/stories one can really see how stuff can get twisted around. I mean they really did have gun shows in school gyms in California, it was just 30+ years ago. </p>

<p>Why isn&#39;t he in the &quot;firearms industry&quot;? Or better question, what do you think that even is? The guy owned a dozen guns for years, and only started stockpiling much more in the last year. I would say he&#39;s a gun enthusiast at the very least.</p>

<p>I own no guns, but if I had the money, I&#39;d probably buy some after this event.. I&#39;m no gun nut, is there a certain amount of guns that suddenly indicates I&#39;m a crazy person?</p>

<p>You&#39;ve created the most illogical argument I&#39;ve seen yet. Did I say what happened in that room is normal? No. I said there&#39;s reasons to travel with guns.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I fully understand that. I&#39;ve been to Vegas multiple times and have brought lots of luggage up without question. I think theorists are inclined to question the narrative. If we didn&#39;t question half the lies uncovered by FOIA requests we would still assume the lies peddled to the masses. There is many unanswered speculations about the event and they will always remain unanswered. After all they will suppress anything to make the majority feel at ease. I still think by now someone would have gotten ahold of some form of video with Stephen paddock in the hotel. The only motive is he &quot;snapped&quot;. I want to see their reasoning for why a 64 year old millionaire who lives off gambling decides to snap and shoot a crowd of concert goers. I&#39;d understand if he snapped and shot himself in the hotel room. </p>

<p>Pics of only a few of the rifles in the room, where are the rest?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the adjoining room?  We haven&#39;t seen any photos from there.  A lot of people don&#39;t realize that Paddock had rented two rooms.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a diagram of the 2 rooms.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://archive.is/1G2Ps">http://archive.is/1G2Ps</a></strong>  </p>

<p>The suite was known as a &quot;Vista Suite&quot; and was where Paddock&#39;s body was found.  The room next door was just a standard room.  It had a connecting interior door to the Vista Suite.   This standard room was the one that had the room service cart out in front of it. </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://archive.is/HIely">http://archive.is/HIely</a></strong>   </p>

<p>Here&#39;s what doesn&#39;t make sense to me.  See this diagram.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://archive.is/Y8KsZ">http://archive.is/Y8KsZ</a></strong>   </p>

<p>It shows that the police breached the double doors to the suite at 11:20 p.m.  It was another 7 minutes until they breached the interior connecting door into the connecting room.   (To me &quot;breach&quot; means open the door or kick it in.) If Paddock were the only one and was running back and forth between the two windows in the two rooms using the interior connecting door, wouldn&#39;t that connecting door ALREADY BE OPEN when the police arrived?﻿ </p>

<p>We&#39;ve only seen photos from the suite.  There haven&#39;t been any photos released that were taken in the adjoining room.  Were there more guns and brass there?</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s this:</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x96Kem0ZYag">Raw Footage Shooting Las Vegas People at Bus Stop Below Shooter</a></strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s 9 minutes long, but you really only have to watch the first four minutes.  From 2:15 through 2:24 you hear two separate (shorter) volley of shots.  From 2:42 to 2:47 you hear another volley of gunshots and that seems to be the last one.  Then at 3:25, you hear a single shot.  At 3:35 you hear another single gunshot.  There are absolutely no shots after that.</p>

<p>What are those last two shots?  </p>

<p>In the initial timeline (before they revised it) they said Paddock shot Campos through the door, and then turned the gun on himself.</p>

<p>If that is what we are hearing, it seems like the shot that hit Campos would have been more muffled (Paddock was shooting through the door into the hallway)  The second shot could have been Paddock shooting himself.  It probably would have been louder because Paddock was found dead next to the broken window in the suite.  But both shots sounded equally loud to me.</p>

<p>Or it could have been the first shot killed Paddock near the open window, and the second shot could have been Campos shooting himself in the leg ten seconds later - also near the open window.</p>

<p>Both shots (10 seconds apart) were definitely not Paddock killing himself.  It would have taken only one shot.</p>

<p>I know this scenario doesn&#39;t fit the revised timeline, but I don&#39;t trust their ever-changing timeline to begin with.</p>

<p>Anyway, just my thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This gets crazier and crazier and I&#39;m more confused than ever.  </p>

<p>The American media is reporting that Paddock rented those two rooms 32-135 and 32-134.  Yet other media overseas (Australia and UK) are reporting that 32-134 was rented by Brian Hodge of Australia.  </p>

<p><strong><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/world/hardcore-las-vegas-shooter-in-room-next-door-says-australian-man-brian-hodge-20171002-gysy9v.html">&#39;Hardcore&#39;: Las Vegas shooter &#39;in hotel room next door&#39;, says Australian man Brian Hodge</a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>An Australian man believes the gunman responsible for a mass shooting in Las Vegas was staying in the room next door to him at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino.</p>

<p>[SNIP]</p>

<p>He said police told him the gunman was in the room 32135, just one room away from his hotel room.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m room <strong>32134</strong> so I&#39;m just so glad I didn&#39;t make it back to my room,&quot; he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I found another photo of the room service cart in front of the door and it goes up a little higher where you can see the room number  <strong><a href="http://archive.is/pTmWr0">here</a></strong></p>

<p>So has the LVMP said Paddock rented two rooms?  The American Media has.  (This on top of the LVMP saying Paddock checked in on September 28, and then a week later changed it to September 25.)</p>

<p>This is about the sloppiest investigation I&#39;ve ever seen.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I&#39;d say the first shot was to the chest, then when he realized that wasn&#39;t working fast enough, he shot himself in the head. That somewhat explains the blood stains on his shirt, and if he sat down after the first shot, could explain the strange position of his body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good question about the adjoining door. Why would it be locked or closed even  if he lone gunman traveling between rooms? Why would a lone gunman even need the second room? The suite had windows on the same plane as adjoining room probably 20-30 ft away. I have read that it was for a better angle to hit fuel tanks. But really would those 20-30 ft make a difference when the windows in the suite faced the same direction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your point number 12 is spot on. I have a bump fire stock, and have used it on my 16&quot; AR-15 chambered in 5.56/223. My fuck is that thing hard to aim, not to mention it takes a lot of practice to even get shooting smoothly. 
Notice how in every youtube video of a bump fire stock you see the person fire a few quick bursts, 2 rounds, 5 rounds, etc. You need to train with a bump fire stock to be able to instantly dump an entire mag....and what do you know, it seems like that doesn&#39;t add up to Paddock. If he was well trained, why did he wear slippers, why did he take so long between shot groups....and more. </p>

<p>I think people also don&#39;t realize is when a bump stock is firing, the entire rifle is shifting back and forth about an inch which would also cause further inaccuracy, going along with what you said. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah the back and forth motion is around 1.5&quot; I think if cant be stopped or the bump stock doesnt work. Tv networks really quit talking about them recently.  The fake news media said countless times &quot;as we all know full auto is banned, illegal&quot;. Thats fake news lies. At a federal level it is not banned just has more steps to acquire. This guy could have bought 3 full auto machine guns and used those in the crime all purchased legally if he was patient enough. For most people the cost is what keeps people from purchasing. Now it looks like the push is this wording that bans any part or thing that could be added to a semi auto that would increase rof. Problem with this is there is no baseline really. Unless a baseline rof is defined this is silly any gun manufacturer could just pit a awesome fast resetting short travel and light pull type of trigger in it in the first place and that way it wasnt upgraded just is as fast as it was originally designed from factory.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not trying to be argumentative, but I think it&#39;s important to point out that video poker definitely requires skill. understanding the mathematical implications and odds of your hand are very important. your decision making when it comes to drawing and discarding cards is very important and can help your odds. also, frequent players (like paddock) are eligible for tons of casino perks and free credits. using these to your full advantage only helps your odds. think about it, if nobody made money playing video poker, it wouldn&#39;t be so popular. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Video Poker machines are definitely favorable to the casinos depending on the paytable.  Even the very best paytables only pay back around 101% with spot on perfect play over a long period of time.  It is well known however that these machines are rarely found on the strip.  If this guy was really a pro he likely would take his play to downtown or locals casinos which offer better odds.  Still I find it hard to believe that you could carve out a <em>reported</em> 5 million dollar profit over the course of a year by visiting Vegas a couple times a month even at 101%.</p>

<p>What would be more conceivable - a great way to launder money is through video poker.  At perfect play on the average payable you&#39;d like get back around 95% of the cash you put in.  The cash you get back from the cage being nice and clean.</p>

They both require skill. Read about it. There are entire websites, books, forums, etc. dedicated to this. </p>

Unfortunately, that&#39;s not correct. Some states take years to accurately record deed records. Also, it&#39;s not unheard of to have unreported rentals on a Schedule E. </p>

I have a friend that works at a college for $12 an hour, single mom, does side gigs, bought her house, eventually saved enough to buy another, which ended up paying for her to get another.. now she has a steady source of income that requires little to no work, which can be reinvested in more property, which exponentially makes her more money.</p>

<p>I used to work in an Indian Casino and there was a security guard who was working on getting into the high rollers club for the perks.  </p>

<p>I was wondering how he was financing 50,000 every 6 months, since that is how much you have to give to the casino to keep the black card, but never found out.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also not brand new. Per OP himself, it was registered in 2006. The body styling looks like it might be a 2007. A 10 year old car is hardly new. If he had to spend a huge portion of his money on it, it would be no surprise if he held on to it for a decade.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was actually just going off OP&#39;s word as far as the registration. They have some of their other facts wrong, so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he got this one wrong, too. The car might&#39;ve been <em>first</em> registered in 2006. When did Jesus Campos buy it? A used Corvette isn&#39;t particularly expensive. If he did buy it new, the house doesn&#39;t look big or particularly nice, is it possible he spends or spent most of his paycheck on it? Was it even registered to him new?</p>

<p>Basically, I was just going off what the person I responded was saying: it&#39;s not out of the ordinary that someone who doesn&#39;t make a ton of money could have an expensive sports car (particularly if it&#39;s from 2006, as OP claims).</p>

<p>It&#39;s just that a lot of people are claiming &quot;holes&quot; in the &quot;official narrative&quot;, but a lot of these things aren&#39;t really that weird or even consequential. But when they&#39;re all added up and compiled into lists like OP&#39;s, people are led to believe there&#39;s a mountain of evidence, when there might not be.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s a lot of weird when it comes to Campos, but not the car he drives, if the Corvette even is his car. There are several reasonable explanations for driving a car like that on a security guard&#39;s pay. He&#39;s not married and doesn&#39;t have kids, probably doesn&#39;t have a lot of expenses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is true. The elevators do have cameras, hallways do not. They could show a video of him in the elevator, but he was probably in the elevator a bunch of times. So just seeing him in the elevator by himself or with someone else won&#39;t prove anything. Since there are no hallway cameras, you won&#39;t be able to determine anything unless he was with the same person every time he was in the elevator.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It depends on where the guns are going and you could always say you sold them in private sales. I&#39;m a gun guy and talk to a lot of people from all walks of life and have seen normal seeming people buy guns then sell them to people who shouldn&#39;t have them for nice profits. I knew one guy who would post ads on Armslist for the guns with pics etc and his contact info. He says he would say that he was contacted and sold the guns off. There&#39;s not law you have to do any background checks or even get a bill of sale for private sales. I thought it was a huge risk and advised him against it but he wont listen. He thinks that just saying he sold them off then after that he doesn&#39;t know who got them will be good enough. I told him even if it is but they suspect you of anything you bet they will be watching you and next shady deal or 2 will lead to his downfall.</p>

<p>He was a frequent gambler and a big fish. The casino would likely comp the room. These are fancy guns with nice attachments, close to 100 grand worth. This may have been his first big gun sale, he might have overdone it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m as skeptical as everyone else and something is fucky but this theory falls really flat. The guns were in his name. No gun runner is selling guns in his name. And besides that the value of the guns reported is less than the cost of the room. The idea that an illegal gun buy went south and they popped a dude in a massive hotel and was like fuck it let&#39;s shoot these people for no reason is ludicrous.</p>

<p>From what little info we know it does seem as if he was actually planning this as a terror attack. The scoping of the locations and whatnot. I think it&#39;s safe to rule out any other reasons for him being there. The gun deals and all that make no sense at all. Now where the whole thing falls on its face is motive. Why did &#39;he&#39; want to do this? I don&#39;t believe that behind every shooting is a puppet master and mind control and all that. People are crazy. People snap. But this is very different.</p>

<p>I find it hard to believe that there were teams of shooters and they escaped and framed him and all these pretty wild explanations. But something was going on here. The security guard, the girlfriend, the money, the shady businesses and connections. All indicators point to this guy being a spook. But why did this particular incident happen? People always say it&#39;s about pushing gun control but we should know by now that that&#39;s crap. These things never change anything and half the country has forgotten and moved on. It wasn&#39;t about these execs or soros&#39; hedge fund. The money people are saying they made off this is peanuts. Not worth anyone&#39;s time or the risk associated.</p>

<p>Figuring out who he was should be a huge key to understanding what happened. But I personally think people need to think more critically about what the motive would be for a government agency to make this happen. It&#39;s not money, it&#39;s not gun control. I just don&#39;t know what it is or what else it could be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very easy to report the guns as stolen, and it&#39;s possible his house being broken into was planned in advance to cover him selling the &quot;stolen&quot; weapons. The person who broke into the house may not have even known whose house it was and was hired by someone in advance of the sale. The room may have been comped, as he was a regular and a big fish.</p>

But assuming he looked at multiple hotels overlooking festivals you could assume he was scoping out places to do this. Or someone was. Or someone wanted us to think he was. But as far as reporting the guns stolen that would be a silly move if he was actually a gun runner. Illicit guns are stolen or purchased through straw buyers, possibly with stolen identities. If I wanted to sell 40 guns to the Mexican drug cartels I wouldn&#39;t go buy them all in my name. But the fact that his home was broken into is absolutely insane and a huge twist in the whole thing. One God damn twist after another. I just hope we get some element of truth out of this. </p>

If your theory is what happened, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a reason to hide the truth.  Its a bad guy who got into an altercation with other bad guys, who then killed a bunch of people.  As much as the theory fits, it doesn&#39;t explain the FBI&#39;s desperation in keeping the American people in the dark.  It also doesn&#39;t explain the &quot;shots&quot; heard about an hour later in the many other hotel lobbies along the strip, which I think could have been firecrackers to draw police away from Mandalay Bay for a getaway.</p>

Just like so many of their &quot;terrorist&quot; arrests, this may have been a contrived sting operation or more Fast&amp;Furious action. Either way it&#39;s possible they were caught with their pants down when shit went sideways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok check this out:</p>

<p>Gambling alcoholic lies about running guns at the casino bar. FBI informant overhears and figures they can use him for F&amp;F. FBI starts handling him, slowly convince him to get the guns and bring them to a hotel (over several months). The plan is to rob him and then the guns will be in the wind. The &quot;buyers&quot; come in, proceed to rob him, he pulls his pocket piece (revolver) and gets shot (unplanned). At some point they shoot out of the windows possibly in firefight with him or they decide to try and shoot the gas tanks. At some point Jesus comes up and gets shot. They scram and leave the guns.</p>

<p>Just a sequence of events that came to me. Obviously conjecture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to get into this guy&#39;s head, but maybe with all this wealth, hookers, booze, $1,000 sushi plates, living a life of a millionaire but not a celebrity life. </p>

<p>Other than engaging in pedo acts (which probably what he did) he wanted one last final &quot;bang&quot; just to feel something. to feel alive, to feel like he&#39;s actually real, </p>

<p>And shooting down a whole crowd of people was the act that needed to test his sociopathic behavior.  </p>

<p>That act finally did it for him. He felt alive, he felt human, he felt remorse.  At first the gunfire was easy, it was exhilarating, but after a little while, reality kicking in, he&#39;s on a downhill roller coaster to hell. He was planning to shoot it out with SWAT, but he started getting scared, he felt his mortality like he never did before. He is now a mass murder, a shooter, his name will forever be a blight on US History. Legislation will be passed under his name. His actions will resonate like 9/11.   </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t want to go anymore. The idea of a SWAT team coming in blasting him full of holes doesn&#39;t sound as cool as he once fantasized about it.</p>

<p>He hears something in the hallway.  Is it them? is this how it ends? Screw this, and he takes the easy way out by shooting himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think for the most part people just find this hard to imagine. He just wanted to feel something. This just doesn&#39;t satisfy people because they have to believe he had to have some big agenda. This is a guy who had no experience in these sorts of things. Not a criminal mastermind. I think that is why there were so many guns and random attachments. So much ammo, explosives, shooting airport fuel tanks etc... It&#39;s all so over the top because he didn&#39;t know HOW to plan it. He started shooting and ten minutes later the adrenaline wears off and he shoots himself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There would be zero discrepancies in the official story at this point. There would basically be none after 24 hours. The guy is dead so it&#39;s not like there is an active hunt for him.</p>

<p>After the shooting there would have immediately been like a dozen agents looking at every security cam footage at MB. They would have also clarified when Jesus was shot by doing an interview at the hospital and by checking when he and this random maintenance man called in that shots were fired.</p>

<p>The above things I mentioned are just a small fraction of things that would have been done within a few hours. That is common sense. The fact that the hotel and the FBi are both stating different timelines shows that there is something to hide. </p>

<p>At the very least the hotel might just not want to be held responsible for and that could be why the security guard pulled out of the interview. That is the bare minimim conspiracy here.</p>

<p><em>Throughout his employment career, he worked for the post office and the IRS.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s a connection to defense contractors that I don&#39;t see a lot of people following up.  From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Paddock">Wikipedia</a>: <em>Towards the end of the 1980s, Paddock worked for three years as an internal auditor for a company that later merged to form Lockheed Martin.[15] His work career after this period is not entirely clear.</em> </p>

<p>Could be nothing.  </p>

<p>But I wonder if &quot;No trails of social media exists for Stephen Paddock&quot; is somehow connected to his earlier work.  I would think people in shady, or covert, occupations usually avoid calling attention to themselves, vis a vis social media. </p>

<p>Also, &quot;A successful casino gambler can only be found riding unicorns.&quot; is false.  Maybe for a video poker player, but there are many successful gamblers out there.  But, usually they play with real cards, and real people.  That&#39;s the advantage. </p>

<li>Paddock called himself the &quot;world&#39;s greatest video poker player&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure how one could adopt such a moniker for himself if he was simply a &quot;comp player&quot;.  Not only that, but from what I understand, he stated that he made $5MM, mostly in gambling winnings, on his taxes. </li>
</ol>

<p>His brother said this, “He could tell you off the top of his head what the odds were down to a tenth of a percent on whatever machine he was playing. He studied it like it was a Ph.D. thing. It was not silly gambling. It was work.”  <a href="https://www.casinopedia.org/news/gambling-habits-stephen-paddock-video-poker">https://www.casinopedia.org/news/gambling-habits-stephen-paddock-video-poker</a></p>

<p>Perhaps you are right in spite of your smarmy comments because I believe he made a living as a set up man/arms dealer for one of the US Govt&#39;s alphabet agencies.  </p>

<p>2.The articles on &quot;Jesus Campos&quot;, the bow-tie wearing, neck-beard sporting, &quot;security guard&quot; state that he indeed radioed for police.  </p>

<p>6.Whatever</p>

<p>7.psy_raven&#39;s comment - &quot;Hotel casinos, the single most extensively surveilled buildings in the world, can not produce even ONE clip of Paddock going on about his business.&quot;</p>

<p>mm6748&#39;s comment - &quot;The casino has footage. Of something. Maybe just nothing relevant.&quot;</p>

<p>You can see why you are an asshole, right?</p>

<p>BTW, do you remember the Hispanic couple who was warning people before the shooting?  Is it possible that Jesus Campos did not work for the casino (or a temp security agency for the casinos), but because he had inside information, tried to stop what was about to happen on his own?  Perhaps this is why no one has been able to follow up on finding the people who were warning everybody that they were about to die.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed.  And you couldn&#39;t even argue that he was selling illicit full auto weapons as they were just fitted with what were, up until now, basically novelty items bump stocks that do shit for accuracy and are more for people to go out to the desert to spray random shit for funzies.  Why would you need some shady arms dealer to sell you legal firearms fitted with legal stocks?  Just go to a gun store in Nevada.  Duh.  If he can legally buy a metric fuckton of rifles in his own name, then so can these alleged gun buyers.  </p>

<p>And if you want to argue that he was trying to sell them to people who otherwise wouldn&#39;t be able to purchase the guns so that they could be used for nefarious purposes why would our shooter sell them perfectly traceable firearms that he bought under his own name?  We&#39;ve heard no reports of serial numbers being filed off so....</p>

<p>The botched gunrunner deal theory I think is a dead end.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It seems they pay extremely well since real estate investing needs quite a bit of seed money.&quot;</p>

<p>My father began buying real estate when he was in the Air Force around age 20.  By the time he retired after 20 years he had already made a considerable amount of wealth from his investments.  I think you might be misunderstanding what it takes to succeed in real estate.  Substantial seed money is not necessary when you start early and make wise decisions.</p>

<li>The gambling thing is just something the media latched on to. A few good real estate investments over the course of 40 years, on top of diligent saving and decent poker skills, can get someone to a few million dollars.</li>
<li>Whoa.</li>
<li>Whoa X2.</li>
<li>That is really odd, but it could be that they weren&#39;t guarding it all that closely because there was nothing in it. And stupid guys saw an opportunity to steal some shit.</li>
<li>Could be that Campos wants to build up a story then make money on a book, vs spill the beans now.</li>
<li>What???</li>
<li>They probably will, when the investigation is done.</li>
<li>This. This is key. Also, why would he need so many guns up there? He&#39;d only need 3-4 to do this (even one, though that&#39;s risky). Instead, he lugged thousands of pounds of guns up 32 stories? No way.</li>
<li>He was a government agent. FBI probably.</li>
<li>No, they&#39;re just talking out of their asses.</li>

<p>The story is that Paddock is an FBI agent. Something went wrong, and he was framed for the shooting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>WHat about the video of him from 2011 falling over in a casino, that then switches to video of him in some kind of back room surrounded by security guards, police and men in suits? That was weird. If you&#39;re a normal older gentleman who has a slip and fall in a business, they normally get the manager, maybe a paramedic if needed. They don&#39;t hustle you off to a back room with a bunch of security.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea, you can put a single gun in a suitcase. Nobody is questioning that. Now do that with 23 long rifles. If he brought his luggage downstairs and went back up with it several times, then I&#39;d say that is evidence he could have moved the guns up.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s no footage of him making multiple trips, well, that suggests that the guns got there some other way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let me try to explain better. They found at least ten pieces of luggage in his room. It isn&#39;t hard to get that many bags in. People walk in with boxes and all kinds of thing. People come there for conventions and shows and they carry all kinds of things. It isn&#39;t hard to get the guns in. You can ask anyone who has been to one of these hotels. They make long duffle bags too. He was a regular with no record. They had no reason to question him. I&#39;m not spreading bullshit. I&#39;m telling you how it is (or was). Look around the comments here...you will see that many people know this same thing. Very easy to do. The valet said he didn&#39;t have anything odd. That is if the story that was posted was true. I&#39;m not saying it isn&#39;t because I don&#39;t know the source. I used to frequent Vegas for work and pleasure. I have had to carry stuff in for a presentation at the airport the next day. I was never questioned about anything. It was on a luggage cart and away you go.</p>

<p>They could have gotten there by an accomplice. Something you would think any investigative team would be looking into. </p>

<p>The fact that they stamped the, &quot;lone wolf&quot; on this one less than 24 hours after the shooting is pretty interesting. You have ISIS taking credit for it which AFAIK they have never done in the past and had it come back as a false claim.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s weird that he would register his rifles in his name in a state that doesn&#39;t require registration of rifles. Do you have a source for this? I own several guns, none of which are registered and all of which are legal. I don&#39;t live in Nevada, but a quick google search says they don&#39;t require registration... Weird.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, people who believe the official story usually haven&#39;t done the research. Take Sandy Hook for example. That is an event which I perceive as being GLARINGLY OBVIOUS that the official story is phony baloney and that the whole entire thing was staged. When other people try to tell me I&#39;m wrong because they believe the people on the news over me, and have never bothered to do any real research into the event, when there is a mountain of evidence and great documentaries have been produced <a href="https://youtu.be/t922i3bDHXw">such as this one</a> then I personally do believe they are asleep to the truth. And I feel that people who are unwilling to challenge their view of an event like Sandy Hook where there is proof for days of it being staged are mislead about so many other things, because we are constantly being deceived by the powers that be.</p>

1) They found no key entry to his room while he was spotted (all by himself) 200x during the week on video across town or when he left on trips to Mesquite.  Was he in / out prior to shootings? How often?

2) He was capturing video and had cameras and devices IN THE ROOM and none indicate another person in the room.  True?

4) We know he&#39;s a big gambler and &quot;a millionaire,&quot; right? How much cash was found in his room? He planned to escape, right? So did he have $50k in cash? Or was he just going to swing by the ATM on the way out?<br/>
5) On that hallway, how many of the adjacent rooms were booked? If part of a sting, likely the floor was mainly cleared out. 
6) Can you confirm that no one entered the room before the LVPD &#39;breach?&#39;  Yes/ no.  Why not lob some tear gas in there after 10 minutes or 30 minutes even? A flash bang?  Yes, he stopped shooting but no indication he was done until they got in there (risky assumption).<br/>
7) Stairway was blockaded outside his room allegedly. What other stairways are accessible on that floor?  Sensors are on the stairwell doors we know, so did anyone use the opposite wing staircase (assuming it exists) during or after the shooting?  Yes/no. 
8) What was his source of income, if any?  Was he living off &#39;the millions&#39; he made in real estate or did he still have a revenue stream? Pretty simple -&quot;He had $5 million in the bank, and was earning $xxxK per year in rental revenue from other properties.&quot;<br/>
10) All the other BS that doesn&#39;t make sense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True - I was referring to the cameras the shooter set up that was in the peephole and on the room service cart in the hallway vs MB cameras. These weren&#39;t recording per LVPD but thinking if he went through all that effort he didn&#39;t simply record his actions in the room? Any recording of the mayhem below?  Prop up an Ipad and record? Anything on his phone? Maybe not but a direct question on that would be interesting. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>As counterpoints</p>

<p>1) He worked as an director in internal audit for Boeing which is Six figures plus for many years, in a time where housing prices were lower.  It is not unreasonable to assume he was able to mortgage several properties on that salary and cash out later in life.  His brother basically said he got lucky with properties.</p>

<p>2) It was actually 40 seconds afterwards they just announced.  The hotel&#39;s incident system has a time based on creation not the actual incident.</p>

<p>4) The FBI wasn&#39;t there at the time.</p>

<p>7) Just because you haven&#39;t seen it doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist.  What&#39;s the point of releasing the footage of him with bags.  This footage is here but there is no use in releasing it.</p>

<p>8) Maybe because he regretted what he was doing.  I&#39;m picturing more of a guy gone nuts taking breaks rather than a cold hearted shooter.</p>

<p>9) Lots of older people don&#39;t give a shit about social media.  My mom is in her 50s with no Facebook Twitter anything because she doesn&#39;t care.  Doesn&#39;t mean she doesn&#39;t use the internet she just has other interest.</p>

<p>10) Well at this point are they wrong?  He&#39;s dead, he told no one, he left no note.  Unless you have a good psychic we may never know why this guy did it.</p>

<p>I think the conspiracy theories are a way to distract from the scarier idea that one day a guy woke up and decided he, for no reason, wanted to hurt as many people as possible.  This guy just snapped and did something unspeakable. It&#39;s not unheard of unfortunately but it is scary to think that at any point some people can just lose it.</p>

<p>I can answer this mystery</p>

<p>The guns used in the shooting was a M240 with 100 round belts</p>

<p>The time between firing was to cool down the barrel and change the belt.</p>

<p>The audio matches a M240.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But in this scenario if this is merely an arms deal gone bad why bother sticking around to shoot up a concert and put all eyes on you?  Kill Paddock and make your escape clean and clear. If it takes hundreds of rounds at a concert before people even realize it’s not fireworks do you think anyone will blink twice over a single solitary shot to Paddock?  Ok so you say to frame him and tie off loose ends so the real perpetrator isn’t sought after. Wouldn’t one volley of gunfire achieve this goal?  If you’re trying to frame a guy and make a clean getaway do you stick around for ten minutes continuing to shoot while your position gets triangulated and law enforcement converge on you?</p>

<p>And since when is the best place to conduct highly illegal business with a cargo load of hardware to haul at one of the most populated and video surveilled locations on earth and not out in the middle of nowhere or in some dark back alley. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know if Paddock was actually a part of the supporting operation, maybe he was in some capacity, however it seems clear to me Paddock had no idea the shooting was going to take place that night.  It was his bedtime being 64 years old and already in his slippers.  Apparently had body armor, but didn&#39;t put it on for the event?  Committed suicide by shooting himself in the chest?  Everything we know about Paddock leads us to believe there&#39;s no way in hell he could pull this off alone.  He was shot by someone else in my opinion.  I also believe there were multiple shooters, maybe some who were only firing blanks (e.g. Bellagio) to enhance the effect. It also seems clear to me that law enforcement is attempting to cover this thing up.  Establishing a timeline in the moments leading up to the attack, during and after should be fall off a log simple given all the cameras rolling in Vegas.  Yet law enforcement keeps changing their timeline every time they hold a press conference.  In my opinion, because the story is a complete fabrication.  And to top it all off, the media won&#39;t hold law enforcement accountable for the truth (even conservative media).  This whole thing is a shit show.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;d think he would have used a SAW tho, because it&#39;s smaller, lighter, easier to use, same ammo as his other rifles 5.56, and, the SAW can use M16 (STANAG) style mags in a pinch.  </p>

<p>But it does sound like a MMG, the sound of it, and the rate of fire too.  </p>

<p>Both have motive.  CIA have been compromised since participation in Kennedy assassination.  They could have been doing a routine sting and realized it was a good opportunity for some homegrown terror to keep populace scared and confused.</p>

<p>Mexican cartel could have realized this was just a great opportunity to kill a gringo and take a valuable gun (the m240) but to get back at rednecks that want to build a wall.  Liberal media would be motivated to cover this up to prevent anti Hispanic sentiment.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But here&#39;s the thing: &quot;gun deals that go south&quot; end with the seller dead; not a crowd intentionally shot up.</p>

<p>I agree that it appears Paddock was an illicit arms dealer. Selling guns to criminals; maybe cartels. But maybe he thought he was selling to a gang or something, but it turned out he was selling to radical Islamic terrorists. They give Paddock very specific instructions on what room to rent for them to meet. They kill Paddock and then do what terrorists do. </p>

<p>But confounding this idea is the information Paddock at least intended to scout Lollapalooza in Chicago and another concert in Vegas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Most of your points are misleading at best, outright fabrications at worst. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stephen Paddock was a professional gambler who made a living off of video poker. A successful casino gambler can only be found riding unicorns. Supposedly a rich real estate guy, but no one knows of any holdings or transactions in his name. Throughout his employment career, he worked for the post office and the IRS. It seems they pay extremely well since real estate investing needs quite a bit of seed money. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do we know how Donald Trump makes his money? Rich real estate moguls are very secretive about the $$$ they bring in. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus Campos was security guard who was shot when he knocked on the door of Paddocks room. But only, he wasn&#39;t shot then, but 6 minutes before the shooting began. And didn&#39;t bring the police/security to the room until 58 people were dead and nearly 500 people were critically injured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This, I agree, is pretty suspicious. But I think there&#39;s an explanation somewhere before the &quot;he&#39;s a patsy set up by the government&quot; act. Maybe he wanted to play hero? Maybe he was helping Paddock out in some way but it was still Paddock&#39;s plan? Need a lot more info on this one. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus Campos&#39;s is guarded by someone who works for a non-existent security company with no physical address and who&#39;s license to operate ran out last year. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a new one. Only Googling I had was that fake &quot;journalist&quot; with a history of fabricating stories made the claim. She said in a random video the private security guard from &quot;On Scene&quot; security was fake because a business license expired. If you go to the Nevada Secretary of State&#39;s website and search On Scene you&#39;ll see the company&#39;s records are perfectly valid and in order. The Las Vegas city government business license search also lists the company&#39;s status as Active.  This appears to be a complete fabrication. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Stephen Paddock&#39;s house gets robbed while the FBI is combing over it for evidence.... No further words needed here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The FBI already finished searching the house. It wans&#39;t right in the middle of a search. And given that Loomer lady&#39;s history of acquiring photos/videos through questionable means... isn&#39;t it more likely a nosy journalist broke in? In addition why 1) wait so long until after the FBI cleared out and 2) broadcast the break-in for everyone to hear about? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus Campos disappears right before he is to give 5 interviews, including Hannity. No one, including the FBI, knows where he is. So the FBI has lost the KEY witness to their investigation. Meanwhile, scary guys guarding his house 24 hours a day. <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/reporter-visits-home-mandalay-bay-hero-jesus-campos-armed-security-guard-shady-firm-meets-yard/">http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/reporter-visits-home-mandalay-bay-hero-jesus-campos-armed-security-guard-shady-firm-meets-yard/</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Already addressed this one. Maybe the dude has a cold????</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Jesus Campos drives a new Corvette with no license plate and whose registration points to 2006, on a security guard salary. <a href="https://www.pscp.tv/LauraLoomer/1DXGyOWAQQVxM?t=55">https://www.pscp.tv/LauraLoomer/1DXGyOWAQQVxM?t=55</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>And you don&#39;t know anyone who lives outside their means? A guy who works part-time at the pizza shop near my house drives a 2018 Subaru WRX STi... that&#39;s like a $35k sports car on minimum wage. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hotel casinos, the single most extensively surveilled buildings in the world, can not produce even ONE clip of Paddock going on about his business.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not the jobs of the police or casinos to release that shit to satisfy conspiracy theorists. That informaiton only ever comes out if 1) they are actively seeking to identify people (not in tihs case because they already know who Paddock is and is dead) 2) through Freedom of Information requests (only when the case is closed) and 3) as evidence in a trial (obviously doesn&#39;t apply because Paddock is dead). The police arne&#39;t going to release every single smartphone video teh second they get them. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has 23 guns and dozens of loaded magazines. But takes over a minute between volleys of fire.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IDK what this is proof of?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The media is continually pushing the narrative &quot;we may never know his motives&quot; over and over again, as if they&#39;re trying to tell us something. hmmm...</p>

<li><p>Successful casino gamblers exist, particularly in more skill-based games like poker. Also, having real estate ownings don&#39;t necessarily count as employment. </p></li>
<li><p>The timeline still seems uncertain. That doesn&#39;t necessarily point to something nefarious. Without surveillance footage in the halls (which probably didn&#39;t exist), the timeline comes completely from witness statements. </p></li>

<li><p>He&#39;s one of the most hated people in the country right now. Not that surprising someone could try to hurt his estate if they had the means to. </p></li>
<li><p>Campos is a security guard who probably never expected to be in a position like this. Who knows what his personal issues might be and what he might be dealing with</p></li>
<li><p>From my understanding his car does have plates, just maybe expired tags. But I actually know a lot of people who live on low income and have nice cars. Sometimes they&#39;re gifts, hand-downs, or broken down cars bought for cheap that they fixed up. </p></li>
<li><p>Surveillance footage of him in the casino doesn&#39;t do anything. It&#39;s unnecessary. </p></li>
<li><p>He could&#39;ve been checking his cameras, thinking about his strategy, etc. Not sure what that means.</p></li>
<li><p>He&#39;s old and mostly a loner. Most of my extended family over 50 doesn&#39;t have social media save for the occasional Linkedin. Danley did have pictures of him with her on her Facebook, though.</p></li>

<p><em>Stephen Paddock was a professional gambler who made a living off of video poker (</em><em>needs source</em><em>) . A successful casino gambler can only be found riding unicorns. Supposedly a rich real estate guy, but no one knows of any holdings or transactions in his name (</em><em>needs source</em><em>). Throughout his employment career, he worked for the post office and the IRS (</em><em>needs source</em>*). It seems they pay extremely well since real estate investing needs quite a bit of seed money. *</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From ZeroHedge.com:</p>

<p>*Also, think about the geometrics of this:</p>

<p>1.) WINDOWS: The windows in his room were floor to ceiling. To fire down one would practically need to be standing at the edge of the window. Have you ever been to the edge of 32 stories? I have and it&#39;s fucking scary even with climbing equipment - let alone standing on the edge of 32 stories while shooting a rifle with a bump stock while the wind AND CURTAINS are blowing around you.</p>

<p>2.) RANGE OF MOTION: To use the bump stock fire you need range of motion to capture the kinetic energy of the recoil. Using a tripod or even a bipod would not allow that to happen. I suppose he could have taken a prone position and put the bipod on the edge but how the fuck do you burn through 1,000 rounds like that?</p>

<p>3.) BIPOD: Using a bipod would not have allowed him to get the same angle he needed to shoot down. Using a tripod? What, did he bolt it to the floor and run it like a door gunner from a helicopter gun ship? That&#39;s the closest comparable platform to consider.</p>

<p>4.) TIME: Even on full auto, one shooter couldn&#39;t do it. Once in the army my squad was tasked to burn off some surplus ammo (about 10K rounds) as it was the end of the Fiscal Year.</p>

<p>For about 12 hours we (8 guys) fired pretty much non stop on full auto with M-16s. We had to make sure not to burn out the barrels and let the rifles rest from time to time. No fucking way ONE SHOOTER is going to burn through 2,000 rounds in 10 minutes even on full auto. We would be lucky to get through 20 (30 round) mags an hour. It took us so long to burn off those 10,000 rounds we had to use parachute flares to light the range.</p>

<p>Fucking insanity to believe the MSM spin on this. There had to be more than one shooter to hit kill 50+ people from 500+ meters. And where did this asshole go for target practice? What ranges did he frequent? No one is going to pick up an AR platform and become &#39;super killer&#39; without a little practice and know how. *</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the view from his room, it doesn&#39;t look like you need to be standing right on the edge to get a good shot off to the event ground</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was using multiple preloaded guns and 100rd. Surefire mags (which he somehow got to work).  At 400RPM that&#39;s 15 seconds per mag.  10 guns (just a guess) that&#39;s 150 seconds of shooting.  Two mags per gun (2000 rounds), that&#39;s 5 minutes of actual shooting.  That leaves 5 minutes to switch between rifles and reload each one once.  Even your own math of 600 rounds per hour per shooter for 8 shooters would expend 10k rounds in a little over 2 hours, not 12 hours.  At 10 mags an hour per shooter, that is still only 250 minutes of range time to expend 10k rounds.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not going to get into the argument about multiple shooters.  but your point #4 is not one to use as proof.  It is not impossible for one individual with 10+ guns to shoot 2k round in 10 minutes.  As for where did he practice?  Las Vegas is surrounded by desert, most of that is public land and folks go out there to shoot all the time, no records, no traces.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not believing it at all! Your list is actually really short when it comes to the shit that doesn&#39;t add up with this case. There is an astonishing amount of inconsistencies in the story and it seems to only be getting worse. Until a few days ago I didn&#39;t know his house was broken into the night before the FBI searched it. Now knowing there is a shady &quot;security company&quot; watching over the house of the &quot;security guard&quot; just makes it even worse.</p>

<p>The sad part is we will never know the truth. If the media has one thing right it&#39;s that we may never know his motive. It&#39;s not that the FBI doesn&#39;t know what it is it&#39;s that they do know but just refuse to tell the public. This whole fucking world is going to shit man. I was reading an article this morning about some poor 17yr old girl in London that was raped 3 FUCKING TIMES by MULTIPLE men in LESS THEN A FUCKING HOUR. Before all the immigrants in London the chances of getting raped were probably pretty low and now the chances are so fucking high it can happen 3 times in an hour less and a lot of the times it will be multiple attackers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And I can&#39;t believe that &quot;normal people&quot; ever do any so-called fucked-up shit like this, because they quite simply don&#39;t. </p>

<p>The real attacks and tragedies as you call them are all the everyday run of the mill kind of ones. Small time robberies, muggings, and crimes of passion. In short &quot;the usual&quot; not the unusual and these highly unusual cases where there are obvious political implications that are parlayed into new or changed laws that someone is already standing by to make a massive amount of money off. </p>

<p>Psychopaths and sociopaths are responsible for the kind of fucked-up shit you&#39;re talking about and they&#39;re definitely not &quot;normal&quot;, even though they can do a good job of pretending to be.</p>

<p>Ordinary people can screw-up, make minor mistakes, maybe lose their temper under circumstances that anyone would, but to deliberately &quot;kill&quot; someone they don&#39;t know simply for kicks, or a bunch of people they don&#39;t know and who have never done anything to them, no, that&#39;s definitely not normal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay sorry. I worded it wrong with &#39;normal&#39;. I meant more so that people are capable of these things. Be it through mental illness or just a fuck you to the world. I just don&#39;t think people can accept that a dude just shot the shit out of a festival. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not saying that is definitively what happened, but there are people who won&#39;t accept that no matter what evidence you give them.</p>

<p>I do believe a man can walk in to a school and shoot  children for no real reason and I do believe Stephen Paddock acted alone. </p>

<p>Again, I didn&#39;t necessarily mean &#39;normal people&#39; as in your average fella. Sorry for the confusion man.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to gather as much information as I can on this case but nothing I have been shown has pointed to anything other than one man deciding to shoot a crowd of people for unknown reasons. I want to believe otherwise but unfortunately even through the &#39;evidence&#39; I&#39;ve combed on this sub, it hasn&#39;t convinced me otherwise. I know for the most part you&#39;ll think I&#39;m stupid, gullible or whatever but I hope you&#39;d give me the courtesy to believe I&#39;ve looked at this as critically as I can and can&#39;t come to a different conclusion. I&#39;m glad you have, though, and you can continue to question my narrative and make me do the same. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its an insult to the intelligence.   People who don&#39;t question this won&#39;t question anything.   Which is kind of what they want.   So there is that.    People are going to get dumb and dumber or they are going to get smart,  but that also means radicalized,  in many cases.   So,  part of this message is that anyone who is getting radicalized is dangerous.    This is almost elementary school tactics on a mass of people.   And Trump himself most certainly is.   Either that or he is certifiably demented.   Or both.   </p>

<p>The last time in history that this reminds me of was the fall of Rome when you had certifiable lunatics mixed with the shrewdest of deceivers.   Society was shafted,  that&#39;s the only sure part of it.</p>

<p>I think we can line up the debauched lunatics on one side and the Machiavellian crooks on the other,  but unfortunately,  a lot of these people at the top fit both descriptions.</p>

<p>What is really different this time is that the corporate world of consumption and production has taken on a more central role where the political minions are so owned that they are almost irrelevant.    Its military,  banking,  pharmaceutical,  entertainment,  and high tech corporations that are really calling the shots and running the world.    Problem is,  when the next downturn hits,  they are going to be pushing for war to deflect the attention from themselves,  who have been taking us to and really beyond the point of default.    Even the Soviet Union wasn&#39;t <em>this</em> rigged.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is there any precedent for casinos on the strip to release surveillance footage to news outlets? I could imagine that they might reflexively keep that stuff under wraps for a number of reasons, I could also imagine they would freely share footage of significant news events in the past.

    <div class="md"><p>SOMEBODY was in that room, on that night, with the concert going on below, for the specific reason of shooting up that crowd. I don&#39;t believe for a second that was a spur-of-the-moment thing. Remember the written down bullet trajectory formulations?</p>

<p>Indeed, this was quite a sophisticated op. Planned for a long while. Either scouted, or considered, at other concert locations. To me, this shuts down the, &quot;he&#39;s just a lunatic who snapped&quot; argument, too. He was one highly functional, thoughtful lunatic. Crazies go into the crowd and start spraying bullets indiscriminately.</p>

<p>What I still struggle with are:</p>

<p>Where&#39;s what should be a sizeable, known history of Paddock being a gun guy? Besides the purchases, where was he training? No one saw or knows about it?</p>

<p>Where are the friends who see Paddock every week, or a couple of times a week? Who can tell us about whether his mood or view of people was changing? We get instead brothers who haven&#39;t been with him in years?</p>

<p>Not buying how he had, and made, money. As others have mentioned here, video poker and slots is what you would do to laundry money; not make it.</p>

<p>His lack of a social imprint and odd finances seem to fit the characteristic of him being a spook for someone like the CIA, or part of organized crime. And when I think organized crime in the Southwestern U.S., I think Mexican drug cartels.</p>

<p>Dude also wouldn&#39;t have an long list of numbers to write out.  He wouldn&#39;t do calculations by hand, he&#39;d look at the chart of bullet drop for whatever gun he was firing, and click his scope/sight up for whatever distance. But that is irrelevant as you can&#39;t maintain a sight picture while bump firing. You&#39;re just trying to keep the gun from getting away from you.</p>

<p>There are obviously a lot of suspicious things about Paddock, but no social media really isn&#39;t one of them.   He also didn&#39;t have any kids... which is not suspicious, but probably the main reason seniors have social media.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It isn&#39;t healthy to make reaches like that. Trying to paint yourself as conspiracy theorist #1 will surely just lead to more misinformation and leaps that hold no real weight. I appreciate people trying to discover answers, but I keep reading things as fact where there is sufficient evidence to debunk the statements. Couple this with people making wild allegations and we cloud the truth more and just reject all conflicting reports. </p>

<p>The only way to look at these events are unbiased and impartially. At first I accepted the original narrative. After some research I&#39;m not convinced of that version, but it doesn&#39;t do anyone justice saying his name refers to cattle enclosures and everyone was fenced in. They were at a festival, if you&#39;ve ever been to an event like that you would be aware they are fenced off, it&#39;s the dudes name, there doesn&#39;t HAVE to be a nutjob behind it. Also, why would they give him a name like that if it was alphabets? Stephen McVegas Massacre Paddock. I don&#39;t get it, is it an inside joke so the guys who planned it can have a chuckle? You can make connections anywhere you look, please just use some critical thinking skills to decipher what makes more sense. </p>

Reading through this entire thread there are multiple instances of people contradicting your list and providing backed up sources to prove you wrong.

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with the sheirff we shouldn&#39;t have to spend so much time figuring out the timeline. 
First off Jesus should have a radio. He&#39;s a security guard. The maintenance guy has one if the security guard doesn&#39;t mgm should be made liable. Which brings me to my second point if Jesus has a radio the maintenance guy shouldn&#39;t be in that hallway. But okay let&#39;s say the maintenance guy doesn&#39;t hear the first shots fired at jesus and turns down the hallway that according to the him it was obvious to him that Jesus was hit and that he had to get to him.  How they made it out of the hallway is fuzzy to me but ok.
Third point it&#39;s mention on the police scanner that they wanna see cctv from the 29th and 32 floor. I&#39;d love to see the suspect drilling the stairwell door shut and the 200 rounds. While we are at it I&#39;d love to see the video of the shooter at the front desk of ny ny or the Audi with wires hanging out. I&#39;d like to know why the cops believed they were being fed diversions. 
And last thing this is hard to overcome but the service elevator thing is hard to believe I mean maybe because he was a high roller but according to Mr. Wynn the suspect made fairly modest bets but ok whatever let&#39;s say he had access there is no way they don&#39;t have cameras in there. Which lets say they don&#39;t then mgm would be liable for damages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok so I am not a regular visitor to this sub, so bear with me, but my god, do you guys not believe in citing your claims around here? If you want to be taken seriously, do the rest of us a favor and provide evidence (you know, the same evidence that brought you to the conclusions you&#39;ve come to here)... If your &quot;evidence&quot; is a gut feeling based upon previous events that you didn&#39;t bother to document or string together, then <em>you</em> are a big part of the problem, at least as far as winning people over to the way you see things. If you see trends and patterns, then document that shit! Then use that documentation to <em>cite</em> your claims. Provide evidence that otherwise skeptical people would not be capable of denying.</p>

<p>That said, just to start here, despite the agreeably shady nature and supposed (yet still uncited) points in your #3 question, I can imagine that there could be a huge number of reasons he might want/require security. From white supremacists to &quot;agent actors of the elite&quot; and so forth. </p>

<p>The second part of your 3rd question bears an <em>extremely</em> obvious answer: The dude clearly has a decent attorney (or team of attorneys). Nobody in their right minds should be talking to the press in such a circumstance.</p>

<p>Before I dive deeper, I&#39;ll leave this here for you to respond and go from there?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory:</p>

<p>He was a self radicalized ISIS sympathizer working with others to perform the nights chaos - a sleeper cell. Multiple shooters were positioned elsewhere and were complicit in the attack - please reference health rangers multiple shooter acoustic forensic study with his suggestions of other perches or locations. The plan stopped short for some reason, I&#39;m sure there were other phases involved. The security guard Jesus Campos is an x factor as he is either complicit himself, or at the very least knows more than the &quot;official&quot; story is allowing him to divulge - could be multiple shooters, or he knows this was an ISIS inspired highly coordinated sleeper cell attack, I don&#39;t know. </p>

<p>What I believe the FBI are intentionally doing, and without any great finesse, is to limit the outrage that would come if the public understood that this was an ISIS sleeper cell attack. What I mean is, they are saving face that they didn&#39;t see this coming, they are trying to limit the likelihood of other sleeper cells activating or other self radicalized individuals people taking action by not broadcasting this was a coordinated terrorist attack - trying to stop copy cats essentially, and at the same time mitigating any anti-islamic or anti-muslim revenge crime happening from the general public.</p>

<p>The FBI are lying and I believe their logic is both intended to mitigate all possible knock on effects from informing the public that a sleeper cell attack occurred - and basically could happen again at any point anywhere - and also mitigating backlash hate crimes against muslim communities. I do believe this is a deceitful but sociologically effective tactic however deeply frustrating to observers. </p>

<p>I do believe the FBI is doing a terrible job all round and I pity the american public as your institutions tend to lie directly to you and treat you like idiot children. </p>

<p>When I first saw this story I thought it was something like the anders breivik event, an ideological attack against the right, a left wing nut job. But that seems unlikely - Paddock went to exceptionally great lengths to act covertly. I doubt any info will turn up on him - I would look at the strain the local authorities are under as they are being forced to lie, someone will crack.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A quick observation. I posted a couple of comments on this on some YouTube videos but I believe Reddit is the proper way to spread the word.</p>

<p>I was watching some timeline videos of the shooting that people edited together and one of the final moments after the shooting was done and Paddock was captured, you hear a single POP in a different tone than the gun shots. The woman in the video looks up to Mandalay Bay and says, &quot;There&#39;s glass falling from Mandalay Bay...&quot; then a second later, one more POP. Could this be the windows finally being blown open? If so, the  shooting didn&#39;t take place from these windows and would explain the lack of videos showing any broken windows or muzzle flash from the 32nd floor windows. It would also suggest multiple shooters and confirm a cover up. </p>

<p>If anybody has a suggestion for me to share at a different sub Reddit, please do. Also, if anybody has a link to one of the videos I&#39;m referring to, please share it. I&#39;ll come back and post it if I come across it again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One question I&#39;ve not yet seen asked;  was the alarm intentionally triggered? Which door caused it - the second door at stairway entrance? It just seems odd, with all the meticulous planning, that Stephen Paddock would have unknowingly set off an alarm by leaving a door open/obstructed or whatever the case. Was he unaware that doing so would lead to security being alerted?</p>

<p>If I&#39;ve missed this detail being expanded upon here or elsewhere please xlarify, as i&#39;malso not clear on which door - or whos -  triggered the alarm. Only that it was a door on the same floor as Paddock&#39;s suite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is confusing.  In the interview, Campos said he went to check an alarm that was set off by the stair doors staying open.  Door are suppose to stay closed and if they&#39;re kept open for a while, it sets off an alarm.  He says he went up from 31st to 32nd floor by stairs and found the 32nd floor door wouldn&#39;t open (ie barricaded).  So he went up one more floor and came out and came down through another set of stairs to 32nd to find the door jammed. </p>

<p>NOW, how can the &quot;door open&quot; alarm go off when the door was &quot;bracketed shut&quot;  It&#39;s a mystery to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, my understanding is that there are  two doors at that stairwell - so you open one and a few feet beyond open another to gain access to the hallway. I was assuming that one was bracketed and the other was left open / propped. Initially iirc they said that the alarm was not set off by Paddocks door, and that it was a coincidental occurance (as in, not related/ a guest was having &quot;door issues&quot;). Then it was &quot;not a guest door&quot; meaning either a stairwell/exit, or - one thought I had at the time - a &quot;maintenance closet&quot;  (I worked in a hotel and we had these on every floor).</p>

<p>Regardless I don&#39;t think they have specified exactly which door and the specific state the door was in to trigger the alarm. Every little detail is important and I highly doubt this one has not been examined by investigators.. but, like much of the details that came out quickly after the incident, this one has been left to speculation and I&#39;m not seeing anyone question this one in particular. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess based on the few details given, is that perhaps Paddock had to prop the door open at some point during the process of installing the bracket. So, perhaps it was open too long at that point, which triggered the alarm, and either Ramos deployed immediately and/or the alarm stays on even after the door is properly shut</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably showing up at the Ellen Degeneres Show - who has contracts with Mandalay Bay for slot machines</p>

<p>“Campos drew more media scrutiny last week when, without explanation, he backed out of scheduled television interviews with Fox News and four other outlets, and also fell out of contact with the Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America union, which was helping him coordinate the appearances. He had posted signs outside his home reading “no trespassing” and “no media on property,” according to the Review-Journal.</p>

<p>Because he was not seen publicly, various news reports referred to him as “missing” and “vanished,” creating an air of mystery around a key witness to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.</p>

<p>In the interview broadcast Wednesday, Campos did not explain why he chose the DeGeneres show to tell his story as opposed to all the other shows vying for the first interview.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a theory.  Paddock has a video poker &quot;hack.&quot;  That is, someone (accomplice) programmed the the machines to allow coded bets to trigger royal flushes.  For example, if you bet 3,1,4,1,5,1,5,5,5,5,5,5,3,2,3,5 then it gives you a royal flush.  This is how people &quot;hack&quot; slot machines/video poker, etc.  </p>

<p>So, he has an accomplice.  The accomplice is the programmer who wrote the code for the machines. Such programmer are not allowed in casinos.  Even then, your accomplice (Paddock) can&#39;t simply go in and bet the &quot;magic code&quot; every time -- they will arrest you quickly.</p>

<p>If you had such a code, you would need to play video poker like a lot --, lose a lot, win a lot.  Ultimately, unlike all the suckers, the odds are in your favor.  But if you tip them too much, the casino will wise up and investigate.   Exactly how elaborate the hack was could have made it extremely difficult to detect.  The proof that such a hack exists is that &quot;lifetime winner&quot; average. </p>

<p>Either his accomplice or the casino tried to black mail him. By the &quot;casino,&quot; I just mean that some in casino management called him and said, &quot;Hey, we have been looking at your betting and we know you have a cheat.  You will start playing fair (i.e. losing) or we are going to arrest you.   </p>

<p>Paddock comes up with a way to screw the casino.  His intent would be to maximize loses at the casino, so setup the lawsuits, etc.  </p>

<p>Ultimately, his world was coming to an end because it was going to be revealed that he really wasn&#39;t the smartest man alive -- he just had a cheat code.  The massive amount of guns were not necessary other than to assign additional liability to the hotel.  Likely Paddock felt he was dead anyway, as &quot;nobody beats the house.&quot;  He played out his &quot;comped&quot; weekend and settled the score.  What he is hiding was the fact that he was a simple cheat.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh.. really, that doesn&#39;t even matter. I have a friend that works at a college for $12 an hour, single mom, does side gigs, bought her house, eventually saved enough to buy another, which ended up paying for her to get another.. now she has a steady source of income that requires little to no work, which can be reinvested in more property, which exponentially makes her more money.</p>

<p>10 years from now, she could be pretty well off, even retired. 20+ years from now she could be a millionaire, if she keeps making investments.</p>

<p>People don&#39;t realize it doesn&#39;t take much seed money, just a lot of effort and smart investments, which in turn generate more money.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One theory that fits almost everything so far was that he was running guns and the hotel room setup was for a sale. It explains why he has so many guns in the hotel room despite not needing very many, it explains why he was shot in the chest when the deal went south instead of a normal suicide wound in the head or mouth, it explains why he didn&#39;t seem to have an escape plan, it explains the presence of the cameras on the hallway and inside, it explains his strange lifestyle. It&#39;s possible the buyers were planning on attacking the crowd or it&#39;s possible one of the buyers went psycho.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is not typical in my experience. I know people who work part time in a union and they don&#39;t even pay full dues. They definitely get perks too. Anecdotes aside I don&#39;t even see what benefit it would be to the union to insist only full time employees are allowed...they would benefit from more members receiving less assistance from them. </p>

<p>In the case of security unions it seems especially unlikely to me that they would require full-time to join. Security is an industry where you have uncertain hours for a lot of jobs. Would unions just not be interested in unionizing these people doing shows or details and such? That doesn&#39;t seem very likely to me given that unions want everyone to join pretty much...they want every industry unionized because that gives them more power and money.</p>

<p>Other than engaging in pedo acts (which probably what he did) he wanted one last final &quot;bang&quot; just to feel something. to feel alive, to feel like he&#39;s actually real, </p>

<p>And shooting down a whole crowd of people was the act that needed to test his sociopathic behavior.  </p>

<p>That act finally did it for him. He felt alive, he felt human, he felt remorse.  At first the gunfire was easy, it was exhilarating, but after a little while, reality kicking in, he&#39;s on a downhill roller coaster to hell. He was planning to shoot it out with SWAT, but he started getting scared, he felt his mortality like he never did before. He is now a mass murder, a shooter, his name will forever be a blight on US History. Legislation will be passed under his name. His actions will resonate like 9/11.   </p>

<p>He doesn&#39;t want to go anymore. The idea of a SWAT team coming in blasting him full of holes doesn&#39;t sound as cool as he once fantasized about it.</p>

<p>He hears something in the hallway.  Is it them? is this how it ends? Screw this, and he takes the easy way out by shooting himself. </p>
