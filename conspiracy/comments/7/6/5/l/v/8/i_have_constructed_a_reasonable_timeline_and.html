        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The following is what I believe to be a possible timeline of events resulting in the reactions, lies, and changes in the story and timeline provided by the FBI via LVMPD. I try to deal with only facts only and sourceable information. These cannot be contested, and keep the “tin foil hat” responses to a minimum, as it is hard to argue facts. In law enforcement there is a “totality of the circumstances” concept that is often applied. This is no different. I apologize in advance for the use of apostrophes, but since so much information appears to be false and/or entirely made up, I have no choice but to use them appropriately. You’ll see what I mean. Again, the following is what I believe to be the reasoning for what we’re seeing play out. Let me know your thoughts.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
<strong>Oct 1 –</strong> Mass shooting occurs. 58 dead plus “Paddock.” We have yet to confirm Paddock is the subject in the “leaked” photo, but for the sake of the rest of this post, we’ll assume it is. Paddock is shown dead in room 32135 with an obvious gunshot wound to the head, and possibly the torso (details unknown). Source of the scene photos are still unknown.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
FBI has to cover suspicious details of death and incident for unknown reasons.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
FBI claims the shooting stopped because a security guard named “Jesus Campos” was checking a door alarm, encountered Paddock, Paddock shot him in the leg, and then Paddock commit suicide, thus stopping the shooting. Yay hero “Campos”.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
Over the next few days, numerous questions come about. One of those questions is that if the mass shooting is already underway, why is security checking on a door alarm while shots are actively being fired (and presumably reported)?<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
<strong>Oct 9 –</strong> FBI retracts initial timeline and says security arrived <em>before</em> shooting.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
MGM (and everyone using their head) asks, “Wait a second. If he was shot 6 minutes before the shooting, why didn’t he notify anyone (i.e. police) which could have stopped the shooting around the same time it started? And why didn’t anyone in the hotel that would have obviously heard the shooting call 911 at that time?”<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
<strong>Oct 10 –</strong> Public starts demanding video or Paddock in the hotel. FBI states Paddock used the service elevator, possibly as a cover for when they claim there is no video in the service elevator and no video of Paddock in the hotel.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
<strong>Oct 11 –</strong> FBI knows that “Campos” isn’t real and too much attention is weighing on his existence. Introduce Stephen Schuck. Sole purpose: validate existence of Campos. Schuck attempts to validate existence of “Campos” on 32nd floor upon finding him there when he himself was dispatched for a stuck door. FBI produces audio track of Schuck taking fire, but no mention of “Campos” and the entire audio track sounds fabricated (unverified). Again, this brings questions as to why police were not notified of the verified shooting on the 32nd floor if Schuck and Campos are indeed real and taking fire before the mass shooting began. Also, it was initially told that “Campos” provided a key card so LVMPD could begin clearing the rooms, yet, in Schuck’s interview he states <em>he</em> gave officers his access card (after he oddly decided go down to the bottom floor, deactivate elevators, and return to the 32nd floor to provide officers the access card. I find that part extremely odd.)<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
MGM knows they will have lawsuits galore if it is found that shooting took place 6 minutes prior to the mass shooting and MGM security (that Schuck allegedly notified per the recording) failed to notify 911, which would have expedited LVMPD’s response directly to the target room, 32135. MGM, in an attempt to cover their ass, responds with the following release:<br/>
&amp;nbsp;  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publically (sic), and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate,” - MGM Resorts spokesperson Debra DeShong.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&amp;nbsp;  </p>

<p><strong>Oct 12 –</strong> “Campos” was to do interviews this day, but cancelled. It is being reported that his whereabouts are unknown. The tales of the elusive “Campos” continues. Reporter Laura Loomer, again, arrived outside of Campos’s house and was told that his family has a gag order. <a href="https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/918689132137791488"><strong>(source)</strong></a> It is extremely odd that his family has a gag order, yet Schuck, who was allegedly in the same hallway and possibly last to encounter Paddock, was on national TV on the TODAY show telling his side of the story. Why is he free to talk, but “Campos’s” family is not?<br/>
&amp;nbsp;  </p>

<hr/>

<p>&amp;nbsp;<br/>
<strong>Other mysteries…</strong><br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
On Oct 11 it was released that on Oct. 8, Paddock’s Reno house miraculously got burglarized over the weekend. How, or better yet, <em>why</em>, was the house not under tight security, when you consider the FBI themselves said they could “discern additional evidence as a result of that revisit,” when questioned whether or not the FBI along with LMVPD would revisit the house.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
It wasn’t until photos leaked online of in-room service and of valet records that the FBI updated their timeline to state Paddock arrived on Sept. 25 and not the Sept. 28. Note that on the valet records, it does show that Paddock had room 32135 as of Sept 25. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bI9y2MF.jpg"><strong>(source)</strong></a><br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
Note: Upon thorough review and syncing of numerous videos of the incident, it was discovered that only the “taxi cab video” captured gunfire that wasn’t heard in any other video. Those particular 22 shots sounded distant and unique in comparison to all other gunfire, which many are inclined to believe were the shots likely fired down into the hallway. (45 to 52 seconds in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEf7HObspB0&amp;amp;t=44s"><strong>this video</strong></a>). These shots occur approximately 4 minutes into the shooting, indicating that if they are indeed shots into the hotel, security would have been shot mid-way through the shooting. There is nothing to substantiate any shooting within the hotel 6 minutes prior to the mass shooting, as the FBI is stating in their recent timeline.<br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
All the above has taken place while there is no credible evidence to support the existence of “Jesus Campos.” There are no photos, online profiles, social media accounts (funny, neither did Paddock), interviews, <em>anything</em> to show he exists. Online records with Nevada Private Investigator’s Licensing Board do not list a Jesus Campos on record, only a Larry Jesus Campos who isn’t licensed to be an <em>armed</em> security officer. It is unconfirmed if this is <em>the</em> Jesus Campos, but worth noting. <a href="https://nevadapilb.glsuite.us/Clients/NVPI/Public/EmployeeDetails.aspx?EntityID=1234104&amp;amp;LicenseID=175870"><strong>(source)</strong></a><br/>
&amp;nbsp;<br/>
Add the fact that “Campos’s” alleged residence is being guarded by one armed male who works for On Scene, a private security company whose business license expired Jan. 31, 2017. <a href="http://nvsos.gov/sosentitysearch/CorpDetails.aspx?lx8nvq=MAWMf5RbAmui9mwqZ7V6Iw%253d%253d&amp;amp;nt7=0"><strong>(source)</strong></a> The male guard refuses to confirm or deny if he is employed with the FBI, CIA or DHS. <a href="http://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2017/10/reporter-visits-home-mandalay-bay-hero-jesus-campos-armed-security-guard-shady-firm-meets-yard/"><strong>(source)</strong></a></p>

<p>That&#39;s not what he said happened.</p>

<p>He said his supervisor gave him his keys. He then went down to the basement so he could disable the elevators. He then made his way back to the 32nd floor so he could return the keys to his supervisor,  so his supervisor could give them to the police.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are plenty of photos and videos of bodies, and you&#39;ve seen photos of the room. Police do not release jack to the media unless there&#39;s a compelling and specific police purpose. e.g. if rhey need help with an ID. They investigate and turn the info over to the DA or similar. Releasing things to the media fucks up a case. It&#39;s not even their tape to release, btw. The tapes belong to the casino. Nearly every &#39;official&#39; security tape of this type that you&#39;ve ever seen has come out years later via FOIA.</p>

<p>Unless someone has another explanation for the sounds of gunfire, the broken glass, and the stampede, all happening 40 mins after the Mandalay Bay shooting, I will believe that someone shot up the Bellagio.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not what I said, now is it?  I said they don&#39;t answer to the internet. The LVMPD is <em>accountable</em> to their county DA and state AG. Those positions are elected positions, so in that regard, in a roundabout way, you could say the police &quot;answer to&quot; the local residents, but only insofar as you&#39;re using answer to as a synonym for accountability. And they sure as hell do not answer to and are not accountable to Joe Internet, wherever the fuck he might happen to live. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you know very much about law and government, and it seems you know even less about how police investigations work. These demands you&#39;re making are just unreal. You may as well be bitching that the Sheriff won&#39;t give you a back rub. It&#39;s as ludicrous an idea as your belief that the police have an obligation to produce whatever evidence you want to see, whenever you want to see it. </p>

<p>Within hours of the attack, this sub was filled with allegations of cover up &amp; impropriety. Do you comprehend how stupid that makes conspiracy theorists look? From the git-go, there&#39;s this attitude of, &quot;nothing is real until I am personally convinced that it&#39;s real.&quot; That&#39;s not being smart. That is not being intelligent. Not even close.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think some or all of the pictures you&#39;re referring to were leaked, not released, but in any event... Do you honestly not understand how flawed your reasoning is?  Why don&#39;t you email me a picture of your drivers license, to prove you&#39;re not a cop? Oh, you won&#39;t, I guess you have something to hide, then. You must be a cop. Otherwise you&#39;d prove you&#39;re not. </p>

<p>You have no right to demand to see anything. It is ridiculous of you to believe that the police have to prove everything to you. It doesn&#39;t work that way and it&#39;s never worked that way. You are not a judge or jury. You don&#39;t get to direct some distant police force from behind your keyboard. </p>

<p>I&#39;m honestly not trying to be a jerk, and I am genuinely sorry if I&#39;m coming across that way. I don&#39;t know how to be any more clear. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The drivers license analogy is a terrible one. That&#39;s my personal info. Why would I send my personal data to a stranger?  How is this even comparable?</p>

<p>You think they were leaked. I am not sure if they were leaked either but I don&#39;t believe those photos were discretely taken. They were well taken photos that suggests someone pulled out their device and took good photos and wasn&#39;t really worried who saw them. Which suggests to me they could of possibly been strategically &quot;leaked&quot;. </p>

<p>Target is a private establishment, I&#39;m not asking for MB to show anything. It&#39;s not close to the same thing.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just me behind a keyboard, it&#39;s the majority of Americans. They have no problem intentionally releasing false information but for some reason struggle to release anything legit. They are public servants, when they stand at that podium during a press conference they should be sharing all the info they can that will have no bearing on the investigation. If not, then don&#39;t stand up there. </p>

<p>With your attitude, we shouldn&#39;t demand anything out of govt. just shut up and let them do their jobs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What?  Dude, every elevator you&#39;ve ever been in has what&#39;s usually called fireman mode. It&#39;s manual operation. That&#39;s how he got back up. Hitting emergency stop on elevators activates an audible alarm. They shut them off properly. No one thinks the police were delayed in entering the room because the manager didn&#39;t have his keys. I doubt the key would have opened thr room door anyway, that&#39;s what you use a key card for. </p>

<p>Your quest to look like Sherlock Holmes is beginning to border on ridiculous. You&#39;re making uneducated assertions and fantastical leaps. </p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing there are two separate keys. The maintenance keys are probably analog/metal keys, different from the digital master room keycard, which Jesus had on him and have the police so they could evacuate guests. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know security guards wouldn&#39;t also have one of those analog keys though. What if there&#39;s a power outage and they digital keycards don&#39;t work? </p>

<p>Matt Lauer: What happened when the police arrived, Stephen, we&#39;re you still there?</p>

<p>Stephen Schuck: I was still there, yes, uh, we kind of were directing them like &#39;It&#39;s this hallway, at the end of the hallway.&#39; Um, me and uh, Jesus... we never saw the door open, so we thought he was shooting from the peephole in the door. We were just telling police that, and then, my supervisor was there, he handed me his master keys, and I ran down and shut off all the guest elevators, and stopped guests on the uh, basement floor. Just let em know &#39;we have an incident upstairs, you know, stay down here.&#39; And then I made my way back up to the 32nd floor to give him his keys so he could give them to the police, so they could use them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree. The logical explanation for the majority of this is clearly MGM trying to avoid liability.  They (and Steve Wynn) knew right away that he was in the service elevator - probably solo - and that&#39;s a huge problem among who knows what other &quot;perks&quot; allowed him to get away with it. (valet bringing up his damn bags, for example?).  The less footage, the less security lapses to find.   </p>

<p>Local FBI, LVMPD, and the casinos work closely together for obvious reasons and have incentive to circle the wagons.  So, there&#39;s been lies and shifting stories - there&#39;s no doubt.  </p>

<p>BUT, interspersed there are also unrelated weird coincidences and communication breakdowns that when lumped in with everything else start to lead people to much more nefarious plots.  </p>

<p>At the end of the day though, a loner retiree comp player got mad, maybe got mad at casinos, snapped, and acted largely alone - exploiting a system he knew very well to pull it off.  </p>

<p>The casinos don&#39;t want to be held liable for that exploitation and the powers-that-be in Vegas have agreed to  cover up evidence when necessary.  The only thing we may never know is which of the facts above are the coverups vs. the coincidences. </p>
