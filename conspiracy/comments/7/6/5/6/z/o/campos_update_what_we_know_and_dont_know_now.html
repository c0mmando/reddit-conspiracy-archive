       The last 72 hours has seen a lot of focus on the man at the center of mystery and controvery, security guard Jesus Campos. Here’s a breakdown of what is known, what is speculation, and what is inaccurate or debunked theory, only focusing on Mr. Campos work status.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, I’d like to point out that I initially dropped comments into 4-5 /conspiracy threads indicating there was no Jesus Campos in the Nevada Board database for guards/security practioners. That was innacurate - as I only searched the licensed guard section. User Elesium is to be credited with the find of a registered employee by the name of Larry Jesus Campos. There is a second database for registered guards and I completely missed that.
      </p>
      <p>
       In between my inital comments and Elesiums post re:LJC - some comments popped up assuming the record for LJC had been fabricated and entered to the database after we started looking. THIS IS FALSE.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not know that the registration for LJC represents the same Jesus Campos at the center of the current investigation, so posts and comments related to this are speculation based on a theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       What has surfaced this morning in MSM - are reports that Campos had multiple interviews with media scheduled, but flaked on all of them. Fox’s Hannity ran a bit quoting Campos’ union rep
“Campos is represented by the International Union, Security, Police and Fire Professionals of America, which did not respond to requests for comment from Fox News earlier this week.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The utterance of ‘union’ may (speculation) indicate that JC actually was/is directly employed by MB - as security at MB organized and unionized with SPFPA in Dec 2016. Reference here -
       <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/security-officers-union-at-mandalay-bay-votes-to-sign-3-year-contract/">
        https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/casinos-gaming/security-officers-union-at-mandalay-bay-votes-to-sign-3-year-contract/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Keep in mind - just because MSM is talking about a union rep, does NOT guarantee that JC was directly employed by MB. There are other contract crews who are also unionized in Nevada.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do we REALLY know?  Not a whole lot that can be credibly validated.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do we NOT know? Who is JC and why is he such a mysterious enigma. 
This is where our speculation realky takes off - and even MSM is pointing out that the lack of credible, consistent information leads people to speculate and stir up so many unproven theories, timelines, and rumors that nobody can make heads or tails if anything now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don’t have a specific conspiracy theory, and thats for good reason. Developing a theory based on speculation is detrimental to fact finding. Once you set your mind to a specific theory, confirmation bias takes over and you only see what validates your theory. Good way to set yourself up for missing key facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m just looking at avenues that can possibly be confirmed, for information that seems sketchy. Right now, everything about JC seems obnoxiously sketchy and I’d simply like to understabd why. The more we dig, the sketchier it gets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Assuming JC is a real person and not a false flag / distraction, it would appear he’s really under a lot of pressure/heat/scrutiny - and as a fellow human being, I don’t want to do anything to add to that. There are many other holes in current info to focus on, that don’t lead us to investigate actual humans (or made up ones) so I’m going to shift away from JC. If the dude is real, and not nefariously involved, I hope he can find some peace and healing. Everyone impacted needs and deserves it.
      </p>

       Now, about the shooter, who is being portrayed as a serious loner, having multiple cell phones with him, and a ton of chemicals in his car that can be used for explisive purpose.... who was he calling from multiple phones? Or, were they being used as phones at all?  (Speculation topic II coming soon to a reddit /conspiracy board near you.....)

       I think it's pretty safe to say he's not made up, Troy the security guard has been protecting his front door for days now.

       It's fine for you to shift away, but finding out more about Campos is still an important part of the investigation.

       Regarding the LJC listed in the database.  They're in Fontana CA which is 3 hours from Vegas.  That's one hell of a commute if LJC is actually JC.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I saw mention that LJC is in his 60's.  If accurate, that coupled with not living anywhere near Vegas would certainly seem to indicate LJC is not JC.
      </p>
      <p>
       This may also lend support to JC being an actual MB employee.

       Indeed the registration shows Fontana. Having worked in this industry, I can say its not uncommon to ship a group of guards off to work a location that isn’t local to their current assignment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: LJC being in his 60’s - can you provide more than ‘I saw mention’? To validate that?  I’m not doubting you, just trying to keep info to either complete speculation, or sourced info.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree that those details, if accurate make it much less likely LJC is the same guy as JC.
      </p>
      <p>
       PS - Fox News now has a fairly blurry photo of a dude on their story about JC bolting before interviews. One would assume their postiong is supposed to represent JC.
      </p>
      <p>
       PSS - HTF does someone 12 days out from being shot in the leg just up and bolt out of a building and ‘disappear’ (Fox says whereabouts unknown)?!?
