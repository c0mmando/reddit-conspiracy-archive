       That makes sense. If Weinstein is really out to get Trump, it stands to reason that Trump would fight back. It raises a couple of questions, though. Like, what is Weinstein going to put out that would damn Trump enough to ruin his whole life/career?

       Right - why is he doing movies that put him in the line of fire if he has all these skeletons in his closet? 
It's horrible to think about, but it must mean Trump has done something worse then systemic sexual assault and abuse. Cause Weinstein wouldn't have blinked an eye at that.

       Or it's a diversion. Look at how bad Trump is, he walked back stage at the Miss Teen USA contest. Yeah, thats bad and gross. Weinstein actually assaulted these kids/people. I don't think he views one as worse than the other, just that "Trump did this, and no one is going to say anything about me because they'll be black-balled."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a testimate to the ego involved in this whole thing. People with money and/or power fear losing their money and power. Thats why they do such shitty things to stay in a position of power, and keep making money.

       That's a good point, I underestimate the egos on these people. It's weird to think this guys living in a glass house throwing stones around, but I guess that's a testament to how much power they have and how safe they feel in their depravity.

       I am saying he doesn't, but not for the strawman reasons you state. But because those agencies are filled with bias political hacks that leak shit to the press constantly. So yes....we would know...

       Nope, I am suggesting that the bias political hacks in the intelligence agencies have a clear axe to grind with Trump specifically based on the amount of leaking involving Trump specifically. So if there was more about Trump we would know it.

       Forgive me for trying to clarify and understand your point...
But I would argue that the hacks have been non-partisan. Especially considering the focus on Hillary and Podesta. Nothing has been leaked that did any damage at all to Trump.  He's sitting pretty right now.

       What focus on Hillary and Podesta? You mean wikileaks? What does that have to do with our intelligence agencies? Nothing has been leaked that did any real damage to Trump because there isn't anything of consequence to leak... that's the entire point of this conversation.... You really just need to let it go an realize you are being manipulated into hating Trump..

       lol I hate Trump for the things he's done and the things he stands for. Things that are out in the open. I think 16 accusations of sexual assault and an open admission to regularly doing so is a good place to start.

       People hated Trump before he ran for President, pal. He didn't just suddenly appear on the national scene two years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's a piece of shit, and has been for years. You're handwaving a power abuser and self-admitted sexual assaulter.

       Actually it's the opposite, no body had a problem with Trump until he ran against a Democrat. Then all the sudden he was magically a racist.

       So your source is 1 person, and that 1 person is someone that has a long running feud? Doesn't seem very objective or the most honest source of information. I bet there is more than 1 person in your life that would insult you if asked. Please dude, you are so brainwashed.

       Donald Trump has been in the public eye for literally decades, and people have hated him for decades (including me). And that isn't "some guy," that's the editor of SPY and later Vogue.

       I'm old, man. I used to listen to Stern. He wasn't on Stern because he was a cool dude who everyone liked, he was on Stern all the time because he's a fucking clown, a caricature of a rich piece of shit.

       Again, my only point is that he's been in the public eye for decades, and people have hated him for decades. He wasn't an unknown prior to running, and people have disliked him foreeeever. He's a shitty reality tv star. That's it. You can't seem to handle that, so you plug your ears and pretend you don't know how to read.

       Or it's a diversion. Look at how bad Trump is, he walked back stage at the Miss Teen USA contest. Yeah, thats bad and gross. Weinstein actually assaulted these kids/people. I don't think he views one as worse than the other, just that "Trump did this, and no one is going to say anything about me because they'll be black-balled."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a testimate to the ego involved in this whole thing. People with money and/or power fear losing their money and power. Thats why they do such shitty things to stay in a position of power, and keep making money.

       Forgive me for trying to clarify and understand your point...
But I would argue that the hacks have been non-partisan. Especially considering the focus on Hillary and Podesta. Nothing has been leaked that did any damage at all to Trump.  He's sitting pretty right now.

       lol I hate Trump for the things he's done and the things he stands for. Things that are out in the open. I think 16 accusations of sexual assault and an open admission to regularly doing so is a good place to start.
