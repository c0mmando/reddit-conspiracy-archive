       With the growing number of people coming forward with testimonials and accusations regarding Weinstein, it's hard to imagine that all these people are paid conspirators part of a larger plan to rid Hollywood of one man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible Weinstein was blackmailed into performing heinous acts to serve as a guarantor that he would keep "deeper" and "darker" secrets for higher-ups?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it's possible he agreed to a blackmail situation, and attempted to break free of, or share with the public, said hypothesised  agreement, and is being framed for acts he did not wish to commit in the first place?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the Harvey Weinstein story is just a cover-up to distract us from something going on? If so, what is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the general public is being brainwashed/ hypnotised by this news? Why or why not?

       Weinstein obviously did something to piss off someone powerful. Or the MSM would be ignoring this. But he's also obviously a fucking creep. Did he go after the wrong guy's daughter? That would be my first guess.

       He's just a horndog,  and women are desperate for fame and will do just about anything to get it. He saw an opportunity and though he could get some sex from their desperation for fame.
      </p>
      <p>
       If he was thinner I think these Hollywood whores.would have fucked him without a problem for the fame.

       I agree with your theory that he's just a horn-dog. He's like the gas station in the middle of nowhere: he knows he can bargain a high price because he knows people will pay it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Women have come forth and reported his abuse, and have been silenced/ignored for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you wonder
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       was working to cover up those women's testimonies, and
       <em>
        why they're all surfacing *
       </em>
       now?***
      </p>
      <p>
       The women who have come forth and shared testimony have all said in similar words "I was afraid he would ruin my career".
      </p>
      <p>
       Well someone has come forth and ruined Harvey Weinstein's career, and I want to know why.

       Definitely a good theory worth researching, however, if you do some researching, you'll find that the Rothschild family owns every major news outlet. They can/will/ and
       <strong>
        constantly
       </strong>
       command any news outlet to tell any story in which ever light best suits their prerogative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since they own every major bank, they control entirely what every country/government/major corporation, they control who's "in" and who's "out".
      </p>
      <p>
       Harvey Weinstein is a molester, a rapist, and a snake, and he's currently on the who's "out" list.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason why he's on that list though.

       I may be seeking a job, but if my prospective boss was to take advantage of my situation and use it for his own sexual gain, that would make him a rapist and me a victim. That would not make me a 'job seeking whore'.

       Some of my thoughts:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         If 40+ women have come out this quickly, there must be hundreds.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Noticed lots of others have made claims of abuse this week about others in the industry without naming names. If this was truly groundbreaking, the celebs would list countless other names, but they are still in fear and entrapped by their industry.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Look at the women in his films who are quiet. Look at the men in the industry who are quiet.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did the story get chosen to be broken now? It helps the news cycle move on from LV.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       I'm not sure about your theories, but they're thought provoking -- it wouldnt surprise me, anything goes in Hollywood with that much power and money.

       He's a sexual predator who abuses his power. The world is full of people like him. This isn't rocket science. It isn't even rickshaw science. When there's such a huge power gap between victim and assailant, like there is here, it is very difficult to bring the perp to justice. It can take decades, if it ever happens at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       In nearly every major sex-related scandal you can think of, it started with a crack that opened the floodgates to decades of abuse. From Penn State to Bill O'Reilly to Roger Ailes to Bill Clinton to Gary Condit etc. Victims blame themselves, they figure no one will believe them, they don't want to ruin their career, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And at the same time, powerful people, especially famous people, really are targeted by liars and scammers, and by disgruntled folks looking for revenge. So you can have a situation where this goes on for years, essentially covered up, even though no one around the predator thinks they're covering it up or is trying to cover it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a tough problem to solve. That's why smart people &amp; organizations aim to avoid creating problem situations in the first place. That's why if you're a lady &amp; happen to have a male doc, you'll never be alone together. A nurse will always be present. If you're a lawyer, there are professional responsibility rules regarding relationships that you should or must follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's any conspiracy going on with Weinstein, and there's nothing unusual about the timing. This is how it always goes. First a crack, then the levy breaks.

       I'm still trying to work out in my head what his brother could've had to gain by finally outing him. Or what else he's sitting on that he needs a lead in for. Miramax took a massive hit with this so something pretty important must be at stake.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe he played a role in the story breaking. None whatsoever. He's feeling victimized, which for a successful sociopath is an uncommon experience. They generally don't permit situations to go this far and risk humiliation. I'm confident it was a surprise to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't believe it's a cover up or a distraction but I do believe it's leading to something bigger. The man has been a known sexual predator for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope it's an entry point into exposing the pedophilia next, which will be taken much more seriously on the heels of something like this. It's sad that on it's own the pedo shit couldn't break out and shock the world, but it being a much touchier subject than sexual assault of grown ups, this story could soften the ground and make people more receptive to it's truth.

       I think the infection of that corrupted industry, like many industries, was allowed to happen by collective inaction and with some assistance from those who benefit from its exposure to push an agenda.  That agenda exists to maintain the existing power imbalance.  This scandal, which will surely grow in scale, is a strawman.  The underlying agenda will continue to perpetuate division particularly on gender lines.  This was part of the plan.  If the end result of this and the ensuing scandals is more authoritarianism, more codified gender division,  more reinforcement of gender stereotype then the plan will have succeeded.  Know them by their acts.

       It is fake news. Everybody is making money off of it. So they don't want scandal to stop. CNN, FOX, MSNBC, local paper they all are making billions off advertisement of the controversy. When he was making million dollar films for you enjoy. You didn't have problem with him. Now some promiscuous women don't want fuck her way in a blockbuster movie anymore. You people have problem with intimate job interviews. It is witch hunt, shadow trial and secret trial in the public media sphere to find guilty before he even has court date. They have no evidence on him. It just women saying he openly giving out free rides to top if you fucked him. People saying I said no but he told me stand there. So stood while he openly exposed himself and masterbated. Then all sudden she is celebrity over night from that jerk off session. Now that she get more famous off being devil advocate and tear him down. She searching for more fame telling off intimate encounter. If it was some quiet small town private case nobody would care.
