       I believe the security guard went up to this room by himself for a reason. I worked at major hotels in the past, security is always paired up. So for this security guard to go the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay in the middle of the night by himself and knock on the shooters door before the shooting occurred is odd. In addition, all security guards have radios and cell phones. For the security guard not to call anyone before or after he got shot and took the police that long is absurd. Also, the fact the shooter had access to the service elevator is strange. Side note, the security guard is an armed guard as well which could play out to be the 2nd shooter. Since it does take many hours and hours of training to be that good of a shooter. To shoot from the 32nd floor down at concert few blocks away, middle of the night, loud concert, people moving around, noise effects, light effects, wind, etc. and to do what the shooter did. And to have only one piece of napkin for notes. Someone in the military would be capable of doing all of this and illegally assembling weapons. The security guard disappeared from his scheduled news conference on "Hannity" and then somehow the shooters house in Reno got robbed. You would think the biggest mass shooting in U.S. history during an investigation they would be protecting the shooters house and have tabs on the security guard, but no. (Maybe the security guard robbed the shooters house because evidence was in the house) Furthermore, MGM &amp; Las Vegas PD keep changing timelines. MGM might know all of the above and are saving their own butts by not releasing too much information. We don't even know what day he checked in and it's been more then week since the shooting. From my hotel experience, it takes 20 seconds to look that up. MGM doesn't want a massive lawsuit from every concertgoer, people staying in hotel, etc. Would hurt MGM brand. Maybe they know something small or big who knows. Also, for the shooter to kill himself before the cops even got their. And for the shooter to only shoot the security guard and not kill him. Makes me wonder, was the security guard the 2nd shooter, and did something happened during the shooting where the shooter shot the security guard and the security guard killed the shooter. MGM has to know more, there would be footage of him getting checked in, did he have bellman help with his bags upon checkin, if he did maybe the bellman were in on it because it takes many bags for that many guns, did he come in a taxi-Uber, interview the driver. Where is all the camera footage?
I mean none of this could be true or all of it. I could add way more to this and some other theory's make sense. But all in all this case doesn't make sense and someone is lying. Thoughts?

       If you watched today's press briefing, the sheriff said the security had and used both. "Mr. Campos received his wounds in close proximity to 22:05.Â He attempted to relay that information via his radio. And it was confirmed because he also relayed that information via his cell phone. So the timeline associated to both of those sources have been verified."

       They said nothing important was taken (although they could be lying). My money is on it being a crazed conspiracy theorist or tenacious journalist (Laura Loomer?) who broke in looking for clues.

       If you rewatch all the press conferences, the timeline really hasn't changed very much. The media is blowing it out of proportion. I do find the sudden addition of the maintenance worker to be extremely odd though.

       I am not here to argue the definition of "middle of the night" but 10pm is nighttime no matter the location. Furthermore, its harder to shoot during the day then at night. That's what I was getting it

       When you start a joke then can't handle a joke. I am not college professor, I was joking about being professor. If you can't even handle a joke why write comments where you joke around in the first place. And should I bend over backwards for that stick since your level 1 nurse. Not sure what that has to do with anything but kudos. (Get sense of humor)

       There was nothing in your comment that could have been a joke lol. I have plenty of a sense of humor. Do you need help with that stick in your ass? If you orifices are as dry as your sense of humor you will!ðŸ˜‚

       MGM is trying to not get their ass sued off. I can only assume they would know if Campos worked for them or not. 
But I've also heard Campos worked for the concerts security not the hotel. Idk if that's true but I've read it. 
And lastly, is the dude a cop?  If not why the cop badge in the pic?  Unless that's a security badge?

       Exactly. Don't take my word for it though. I know I read that but I have no idea where. I also read somewhere once that he was using jammers to block the cameras but I haven't seen that said since. Its all screwy but they do that shit in purpose to muddy the waters.

       Not a single photo has emerged or been released from the man of the year - the alleged fake Jesus Campos. There is zero reason for that as well with all the Tabloid photographers at loose.

       If the shooter had cameras to monitor hallway, why havent we at least seen that footage? I am sure it can clear up any time discrepancy all on its own. It would have recorded the sound of shooting, times stamp for when everything happened, and be extremely helpful/or damaging to offical story. Guess I may have just answered my own question. 
I just want to know the truth.
