        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>There were reports of a man leaving the Village area, and entering a RV near the Motel 6, he was wearing fatigues, and carrying a black bag.</p>

<p>The area south east of the Catholic Shrine Church on E. Alibaba Ln, and Giles st. was identified as a second shooting location with several casualties, and the man in the RV was the suspect, at least 3 rifleman were placed on the RV.</p>

<p>One witness reported to media that police enter the Motel 6 lobby, told them that suspect was in the area, and to evacuate, the witness and around 15 other people hid in one of the Motel rooms.</p>

<p>After this there has been nothing more mentioned about the casualties on E. Alibaba Ln, or the suspect in the RV. The last reference of the Motel 6 reported to dispatch can be found below at the 1:03:51 mark, but I can not clearly make out what the officer is saying.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xAcTKNpDeY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xAcTKNpDeY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be</a></p>

<p>Can anyone make out what the officer at the Motel 6 last reported, or has anyone heard anything more about the suspect, or second shooting location?</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>Note - The RV Suspect, and Alibaba Ln casualties were identified early during the incident, not as part of the possible diversion calls made while SWAT was breeching Paddock&#39;s room!</p>

<p>It appears the officer said something like &quot;We have another GSW at the Motel 6, it&#39;s 3 shots!&quot; GSW is a common dispatch code for Gun Shot Wound!</p>

<p>There was another early report that a black dually sped out of the Delano parking lot heading east. The black dually was reference to a Chevy dual cab truck, Paddock&#39;s brother Eric has been seen with both a white RV, and black Chevy dual cab, as described in the police dispatch calls.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Listening to the scanner, they assumed many of these had to be diversions right?</p>

<p>Has ANYBODY asked the sheriff about who could&#39;ve possibly called in these diversions if it were a lone wolf attack? This is a potential smoking gun that I havn&#39;t seen referenced anywhere that I can remember.</p>

<p>Holy crap, and there was report of a black dually speeding out of the Delano parking lot heading east.</p>

<p>Guess who owns a white RV, and black Chevy dual cab.... None other than the main suspects brother himself Eric Paddock!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be right, however the extended cab on Eric truck is sometimes referred to as a double cab, so there is that.</p>

<p>There is also possibility that it wasn&#39;t a dually at all, at this point I would think that any black Chevy truck speeding away from the scene would be suspect, particularly one owned by the shooters brother.</p>
