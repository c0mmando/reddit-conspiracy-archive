      <p>
       There were reports of a man leaving the Village area, and entering a RV near the Motel 6, he was wearing fatigues, and carrying a black bag.
      </p>
      <p>
       The area south east of the Catholic Shrine Church on E. Alibaba Ln, and Giles st. was identified as a second shooting location with several casualties, and the man in the RV was the suspect, at least 3 rifleman were placed on the RV.
      </p>
      <p>
       One witness reported to media that police enter the Motel 6 lobby, told them that suspect was in the area, and to evacuate, the witness and around 15 other people hid in one of the Motel rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
       After this there has been nothing more mentioned about the casualties on E. Alibaba Ln, or the suspect in the RV. The last reference of the Motel 6 reported to dispatch can be found below at the 1:03:51 mark, but I can not clearly make out what the officer is saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xAcTKNpDeY&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Can anyone make out what the officer at the Motel 6 last reported, or has anyone heard anything more about the suspect, or second shooting location?
      </p>
      <p>
       Update:
      </p>
      <p>
       Note - The RV Suspect, and Alibaba Ln casualties were identified early during the incident, not as part of the possible diversion calls made while SWAT was breeching Paddock's room!
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears the officer said something like "We have another GSW at the Motel 6, it's 3 shots!" GSW is a common dispatch code for Gun Shot Wound!
      </p>
      <p>
       There was another early report that a black dually sped out of the Delano parking lot heading east. The black dually was reference to a Chevy dual cab truck, Paddock's brother Eric has been seen with both a white RV, and black Chevy dual cab, as described in the police dispatch calls.

       Listening to the scanner, they assumed many of these had to be diversions right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Has ANYBODY asked the sheriff about who could've possibly called in these diversions if it were a lone wolf attack? This is a potential smoking gun that I havn't seen referenced anywhere that I can remember.

       Many of the diversions came in around the time they were breaching Paddock's room, the motel 6 suspect, and Alibaba st casualties were reported during the shots.

       Sounds like another GSW at Motel 6 with 3 shots.  Can't make out the first part.

       Holy crap, and there was report of a black dually speeding out of the Delano parking lot heading east.

       Guess who owns a white RV, and black Chevy dual cab.... None other than the main suspects brother himself Eric Paddock!

       Not a dually. Refers to dual rear wheels typically never heard of a dual cab.

       You may be right, however the extended cab on Eric truck is sometimes referred to as a double cab, so there is that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also possibility that it wasn't a dually at all, at this point I would think that any black Chevy truck speeding away from the scene would be suspect, particularly one owned by the shooters brother.
