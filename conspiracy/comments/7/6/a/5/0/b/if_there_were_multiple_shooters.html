    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve lived in Vegas my whole life and still do. I don&#39;t know where you live, but you really wouldn&#39;t want this kind of crazy shit to happen anywhere near you. I&#39;ve known at least 5 people who ended up on the local news from doing shit like overdosing on drugs, get busted for CP, die from drowning, killing their kids, die/injured in motorcycle accidents, threatening workplaces and bomb-threats in schools, having sex with their students, etc etc. Only after the shooting I realize this city is small as fuck. It&#39;s just Vegas people are bound to know people who know people who get into stupid shit whether they like it or not. And knock on wood there&#39;s nobody I know so far that was at that country festival who got injured/killed.</p>

<p>I did some googling and the population in Las Vegas alone is just over half a million, and that&#39;s not even all of Clark County.</p>

<p>Seems like a lot of people, but if you look at the city on google maps and switch to satellite version, everything is so close to each other..</p>

What are you going to do when you find out you are wrong and you basically shit all over the victims and their families? Fade silently into the background..cause all you can do is talk shit. Like I said, you need to be convinced..take your silly ass to Vegas and see for yourself. Otherwise, toss around your ideas without being disrespectful to the victims. Or is that too much to ask?</p>

<p>You can definitely see the windows. The weapons he was reported to have used would discharge shell casings far enough that you’d see them everywhere. Not to mention, 1,000+ of them (never saw an official count on total shots fired) shot in various directions would nearly cover the ground in spots, not just be in a couple of piles.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Different models of guns dispel casings differently, so it depends on the model and caliber being shot.</p>

<p>But I have to say that in one of the pictures with a close up of a couple guns, you can see 10/20 shells laying on the ground in a sporadic enough order to be discharges, my question still remains though, for the amounnt of shots fired, it’s odd to not have seen a floor covered.</p>

<p>The casings by his head are suspicious too, I understand blood pooling underneath the casing as he bled out, just odd placement considering you can see the shot to the chest, as well as reports from the tactical team that “breached” his room that there was no visible gun shot wound to the head. </p>

<p>Who knows... lots of fuckery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the sound of the gunfire, I think I know what happened. </p>

<p>Schuck and Jesus were shooting it out with Paddock before Paddock started firing on the crowd. This is because Schuck and Jesus were agents. This would explain the multiple caliber automatic fire at the same time, the long pause. There are only 4 distinct rifles in the videos and two pistol shots. 1 rifle is a bump-fire, another rifle is a crank-trigger. Yet another rifle or 2 rifles is a small automatic weapon, not used to rain down on concert goers. The last 2 gunshots are from pistols. One shot, then a second shot. I think the first shot is Paddock shooting himself in the mouth. The second shot is one of our agents shooting him again to make sure he is down.</p>
