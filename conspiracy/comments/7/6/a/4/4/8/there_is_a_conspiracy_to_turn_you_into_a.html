Just wanted to point out the irony of campaigning against these social injustices.  There&#39;s a term for that.... Social Justice Warrior.</p>

<p>SJWs are known for having taken Saul Alinsky’s Rules for Radicals and turned it into their guidebook.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>7. Tactics</em></p>

<p>&quot;Tactics are those conscious deliberate acts by which human beings live with each other and deal with the world around them. ... Here our concern is with the tactic of taking; </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.  In conflict tactics there are certain rules that [should be regarded] as universalities. One is that the opposition must be singled out as the target and &#39;frozen.&#39;...</p>

<p>&quot;...any target can always say, <strong>&#39;Why do you center on me when there are others to blame as well?&#39; When your &#39;freeze the target,&#39; you disregard these [rational but distracting] arguments.... Then, as you zero in and freeze your target and carry out your attack, all the &#39;others&#39; come out of the woodwork very soon. They become visible by their support of the target...&#39;</strong></p>

<p>&quot;One acts decisively only in the conviction that all the angels are on one side and all the devils on the other.&quot; (pps.127-134)</p></li>

<p>Its a trick to get the right to agree that normal heterosexual advances with women vno not rape) are somehow wrong which is the position of tue man hating social justice warrior. And they have the right doing it beucase we dont likeome of the tsrgets for other reasons.</p>

<p>So we are trapped into saying ben affleck tryi g to cop a feel woth a girl who clealry didnt mind is terrible leaving us all at the end of the day cornered into the SJW position that male sexuality is bad.</p>

<p>You realize you aren&#39;t supposed to fucking do that shit in professional situations, right? That&#39;s because there&#39;s a power dynamic where the victim feels pressured to go along or not to speak out.</p>

<p>Now clearly weinsteinwas a sleaze but wehave yet to talk about the bigger problem in holloywood which is the huge homosexual pedophilia problem which is far worsethan a few actresses offended that a fat guy asked them...ASKED THEM...if they wnated to sleep with him.</p>

<p>And by the way... Hollywood isnt kansas. Actors and Actresses and directors and producers  are jumping in bed with each other all the time which makes the whole thing far less about inappropiate sex than anti male politics</p>

<p>Sexual assault is any type of sexual contact or behavior that occurs without the explicit consent of the recipient. Falling under the definition of sexual assault are sexual activities as forced sexual intercourse, forcible sodomy, child molestation, incest, fondling, and attempted rape.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“At that point, after that, is when he assaulted me,” Evans said. “He forced me to perform oral sex on him.” As she objected, Weinstein took his penis out of his pants and pulled her head down onto it. “I said, over and over, ‘I don’t want to do this, stop, don’t,’ ” she recalled. “I tried to get away, but maybe I didn’t try hard enough. I didn’t want to kick him or fight him.” In the end, she said, “he’s a big guy. He overpowered me.” She added, “I just sort of gave up. That’s the most horrible part of it, and that’s why he’s been able to do this for so long to so many women: people give up, and then they feel like it’s their fault.”</p>

<p>Weinstein appeared to find the encounter unremarkable. “It was like it was just another day for him,” Evans said. “It was no emotion.” Afterward, he acted as if nothing had happened. She wondered how Weinstein’s staff could not know what was going on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Harassment?  No it&#39;s an offer, unless the offer was refused and again made repeatedly I don&#39;t see how you could construe that as harassment.  Do females not possess free will and the power to say no?</p>

<p>Remember, in California it is legal to offer adult film employment and to conditionally cast your prostitutes (err I mean &quot;adult movie star actresses&quot;).  If you as a director/producer knew she was 17, obviously you&#39;d get charged with propositioning a minor because of the &quot;statutory rape&quot; law.</p>

<p>Bottom line though, if your 17 year old &quot;child&quot; is so innocent and vulnerable, Why would you as a parent allow her to go audition for these roles alone with adult men? </p>

<p>And not sure why you are going to &quot;Add in groping&quot;?  Just to justify your flawed remark?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because groping is what several of the people are being accused of? </p>

<p>Also you’re wrong on the definition of sexual harassment. </p>

<p>From Wikipedia
“Sexual harassment is intimidation, bullying or coercion of a sexual nature, or the unwelcome or inappropriate promise of rewards in exchange for sexual favors.”</p>

<p>From Black’s law dictionary
“Harrassment in the workplace or discrimination where unwelcome and unwanted advances are made to a person by one or more other employees. The comments are of a personal nature and often sexual in style and manner.”</p>

<p>Don’t see anything about repeated on either. </p>
