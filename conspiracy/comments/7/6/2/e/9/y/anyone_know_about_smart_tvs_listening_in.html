    <div class="md"><p>In a way yes. The biggest struggle you&#39;ll face with your thoughts is figuring out which ones to trust/which sort of logic works best.</p>

<p>They will always try to lead your thoughts in a certain way. Not only will they lead your thoughts but there are people out there(The fully brainwashed) who will always take you into bad ways of thinking.</p>

<p>Personally I would always live life in the moment. The second you start to project the future you will lose track of the moment.</p>

<p>I have done a lot of research so I believe the food we eat is horrible and plays a large role. <a href="https://youtu.be/0309CVqFqFA?t=7m34s">for example</a> This (almost all) cereal actually has magnetic filings in it.</p>

<p>Knowing technology beams thoughts into you, eating this cereal would obviously make it more effective.</p>

<p>People ridicule theories like &quot;Full mind control&quot; but I see it in the cards because of foods like this.</p>

<p>Other foods like milk, cheese or any meat that comes from cows have Oxytocin in it. Oxytocin is known to cause major emotional sensitivity.</p>

<p>You can hopefully begin to see how the world, the system aims to control your body entirely. First by teaching you false things, for example our world is in debt (200 trillion + and counting), they teach us that humans only live 70-80 years which at this point I would be down to argue hardcore after seeing the horrible foods we&#39;re eating.</p>

<p>Next way of mind control is by running your brain/neurotic system with technology.</p>

<p>And last is making you reliant on food to maintain happiness. Since drugs are in food we rely on the food to stay happy just as much as a crack addict relies on crack to stay happy.</p>

<p>Once they have you locked into that system it&#39;s really hard to pull out.</p>

<p>I personally believe that our diet plays a huge role into everything wrong. You think about horses for example. Some horses eat dried up hay and they never starve to death. We are 1/10th their size and we have huge meals.</p>

<p>Our thinking validates itself because everywhere we look our thinking is already validated. Our entire society is brainwashed to the point where a lot of people scoff at the idea of terrorist attacks being perpetrated by our own government. Some people wake up, other people don&#39;t even try to wake up at all.</p>

<p>Look up David Icke if you want to know more. The best way I can describe it is, they control every form of thinking you have. Because they control the object or the event that you&#39;re thinking about. On top of that they can control thoughts you have and give you new thoughts. They tell you how smart you are and what is right or wrong through school. They teach you who&#39;s right and who&#39;s wrong. Unless you take a real hard look at what you&#39;ve learned it&#39;s hard to see through it all. Really hard.</p>

<p>They&#39;re trying to build a prison, a prison for your mind. Not just yours, everyone&#39;s.</p>

<p>Always have faith that there is better than we&#39;ve got. The world is made the way it is leading up to something. A great deception.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Super interesting. I&#39;ve been huge on where my food comes from for a long while, since I got into environmental science in college and it&#39;s been growing since then. My family&#39;s diet basically consists of real food from a farm, and we don&#39;t drink milk unless it is raw from a small farm, we only eat meat that has been pasture-raised and organic and we try not to over do that either. We pretty much never have cereals and breads in the house. I&#39;ve heard of a lot of toxic things in cereal. We also don&#39;t vaccinate (I exhibit vaccine injury myself from childhood vaccines), and both my husband and I notice that my husband&#39;s moods and behaviors become more aggressive when he has too much sugar in his diet. It&#39;s incredible, actually. He was on a no carbs, no sugar diet for 90 days and it was the most peaceful he&#39;s been in a lifetime. We definitely believe if we have control over our health, our minds become clearer too. We don&#39;t have any faith in the public (or private) school systems so it&#39;s going to be self-directed learning for our children. But then there&#39;s technology that seems to follow us wherever we go. We can&#39;t avoid it because we are city people. We even tried to cut down on our EMFs in the bedroom and the house but we know it&#39;s bouncing around all over. I also see this really big shift in the way our world is operating now, too, from mega corporations like Amazon, to even the smallest illusions of Choice (see the sunglasses industry -- nearly every brand of eyewear you see is owned and designed by the same company Luxottica, sticking different brands on things to give an mirage of choice)... it&#39;s a crazy world we live in and I keep feeling like everywhere I go nothing is sacred anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah sadly everything is watching you and listening to you. According to facebook terms and services they can look through your camera or listen through your recorder at any given time. Imagine them listening to everything and everyone 24 hours a day 7 days a week and constructing reality accordingly. With the most advanced technology they have today they could easily map out your thoughts. Imagine having everyone&#39;s thoughts you could have many people mapped out so good they could predict the future with ease and therefore make life easier or harder. (raise prices of things they would buy, put extra traffic in areas so they&#39;re late to work, give X person articles about something so they disagree with Y person to create conflicts within groups of friends) the possibilities are endless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as Smart TVs. The news report left out an important factor. Unless the manufacturer plants the hack on the TV during manufacture the only way the hack can be done is if someone physically comes to your house with the hack on a USB stick and plugs it into the TV and executes the code on the TV. The second way would be if you accidently downloaded the hack by accidently visiting a malicious web link that contained the hack using the TVs own web browser. So odd are slim to none that u r at risk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look into what the Utah data center is, youd realize <strong><em>its all collected</em></strong> and stored. So when something happens they can go back and connect the dots. I&#39;m not sure AI has progressed &quot;publicly&quot; to actively surveil all of this information in real time. But behind closed doors you bet your ass thats the end game. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s huge amounts of data being collected all the time. Isn&#39;t that why Facebook was such a game changer in the first place? It isn&#39;t so hard to believe that they have all this information -- and maybe being used for nothing more than market research, consumer behavior or increasing profits at such a time -- but it doesn&#39;t mean it still isn&#39;t a massive invasion of privacy and that there isn&#39;t a possibility of the information being used in other ways later. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well what&#39;s interesting is that I was having a conversation today with my cousin who is a young software coder, and he told me he specifically deleted the FB app off his phone. He still uses FB just not on his phone. There must be different permissions and regulations on the phone vs on the computer. He was also interviewing with a group whom he said developed software that helped the IRS detect fraudulent activity, the government track down illegal immigrants and also used by the CIA for whatever purposes they get up to. Ironically, this year I was audited by the IRS even though I run a very small side business that doesn&#39;t even make $10k, and yet I happened to be audited. What he said tipped me off because i probably was using the online tax software in a suspicious way because I was curious about what makes a difference in my return. So I was plugging in different numbers and scenarios into those programs (and I used multiple programs because I was trying to go with the cheapest service) -- and it probably raised flags with their algorithms... hence my reasoning for why I was audited. Nothing came of their investigation since I eventually just put in all my correct numbers with paperwork to back it up. </p>

<p>Ever thought about the push to digitization and the smart tv concept critically? Albeit I assume most aren&#39;t targeted, because well, we are boring. But possiblities are near limitless with IoT</p>

<p>I see you are attempting comedy to alleviate the seriousness. That&#39;s unfortunate. Its a pretty severe invasion of privacy, anybody with technical know how and $30 bucks could do.</p>

<p>If you know Joe connects to a different network at work. Thats infected. Employees spread ad infinium. Sally goes to Starbucks connects to their wifi. Its on and on. Until target reached. Just a matter of who and where. And making that bridge. And its only constraint is time, how urgent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Super interesting. I&#39;ve been huge on where my food comes from for a long while, since I got into environmental science in college and it&#39;s been growing since then. My family&#39;s diet basically consists of real food from a farm, and we don&#39;t drink milk unless it is raw from a small farm, we only eat meat that has been pasture-raised and organic and we try not to over do that either. We pretty much never have cereals and breads in the house. I&#39;ve heard of a lot of toxic things in cereal. We also don&#39;t vaccinate (I exhibit vaccine injury myself from childhood vaccines), and both my husband and I notice that my husband&#39;s moods and behaviors become more aggressive when he has too much sugar in his diet. It&#39;s incredible, actually. He was on a no carbs, no sugar diet for 90 days and it was the most peaceful he&#39;s been in a lifetime. We definitely believe if we have control over our health, our minds become clearer too. We don&#39;t have any faith in the public (or private) school systems so it&#39;s going to be self-directed learning for our children. But then there&#39;s technology that seems to follow us wherever we go. We can&#39;t avoid it because we are city people. We even tried to cut down on our EMFs in the bedroom and the house but we know it&#39;s bouncing around all over. I also see this really big shift in the way our world is operating now, too, from mega corporations like Amazon, to even the smallest illusions of Choice (see the sunglasses industry -- nearly every brand of eyewear you see is owned and designed by the same company Luxottica, sticking different brands on things to give an mirage of choice)... it&#39;s a crazy world we live in and I keep feeling like everywhere I go nothing is sacred anymore. </p>
