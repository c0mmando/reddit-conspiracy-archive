        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Dr. Steven Greer: There’s a whole team of people who have had purchased the estate of Stan Meyer that had a water fuel car, and what people don’t know is that he had a toroid that looked like a donut that was a zero point free energy system that had a national security order on it. Our team went there and saw it. Now there was a group in Michigan that outbid us, an engineering group, and it disappeared into a black hole. They did it secretly. Next thing I know their chief funder calls me up and says ‘they’re all running for their lives’. Last I heard they’ve all been assassinated and all that technology is gone. That’s all recent. This is all in the last 5-10 years. So, I tell people you have to understand what you’re dealing with here. This is not like inventing an iPhone or something. You’re dealing with something that’s making an endrun at the entire global elite’s system. Much more so than big pharma. Much more so than medical stuff that you deal with. It’s orders of magnitude beyond that. It’s hundreds of trillions of dollars. So, I think that people in this area need to know what they’re dealing with because otherwise they think ‘oh, well, I’ve invented this thing’–One of the sad things I’ve observed over the last 27 years of doing this is how many people have developed these devices, have tried to do the usual business and strategic, or venture capital and distribution plan, and have all vanished. Every single one of them. So if someone does have one of these, or they are working on something like this, please have them contact us and let us put it on a trajectory that will get it out to public. And, if people have invested to get to a certain point, we have folks on my team who can make them whole, frankly, if they can prove it. But, here’s what that got to do: It’s got to be testable, reproducible, and transparent. And they have to agree with an open source release of it. If not, I won’t even talk to them. I’ve spent almost a million dollars of our funds going around the world with people who are brilliant, scientifically, but they have no strategic knowledge, and every one of them have failed. So, you know, I have personally briefed CIA directors, people on the Senate Intel Committee, generals and admirals at the Pentagon, and in every one of these cases what I’ve found is that when you’re dealing with USAP, it’s really a different universe. And people dealing with these technologies need to understand that’s what they’re dealing with. Frankly, I’ve been threatened plenty of times over these years, I’ve had 3 people I’ve worked with on my team assassinated. You know, there’s a former CIA director who was going to hand off one of these devices to us, and about $50 million dollars in sort of seed money so we could get it out, who, the week he was going to meet with a member of my board they found him floating down the Potomac River. Absolutely true, Bill Colby. Everyone thinks it was an accident or he committed suicide; no. His best friend came to me and said ‘he was taken out…wetworks’. It’s called wetworks, assassination team. And, again, he was trying to do it clandestinely. I said ‘no, we have to do this with the whole world watching’. Now, back in the 90s when that happened, we didn’t have Facebook and Twitter and all the streaming capabilities. Now we do. We have the tools now that we didn’t have 10 years, so I tell people ‘let’s use them to our advantage this time’.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Stan Meyer &quot;water fueled&quot; car is grade-a bullshit.  The CIA has been stealing oil for a long time.  There is no magic free energy device.  It&#39;s just money-printing and theft.  Greer has a lot of issues with credibility.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey, no need to apologize. I think him being some sort of disinfo operative is absolutely within the realm of possibility. I’m just putting the info out there objectively, allowing people to decide what they think for themselves.</p>

<p>I will say, though, that he did create a helluva documentary (which is on Netflix right now).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Greer doing a final, futile cry for people to come forward before delonge destroys his snake oil business. In one 45 minute video delonge has done more for UAP phenomena and free energy than Greer has done in the last decade. Plus delonge had his government insiders come out into the lime light, state who they are, what their experience is and what they plan to do. Greers gov insiders still deny ever meeting him. </p>
