       From the start of all this speculation I've thought Campos was the biggest missing puzzle piece. Now he just disappears before interviews... it's starting to seem too obvious. If there is some shadow entity behind all this, why would Campos even have the opportunity to back out of interviews and make headlines in doing so?

       I choose to not believe that the CIA or FBI orchestrate events like this, however, I have no problem believing that they jump at the opportunity to use these events. What better way to dissuade conspiratorial speculation by the general public than by gas lighting the entire country. Get everyone to buy into a conspiracy by releasing questionable information, then follow that up with irrefutable proof that Paddock really was just a lone wolf. He had cameras set up after all. If they were filming, the full story is out there. You could even say the Weinstein thing is part of it--start scratching that conspiracy itch, then in one swoop make the whole country feel stupid and crazy for doubting the official narrative.

       I'd agree. People in the FBI fuck up, they probably don't trust other people in FBI as much as we do. Maybe on the top top levels of they can use events like these to gain some insight that they couldn't otherwise. But they're just people

       Why would the FBI and the CIA purposely undermine confidence in the United States Government by perpetuating events and not having a iron clad narrative that achieves some objective?

       So Russians sitting at a computer in the comfort of their own country accomplishing things that no army is capable of is just too far out there for you, huh?

       Would you mind filling me in on why the CIA and FBI would undermine the American peoples confidence in the American Government? Seems kinda self defeating doesn't it?

       At least there is a clear benefit for Russian trolls. It's also easy and cost effective to put thousands of Russian geeks to work doing the bidding of Vladimir Putin.

       Motive and opportunity is usually more than enough for any other conspiracy theory. Flat Earth gets more traction around here. Don't you think that is strange?

       Most everyone here will talk about how they understand what is going on in a situation like the LV shooting based on VERY little actual evidence. If "someone" can find a way to get the idea set that there was multiple shooters going then they have accomplished their goals.

       Not really, but maybe a little? Some of the narrative just seems so blatantly inconsistent. So I guess what I think is that there are three options, cover up of something bigger, intentional muddying of the waters for whatever reason, FBI sucks and just can't find anything or some combo of the three.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just saying that I don't want to believe the FBI is as confused as we are or that some shadow entity orchestrated the event And that it is starting to feel like the narrative is intentionally being manipulated now for some reason.

       I have resisted the idea from the beginning but after watching just about all footage of the shooting and interviews of victims I have come to the undeniable conclusion:  It's a fucking HOAX.  No one died.  Multiple shooters firing blanks.

       well, there are bullet holes in lots of things, including people... and rounds certainly have been recovered... although I'm not sure what the relevance it would have to release photos of recovered bullets would be.

       A large part of what is at play with  MGM disputing the police narrative is most likely them trying to mitigate their liability and the potential law suites that could arise depending on the course of events.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Campos, I feel like given all the speculation, theories, and agendas being pushed around the event, he might have decided that his anonymity was more valuable than whatever fox was paying him, that or for the reasons above MGM will make it worth his while to get his story to match their preferences sequence of events.

       I can definitely get behind this as well. The 6 minutes prior to shooting narrative puts blame on MGM making it seem like they tried to handle it quietly. But it could also put blame on the police depending on how MGM spins it.
