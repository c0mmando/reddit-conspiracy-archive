       Oh, we're about to give MegaAnon credit for the whole Russian bribery story, is that it? Because if someone says "something big is coming" for a long time and gives no details, then the first big thing that happens must be what they were talking about, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       All I can say is, I don't see the point in an anonymous source who gives you no details or specifics on anything whatsoever, but just gives you fair warning that mainstream media will be covering something eventually

       I think you're mistaken. AFAIK it was some other 4chan anon, not MegaAnon, who 'called' Las Vegas. That other anon predicted that
       <em>
        something
       </em>
       would happen in Las Vegas on Sept. 11 or later, which is wildly vague.

       I see it as that employee that finds out about layoffs before anyone else, is told not to tell, but has to tell something to someone.  So they say little hints here and there to get it off their chest without actually saying anything.  Sometimes if you say what you know it's easy to identify you as a leak inside based on the knowledge given out.

       She feels like she is doing us a favor.  She is pretty specific with what will happen just not an exact date. If she is right with this FBI/CIA prediction and Clinton/Russian collusion then maybe she is legit. Either way I am just along for the ride.  &lt;Grabs beer and popcorn&gt;

       Right, Left...Right, Wrong.  The Russia / Trump thing fizzled out.  This probably will too but since the MSM avoids it I tend to find it more interesting. As for 4chan, I would suggest all sources be taken with a grain of salt. It doesn't hurt anyone to listen and if it was wrong hopefully it was entertaining.  I wouldn't let 4chan or any conspiracy in particular bother you. Life is way to short to be triggered by a conspiracy theory that ends up wrong.

       No way, I don't buy it one bit. No way. In the US, corruption has become truly legitimized: Citizens United. Since the turn of the last century there has been struggle to control corruption in the US and end it but it has gone nowhere. Money is just too good.

The ones who've claimed to have been, exposed too many obvious holes in the cheese, they tried to feed you. I don't work for anyone but myself and I choose which jobs I ultimately work and the roles I fulfill, for others on their behalf. Always have, always will.

       It sounds a little too anti-Israel to be Bannon personally, although he is known to post on 4chan. Could be someone close to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't have any grasp on what Bush, Clinton, and Obama did in the CIA, which means they're not in intelligence or they're stupid/lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       That makes me lean toward someone in the political sector: politician, big donor, staffer, policy wonk or the like. There's no reason to leak this if it's really happening, so it sounds like a bluff. If they really had everything and wanted to scare the people that they have dirt on, they'd do it in person.

       Rather hard to do when you will not explain yourself.  And, near as I can tell, asking question and not making assumptions when you don't know something is part of the learning process.  Making up facts and not researching aren't part of it...

       MegaAnon has said more than once that she is a she.
      </p>
      <p>
       She also posted a photo to prove she was the same person as MegaAnon - it's of a lady's feet in flop flops (and part of her legs) on a tile floor with a post it note with the current time and date and "Hi" to somebody on 4chan.  Apparently, she posted a photo using the same (shitty tile job, per her)  that at some point in the past, so she's linking the anonymous IDs with a photo of that floor and a note on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those were definitely lady feet/legs, for sure.

       Just my 2 cents - she's likely older.  Those are age/sun spots on her legs.  Those don't typically show up until late 30's - early 40's.  The alternative would have been a redhead and they are freckles, but she appears too tan to be a redhead.  Also, looks like she may like wearing Tom's, as that appears to be a Tom's tan line on her feet.

Hence is why you can't drop this in one epic public address. We have dedicated more time and energy on the positioning and messaging than ANYTHING ELSE, to ensure we are not only clear and concise, but are also comforting and confident, which will help console."

        "Assuming you voted for Trump, then great! You've already done half your job. In 2018 and 2020, vote the swamp out. I hate to sound like a campaign slogan for Trump. Candidly, I'm 50/50 on him all the time, for my own reasons. That said, his agenda is what I'm after and we all knew the thorns in the side of that agenda would show themselves sooner than later, after his inauguration. Ryan, McConnell, McCain, etc. all have to go. The swamp only churns because groomed candidates win and they start their careers at the local levels to build their political networks and public voting records, while using it like a training ground as the parties groom and prep them for a seat they know is coming, in DC. We don't have enough voter or political participation at the local or even the state level. I mean, it's a fact that more than 50% of Americans never even participate in their local/state elections. This lets the swamp of the establishment ultimately choose your candidate options for you and it's exactly what ends up discouraging every day citizens from running. Remember, running for and serving in a public office requires NO EXPERIENCE. That's the point. "Career politician" shouldn't even be a descriptive term we know, let alone use regularly, as it's not intended to be a career, hence elections. You only have to be over a certain age, a US citizen and usually live in the state, district or locality you're running for the position in, for a certain amount of time, and depending where and what position, it varies. The thing that annoys me most is when people either say 1. I only vote in presidential elections and/or 2. A candidate has no experience. If you only vote every 4 years and you only vote on "experience", then you've missed the entire point of our political process. I hated Obama but the one thing I'd never give him shit on is his brief stint in congress before running for president. YOU ALL COULD RUN... and maybe you should!"

       You dont get into significant position of power without having leverage over yourself today.  AKA someone has blackmail material on you.  I would never be allowed to hold public office.  No one would donate to me because I'm not blackmailable.   There's probably stuff people could dig up on my past but I wouldnt care about it being used as a weapon against me, so I would never be allowed to run

      <p>
       "3 disclosures - FBI, CIA and the FED."

      <p>
       "This is also what I was referring to as part of 3, 3 letter disclosures. By the time this is out, it's going to be REALLY HARD for the FBI and CIA to explain how the fuck Hillary even made it to election night as a candidate, instead of just watching it from a 14" analog TV, in a max security, isolation cell bunk in federal prison. Two down, the Fed to go... "

       This poster is trying to salvage the 26d chess meme. It makes serious errors, like claiming Mueller wasn't a political hit man (he was FBI director when this uranium coverup happened, there is simply no way he was trying to expose that and incriminate himself). Doesn't mention Clinton and Bush running Mena.

       Sounds like just another iteration of WH Anon's "trust" line. This is not a time to trust, this is a time to fight tooth and nail for change because the ruling class is vulnerable and they know it.

       I will say if the "coming storm" that Trump talked about and i think the other MegaAnon were hinting at was this Russia shit, then that is a really weak storm that the general public wont give a single shit about.

       And it should not stop there, because I want a space elevator (an orbital ring system based, not the sci-fi carbon nanotubes unobtainium 40,000 km cable to GEO). I'm serious, check my post history.

       Anon  said this, so it's still kind of open. Can you imagine the extensive negotiations as to what will be released, with respect to who and how many people will be prosecuted?

        "Just know that either way, wherher Assange gets to drop the last piece of his delayed surprise exactly one year later or you find out JFK was murdered by "our own", it's going to be a good couple of weeks, for justice. If GHB unironically kicks it within the next week or so, you'll know it's probably going the JFK route. Hope it's not though... no one directly involved back then will pay for JFK. They're all dead or too old to even bother with. Pray we get the Assange release. "

       The links in OP don't go to "4chin" but to an archive (4plebs). It's better than screencaps.
