       Kids might actually learn something useful. I just homeschooled my kids for a few months while we drove 12,000 miles round trip. Now they are back in indoctrination camp, kneeling during the pledge.

       Agreed. I hate sending them. My wife lets them make the decisions though. However, we hiked some mountains and did math at 7k above sea level in the New Mexican desert. They'll always remember that.

       They seem to try and teach through fear. They have to be quiet in the hall and they have a behavior system based on street lights. Green is good, red is bad. Yellow needs works. At least their teachers are pretty hot.

       Anything is subject to change, nothing is permanent.

       Schools do not ingrain that, they depict a constant image that is immune to alter or modify through creativity and critical thinking.

       We make sure to repatriate them with critical thinking and creativity daily (my wife is an artist). We tell them the truth about Columbus, Reagan, Clinton,  etc. we don't let them have slavery white washed nor do we allow them to think their government or the police force always has their best interest in mind. We also let them have their own opinions and teach to them to not buy everything they are told by adults. It's tough though because you don't want to raise obnoxious assholes.

       They have a set of rules to follow because kids need structure. If they can't follow simple rules like be quiet in the hall they probably won't respect authority when an officer is telling them what to do. Sounds like you're doing a bang up job of raising them

       Their great grandfather and grandfather were both killed in action. They've never met them because of it. I barely knew my dad.

       There wouldn't be mandatory vaccinations... hmmmm.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was homeschooled for one year of my life and my mom wasn't really prepared for it. 7th grade. I think it's a pretty pivotal year in school. A lot of my friends got their first kisses and more while I learned how to A) Help my mother do taxes for both of my parents B) go grocery shopping with a list, a budget, and some nice home cooked desserts in mind (mind you my parents have never made much so this!!) C) interact with adults more so than my own peers (adults are good at living ACTUAL life in this day and age, occasionally) D) sleep on a schedule that was good for me rather than what was mandated by my school hours E) explore my own interests more while also accomplishing enough that my tester lady at the end of the year wanted to give me the 8th, 9th, and 10th grade standardized tests (because my brother was also homeschooled that year and was in 10th grade and I basically learned enough throughout the ONE YEAR to be looked at for jumping ahead) F) love myself for the awkward little girl who hated showering that I was rather than be told by my peers what was "normal."
      </p>
      <p>
       I am in no way 100% advocating homeschooling for an entire 18 years, but I truly believe that people who have life experience are better left without so so many rules as regulations as to what they are allowed to teach. Homeschooling is an amazing platform for learning and self discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, if you learn what you're interested in, you tend to forget less. I know more about weather than most people that I know, because not only did I study lectures and books on it, I studied IT. This is an experience that most people don't get (in the ways that I did) until they reach a higher education beyond an associated or even bachelors.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's my take on it, but what do I know.

       You've got valid points. I agree with most of what you have said.

       Just make sure that they do get enough peer time as well! They have plenty of group activities for homeschooled kids like filed trips and even graduations. And don't worry, they'll be who they are pretty much regardless of what you do, as long as you remind them that they're valued as individuals. My mother always says that the one thing I learned that year, above all else, was to think for myself and to teach myself. Pretty valuable when entering back into public school. I basically just bullshitted and never went to class and graduated with a 4.7 (then dropped out of college twice! Ha! Kids will be kids)

       Except for mandatory vaccination (and it's not only for schools, in my country you need to be vaccinated for federal / government jobs - not all vaccines, only 2 are mandatory]) if you didn't do any of the rest on the list, who was there to stop you, but yourself ? What the fuck are you on about?

       I studied all my life in public schools. On my spare time I did theater, played hockey, was a swimmer, studied music and learnt how to play the piano. had part-times in the summer and still was together with my friends almost every afternoon (studying or chilling), going out every Friday and Saturday. Went to Sunday school for 10 years. 
Tried guitar, tennis and was a member of the biology club for 2 years in high school.
Currently finished medschool.
      </p>
      <p>
       Only thing I do agree, is why did I have to learn useless subjects that offer me 0 benefits in life/career of choice. People should be able to come up with their own school program and mandatory subject where they learn useful stuff like filling taxes, politics basics, etc.

       I never once claimed that going to public school is a bad way to learn, I went to public school for 17 years of my life and turned out fine. I was just sharing my own personal experience with homeschooling.. but thanks for the needless aggression/defensiveness lol. Congrats on med school.

       Sorry, didn't mean to sound aggressive. But in no way is any of what you listed impossible while going through public school... I'm also not saying that homeschooling is bad. 
Just saying that A allowed for something that B, makes no sense when it's all possible regardless of A or B. In fact being home schooled doesn't mean you'll do all of the above. It's all up to you...

       You're good lol I was probably being sensitive but I totally agree with the face that these things are possible, but there is less time to explore your own interests with 40 hours of school and then the homework that a lot of people end up with these days. Homeschooling can allow for a much more flexible schedule to accomplish other things

       Super naive, unsocialized kids. I had a homeschooled kid working for me once who walked into the break room, stripped out of her regular shirt and into her work shirt with a full room of people. She was young, attractive and fairly busty, she thought nothing of it until someone pulled her aside.
