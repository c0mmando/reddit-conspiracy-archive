        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Reddit is not the place for anything pedogate or pizzagate related. If you have information and want to share it, whether there be doxxing or not, steemit is the place to go. It is a great platform for research, and shills and troll are almost non-existent. Reddit will delete anything that exposes to much truth about pedophilia. That is a fact. So, anyone who worked on reddit pizzagate and still wants to research but can&#39;t find a place to post your info, steemit is the place. </p>

<hr/>

<p>This isn&#39;t a marketing ploy, this is me trying to help others leave a censorship platform that is reddit. With censorship comes the tiresome realization that truth is useless if nobody can see it. This in turn engenders self-censorship. Get on Steemit and leave this god for saken place. Reddit is sucking authentic researchers dry. I&#39;m appauled at the amount of shills and forums sliding there is here. In many cases you could be arguing with a bot and not even know it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and wiki and voat. The art in embassies post was cenosred after it got 1000 upvoats and was deleted by admins due to &quot;POSSIBLE DOXXING.&quot; Meaning I didn&#39;t doxx anyone but they were possibly afriad of what the post entailed or of its implications. I&#39;ve had many posts about pizzagate censored on here. Rebelskum is one example. He was banned from reddit and then pizzagate.wiki was banned and ALL THE ARCHIVES WERE as well. Meaning that someone or a group of people not only suspended all of his sites that he posted frequently on but he is gone, he doesn&#39;t post anymore as if something happened, his site was DDOS&#39;ed by an IP linked to a former dyncorp headquarters in MA and then ALL the archives on EVERY ARCHIVE SITE WERE DELETED. It doesn&#39;t gt anymore obvious than that. Pizzagate is 100% legit and you will never here the truth on here nor on pedophile mod voat pizzagate or gab or twitter on the MSM or anywhere else. Steemit is the last place and I&#39;m afraid that might go too. </p>
