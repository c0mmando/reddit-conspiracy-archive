       Reddit is not the place for anything pedogate or pizzagate related. If you have information and want to share it, whether there be doxxing or not, steemit is the place to go. It is a great platform for research, and shills and troll are almost non-existent. Reddit will delete anything that exposes to much truth about pedophilia. That is a fact. So, anyone who worked on reddit pizzagate and still wants to research but can't find a place to post your info, steemit is the place.

       This isn't a marketing ploy, this is me trying to help others leave a censorship platform that is reddit. With censorship comes the tiresome realization that truth is useless if nobody can see it. This in turn engenders self-censorship. Get on Steemit and leave this god for saken place. Reddit is sucking authentic researchers dry. I'm appauled at the amount of shills and forums sliding there is here. In many cases you could be arguing with a bot and not even know it.

       Yes, and wiki and voat. The art in embassies post was cenosred after it got 1000 upvoats and was deleted by admins due to "POSSIBLE DOXXING." Meaning I didn't doxx anyone but they were possibly afriad of what the post entailed or of its implications. I've had many posts about pizzagate censored on here. Rebelskum is one example. He was banned from reddit and then pizzagate.wiki was banned and ALL THE ARCHIVES WERE as well. Meaning that someone or a group of people not only suspended all of his sites that he posted frequently on but he is gone, he doesn't post anymore as if something happened, his site was DDOS'ed by an IP linked to a former dyncorp headquarters in MA and then ALL the archives on EVERY ARCHIVE SITE WERE DELETED. It doesn't gt anymore obvious than that. Pizzagate is 100% legit and you will never here the truth on here nor on pedophile mod voat pizzagate or gab or twitter on the MSM or anywhere else. Steemit is the last place and I'm afraid that might go too.

       I'd have to look through all the screenshots I saved. it happend quickly so that's the only way I could capture it. But as I've said. I'm not posting anything pedo or pizzagate related on reddit. For that will get the rest of the archives deleted.

       I have thousands of docs. and screencaps and pdfs saved on a encrypted hardrive, of which I'm trying at the moment to create a wiki page for. See how long it will stay up. Like I said my post isn't to post evidence, I've already tried that. I wouldn't dare post it to you, looking at your post history. This post is to get people over to steem to doxx and expose people and institutions.

       It's run on a block chain like bitcoin so there is no one owner. Spam and such are still policed by the community through down votes but once something is on the block chain it can't be removed. You can edit but if you look at certain sources the original draft will still be there.

       I can't believe people aren't flocking there. The sign up process can take a few days and there are some problems but you can make crypto by blogging and say what you want. The worst that can happen is someone will lower your payout with a down vote.

       yeah, i think thats why people are hesitant.  we dont want to make money and a lot of us dont even know what cryptobis, i think it is a lot of new all at once so people are choosing to stay.  i for ine will be making the move today

       Well most people on steemit don't make money right off the bat so I wouldn't be too worried about that 😂 I understand the barrier of crypto though, I've been involved for years and it's a while new world. Steemit is pretty easy to use even with no knowledge though you just have to be safe with and not lose  your password

       This is why rational people know that pizzagate is bullshit when you say things like "elite Satanic rituals."  There's actual sick fucks and when they add that it makes it unbelievable.

       There are powerful well placed scumbags that traffick children and overtly use ritual abuse as a means to further their power, whilst also to blackmail. It might make it unbelievable, but I assure you Satanic ritual abuse is real and their are thousands of psycologists that have had to help children that had gone through this abuse. Look up the OTO case in AUS.
