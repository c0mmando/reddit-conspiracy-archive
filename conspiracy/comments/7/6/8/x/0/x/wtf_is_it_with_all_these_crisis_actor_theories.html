        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So I am supposed to believe that out of all of the years and the hundreds and hundreds of theoretical CRISIS ACTORS that not one.. NOT A SINGLE ONE has defected and came out blowing these &quot;hoaxes&quot; out of the water? </p>

<p>I mean from what I&#39;m led to believe is that all of these &quot;actors&quot; are out there playing the long con. Some of them teenagers. And not a single one has come out and said, &quot;oh that, that was fake. We were just acting.&quot; Not a single solitary soul.</p>

<p>I&#39;m supposed to believe out of all these people not one of them has loose lips. Not one of them has come forward and said these events were all just a hoax and has the physical evidence to back up their claims. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe it. Not one fucking bit. Too many variables in the human personality that would explain how ALL of these so called actors have never come forward. How they have kept a lid on all of these controversial things such as faking mass murder and what not.</p>

<p>Yeah... Ok.. Riiiiigght.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not buying it either. Crisis actors leave way too many loose ends. Why go through all of the trouble when you know for a fact the majority will believe the official narrative given? It&#39;s never been a very plausible theory, and the burden of proof should be placed on those claiming the theory holds water. So I challenge anyone saying crisis actors were involved in this shooting to show me irrefutable proof that is the case. Until then I&#39;ll dig into theories that actually have some meat to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Crisis actors don&#39;t fake mass murder, they&#39;re simply &#39;extras&#39; on a very real movie set. They say what matches the narrative they&#39;re told to follow. It&#39;s quite simple. Trauma based directing (ie mind control) is as real as the nose on your face. I suppose you should consider yourself fortunate for being <strong>capable</strong> of disbelieving. </p>

<p>Why haven&#39;t they come out? Hmm. I would suggest asking the thousands of scientists &amp; interns who discovered or worked on something that would shut down the pharmaceutical industry or dismantle entire governments - but they&#39;re dead. </p>
