       Swat teams are normally on call and not just sitting around the station waiting. The teams are drawn from officers in different section of the department with different schedules. Some will be at home and need to drive in gear up and then move out when the whole team is ready. This takes time.

       Goddamnit, why did you post that?? Now, we are going to read that in this week's official narrative revision.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously, I already knew the answer to the question before I asked it. Per the police radio traffic, police were on the 32nd floor for the final 3 minutes of Paddock's barrage. For the next 45 minutes more and more police accumulated on the 32nd floor but did nothing. I'd wager they all had body armor and full auto AR-15s. Why? All they did was wait for the SWAT team. The same response that would have occured ig they were disarmed entirely.

       Do you want the real answer?
      </p>
      <p>
       The shooter only shot for 9 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first officer arrived in the stairwell of the 32nd floor 16 minutes after the first 911 call. It's actually a good response time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that the shooting was over, and had been over for several minutes, before the officer even arrived in the stairwell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he waited for backup officers to reach him. Then he waited for armored SWAT teams to reach him. A cop doesn't solo approach a room containing a man with automatic rifles. A group of cops don't even do that if it is avoidable, that is a SWAT job.
      </p>
      <p>
       It wasn't an active shooter situation at any point in time - once law enforcement was on-scene. They deemed it a possible barricade situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once SWAT was there, floors 29-31 were swept clear, and SWAT started sweeping it's way to room 135 where they then put breach charges on the door and then blew their way in to find an already dead shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of this is incorrect nor conspiracy, this is all from the live feed of the police radio of the officers and SWAT members.
      </p>
      <p>
       The conspiracy in the shooting, if one exists, lies within the motivations and the actors and the planners - but not with LVPD response.

       It's a moot point. Command is thinking active shooter with barricade, and with the pressure of live firing on the public form a vantage point, they probably didn't think too much as to what he is doing in silence, other than needing to breach and disarm as safely as possible. I bet if the thought of a large bomb being armed popped into their head, they would think all the more reason to breach and disarm as fast as possible.

       Sry I'm so late getting back, I like the answer about ir or maybe a heart beat sensor, idk. However, I don't get what u say is moot point, unless they have confirmation of death somehow, then who knows what he was doing, didn't have to be arming a bomb, could been nodding off a bit from a shot of heroin only to pop up and start shooting again. So I'm guessing they did have confirmed of death otherwise I dont know why they would've taken so much time to breach without at least smoke screening the crowd or running interference with a helo, again amateur guesses. The only thing that leads me to believe they may have been putting their own safety above the crowds, is how long they took in Orlando while people died. Maybe it's justifiable to say if the shooter took out the whole SWAT team somehow it would delay rescue that much longer. But how that could happen in a highrise without the shooter taking himself out idk. Maybe the team was split up and looking for bombs or multiple, simultaneous breach points before somehow getting confirming he was dead and assembling a team at the door for breach to blow booby traps on the way in. Still though, while I do agree we need a certain level of militarization for the police, because lessons learned on the battlefield will become increasingly relevant, Ops question was more along the lines of why do we need them if they can't stop a tragedy from become a mass tragedy, whether due to bad training or sheer physics. After Ferguson, Orlando and more than a few incidences of militarized police being deployed in the last few years and showing their lack of training and/or regard for civilian rights, while I agree we need militarized police, i'm not sure that's what we have, at least for the majority of incidences we've all witnessed since it became an issue after Ferguson.

       And if the North Hollywood bank shootout happened today, the result would be the same. The militarized street level police would evade the shooters and call for better equipped and trained SWAT officers. Thus, it makes perfect sense to demilitarize street level police if not disarm them completely.

       I was alluding to the conspiracy where the wealthy have gutted the Posse Comitatus  Act by giving military grade equipment to toy soldiers. This shooting and others have clearly demonstrated that there is no reason for street level police to be armed whatsover.

       Whatsoever? This ignores the need of residential response outside of a large scale attack. I'm not a police force apologist by any means, they need a complete overhaul in the oversight and accountability department. Having said that, I'm sure the victims of street or domestic crime feels very differently about having first response armed or not.

       Street level police should only be given radios and non-lethal weapons. If lethal force is required, they can radio for it.

       Before fridays presser things were suspicious now they confirmed it by their reaction to Thursday nights events. At presser we saw them claim the press conferences purposes is only to calm the public. He said they wanted help days ago now complains that too much info exists and its hard for them to deal with it but they chased 1000 leads. They unprovoked issued multiple wide statements. No one else was involved and we are not engaged in a conspiracy topping it all off with in a supposed attempt to clear the air no questions allowed. They knew a Campos question would come and they were not wanting to deal with that yet

       Yep and they refuse to release the number of non-fatal gunshot victims. In fact, I have had several comments angrily brigaded for askng about it. The number of fatal/non-fatal gunshot injuries gives you an idea of the shooter's/shooters' accuracy.
