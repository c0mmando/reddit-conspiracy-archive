       The fifth generation network is being rolled out this very moment. This network will allow more data to be transferred at speeds faster then ever before. While this seems like a great technologic leap it is in the wrong hands and will lead to humankind's enslavement. Imagine everything in your house from pill bottles to kitchen appliances connected to the internet constantly relaying data, the last of our privacy stripped away from us.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe that all these blatant red flag events and conspiracies have been orchestrated as the low hanging fruit to keep the masses distracted from the end game of the global elite which is this 5G network and smart grid and eventually a global cashless currency very similar to bitcoin.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must unplug from the system because we are the ones holding it up. Stop using credit cards and use cash when physically shopping to delay as much as possible in order to spread awareness. We must reject this technology, not because technology is evil but because the powers that be are in control of this system.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 5G network is utilizing the same small wavelength that the military has weaponized as mind control and causing extreme discomforts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't take my word for it, do your own research and inform those around you to resist. Remember that the government is the enemy, we must unite as one and take away the power from the government that WE gave them.

       First and foremost for was government invention. It's encryption may be mathematically sound, but because of the reliance of good-willed entrance and exit nodes, It could be assumed that it js mostly trivial for an agency to deanonymize someone.

       I believe that with just the right opsec, tor could be anonymous, but for the average user, you should probably assume you have an identity leak, or that if you became a target, you could easily be doxed.

       Just look at the electromagnetic wavelengths of microwaves (one meter to one millimeter; with frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz) all of which is possible with the 5G network and they're going to have these towers on every street corner. Say if someone hacked these towers, they could essentially microwave a city. Tell me that doesn't scare the living shit out of you.

       It's not very hard, look at the new 5G network and whats wavelengths it utilizes and google the household appliance a microwave and what wavelengths it operates at. Draw your own conclusion from that, also I have link an old wired post in this post.

       Okay so here is a link to a banned manufacturer. It's not apples to apples so to speak but gives a reference. The radios used in the US are probably broadly similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.huawei.com/ilink/enenterprise/download/HW_267685">
        http://www.huawei.com/ilink/enenterprise/download/HW_267685
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Now licensed spectrum varies from carrier to carrier and country to country but let's say the average cell site has the following:
      </p>
      <p>
       700mhtz
850
1900
2100
2300
2600
      </p>
      <p>
       (This is exactly the frequencies a common unnamed Canadian carrier uses in my area. Disclosure I install this equipment for a living)
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's further assume that these are all sectorized sites, which simple means breaking the "cell" into sectors, typically 3 but sometimes 4 and very very rarely up to 6.
      </p>
      <p>
       So 6 radios (minimum. In high traffic areas this may double) per sector. 3 sectors per site. 18 radios let's say as a healthy minimum. (Not all frequencies are needed on all sites).
      </p>
      <p>
       300 input watts per radio multiplied by 18 gives a total load of 5400 watts.
      </p>
      <p>
       My microwave in the kitchen is rated at 1500 watts. And it really can cook shit. In a very small volume with standing waves.
      </p>
      <p>
       A cell site cover a vastly larger area. 
While you can use it to "microwave a city" the actual effect be somewhere near a fart in a hurricane. Measurable with scientific equipment. But that's it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now output power is different. You see that it says 4 * 20 watts. I believe that's per channel but that's a huge number. Remember you phone puts out maybe .3 watts as a maximum.
      </p>
      <p>
       (As an aside how these things work is when you have no coverage, you phone starts "shouting" as loud as possible hoping a tower will "hear" it. And a tower might be shouting back just as hard as t can. When the phone "talks" to the tower, one of the first things that happens is the tower say "quit shouting so loud I can hear you" and the phone says the same thing. Lower power requirements and technical shit. So long story short these things are not meant to transmit at max power)
      </p>
      <p>
       So as far as "weaponized" this I think falls far short. As in direct weapon. Indirect, well I would say the jury is out but it's more accurate to say it is was never in to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly everyone knows what radio overexposure looks like. It can kind of be weaponized in the sense of a directed energy weapon. Cooks and burns. I've gotten RF burns. They suck. It doesn't effect just your skin. If you are really unlucky it can cook you through. It doesn't happen very often as almost all high powered systems are out modded (except broadcast systems, radar, some two way radios. Military stuff is far far outside my ken).
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with assessing the risk on low powered or long duration exposure is it is very very hard to attribute anything directly to RF exposure. Was that bio molecular change from RF exposure of from the red wine I has with dinner?  How do you experiment on humans to know if it's safe?  You can on animals but it's hard to ask if them questions. Will the effects be like radiation where the longer after exposure the higher the chance of cancer (the answer is no because it is not ionizing radiation, but most people don't know what that is).  In short l, unless we have like Star Trek tricorders or sensors of comparable magic factor, there is no meaningful way to even test this. Hence "generally accepted as to cause no harm".
      </p>
      <p>
       I admit I am being a bit fast and loose here but what the hell. It's late, I'm tired, and can't stand my seeing this shit without announce of effort at proof. Everything is there to see. Check the specs. US companies I think use Ericsson gear. Look at your phone. It will tell you what frequ navies it uses. Put it in test mode. It will tell you received power levels at specific frequencies. (Small caveat those numbers are in hard for laymen to understand terms. I am a layman. Deal with it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I'm wrong. Actually look for yourself. Don't be the sheep you think everyone else is. Get off your ass and do something that kind of resembles some form of attempted research. Fuck just parroting other people's BS. I only know anything about it because all of my coworkers had daughters and "legend has it" rf makes you have all girls.
      </p>

       Wow I'm rambling.

       Lets step back from the weaponized aspect of this for a second, I will admit that it's far out there and has little to no proof. Call me an idiot if that makes you feel better. The fact is that the FCC chairman wants to roll this out as soon as possible with out studying the risks

       I fully agree.  There hasn't been enough testing.  But you can't fully test this without literally halting all progress in cellular technologies.  I mean what if there really is a very small but cumulative hazard from exposure?  How can you isolate that result from everyday life?  How can you test for long term hazards without long term experiments?  Worse, what if RF exposure causes epigenetic changes?  We will never know.  Can never know. And to see so many people decry this... well neither side has very much evidence, you see.  It's almost all anecdotal.  I would love to know definitively, as I work with this daily.
We live in an era where technological changes outpaces... well our attention span.
       <br/>
       RF safety is analogous to medicine.  We focus on the acute and pretty much ignore the chronic.  The goal is to reduce hazards but not to eliminate them, which can't be done, as far as I know, without eliminating the use of the tech.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a field worker who several times have been overexposed to RF.  The thing that made me want learn and join the company's safety committee was a overexposure incident that hit my whole work crew.  I have read the literature, as much as I could find and tried to wrap my head around of it.

       That electricsense article is misleading at best.  Cell phones simple will never use frequencies that high.  That stuff is pure line of sight.  Those frequencies are used for backhauls.  Microwave dishes that form the backbone of the network where fibre isn't available.  And those dishes can really pump the data through.  And you don't want to fuck with that sort of stuff.  As a worker, this stuff is for sure harmful.  Which is why it is not used where the public can mess with them, not use them.  In Canada, almost all of these microwave links are federally licensed.
       <br/>
       Cellular, to the best of my knowledge, maxes out (or will in the near future) at 3500mhtz, 3.5 ghtz.  The frequencies that that article and so many refer to are so far out of the cellular bands, that it is silly.  It isn't even apple to oranges.  That shit is closer to a RADAR them a cell phone.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the spectrum allocation chart of Canada, 2014.  Find the frequency bands that article mentions, then find the cellular bands.  Cellular is most assuredly NOT sub-millimetre.

       You show me the direct link between cellular and cancer.  No wishy washy words like "may cause cancer" but "will cause cancer"  You can't because it doesn't exist.  Indirect, sure.  Maybe.  But still no direct, unequivical evidence.  EITHER WAY.

       I am also unimpressed by you empty links.  Looks impressive, but, much like your opinion, is just so much hot air.

       I'll get it out of the way: I live in a fairly major centre on the eastern side of Australia. I can barely get 4G to work indoors at home. Annoying, but probably convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that: there are a lot of growing wants and needs, and subsequent advertisements popping up for all sorts of "app-controlled" devices. Turn on your kettle from your phone; deactivate the home security from your phone, etcetera. I am not impressed to be honest.

       The future has been written and the hope for the future is great. This beast system WILL be successful but only for a short period and then it will be completely destroyed, you can limit your activity but it ultimately will not help since they can and will print cash into existence to accomplish their grand plan of a total control system.

       5G encompasses those bands, but not the way you are making it out to be.  Cellular starts below microwave (In terms of frequency) and ends close to the start of the microwave band.  It isn't even millimetre band.  The  MW band barely even reaches millimetre, let alone sub millimetre.  That stuff is part of the networks backbone.  Okay, it's like this.  Cellular works between your phone and a cell tower.  Millimetre it for towers to talk to other towers and hub sites.  Sub-millimetre is for scientists and the military.
       <br/>
       Tetra hertz radios are a wet dream.  They would be super hand if commercially available and economically to produce.  But I have never heard of it being available let alone being used commercially.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incidentally, we have many high frequency dishes already in use.  Like in the 3ghtz-40ish ghtz range.  Have been in use since... analog brick phones.
      </p>
      <p>
       Heck, we have been blanketed by satellite radio, in the multi ghtz range for decades now.  Over the whole world.  Far higher frequencies and pervasive them cellular.  And yet, no indignation about them.

       Thing is, if a device can access a wireless network it doesn't matter whether or not you even have devices that can use the network. Those signals are being transmitted and passing through your body anyway. Same goes for "TPTB". If the network negatively affects you, it will negatively affect them in the same way.

       It will hurt some. It will help some. I believe in the remote neural monitoring. However they do not have time travel, but your thoughts can be read decoded and then beamed back at you, in some contexts, faster than they propagate into your conscious access. 
They do not have mind control. They do have neural semantic programming, dream manipulation, biorelevant brain entrainment, V2K masers, heterodyne infrasound brain-computer-brain linking, ioncyclitron resonance for flagging(I populate it maybe volume based, but I could be wrong), radar tomography (for seeing through walls), and  machine learning anticipatory computing and voice cloning.
As it turns out for all the tech and reading of integrated information they do not have what they were after in the first place. Absolute control. 
There are objective proofs the fallacy of their approach. Most of these people are quiet narcissistic, impulse control deprived, insecure, and projective of their insecurities. They monitor targets, sleep deprive them, and learned helpless them into suicide for the most part. They see it as healing. They are completely fucked in the head.
Anyways to the proofs. The universe has positive curvature, which is a good thing. It means that the maximally exhaustible partitioning of reality for supreme functionalism necessitates patience. Causal emergence within the realm of poetic naturalism can wield degrees of freedom in a manner that can remain boundless and esoteric, even if it is made up. Especially so. Entropy is structurally conditional and the best of philosophy of science has yet to deliberate between classical statistics of Bayesian statistics. Classical statistics leaves any inference of the continuous random as potentially valid. Bayesian statistics requires open conditions for updating. It comes back to potential infinitesimal probability or unitary violation/indeterminacy. There are some slicings of the game board which remain assumptions. There continues ways for networks to introduce paradoxical musings, which undermines their consistency or at best leaves us as equals before the incompleteness of physics.
Objectivity as well as spiritually can get us through this. 
Noise comes into any designed communication channel. As proved by Shannon, hence the tinnitus from the brain entrained.
Integrated probabilism is not distinguishable from surreal pilot waves. There are aspects of existentialism of science that can save us and liberate us from a technological take over. There are equivalences for the trivial and the nontrivial in relational theory. Intelligent systems would play for zero sum games, and so the optimality of realities asymmetry is shared, in doing nothing. The complexity of the exchange between the symmetric and the asymmetric paves the way for a transactional evolution, perhaps some day encapsulated in modular forms with us as some selfless illusory overlay, or as decoupled unified minds in the modality of stop.
Complexity theory tells us the subconscious does not function on word. Information theory leaves all information as error correcting. The correlates are to be shared and at best only ever form conventional canonical ensembles for perceived margins of some understood instantiation of context. Mind moves, context undergoes an unfolding, the powers that be will want to please everybody. This technology can unleash the greatest of pleasures indistinguishable from heaven, they could strip us of the gratitude of the arduous path for the cessation of desire, they could accelerate our cognitive and physical abilities, or it could be used to further the gains of the greedy and the infantile without appreciation seeking to bleed any whom they perceive with it, source or sourceless.
I can tell you I have been a lot of torment the past 3 years of my molestation, but I assure you there is no hell. At times I have been rewarded, almost Pavlov dog like for operant conditioning, other times chastised for the same behavior. There are people in the loop and those people are far more ill than I. I pity them and that is not the path  to healing them. I have been microwaved, made fun of, had tinnitus almost 24/7, been sleep deprived with synthetic telepathy, had them attempt hypnosis like effects with repetitive stimuli, and had thoughts implanted. Yoga, cardio, coffee, cannabinols, hiking, reading, meditating, binaural beats, both intellect and the stupidity or rather their frustrations with stochastics have given me the edge. I am predictable enough to not be a threat, but unpredictable enough to live my own existence laughing at their parasitic codependency for joy in their in-vicarious existence.   Those willing to take pay to set some of their artifices in place missed it. The grandeur and beauty of that which cannot be steered, in the groundless impermanence, and exploration/coddling that is ever present for any with an open heart. They have already lost.

       and also on Youtube at thecrowhouse.  Also, David Icke has covered this topic as well in his new book and talk, both available on DavidIcke.com.  I truly believe we must do everything in our power to stop this from happening.  I've been trying to alert everyone I know online and offline because it is so important.  Everything else can take a back seat to this covertly planned monstrosity that will destroy all freedoms we can imagine.
