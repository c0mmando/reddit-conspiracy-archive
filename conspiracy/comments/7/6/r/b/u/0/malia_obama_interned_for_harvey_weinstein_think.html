    <div class="md"><p>&#39;They&#39; threw Weinstein under the bus to get on to Trump. And it&#39;s working. Now even Republicans suddenly publicly condemn sexual predators like never before (remember how quiet conservatives were when Bill O&#39;Reilly got busted?). </p>

<p>And the next step will be to get Trump (and his long list of sexual assault allegations) - since both political sides now heavily condemn the sexual abuse by powerful men.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the reality is, these &#39;producers&#39; have been allowed to bring into reality disgusting filth barely disguised as kids show. </p>

<p>icarly was developed with the purpose of getting children to start uploading their lives on line and making it seem normal to do &#39;challenges&#39; and other sexualized bullshit masqueraded as a joke or prank. </p>

<p>this shit goes deep and is so deep and disgusting I can&#39;t even begin to imagine if there is an end to it, cause if there is, it&#39;s truly one of the worst things unimaginable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When the internet was starting, most parents were concerned with what their child looked at online and most importantly, who their child interacted with. Everyone is different and of course some care more or less than others, but it&#39;s safe to say most parents are watchful of internet history of their young kids. </p>

<p>Posting pictures, videos or anything like that of your children was even weird before facebook, Myspace was known for pedos so most didn&#39;t want their kids on it, and before that AOL was horrible lol </p>

<p>Icarly helped push into the mainstream of your kids being live online, constantly in contact, in making videos and uploading it, taking pictures, and having things like facebook. Most parents aren&#39;t looking at disney with jaded eyes so they don&#39;t expect to look at everything with a fine tooth comb and they tune it out and focus on their devices. </p>

<p>The real insidious turn is when they themselves start enacting the behaviors seen on icarly, going on youtube rn you will fall down a pit of hell of creepy pedo fetish videos with millions of views on them, all with kids trying to copy them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is a repeat of when the paedo scandal broke in the UK with Savile. They&#39;ll out a few people and declare the problem solved. Meanwhile the elites will carry on regardless.</p>

<p>When a public inquiry is announced then it&#39;s game over for disclosure. It was Theresa May&#39;s handling of the paedo scandal when she was Home Secretary that killed it. That&#39;s why she was awarded the PM job after Cameron quit. Covering up for these people really advances your career.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When numerous entertainers with links to the UK elite were arrested or accused posthumously the then Home Secretary Theresa May announced a public inquiry into institutional child abuse. She then selected numerous chairs who had huge connections to the people doing the abusing and as such the delays in the inquiry pushed it out of the public consciousness and ensured the truth would be buried again. The Tory party, of which May is a member, were heavily implicated in the original cover up of the abuse in the 80s when Thatcher, a Tory, was PM.</p>

<p>Fast forward to the day after the Brexit vote PM David Cameron quit. Theresa May was quickly declared party leader in an uncontested leadership contest and as leader of the majority party in the House of Commons became prime minister.</p>

<p>Shady as fuck.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think so (at least I hope not), because the POTUS had more power that he did. Do you really think he could&#39;ve been that ignorant? </p>

<p>HW was able to get away with being a predator <em>because of</em> his &quot;power&quot; &amp; clout, some think that it&#39;s possible unknown victims might have complied to get what they wanted; he&#39;s been the open secret for decades. </p>

<p>Could be that some ppl won&#39;t speak out because for fear of backlash from the public. Pay for play seems to be the way things get done in businesses, especially in hollywood.</p>
