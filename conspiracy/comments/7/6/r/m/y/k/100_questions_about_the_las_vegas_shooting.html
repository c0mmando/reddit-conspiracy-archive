       I've been compiling these questions about the Las Vegas Shooting over the past two weeks so there may be some repeats on the list and there may be some questions which have already been adequately answered. If there are falsehoods then please don't use that to discredit the other questions on the list because I have limited resources to fact check each point. If you have found satisfactory answers to some of these, please share!
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Assuming the shooter was Paddock, what was his motive?
        <ol>
         <li>
          Where did he receive the training and proficiency to fire these weapons?
         </li>
         <li>
          How come there were no visible muzzle flashes from the 32nd floor?
         </li>
         <li>
          How many rounds were actually fired &amp; has this number been compared to the casings in Paddock’s room?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why did it take upwards of 80 minutes for the police to enter his room when his location was known by security guard Jesus Campos from the beginning?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why did the smoke alarms not go off in his room during the shooting? - In an interview with 60 minutes, the 4 police officers to enter the room said that their blasting charges set off the fire alarm.
         </li>
         <li>
          Is there any record of him purchasing the weapons which were used?
         </li>
         <li>
          Were any of the weapons in the hotel pre-1986 machine guns? Why are many gun experts calling into question the rate of fire and saying that some of the shots do not sound like they were coming from an AR-15 style rifle with a “bump stock”?
         </li>
         <li>
          Were the 90 round magazines the largest found in the room? If so, were there any instances where more than 90 rounds were fired at once?
         </li>
         <li>
          Out of the 23 guns in the hotel room, which ones were used?
         </li>
         <li>
          Were there any maids who cleaned his room in the 7 days leading up to the attack? If not, why not?
         </li>
         <li>
          Casino’s are covered in cameras… where is the video evidence of Paddock bringing in all of these weapons and ammo? Supposedly 10+ suitcases worth?
         </li>
         <li>
          Where is the CCTV footage from the hallway? If no such camera exists, why not?
         </li>
         <li>
          Where is the CCTV footage from the elevators?
         </li>
         <li>
          If he committed suicide, why would Paddock shoot himself in the chest instead of his head?
         </li>
         <li>
          In the bar photo, it appears he has a tattoo of the number 13 on his neck… in his suicide photo, it’s not there.
         </li>
         <li>
          Why is the gun used for his suicide above his head and his arms down by his side?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why is there a rifle on a bi-pod stand over his feet?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why place 3 different cameras to keep an eye out for people coming to his room and not have a device in the room to record?
         </li>
         <li>
          If a cell phone was found &amp; owned by Paddock, did it have the software on the cellphone to be able to stream the cameras to his phone?
         </li>
         <li>
          Were the cameras wireless or not?
         </li>
         <li>
          If the shooters goal was maximum casualties + suicide why not get in a shootout with the police inside the hotel?
         </li>
         <li>
          If the shooters goal was maximum casualties + suicide, why stop firing on the crowds below even though he had thousands of rounds still left?
         </li>
         <li>
          If the shooters goal was maximum casualties + escape, why kill himself when he was under no threat of capture?
         </li>
         <li>
          Who would stand to benefit from this sort of thing?
         </li>
         <li>
          Is it just coincidence that the Mandalay Bay CEO James Murren sold 80% of his stocks in the weeks leading up to the shooting?
         </li>
         <li>
          23 guns… why so many? Better results could have taken place with far fewer weapons and lots of magazines. (It’s faster to switch out a magazine than it is to put down a gun and pick up another gun.)
         </li>
         <li>
          If evidence were discovered at this point which ran counter to the official narrative, how confident are you that we would be told about it and that it would be fully investigated?
         </li>
         <li>
          What about the anonymous 4chan user who described the Las Vegas shooting about a month in advance?
         </li>
         <li>
          What do these groups stand to benefit from this shooting? Chertoff Group, OSI, and Rapiscan?
         </li>
         <li>
          Is it strange that James Murren is on the National Infrastructure Advisory Council @ DHS?
         </li>
         <li>
          The FBI were able to quickly conclude (within 12 hours) that the shooter did not have a connection with ISIS but they still don’t have a motive?
         </li>
         <li>
          Is the security guard Jesus Campos being investigated seeing as how his story has changed and he was the only person who could have possibly been involved and get away with a clean cover? (He was the only person on the 32nd floor with access to Stephen Paddock’s room other than Stephen Paddock during the time of the shooting).
         </li>
         <li>
          Why did the first two officers only learn about Jesus Campos being shot after they arrived onto the 32nd floor?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why did the first two officers go to the 31st floor looking for the shooter when it was known by the hotel that the shooter was on the 32nd?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why is nobody in the MSM talking about Paddock’s employment with the FBI and  Lockheed Martin which is one of the largest defense contractors in the US?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why do most headlines describe Paddock as a “retired accountant” instead of former FBI or former contractor for DHS?
         </li>
         <li>
          Was Paddock undercover FBI/ CIA? If he was, how could we ever know?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why do we have strange recordings which sound like there were multiple shooters from different locations?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why are the police and FBI not investigating a second shooter despite the numerous eyewitness accounts of there being one?
         </li>
         <li>
          In the video of the cab driver who drove people away from the concert after the attack, one of them supposedly had “a broken leg” but they didn’t want to go to a Hospital… but a “really nice Hotel”... what’s up with that?
         </li>
         <li>
          In an interview, Paddock’s brother almost said he was an “Arms…” but he stopped himself. --- Arms dealer?
         </li>
         <li>
          Paddock’s keycard was used to enter his room when he was not there… supposedly a Prostitute used his keycard.. Where is the proof of this? Why didn’t she find anything strange about the 10 suitcases filled with 23 guns?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why was there a cell phone charger found in his room which did not belong to any devices in the room?
         </li>
         <li>
          Has the piece of paper with numbers on it been analyzed to show it was his hand writing?
         </li>
         <li>
          Was the note analyzed to see if it really included things like wind velocity, distance, etc?
         </li>
         <li>
          Does the story and timeline of the Prostitute fit with the receipt for room service for 2, 4 days earlier?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why was the Security Guard present at Stephen Paddock’s room 6 minutes before the shooting towards the concert began? Why did he not immediately inform the hotel? If he did, why did the hotel not immediately call the police?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why was there a maintenance worker close by working on a door that had been rigged shut and that didn’t cause any alarm? Who told the maintenance worker about this? Was he able to get it unstuck? Was it the same door the police said they had to pry open with a prybar?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why were there no 911 calls about 200+ shots being fired inside of a Las Vegas Hotel during the 6 minutes leading up to the shooting at the concert? Why did it take so long to communicate to police where the shooter was?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why were there reports of shooters at other hotels and was this an intentional distraction / deception to hinder police response time to Mandalay Bay?
         </li>
         <li>
          The shooter’s location was known as early as 9:59 but it took them until after 11:00 to breach the door… and even then it wasn’t even a full swat team, rather it was 4 police officers from different divisions and one of them was SWAT but he didn’t have full SWAT gear. Did the officers hear any gunfire at all from the time they arrived on the 32nd floor until they breached the room? If not, why did Paddock supposedly kill himself before they were a threat to him?
         </li>
         <li>
          Isn’t it strange that ISIS released a video warning about an attack that will happen in either San Francisco or Las Vegas back on 6/27/2016?  (6+27= 33)
         </li>
         <li>
          Why the strange lengths of time between shots? Sometimes as long as 30-40 seconds or more.. This seems odd for someone with 23 locked and loaded guns looking to kill as many as possible.
         </li>
         <li>
          Why did the shooter switch from fully auto firing to single shots?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why not shoot the Luxor Hotel or the cars beneath the hotel? Why focus mainly on the concert?
         </li>
         <li>
          Supposedly he was gambling downstairs up until about 15 minutes before the shooting. Which means that he would have had to go directly to his hotel room in about 6-7 minutes time and carry out this attack w/ very little last-minute preparation because he supposedly shot at the security guard 6 minutes before the shooting towards the concert happened.
         </li>
         <li>
          The mass shooting was done in front of of a pyramid, sphinx, and obelisk. Was this supposed to be some sort of symbolic sacrifice?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why were there two people screaming and warning people that they were all going to die 45 minutes before the shooting? Who were these people? Have they been IDed?
         </li>
         <li>
          The security guard was supposedly responding to an open door alarm coming from a room next to Stephen Paddock’s. Don't all hotel doors close automatically for safety reasons?
         </li>
         <li>
          Also, if the Security guard knew where the shooter was 6 minutes before the shooting began towards the concert, that means it took police officers nearly 80 minutes before they breached the door. Why were there no calls to the police from people in the hotel saying they heard 200!!! rounds being fired inside a building? Why did the Hotel not tell police where he was, considering they knew 6 minutes before the shooting began?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why are we hearing conflicting reports about the fire alarm? Some reports have said that the shooter did set off the fire alarms from the shooting, which would mean the Hotel would know exactly what floor he was on. Some reports said that the fire alarm is what allowed the police to find the shooter "so quickly". But then in the 60 minutes interview with the 4 police officers who breached the room, they said that the breaching charges set off the fire alarm.. so which is it? What is the standard response when a fire alarm goes off in a hotel? If there is a fire on one floor, shouldn't other floors be notified as well? Shouldn't people be notified even in the lobby? Why are folks just standing around in the lobby, acting like nothing is going on during the shooting?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why did Paddock fly to Phoenix AZ just days before the shooting and rent a car to drive back? His trip back to Vegas took an extra 80 miles than what would be standard…
         </li>
         <li>
          Where did he go from Phoenix to Las Vegas? Why fly some where 4 hours away, and not fly back? Could it be because he was transporting something he couldn’t carry on a plane?
         </li>
         <li>
          The rental receipt places Paddock in Las Vegas on Sept 20th at 12:51 AM. But he didn’t check in at the Mandalay Bay until Sept 25th?
         </li>
         <li>
          When asked about Paddock’s time at the hotel from Sept 25th until October 1st, The Sheriff said that "I'm under the belief he was not occupying the room between those dates." .. whats up with that?
         </li>
         <li>
          The CEO of “the Wynn” hotel says they have a policy of “If the Do not disturb sign is on the door for more than 12 hours, we investigate” --- What about MGM? Why did housekeeping not detect what was going on?
         </li>
         <li>
          How long was the food cart sitting there? How often do they pick it up?
         </li>
         <li>
          Service staff found it weird that he and his girlfriend didn’t drink… Steven Wynn CEO of Wynn Hotel said that all of his employees never saw him or his GF drink alcohol. So why is there a picture of him taking a shot?
         </li>
         <li>
          Power drills and other tools were present, perhaps someone drilled holes into the glass and then broke them with a hammer?
         </li>
         <li>
          His money… supposedly he made money gambling at video poker?
         </li>
         <li>
          Is it possible he made money through illegal means and used the Casino’s to clean his money? I’ve heard this is common practice for “high rollers”.
         </li>
         <li>
          Why did MGM wait to call the police until after the shooter had opened fire on to the crowds in the concert?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why no reports of falling glass outside the windows?
         </li>
         <li>
          Supposedly Jesus Campos wasn’t a registered security guard for the State of NV until days after the shooting.
         </li>
         <li>
          Hotel employee says Paddock was using the freight elevator -- this claim needs to be checked.
         </li>
         <li>
          Supposedly the door that was triggering the open door alarm was not Paddock’s… if so, why did the shooter shoot at the security guard who was not approaching his door?
         </li>
         <li>
          How can it possibly take 8 days to figure out when he checked into the hotel?
         </li>
         <li>
          Why was Paddock wearing gloves if he planned on committing suicide?
         </li>
         <li>
          Have any other active shooters ever had girlfriends?
         </li>
         <li>
          If Paddock wasn't making money on video poker -- and he wasn't -- why would he be cycling millions of dollars through a casino, turning every dollar into, at best, 99 cents?
         </li>
         <li>
          Maybe Paddock enjoyed video poker. But if the allegedly serious media are going to keep telling us he was making a living doing it, they're just begging us to say that losing a percent or two on millions of dollars doesn't make sense as an investment strategy, but it does make sense as a money laundering operation.
         </li>
         <li>
          What have they released? CCTV footage of him from 6 years ago when he slipped and fell on the floor. But not anything from the current shooting.
         </li>
         <li>
          George Soros sold thousands of shares of stock he owned in LVS and WYNN. shares during 2017.
         </li>
         <li>
          In August of 2017, George Soros bought numerous put options on MGM, (meaning he was betting that MGM stock would go down)
         </li>
         <li>
          Is it just coincidence that a stock repurchase program at MGM was introduced September 5th?

          Paddock did not have any gambling debts and when he lost, he always paid on time said Steve WYNN. So why would someone with tons of money and no gambling debts do this?
         </li>
         <li>
          Have the FBI checked out the claim that the Valet said Steven Paddock didn’t check in with any bags on the 25th?

          Less interesting to most people other than tinfoil hat wearers.. But the Numerology is interesting - Shooter was on the 32nd story which in reality is the 33rd floor when you include the ground level.

          In 2016, The accountant and the latest Bourne movie were released 3 months and 3 days from eachother. (33) … Bourne movie features a plot to attack Las Vegas and the Accountant, well, it’s not about crunching numbers.

          Why does MGM track your physical location using your cellphone (whether you use their wi-fi or not) but Paddock can somehow bring an arsenal up to his room unnoticed?

         <li>
          Lombardo said that investigators have found 200 incidents of Paddock moving through the city, there was no evidence he was with anyone else… so then it wouldn’t be an issue to release the CCTV since there are no other suspects, right?

       They were both idiots, and frauds. The lady channeling the shooter spoke form the standpoint of a brainwashed MSM psychoanalysis. The shooter was supposed to have been woke. If she were actually channeling him, the answers would have been totally different.

       You must have never shot a bump stock. You don't 'pull' the trigger every time. the movement of the stock does it for you.

       I think one of the cops in the 60 minutes interview was saying something about there being so many weapons they were tripping over them. That could be the explanation, or that could be some bullshit they said to explain away that rifle's curious position (note: the pictures were "leaked" before that interview). Either way, you would think swat would be trained to clear rooms while disturbing a crime scene as little as possible.

       The question I've been asking from day one is which gun range or ranges was Paddock using to train with these weapons.  No possible way he just showed up and pray and spray.  Someone in a range should be able to come forward and say..... Yeah Paddock would come and shoot often etc....

       There are a couple of different ways you could do it. Your best bet is to just hit the little formatting help button down there (↘) and pick out what you think works best.

       Probably just using some asterisks with correct spacing will do as you'll get a bullet-pointed list that line wraps.

        I wanted to address these questions with a level headed answers, not conjecture like so many are and how OP is baiting. 9 times out of 10 the answer is the most mundane. I feel like a lot of people are looking for things that aren't there. That's not to say I believe the official narrative, because i absolutely don't. It's complete garbage, and Lombardo is being bullied into saying what the FBI wants him to so they can save face. What we are being told is not what happened IMO, but a lot of these questions can be simply explained.

      <pre><code>Where did he receive the training and proficiency to fire these weapons? **I think you're overestimating how much 'training' you need to do this. I think he sprayed a lot of the area and was not very 'dialed in'. there is also a lot of places in vegas where you can not only shoot full auto, but your own weapons. no reason why he couldn't have visited any of these places, or simply gone out in the desert. Where i live we are surrounded by BLM land that you can just go shoot. I'm sure there's something similar in nevada.**

How come there were no visible muzzle flashes from the 32nd floor? **They sell these things called flash hiders. Some of the good ones work pretty good. see [this](http://www.thetruthaboutguns.com/2015/12/jeremy-s/ar-15-flash-hiding-test-2/)**

How many rounds were actually fired &amp;amp; has this number been compared to the casings in Paddock’s room? **reports I've seen have said around 1000. That sounds about right to me from watching the videos. I believe the majority of the casings went out the window. It's been my experience with AR style guns that the casings are ejected with a forward trajectory. that being said, 1000 rounds wouldn't look like that much spread out on the floor. I'd be you could fit nearly 2000 casings in a standard ammo can.**

Why did it take upwards of 80 minutes for the police to enter his room when his location was known by security guard Jesus Campos from the beginning? **Good Question**

Why did the smoke alarms not go off in his room during the shooting? - In an interview with 60 minutes, the 4 police officers to enter the room said that their blasting charges set off the fire alarm. **there is a good theory that this is why he broke out two windows. the cross breeze would carry the majority of the smoke out.**

Is there any record of him purchasing the weapons which were used? **supposedly there are dealers that remember selling him guns, but no word on if it was the specific guns. The ATF would have the 4473's by now**

Were any of the weapons in the hotel pre-1986 machine guns? Why are many gun experts calling into question the rate of fire and saying that some of the shots do not sound like they were coming from an AR-15 style rifle with a “bump stock”? **none of the ones pictured or named are pre 86. these "gun experts" you mention are computer jockeys. a chain fed gun or a real select fire weapon don't have a varying fire rates. if you listen in the videos there are a lot of the volleys that have strange changes in tempo. this is lack of experience with a bump stock and the nature of how a bumpstock works. If I had one I would make a video with someone that's new with a bump stock, it sounds very much like what was heard. the videos ive seen trying to prove otherwise are all people that are well practiced with the stock. it was likely that paddock was not skilled, but had tried it once or twice before.**

Were the 90 round magazines the largest found in the room? If so, were there any instances where more than 90 rounds were fired at once? **I believe the magazines that were in the photos were surefire 100 round magazines. [here](http://www.surefire.com/mag5-100.html) It doesn't sound to me that there were any longer bursts than 100 rounds. this is yet another reason i don't believe there was a chain fed weapon used. Why would you only make your chain 100 rounds long when you can make them much longer.**

Out of the 23 guns in the hotel room, which ones were used? **no way to know for us, but i'd imagine the semi-auto 308 was used a few times (single shots) and the AR style guns. Nothing else makes much sense. obviously the handgun was used as well. IMO **

Were there any maids who cleaned his room in the 7 days leading up to the attack? If not, why not? **I remember reading at one point that maids HAD been there in that 7 day stretch and said nothing was out of the ordinary. Also vaguely remember them saying they heard him speaking with other people but that is unsubstantiated** 

Casino’s are covered in cameras… where is the video evidence of Paddock bringing in all of these weapons and ammo? Supposedly 10+ suitcases worth? **I don't know why every one assumes he took all of them at once. I would imagine he would bring them up a few at a time. no one would think twice about a guy in a hotel with two suitcases. He could have just as easily paid a bellhop to bring them up.**

Where is the CCTV footage from the hallway? If no such camera exists, why not? ** Pretty sure it's been stated many times in this thread that there are no cameras in most LV hotel hallways. privacy is the stated reason**

Where is the CCTV footage from the elevators? **Good Question**

If he committed suicide, why would Paddock shoot himself in the chest instead of his head? **it's not unheard of to have someone shoot themselves in the chest during a suicide. this is really not that strange**

In the bar photo, it appears he has a tattoo of the number 13 on his neck… in his suicide photo, it’s not there.**i believe this has been 'debunked' as just skin**

Why is the gun used for his suicide above his head and his arms down by his side? **common thought here is if he had shot himself and was laying there with the gun in his hand when SWAT came in, they would immediately kick the gun away as protocol.**

Why is there a rifle on a bi-pod stand over his feet? **I'm probably going to have to actually record a video for this, but i whole heartedly believe that this can be explained as him standing with his foot/toes under the gun that is set up on the tripod before he shoots himself. bang! falls back and toes 'hook' the far side of the gun and keep it 'on top' of his leg.**

Why place 3 different cameras to keep an eye out for people coming to his room and not have a device in the room to record? **why record the evidence? why not just stream it? especially if you believe the narrative that he had an escape plan. that's one more thing you'd have to destroy or take on your way out.**

If a cell phone was found &amp;amp; owned by Paddock, did it have the software on the cellphone to be able to stream the cameras to his phone? **60 min interview said there was a ton of electrontics in the room. it's likely that the phone was what was used IMO**

Were the cameras wireless or not? **Unlikely as you can see wires from the room service cart, and the story that he was drilling holes all over the rooms**

If the shooters goal was maximum casualties + suicide why not get in a shootout with the police inside the hotel? **someone in this frame of mind doesn't think straight in the first place**

If the shooters goal was maximum casualties + suicide, why stop firing on the crowds below even though he had thousands of rounds still left? **When the narrative was that Campos came up at the end of the shooting, this made sense. in his adrenaline rush, he saw campos and the maintenance and thought his time was up. maybe who knows.**

If the shooters goal was maximum casualties + escape, why kill himself when he was under no threat of capture? **remember, you're shooting 1000 rounds into a crowd. your adrenaline is going nuts. people don't tend to think straight in those kinds of situations without proper training. He saw people in the hall, that enough is threat of capture**

Who would stand to benefit from this sort of thing? **apparently MGM owners, and the guy that makes those metal detectors. FBI stays 'relevant'**

Is it just coincidence that the Mandalay Bay CEO James Murren sold 80% of his stocks in the weeks leading up to the shooting?** not in my opinion. he knew what was up**

         23 guns… why so many? Better results could have taken place with far fewer weapons and lots of magazines. (It’s faster to switch out a magazine than it is to put down a gun and pick up another gun.)
         <strong>
          it's faster if you're trained. shooting even in simulated full auto also heats up the barrel fast! easier to swap out and keep the barrels cool. IMO

         <strong>
          not confident at all. i think they have contradictory evidence. I don't think the public is ever going to REALLY know what happened here. no way at all do they disclose the official story

          there are 9/11 threads every year. ISIS has been threatening a vegas attack for a while as well. it's a great theory and one i personally am buying into right now, but who knows. could be coincidence. MEGANON has been kind of hit or miss since

         Is the security guard Jesus Campos being investigated seeing as how his story has changed and he was the only person who could have possibly been involved and get away with a clean cover?

         Why is nobody in the MSM talking about Paddock’s employment with the FBI and  Lockheed Martin which is one of the largest defense contractors in the US? ** I hadn't heard that it was confirmed that he worked for the FBI, can you cite this? Lockheed was YEARS ago.**

         Why do most headlines describe Paddock as a “retired accountant” instead of former FBI or former contractor for DHS?

         <strong>
          we wouldn't. that's the point of being undercover. the FBI wouldn't burn one of their own unless they stood to benefit from it. in this case doing so would make them look worse than they do already

         Why do we have strange recordings which sound like there were multiple shooters from different locations?
         <strong>
          multiple shooter theory is bogus IMO. they would have all had to been synced to shoot at the same time as ALL of these recordings are one firing over another. these are explained by the physics of shooting a gun at a long distance. you'll hear the 'crack' before the muzzle report because bullets are breaking the speed of sound. also with him 'spraying' all over, all 100 rounds wouldn't be hitting in one area but many. the people that heard the cracks and snaps should count their blessings. those bullets were very close to them.

          in context he was saying how self sufficient paddock was. I don't think he was trying to say "arms" (btw, i think he stops short of an 's', so just 'arm...'), but was going to say "Army of One" and thought better of it because that doesn't sound good that his brother whom he said wasn't a 'gun guy' was an Army of one.

         The shooter’s location was known as early as 9:59 but it took them until after 11:00 to breach the door… and even then it wasn’t even a full swat team, rather it was 4 police officers from different divisions and one of them was SWAT but he didn’t have full SWAT gear. Did the officers hear any gunfire at all from the time they arrived on the 32nd floor until they breached the room? If not, why did Paddock supposedly kill himself before they were a threat to him?

         Isn’t it strange that ISIS released a video warning about an attack that will happen in either San Francisco or Las Vegas back on 6/27/2016?  (6+27= 33)
         <strong>
          what's with the math? signifigance of 33? ISIS does this shit all the time though. even a broken clock is right twice a day

         Why the strange lengths of time between shots? Sometimes as long as 30-40 seconds or more.. This seems odd for someone with 23 locked and loaded guns looking to kill as many as possible.
         <strong>
          likely jams. those 100 rd mags are garbage and jam, as well as the bumpstock not being reliable when not used correctly. seems pretty straightforward to me

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why did the shooter switch from fully auto firing to single shots?
         <strong>
          I think the first shots were to gauge distance. the last two (filmed from the busstop) were handgun IMO

        <p>
         Why not shoot the Luxor Hotel or the cars beneath the hotel? Why focus mainly on the concert?
         <strong>
          if your goal is to kill as many as you can, why waste ammo on targets you are not sure of. crowd of 22k is a lot more of a sure thing

         Supposedly he was gambling downstairs up until about 15 minutes before the shooting. Which means that he would have had to go directly to his hotel room in about 6-7 minutes time and carry out this attack w/ very little last-minute preparation because he supposedly shot at the security guard 6 minutes before the shooting towards the concert happened.
         <strong>
          this is strange indeed

       <li>
        <p>
         The mass shooting was done in front of of a pyramid, sphinx, and obelisk. Was this supposed to be some sort of symbolic sacrifice?
         <strong>
          honestly, this theory is dumb as fuck IMO

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why were there two people screaming and warning people that they were all going to die 45 minutes before the shooting? Who were these people? Have they been IDed?
         <strong>
          not ID as far as I know. it's strange to say the least

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The security guard was supposedly responding to an open door alarm coming from a room next to Stephen Paddock’s. Don't all hotel doors close automatically for safety reasons?
         <strong>
          doesn't mean you cant turn the deadbolt or the lever thing to prop the door open.
         </strong>
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Also, if the Security guard knew where the shooter was 6 minutes before the shooting began towards the concert, that means it took police officers nearly 80 minutes before they breached the door. Why were there no calls to the police from people in the hotel saying they heard 200!!! rounds being fired inside a building? Why did the Hotel not tell police where he was, considering they knew 6 minutes before the shooting began?
         <strong>
          the 200 rounds is bullshit. the pics of the cart and door in the hall there would be way more damage from 200 rounds blowing through that. he would also would have likely hit both doors, and from what I can tell there are only holes in the door on the floor.

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Why are we hearing conflicting reports about the fire alarm? Some reports have said that the shooter did set off the fire alarms from the shooting, which would mean the Hotel would know exactly what floor he was on. Some reports said that the fire alarm is what allowed the police to find the shooter "so quickly". But then in the 60 minutes interview with the 4 police officers who breached the room, they said that the breaching charges set off the fire alarm.. so which is it? What is the standard response when a fire alarm goes off in a hotel? If there is a fire on one floor, shouldn't other floors be notified as well? Shouldn't people be notified even in the lobby? Why are folks just standing around in the lobby, acting like nothing is going on during the shooting?
         <strong>
          this needs cleared up. as for standing in the lobby, it's likely you couldn't hear the gunfire from within the casino area. those areas are loud on purpose

        <p>
         Why did Paddock fly to Phoenix AZ just days before the shooting and rent a car to drive back? His trip back to Vegas took an extra 80 miles than what would be standard…
         <strong>
          haven't heard this, but what's the point of the 80 miles being standard??

       <li>
        <p>
         Where did he go from Phoenix to Las Vegas? Why fly some where 4 hours away, and not fly back? Could it be because he was transporting something he couldn’t carry on a plane?
         <strong>
          if this is the case, I would think this is EXACTLY why he drove back, but again i havent heard that he flew out of vegas

         The rental receipt places Paddock in Las Vegas on Sept 20th at 12:51 AM. But he didn’t check in at the Mandalay Bay until Sept 25th?

         Maybe Paddock enjoyed video poker.

         Paddock did not have any gambling debts and when he lost, he always paid on time said Steve WYNN. So why would someone with tons of money and no gambling debts do this?
         <strong>
          Some people really ARE fucking crazy. not everything revolves around money. it is entirely likely he had a motive. very possible he was an activist of some sort. Could even see him being an anti gun activist. what better way to get people to shut down what you don't like by killing 58 people and wounding tons more? not much gets as much attention in this county as mass shootings

         Have the FBI checked out the claim that the Valet said Steven Paddock didn’t check in with any bags on the 25th?
         <strong>
          how would we even know that. that being said, the Valet that said that is now missing

         Less interesting to most people other than tinfoil hat wearers.. But the Numerology is interesting - Shooter was on the 32nd story which in reality is the 33rd floor when you include the ground level.
         <strong>
          only in aus or eu. in USA ground floor is 1. , though i've never been in MB hotel, I could be wrong. also, lots of many story buildings in the US skip 13th floor for superstitious reasons.

         Why does MGM track your physical location using your cellphone (whether you use their wi-fi or not) but Paddock can somehow bring an arsenal up to his room unnoticed?
         <strong>
          how would this change anything? they could still track him, doesn't mean they know what he's carrying. besides, you're tracked a whole lot MORE than you probably realize.

         Lombardo said that investigators have found 200 incidents of Paddock moving through the city, there was no evidence he was with anyone else… so then it wouldn’t be an issue to release the CCTV since there are no other suspects, right?
         <strong>
          except it's still an active investigation, so why would they? though a photo or two would go a long way to help their credibility

       With response to the idea that he needed extra guns in case one jams, or one becomes overheated, or w/e.. that is still way too many guns to have, so why bring more than what is necessary because each additional gun you bring and each additional suitcase you bring introduces a level of additional risk that is not necessary to accomplish your task? For comparison, here is an AR-15 meltdown where I think he fires around 300-400 rounds in about 6 minutes.
