<p>I don&#39;t post a lot on Reddit but I do spend a lot of time lurking on this board. Today, while reading about the r/elsagate conspiracies, I came across someone who posted this website. When I went to it, the images and background of the site are absurd and unpleasant to look at, but they also have a lot of random information and facts pertaining to the Department of Defense and several weird videos that seem 9/11 related. For example, while clicking random pictures/links on the site, I came across a compilation of what seemed to be some sort of cartoon, and the video of bush finding out that &quot;the plane hit the second tower&quot; and his odd reaction. The site also has a lot of random auditing information for the DOD and other things.  They also give instructions on a program called COFEE. I thought it was weird but maybe someone can use some of this information better than I can.  After further digging there are legal documents pertaining to MKULTRA and weird religious stuff. You have to do a lot of clicking on weird things to navigate this site. Like I said, I don&#39;t know what any of this means I&#39;m just posting and hoping someone can use anything from this. Let me know what you find! I&#39;ll edit this if I find specific links from this site that I think may be helpful.<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>If you inspect the code - (*I am at work and can&#39;t dig much) - but on the homepage, press F12 - this will bring up dev tools. You can see the code. </p>

<p>Whoever did this, has search engine optimization in mind hahaha... The &lt;head&gt; tag contains a meta description for the site. It references &quot;Conquering the Drawbacks of Democracy by Philip Atkinson.</p>

<p>Further more, there is more text on that homepage than you are lead to believe. (homepage: <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/lhohq_corporate.html">http://www.lhohq.info/lhohq_corporate.html</a>)</p>

<p>First there is an entire book excerpt in the meta tag. Next there is a paragraph with two individual paragraphs inside of it. Within that paragraph there is an anchor tag which contains an image. This anchor tag contains the text you see on the page.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing, I mentioned before.... These people had SEO (search engine optimization) and accessibility in mind. I say that because, even I, a web developer, don&#39;t always remember to include alt tags in my images - I only started doing it because we had clients getting sued by shitbag lawyers for not being accessible.</p>

<p>Anyways, the image alt tag on the homepage reads: calendar lake photo of Iowa midland corporate hegemony</p>

<p>So it looks like its pointing out some shit in Iowa - at least on the homepage. I will post a response to my comment with the full text of the homepage.</p>

Meta Description: Conquering the Drawbacks of Democracy</p>

<p>by Philip Atkinson</p>

<p>President George W. Bush is the 43rd President of the United States. He was sworn in for a second term on January 20, 2005 after being chosen by the majority of citizens in America to be president.</p>

<p>Yet in 2007 he is generally despised, with many citizens of Western civilization expressing contempt for his person and his policies, sentiments which now abound on the Internet. This rage at President Bush is an inevitable result of the system of government demanded by the people, which is Democracy.</p>

<p>The inadequacy of Democracy, rule by the majority, is undeniable -- for it demands adopting ideas because they are popular, rather than because they are wise. This means that any man chosen to act as an agent of the people is placed in an invidious position: if he commits folly because it is popular, then he will be held responsible for the inevitable result. If he refuses to commit folly, then he will be detested by most citizens because he is frustrating their demands.</p>

<p>When faced with the possible threat that the Iraqis might be amassing terrible weapons that could be used to slay millions of citizens of Western Civilization, President Bush took the only action prudence demanded and the electorate allowed: he conquered Iraq with an army.</p>

<p>This dangerous and expensive act did destroy the Iraqi regime, but left an American army without any clear purpose in a hostile country and subject to attack. If the Army merely returns to its home, then the threat it ended would simply return.</p>

<p>The wisest course would have been for President Bush to use his nuclear weapons to slaughter Iraqis until they complied with his demands, or until they were all dead. Then there would be little risk or expense and no American army would be left exposed. But if he did this, his cowardly electorate would have instantly ended his term of office, if not his freedom or his life.</p>

<p>The simple truth that modern weapons now mean a nation must practice genocide or commit suicide. Israel provides the perfect example. If the Israelis do not raze Iran, the Iranians will fulfill their boast and wipe Israel off the face of the earth. Yet Israel is not popular, and so is denied permission to defend itself. In the same vein, President Bush cannot do what is necessary for the survival of Americans. He cannot use the nation&#39;s powerful weapons. All he can do is try and discover a result that will be popular with Americans.</p>

<p>As there appears to be no sensible result of the invasion of Iraq that will be popular with his countrymen other than retreat, President Bush is reviled; he has become another victim of Democracy.</p>

<p>By elevating popular fancy over truth, Democracy is clearly an enemy of not just truth, but duty and justice, which makes it the worst form of government. President Bush must overcome not just the situation in Iraq, but democratic government.</p>

<p>However, President Bush has a valuable historical example that he could choose to follow.</p>

<p>When the ancient Roman general Julius Caesar was struggling to conquer ancient Gaul, he not only had to defeat the Gauls, but he also had to defeat his political enemies in Rome who would destroy him the moment his tenure as consul (president) ended.</p>

<p>Caesar pacified Gaul by mass slaughter; he then used his successful army to crush all political opposition at home and establish himself as permanent ruler of ancient Rome. This brilliant action not only ended the personal threat to Caesar, but ended the civil chaos that was threatening anarchy in ancient Rome Ã¢â‚¬â€œ thus marking the start of the ancient Roman Empire that gave peace and prosperity to the known world.</p>

<p>If President Bush copied Julius Caesar by ordering his army to empty Iraq of Arabs and repopulate the country with Americans, he would achieve immediate results: popularity with his military; enrichment of America by converting an Arabian Iraq into an American Iraq (therefore turning it from a liability to an asset); and boost American prestiege while terrifying American enemies.</p>

<p>He could then follow Caesar&#39;s example and use his newfound popularity with the military to wield military power to become the first permanent president of America, and end the civil chaos caused by the continually squabbling Congress and the out-of-control Supreme Court.</p>

<p>President Bush can fail in his duty to himself, his country, and his God, by becoming &#39;ex-president&#39; Bush or he can become &#39;President-for-Life&#39; Bush: the conqueror of Iraq, who brings sense to the Congress and sanity to the Supreme Court. Then who would be able to stop Bush from emulating Augustus Caesar and becoming ruler of the world? For only an America united under one ruler has the power to save humanity from the threat of a new Dark Age wrought by terrorists armed with nuclear weapons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yeah that would be cool. i must have about 10,000 email adresses so far, from government, to pr companies, to talk show hosts i actually heard of from america, actors, alchohol companies. nothing is making much sense, but heres a image of how im documenting it .i tried at first with screen shots, and arrows  from hyerlinks going to the next screenshot, but that was so messy, and made no sense. so i have gone into making text files, downloading all the files in each page, and explaining the text etc. theres leads inside the file names aswell (only some i have noticed, not all).i really messed up as i mentioned before in a comment somewhere else, by not realising i wasnt starting from the homepage. i started mid site somewhere. but i wrote down in each text file/folder, a numerical path and names, so i can draw a simple index of what links take you where, and where the next batch of links/photos takes you.  in regards to the email adresses though, they appear to be very useful to someone who was a celebrity. also the clintons show up a few times. as  i go through each page, im picking up new things i may have missed out from previous pages. sorry for a eyeburning&#39;ly long message. </p>

<p>It&#39;s good web design because 1) It allows you to know the context of the text even if the images don&#39;t load and 2) It allows blind people to use your website. </p>

<p>Most of text seems like gibberish and erroneous information, but there is also some really odd and disturbing content. E.g. mock satanic ritual video with really creepy voice over and a (sorta)hidden text diatribe filled with awful ideas like nuking Iraq and Iran. The last two pages are relatively normal compared the the rest of that madness. </p>

<p>Below is an example of some of the (sorta)hidden text you can find:</p>

<p>POLITICAL INTRODUCTION In 1954 it was well recognized by those in positions of authority that it was only a matter of time, only a few decades, before the general public would be able to grasp and upset the cradle of power, for the very elements of the new silent-weapon technology were as accessible for a public utopia as they were for providing a private utopia. The issue of primary concern, that of dominance, revolved around the subject of the energy sciences. ENERGY Energy is recognized as the key to all activity on earth. Natural science is the study of the sources and control of natural energy, and social science, theoretically expressed as economics, is the study of the sources and control of social energy. Both are bookkeeping systems: mathematics. Therefore, mathematics is the primary energy science. And the bookkeeper can be king if the public can be kept ignorant of the methodology of the bookkeeping. All science is merely a means to an end. The means is knowledge. The end is control. Beyond this remains only one issue: Who will be the beneficiary? In 1954 this was the issue of primary concern. Although the so-called &quot;moral issues&quot; were raised, in view of the law of natural selection it was agreed that a nation or world of people who will not use their intelligence are no better than animals who do not have intelligence. Such people are beasts of burden and steaks on the table by choice and consent. Consequently, in the interest of future world order, peace, and tranquility, it was decided to privately wage a quiet war against the American public with an ultimate objective of permanently shifting the natural and social energy (wealth) of the undisciplined and irresponsible many into the hands of the self-disciplined, responsible, and worthy few. In order to implement this objective, it was necessary to create, secure, and apply new weapons which, as it turned out, were a class of weapons so subtle and sophisticated in their principle of operation and public appearance as to earn for themselves the name &quot;silent weapons.&quot; In conclusion, the objective of economic research, as conducted by the magnates of capital (banking) and the industries of commodities (goods) and services, is the establishment of an economy which is totally predictable and manipulatable. In order to achieve a totally predictable economy, the low-class elements of the society must be brought under total control, i.e., must be housebroken, trained, and assigned a yoke and long-term social duties
An introductory programming manual Operations Research Technical Manual TM-SW7905.1 WELCOME ABOARD This publication marks the 25th anniversary of the Third World War, called the &quot;Quiet War,&quot; being conducted using subjective biological warfare, fought with &quot;silent weapons.&quot; This book contains an introductory description of this war, its strategies, and its weaponry. May 1979 #74-1120 SECURITY It is patently impossible to discuss social engineering or the automation of a society, i.e., the engineering of social automation systems (silent weapons) on a national or worldwide scale without implying extensive objectives of social control and destruction of human life, i.e., slavery and genocide. This manual is in itself an analog declaration of intent. Such a writing must be secured from public scrutiny. Otherwise, it might be recognized as a technically formal declaration of domestic war. Furthermore, whenever any person or group of persons in a position of great power and without full knowledge and consent of the public, uses such knowledge and methodology for economic conquest -- it must be understood that a state of domestic warfare exists between said person or group of persons and the public. The solution of today&#39;s problems requires an approach which is ruthlessly candid, with no agonizing over religious, moral or cultural values. You have qualified for this project because of your ability to look at human society with cold objectivity, and yet analyze and discuss your observations and conclusions with others of similar intellectual capacity without a loss of discretion or humility. Such virtues are exercised in your own best interest. Do not deviate from them. HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION Silent weapon technology has evolved from Operations Research (O.R.), a strategic and tactical methodology developed under the military management [Eisenhower] in England during World War II. The original purpose of Operations Research was to study the strategic and tactical problems of air and land defense with the objective of effective use of limited military resources against foreign enemies (i.e., logistics). It was soon recognized by those in position</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking anyone with photoshop experience better than mine, can do some photo manipulation on this. I assume it has some info in it. Not to mention the meta data in the photo itself.

<p>Then at the bottom of the page, there is a link around an image. The link goes to: videogameviolence.html - the image referenced is texas.jpg and the alt tag (which is particularly interesting) on the image is: &quot;soup can random distribution of soup scatterplot can soup&quot;  now remember the name of the image that is pure black at the beginning is named &quot;soup.jpg&quot;   ----   what this could be... I have no idea. </p>

<li>The people were asked to curb their prejudice against corporations. It was promised that in the future corporations should be honestly run, and in the interest of the stockholders and the public. Dru expressed the hope that their formation would be welcomed rather than discouraged, for he was sure that under the new law it would be more to the public advantage to have business conducted by corporations than by individuals in a private capacity. In the taxation of real estate, the unfair practice of taxing it at full value when mortgaged and then taxing the holder of the mortgage, was to be abolished. The same was to be true of bonded indebtedness on any kind of property. The easy way to do this was to tax property and not tax the evidence of debt, but Dru preferred the other method, that of taxing the property, less the debt, and then taxing the debt wherever found.  small bank tarp deal His reason for this was that, if bonds or other forms of debt paid no taxes, it would have a tendency to make investors put money into that kind of security, even though the interest was correspondingly low, in order to avoid the trouble of rendering and paying taxes on them. This, he thought, might keep capital out of other needful enterprises, and give a glut of money in one direction and a paucity in another. Money itself was not to be taxed as was then done in so many States. CHAPTER XXXIII THE RAILROAD PROBLEM While the boards and commissions appointed by Administrator Dru were working out new tax, tariff and revenue laws, establishing the judiciary and legal machinery on a new basis and revising the general law, it was necessary that the financial system of the country also should be reformed. Dru and his advisers saw the difficulties of attacking this most intricate question, but with the advice and assistance of a commission appointed for that purpose, they began the formulation of a new banking law, affording a flexible currency, bottomed largely upon commercial assets, the real wealth of the nation, instead of upon debt, as formerly. This measure was based upon the English, French and German plans, its authors taking the best from each and making the whole conform to American needs and conditions. Dru regarded this as one of his most pressing reforms, for he hoped that it would not only prevent panics, as formerly, but that its final construction would completely destroy the credit trust, the greatest, the most far reaching and, under evil direction, the most pernicious trust of all. While in this connection, as well as all others, he was insistent that business should be honestly conducted, yet it was his purpose to throw all possible safeguards around it. In the past it had been not only harassed by a monetary system that was a mere patchwork affair and entirely inadequate to the needs of the times, but it had been constantly threatened by tariff, railroad and other legislation calculated to cause continued disturbance. The ever-present demagogue had added to the confusion, and, altogether, legitimate business had suffered more during the long season of unrest than had the law-defying monopolies. Dru wanted to see the nation prosper, as he knew it could never have done under the old order, where the few reaped a disproportionate reward and to this end he spared no pains in perfecting the new financial system. In the past the railroads and a few industrial monopolies had come in for the greatest amount of abuse and prejudice. This feeling while largely just, in his opinion, had done much harm. The railroads were the offenders in the first instance, he knew, and then the people retaliated, and in the end both the capitalists who actually furnished the money to build the roads and the people suffered. This request is designed to implement the analytical and IT requirements for the NSAC by augmenting the existing HSPD-2 operations to provide the additional analysis and technology support for the NSB. Justification The NSAC will include FTTTF Operations under HSPD-2 and expand to support NSB requirements, as seen in the diagram below. This diagram is a visual representation of the NSAC, including lines of authority, business areas, existing and expanded operations, information technology (IT) and prioritized IT projects and programs. The Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO) and the Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) will provide IT support to the NSAC, as they now do for the FTTTF. </li>

But it will also have caused alarm among other people in the public eye who deal with sensitive information - or anyone, indeed, who values their privacy. If the secretary general of the United Nations cannot prevent his private conversations from being listened to by all and sundry, who can? It seems if someone wants to listen to what you are saying badly enough, there is very little you can do to stop it. &quot;Technological advances, particularly in the fields of power supply and miniaturisation, mean that its now possible to bug almost anywhere and anything,&quot; says Charles Shoebridge, a former counter-terrorism intelligence officer. &quot;Similar advances have enormously improved anti-bugging capabilities too, and an enormous effort has gone into making communications secure - particularly those of governments and even large commercial organisations. &quot;However, if security is absolutely critical, it will always pay to assume that a conversation is at l years of their lives. It has produced generations of ertarian, but are authoritarian libertines (the libertine trait is not necessarily bad, the authoritarian trait IS necessarily bad). How did the Pledge of Allegiance turn libertarian people into flagety libertines? How did the government bamboozle individuals into believing that robotic group-chanting in government schools is a beautiful expression of freedom? America&#39;s flag obscenities started as early as 1875, and continued through the creation of the National Socialist German Workers&#39; Party (German Nazis or NSGWP). In 1875, the Theosophical Society was created in New York. The TS was orgainized by Madame H.P. Blavatsky, Colonel Henry Steel Olcott (U.S. army, retired, and a writer for the New York Daily Graphic), and Charles Sotheran (an author, socialist, and a Freemason Supreme Council member of the Scottish Rite, a &quot;secret society&quot; steeped in ritual and alleged occult interests). The TS grew rapidly and soon after became international. <a href="http://rexcurry.net/theosophy-madame-blavatsky-theosophical-society.html">http://rexcurry.net/theosophy-madame-blavatsky-theosophical-society.html</a> The Theosophical Society (TS) touted the explicit collectivist goal of &quot;universal brotherhood.&quot; The political product was socialism and self-sacrifice to government by calling it the &quot;greater good.&quot; The TS dogma reveals no knowledge of economics, markets, prices, trade or private property rights. Theosophy is similar to other civic, religious or philosophical groups where followers are easily seduced and raped by socialists. </li>

Mutual emotional masturbation each morning in America has been a nasty example to perverts worldwide. Whether it was done toward the USA&#39;s flag or toward the swastika flag, the kinky chanting and the gesticulation represented submission and obedience to follow authority and obey commands The NSGWP had clear roots in National Socialism promoted by socialists in the USA. The ritualized humiliation and degradation has inspired bondage and discipline and sadism masochism (BDSM and sado-masochism) and even death. America influenced the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Peoples&#39; Republic of China, and the National Socialist German Workers&#39; Party, and it was the origin of their salutes, their robotic chanting and their worship of government and flags and symbols in their government schools (socialist s a preceding word or group of those we found angels in div 1995 from it is not Gk: a sincere worth a great consolation</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Holy fuck. Ummm that video isnt whats on that page...</p>

<p>That video is basically just covering up a bunch of text. Under that text is some pretty interesting information.</p>

<p>Title: Contribution of the Rapporteur: Research on the Planes Used by the CIA</p>

<p>and then a VERY detailed list of CIA planes, when they have taken off, landed, when and where. Dates and times. Further, it explains tail numbers and more...</p>

<p>Googling it, looks like in 2002, Claudio Fava compiled this information - Giovanni Claudio Fava is an Italian politician. He is the Coordinator of the National Secretariat of Sinistra Ecologia Libertà. - Here is the research document on the CIA: <a href="https://www.anagomes.eu/PublicDocs/b4966aac-ea37-4717-824e-7708c3f506de.pdf">https://www.anagomes.eu/PublicDocs/b4966aac-ea37-4717-824e-7708c3f506de.pdf</a></p>

<p>I found out Claudio published this because it is referenced in the book &quot;Shadow Warriors: The untold Story of Traitors, Saboteurs and the Party of Surrender&quot;</p>

<p>Interesting stuff guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright, I was amped then looked into it and wasnt so amped. But taking a closer look I found something more.</p>

<p>The PDF mentioned above is all the information presented on this LHOHQ site. So I wrote it off as a copy pasta - which I suspect most this site is but whats important is where that copy pasta came from. So I have been trying to find sources on everything. Anyways, if you scroll further down this bob.html page, past all the tabular data stuff, you will find tons of images like... ~89 images that pertain to official registrations with FAA and sorts. The original document does not include these documents. I think that is important to point out.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lhohq.info/free-baluchistan/drugs-cia-N987SA-faa-registration_img_40.png">http://www.lhohq.info/free-baluchistan/drugs-cia-N987SA-faa-registration_img_40.png</a>

<p>(just change the number to see more - img_43, img_44)</p>

<p>Also, this gave me another name. Baluchistan - who is he, i havent Googled yet but they set this structure up on purpose. Or... It could be one big smoke screen. But I&#39;m down to find out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, glad someone else remembers. I never dove too deep because it seemed like a waste of time. IIRC the site owner actually realized where the spike in traffic was coming from and made some page as a response saying &quot;I am Robert Anton Wilson&#39;s brain in a vat&quot; which annoyed me because not only is it a blatantly false comparison, it&#39;s insulting to one of my favorite authors.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wrong. Super wrong.</p>

<p>It contained verifiable information about CIA planes running cocaine, JEMSO global data monitoring sites and tons of other information that, if the news reported on, would bring the US government to a halt. </p>

<p>It also reveals that cults are a controlled tool of the deep state and it starts with a video about &quot;Bob&quot; who is Robert Heinlen.</p>

<p>The information, if you have the brain to pull it from the site, is designed to allow you to confirm with through other sources.</p>

<p>It also contained contact lists of Colin Powell&#39;s emails, Syd Blumenthal&#39;s emails and other politicians where the common denominator from both sides of the aisle was &quot;TAMARA LUZZATTO.&quot;</p>

<p>So, not only does it confirm unconstitutional spying, it confirms CIA drug running and gun-running, and, seemingly, pizzagate because of the Luzzatto info and the cult info.</p>

<p>Going off the video someone else posted (<a href="http://www.lhohq.info/cinema/lhohq-space-girl.mp4">http://www.lhohq.info/cinema/lhohq-space-girl.mp4</a>) - I went to <a href="http://www.lhohq.info/cinema/">http://www.lhohq.info/cinema/</a> - which says &quot;what are you looking for&quot; that all there is on this page which is important because the other ones had some meta data. Further... If you google LHOHQ Iowa, some of their pages show up on Google. This is important because those pages have metadata allowing Google to index their site. There is a Follow/Index meta. So that means, some pages they are hiding and others they are showing to the public.</p>

<p>I will say, Laughing Horse Orifices HQ is definitely it.

<p>They seem to use trending topics and also just collect a mass quantity of text so they come up for a lot more terms on google. Check out the homepage: <a href="http://archive.is/hNBdN">http://archive.is/hNBdN</a></p>

<p>The blurbs are likely generated with markov chains, which use chunks from source text in a heuristic manner, either generating new text or modifying the original. The pictures are entirly unrelated.</p>

<p>If you go to the <a href="http://archive.is/6ef0P">phonograph</a> (About/Massage) subdomain it&#39;s what looks like a guest book. A quick <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&amp;amp;dcr=0&amp;amp;source=hp&amp;amp;q=site%3Aphonograph.lhohq.info&amp;amp;oq=site%3Aphonograph.lhohq.info">check on google</a> shows that this subdomain isn&#39;t blocked by the site&#39;s robots.txt, meaning it&#39;s fully indexed and will show up for whatever lunacy is posted there (by the site&#39;s admin or actual guests).</p>

<p>I seem to remember another page on it somewhere that was literally just random images but they were all the same size and quality and there was only ever one per page. You&#39;d click next to progress through them.</p>

<p>tl;dr apart from trolling there could be meaning laced in but it&#39;s amidst so much batshit insane that it does no good to anyone, except the owner, who gets free advertising for whatever group he may be running (see <a href="http://archive.is/Wnkzv">octagon</a>) from people posting it on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a></p>

<p>I think this site might be a honeypot/distraction operation.</p>

<p>Based on my time in researching many topics, among them child abuse, mkultra-esque modern research and others, we need to expose everything, and perhaps this site is related. I&#39;ve also spent time looking at it, and I also remember when it first appeared on this site. The website you are referencing was linked (for the first time in recent memory) when <a href="/r/pizzagate">/r/pizzagate</a> banning and drama was going news, right after the CTR brigading. Shills were private messaging with links to shady &quot;chat&quot; apps, that would take permission from camera and mic, and honeypot you to phish for ip address, usernames, and more. I have evidence of this, happy to talk more about it. I came to the conclusion that this site was being used to collect SEO, and to distract people from REAL topics of sexual abuse, child trafficking, and other repudiate crimes.</p>

<p>Around the time the Podesta emails were getting researched on pol and other places, the term &quot;fake news&quot; was first launched on Facebook, the same night when many nights of advanced and rapid research was being done online. Many shills, and dissenters were present to make people avoid looking at topics, many memes still exist today referencing this. </p>

<p>Usually shills, bots or dissenters will try to dissuade you from researching topics, or tell people (in <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> no doubt) that they are wrong, when researching topics found here. I want to encourage you with all my might. I just have a hunch that this particular site is a distraction. I also think it&#39;s very fascinating. If you have the time to look, please do! I just think we have real crimes in front of us as well, that could also use your equal attention.</p>

<p>Take care, always curious to hear more about these sites, if anyone has spent the time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Something intended to be a pure distraction can still produce usable information, it&#39;s just a lot less likely than other sources.</p>

<p>Regarding the &quot;chat&quot; apps, I joined one that was using <a href="https://riot.im">https://riot.im</a> (it&#39;s also where I first learned of lhohq) but I was also using fairly decent protection, noscript/privacy badger/VPN etc. Never got asked to share my webcam/mic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay so I&#39;ve spent some more time on this site. I posted below a bunch of GPS Lat Long coords and names, etc... Looks like that table came from this data: <a href="https://cryptome.org/1804.htm">https://cryptome.org/1804.htm</a> - obviously this isnt the original source but its got everything on it.</p>

<p>Next up is a great resource for us. BUT PLEASE I BEG YOU, dont get sucked down the wrong rabbit hole. We need to find out about the LHOHQ site. Not just this one page. This could lead us there but wont be the answer.</p>

<p>Here is a manual posted in the site: (maybe not manual but a how-to of sorts) - <a href="https://cryptome.org/disa/disa-stations.htm">https://cryptome.org/disa/disa-stations.htm</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>awesome. so i kept what i did already, but now i woken up i have gone back to the very first homescreen and starting from there. what i found on that page, was a code, which if you google search it, it appears on a completely different site, but the site is in the exact same kind of style as the one we are on (LHOHQ), and guess what is hidden on the landing page? yes, a fuck load more emails, but these are also accompanied by phone numbers and addresses., so all together, we have 3 linked sites (Which did get mentioned somewhere else, but wrong links were supplied so it was a dead end until now. just a thought that came to my mind, we have 2 types of information, things that make sense and understandable, and things that make no sense and seem like gibberish, well i think the gibberish things, are broken into parts, and need to be reassembled, except each of the parts from the original content, is on the seperate websites. what im wondering now, is once we made teh plan of the sites layout , will the same layout appear on the other sites? so its easy to reassemble? theres no way there is random gibberish on these sites. everything is something when you look at it. really, im just writing this, so i dont forget any of this thing, and it makes sense if i tell you something im looking at and you  have no idea what it is, it will make sense its a external site to what were looking at, which isnt accesible, from the LHOHQ site</p>

<p>now heres something i found, on this page = <a href="http://synt.abod.co/orifice/">http://synt.abod.co/orifice/</a></p>

<p>thats the orifice part of the abod.co site. but the picture on that page, when you click it, it goes to a none existant link, so i looked in the source code, 
<a href="http://synt.us/mark-5frqcommunists-judamay13-ofhix/">http://synt.us/mark-5frqcommunists-judamay13-ofhix/</a></p>

<p>i changed synt.us, to synt.abod.co
then added the /mark-5frqcommunists-judamay13-ofhix/</p>

<p>to give
synt.abod.co/mark-5frqcommunists-judamay13-ofhix/</p>

<p>BINGO. worked. thought it was a dead end. happy it wasnt.
do you know what this could mean, there was a bunch of site links hidden in the source.

<p>&quot;Clinical research reveals that psycho-physiological sensitivity to extreme low frequency magnetic and electric fields.  Brainwave entrainment can be demonstrated in the vicinity of oscillations in the frequency range of 3 to 20 Hz at intensities of below 100 nanoteslas.  (1 tesla = 104 gauss) ELF fields of 6.67 Hz, 6.26 Hz and lower tend to symptoms of confusion, anxiety, depression, fear, mild nausea and headaches, cholinergia, arthritic-like aches, insomnia, extended reaction times, hemispheric EEG desynchronization, and many other vegetative disturbances.  H and B field (magnetic vector) oscillations of 7.8, 8.O and 9 Hz produce anxiety-relieving and stress-reducing effects mimicking some &#39;  meditative &#39;states.  The psychology of psychology and psychoanalysis of psychology and psychoanalysis in psychoanalytic psychology. healing, radiesthesia, and related paranormal but anecdotal phenomena.  Coherent ELF energies have the unique and interesting property of almost lossless propagation within the earth-ionosphere cavity waveguide, and attenuation of these signals due to distance from transmitter sites is negligible.  Power losses are O.8 db per Mm (million meters).  The magnetic vectors, unlike electrical (E-wave) components, permeate any substance and can not be effectively shielded, even by iron, mu-metal, lead, copper, Faraday cages.  The established physics of radio propagation therefore suggests that vast geographical areas can be readily mood-manipulated by transmissions of EM energy within the earth-ionosphere cavity wave guide.  The accidental discovery in 1938 of the &#39;Luxembourg Effect&#39;, by which a transmitter of low power, fed to an antenna array producing a circularly-polarized signal, can &#39;piggy-back&#39; to any preexisting. ionosphere at any frequency desired (which then &#39;modulates&#39; all other energies within that &#39;waveguide&#39; is fully described in the literature of 40 years ago but probably forgotten or overlooked by today&#39;s technologists.  HISTORY AND BACKGROUND My personal interest in EEG and consciousness dates to 1969 when I became fascinated with the re-discoveries of Joe Kamiya and the conscious control of brainwaves via biofeedback.  Monopolar instrumentation for this purpose under the Alpha-Metrics trademark.  In the course of traveling, lecturing, teaching classes and demonstrating this EEG equipment, and because of my personal interests was in parapsychology and consciousness research, I had the unique opportunity to make electroencephalographic recordings of the brain wave reputations as psychics, healers, medicine-men, dowsers, and so on.  I was fortunate enough to have a cross-section of &#39;sensitives&#39; from vastly different disciplines , ranging from charismatic Christian faith healers, to an authentic Hawaiian Kahuna, to practitioners of Wicca, hex, Santaria, radiesthesia-radionics, seers, ESP &#39;readers&#39;, psychics, etc.  A striking number of these authentic &#39;sensitives&#39; exhibited a nearly identical EEG signature when reporting that they were in their &#39;working&#39; state of consciousness, a state persisting from one to several seconds intermittently during the &#39;altered state of consciousness&#39; phase of the paranormal activity.  The signal appears to be an almost pure sine-wave of up to 25 microvolts as read MONOPOLAR, frontal to occipital, midline;  and 7.8 to 8.0 Hz in frequency;  or on the &#39;alpha-theta&#39; borderline.  This serendipitous discovery was unexpected, in which the subjects were practicing opposing disciplines, and coming from totally disparate teachings and viewpoints, and would barely acknowledge the existence or authenticity of practitioners of their belief system. sound of the same cosmic drummer &#39;when in an altered state of consciousness.  After replicating this phenomenon, the cosmic consciousness, the cosmic consciousness, the unconscious,  what was the signal to which their brain waves became entrained?  What was the &#39;drummer&#39;?  Is there a &#39;clock&#39; or &#39;synchronizing&#39; signal present?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;In 1952, physicist WO Schumann postulated mathematically that our earth and ionosphere constituted a cavity wave, whose physical and magnetic field would oscillate at a resonant frequency to the range of human brain waves.  In 1962, our National Bureau of Standards Division of Radio Propagation reported the actual physical detection and instrumental recordings of these signals;  and as predicted, tracings were indistinguishable from encephalographic recordings from human brain waves.  This newly-discovered phenomenon was dubbed &#39;earth brain wave&#39;.  Since there is a pronounced node in these Schumann resonances at 7.8 - 8.O Hz,  the question of possible EEG and ELF interconnectedness appears to be irresistible area for investigation.  In 1973 a professional coil fabricator duplicated the &#39;Schumann&#39; pick-up described on page 313 in the Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards, Division of Radio Propagation, Vol. 66D No.3 May-June 1962, and I perfected an extremely low noise, highly-filtered amplifier capable of recording and displaying the naturally-occurring magnetic oscillations surrounding our biosphere.  EEG and ELF records and compares the signals for frequency and phase coherency.  This was the first phase of investigations.  In a few instances,  careful analysis revealed episodes of absolute entrainment during the brief seconds when sensitives reported being in their altered states of consciousness.  Unexpected variables emerged, such as reliability factors dependent on lunar phases and time of day.  This study was extended to test the theory that a very small percentage of subjects, by virtue of hereditary factors, or religious or metaphysical discipline, or meditative practices, had sensitized some of their minds or brains to act as an extremely sensitive dual -conversion superheterodyne receiver &#39;;  would have been able to remotely sense, amplify, and display this real-time &#39;drummer&#39; to less sensitive subjects whose heads were unresponsive and un-selective as a crystal set,  abilities of the trained &#39;seer&#39;?  Late in 1973, the apparatus was built for pulsing a miniature lamp as a real-time photic stimulus that would cause an evoked potential in step with the ELF &#39;cosmic drummer&#39;.  This was moderately promising, but marginally successful because of the individually variable delay-llne (of about 100 milliseconds) between the stimulus and its response.  The next effort at inducing psychic awareness was to place at 9 ft.  diameter coil of about 100 turns of # 28 magnet wire on the floor of the laboratory, and exposes subjects to the real-time magnetic replica of the highly-amplified &#39;Schumann&#39; signal at a remote location to avoid feedback.  Results with individuals and groups experiencing &#39;magic circle&#39; were dramatically successful.  The third generation investigations were extended to determine whether or not the brainwaves could be influenced by artificially generated magnetic oscillations of sine-waves of low intensity and at specific frequencies within the ranges occurring naturally.  Some subjects exhibited absolute brainwave entrainment over the range of approximately 6 to 14 Hz and at nanoteslas.  ELF generator, and would sometimes last for the duration of the stimulus, usually 10 second episodes.  One subject (Mr. AP, aged 54) displayed absolute entrainment when he was placed inside a triple-shielded magnetic (iron) and triple electrostatic (copper) Faraday cage.  The artificial ELF stimulus was originating from a pocket-sized battery powered device positioned outside the shielded room and 12 ft.  removed from the subject.  EEG to exactly follow the stimulus.  After demonstrating the neurological responses of sensitive individuals, and performing preliminary mapping of subjective states as reported for various specific frequencies (defined to 1/100 Hz on a ELF generator), experiments were undertaken on a broader scale with totally unaware subjects, local coffee shops during rush hours.  This obviated the variables of &#39;suggestion&#39;, &#39;expectancy&#39; or &#39;hypnosis&#39;.  Anecdotal data amassed suggesting that a pocket-sized transmitter at power levels of 100 milliwatts could drastically alter the moods of unsuspecting persons, and that vast geographical areas could be surreptitiously mood manipulated by invisible and remote transmissions of EM energy.  Tests were rapid: y abandoned after dramatic proof because of ethical considerations.  It is well known that naturally-occurring earth-ionosphere magnetic oscillations will vary slightly in frequency diurnally, monthly (full vs. new boon), and in definite cycles related to sunspot activity.  This may well explain observable &#39;full moon craziness&#39;.  Resonant frequencies are also affected by earth-venus-mercury-moon-Jupiter-sun gravity vectors.  And there is well-documented correlation between these geophysical phenomena and episodes of political unrest,  mood alteration, and health cycles;  as well as the literature.  Our &#39;Drummer&#39;seems to affect all life-forms.  An excellent reference source of widely unrelated phenomena dramatically tied to our earth&#39;s geometric cycles is Peterson&#39;s Man.  Weather.  Sun.  cited in the bibliography.  And by artificially amplifying or altering or distorting these geomagnetic fields, or transmitting specific and coherent frequencies, vast segments of earth&#39;s populations could be affected.  This now becomes an attractive modality of psychological or psionic warfare;  or fluctuations in the price.  (Epidemics of 4:00 to 5:30 AM &#39;worry&#39;, insomnia coinciding with the 9 Hz &#39;Schumann&#39;  Drop-out as observed in journals of geomagnetic research.) On several occasions within the last few years, our laboratory began detecting wavetrains in the ELF ranges which could not be of natural origin.  Soviet transmissions of radio energy spread over broad segments of the frequency spectrum ranging up to 28 MHz.  Danish monitoring stations report that peak powers of these signals are on the order of 40 megawatts.  Transmitters are presumably located near Riga or Gomel.  Transmissions have disrupted lawful radio communications throughout the world, and have been protested by many nations.  The Soviets have not given an adequate explanation of the purpose of these tests.  An early assumption assumed Soviet experiments with over-the horizon radar.  Perhaps the psychoactive EM components are unexpected side-effects of this new technology.  The Department of Transport, which is a part of the Tesla Foundation,  The signals are modulated with pulses with repetition rates of 5 to 15 pulses per second, usually 10 Hz. Besides modifying the electrical, ionic, and stratospheric jet stream equilibrium weather-motion factors, the signals fall into the psychoactive.  The Canadians report alarming mood-alterations in certain areas of eastern Canada, as well as Timmins and Kirkland Lake, Ontario, which observers believe are linked to Soviet transmissions.  Since both theory and laboratory tests prove that magnetic (H-wave) shielding is impossible at these psycho-active frequencies, even with highly sophisticated multiple iron or mu-metal shielding, it can be speculated that ELF signals can be a powerful potential global capabilities in psycho-physiological warfare.  (The wavelength of an 8 Hz signal is 22,159 miles).  ELF sensors that can be made directional in order to establish by triangulation the sources of these recently detected manmade disturbances, whether originating from offshore or domestically.  ELF data should be correlated with data monitored from Soviet transmissions that can be detected on commercial short-wave receivers.  These two modalities can be correlated with human or animal EEG recordings.  (Note:  this was done 5/25/78 with positive correlations;  RCB) ELF as a modality for mood-manipulation is a demonstrated reality. &quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;It has not yet been implemented since 1975 by the Soviets, or intentionally or accidentally as a result of unpredicted side effects of local waves or re-radiation of power lines.  This speculation is being explored by a network of independent scientists working in the disciplines of psychophysiology, geophysics.  radio propagation, pharmacology, physics, electronics, and psychotherapy.  A bibliography of pertinent medical and technical articles and books is attached to this report.  Possible countermeasure proposals embrace psychopharmacology, adaptive desensitization,  and the utilization of personal low-powered (milliwatt) magnetic oscillators which by the law of inverse-square will override hostile signals, man made or natural, with beneficial frequencies.  An interesting device of this nature with possible &#39;countermeasure&#39; capabilities is the &#39;Vitasette&#39; instrument designed by W. Ludwlg for limited distribution and testing in West Germany.  One model of this device is the size of a cigarette lighter and has a battery life of two years.  Frequencies are user programmable over the range of 1.25 to 19 Hz by activating specific combinations of switches.  This &#39;transmitter&#39; generates spike-wave pulses when a mu-metal core of extremely high permeability is driven to beyond saturation with a single transistor and coil.  Effective range is claimed to be about one meter.  This is sufficient to insure proper synchronization of the wearer&#39;s biological clocks, circadian rhythms, and possible coherency of left and right hemisphere neuronal firings.  Ludwig claims cures for a broad spectrum of vegetative disturbances Similar to the characteristics of a frequency-modulation discriminator (Foster-Seeley) the brain cells appear to &#39;latch&#39; to the highest amplitude pulses in their proximity, and unlike reject background noise and pulses of lower intensity.  The analogy would be that a small transistor radio would up to a listener&#39;s ear would be drown out a nearby rock-muslc band with thousands of watts of audio amplification.  Similarly, a milliwatt device could override a hostile transmission of megawatt power at a distance.  While almost everyone is familiar with electronic &#39;heart pacers&#39; capable of insuring proper heart rhythms, few are aware of recent research that brainwaves and other biological functions can be influenced at great distances by magnetic pulses of critical frequencies.  There is promise that such devices, when tuned to highly specific &#39;beneficial&#39; rates, could be of value in stress-modification, tension and anxiety relief, dyslexia;  psychotherapy, insomnia, &#39;confusion&#39;, hemisphere desynchronization, headaches, sexual dysfunction, and many other conditions.  However, the first large-scale implementations of ELF discoveries appear to be destructive.  I invite other interested investigators to replicate and verify my observations.  A brief disclosure of my procedures follows.  A EEG amplifier. A human subject, selected for sensitivity, is wired to a battery-powered, totally isolated EEG amplifier.  FM / VCO to channel (s) of magnetic tape.  Monopolar electrodes were frontal to occipital, midline.  Simultaneously, the purpose of a magnetic-signal detector (Schumann coil) is chartrecorded or fed to its separate magnetic tape channel.  The &#39;Schumann&#39; coils typically consist of 50,000 to 250,000 turns of a magnet wire wound on a ferrite, soft-iron, or mu-metal core.  Coil axis is oriented to magnetic N-5 and connected to a separate amplifier having a bandpass of 2-40 Hz.  1 micro-volt rms at 10 k ohms, and 100 db.  or better rejection of frequencies of 60 Hz and higher.  EEG &#39;lock-ons&#39; can be easily observed by inspecting the chart recordings, or by measurements in the field, by later observation of the magnetic tape records after signal recovery on paper charts or dual-trace storage scopes (Tektronlx 214).  My initial transmitter of ELF signals consisted of a phase-shift, pure sine-wave oscillator whose output was fed to a 10 mA soft core inductance of 1200 ohm dc resistance.  Power level was 9 volts at O.7 ma, or 6.3 milliwatts.  This device could cause EEG modification and mood alteration in subjects at up to 10 ft.  A higher power device constructed in 1973, which was larger than the average, as was expected.  Highly specific modulating and carrier frequencies must be clearly identified and used as a keystone and waveform data, also details of the multiple-source devices producing &#39;soliton&#39; ELF magnetic standing waves.  My investigations began in 1970.  Early research In consciousness-modification by external non-chemical stimulus was undertaken in the following areas.  Photic stimulation of the subjects by miniature lamps, both cold-cathode (phosphors) and filament, and &#39;strobe&#39;.  These light sources were either driven by oscillators or by the subject&#39;s amplified brainwaves in real time and later) with delayed and phase-modified pulses to &#39;pump&#39; EEG&#39;s.  Exposure of subjects to voltage-gradient oscillating fields, and electrostatic (modulated) fields.  This paper presents the results of the experimental study of the phenomenon of ionizing radiation in the corona discharge. . tidy.  Exposure of subjects to actinic stimulus of nearly monochromatic red-green-pulses of light through a fiber optic display device.  Phase and frequency of each channel was selectively varied in efforts to excite red-green-blue rod and cone receptors independently and evoke &#39;standing wave&#39; potentials in specific sites of the occipital cortex.  By selective excitation of both eyes with delayed pulses, evoked &#39;standing waves&#39; occurred.  Audible &#39;click&#39; stimulus was explored, as were infrasonics,  ultrasonics (28 kHz) and phase-shifted sound fed to left and right ears.  Audio-modulated 100 kHz electrostatic fields were tested.  In a series of tests, the amplified, filtered, and clipped (about 200 mv) real-time &#39;Schumann&#39; signals were fed directly to the surface via electrodes.  This approach was dramatically psychoactive, and abandoned in 1974 as dangerous aftersubjects experienced &#39;LSD&#39; type visions.  At this time, we prefer SINUSOIDAL (not pulsed, triangular, square, saw-toothed, etc.) waveforms.  Fundamental frequencies are psychoactive, but can be enhanced by audio-modulating them to compound carrier frequencies, hetrodyning multiple sources, generating &#39;soliton&#39; waves;  etc.  We find that long-chain molecules near-liquid crystal boundaries may simulate coherent dipole arrays with very high Qs .  Biochemistry and biochemistry in the VHF and UHF bands are specified to .005% and better.  These investigations have been carried out privately by the author.  They have been totally funded by myself, and are in no way connected with any interests, either governmental or commercial.  The results of this survey are based on the results of a limited number of interviews.  Highly specific frequency and advanced waveform data are proprietary.  Precise technical details on low-noise biological and geomagnetic amplifiers, filters, Schumann detector coils, practical and inexpensive voltage-controlled oscillator and FM discriminator circuits for cassette tape recording of ELF and EEG signals and data, practical and inexpensive modifications to digital frequency counters extending their ranges to 1/100 Hz, suggestions for recording and displaying and analyzing these signals, etc., etc., can be made available this subject.  We feel it to hemispheric desynchronization frequencies.  The instruments and hardware used in this study can be made available for inspection and evaluation.  Emphasis in this report on ELF magnetic phenomena rather than details of results of related psychoactive modalities is based on the conclusion that the physics and propagation characteristics make this the most viable choice of technically feasible global mood manipulation.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you supply links or send me a PM with the links so I can keep looking - I also want to keep a list of the parents. The 3 you have collected would be good. I will start from there and run an accessibility test on all 3 and publish the site map when I am done. It will find every possible link and should give us a clue as to how it is structured. it will be a 3D sitemap</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He was of the idea that the best way to make money was to start a cult and, purportedly, encouraged L ROn Hubbard to start Scientology, which was then, ironically, infiltrated by another cult, The Process Church of the Final Judgment.</p>

<p>At that time, there was a lot of interest in using cult tactics and strategies to serve the greater good in order to create &quot;Unity of Purpose&quot; and eliminating anti-war opposition.</p>
