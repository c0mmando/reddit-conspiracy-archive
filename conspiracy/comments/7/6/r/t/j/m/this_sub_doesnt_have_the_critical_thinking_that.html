       What was once a free minded, open thinking and intellectual forum is now a place where we can't criticize the president of the United States, because he's believed to be infallible to his followers. If you hate the Russian hacking narrative, don't enforce its power by brigading every post about Trump. I don't care who you voted for, because I don't think our votes actually count. What I do care about is our ability to come together on what's right and wrong. Unfortunately, we are in a constant circle jerk now. I understand that there are a lot of people that like to bash Trump, and a lot of news sources that constantly attack him. In this forum we need to not vote down topics that are genuinely thoughtful and of importance just because your feelings are hurt whenever the POTUS is criticized. Trump is now a politician just like Reagan became one. Let's put accountability where it belongs when it is actually of importance. That goes for both sides of you people that actually believe in a political party..

       Very true. Forgive me, I'm warding off a lot of emotional responses and probably read into that wrong. I am also now guilty of muddying the waters. But, if I got just one person who is emphatically in support of one political party, so much so that their bias opinions can only be see as fact to them, well then I'm ok with that.

       We have Trump shills (T_D zionist warmonger shill mods + echo chamber
that shits on all left wingers and who they THINK is left wing but isn't)
      </p>
      <p>
       and we have Clinton shills (Shareblue).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sickening that people
actually think an echo chamber is a legit place for information.
Dem V Repub is bullshit.
Libertarian party is also corrupt and extreme in their Darwinistic
extreme right NEOliberal economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to wake up and see the center is a good place to start
and it's NOT where they think it is.
Clinton is NOT centrist, she's far right economically.
Bernie was a European centrist but in the U.S.
he's slightly left of center.

       Identity politics is what shills keep pushing in this sub.

       I'm seeing close to an equal amount of downvotes, just depends on what the title of the post is and who decides to brigade.

       Check this, Donald Trump needs to actually kick the shit out of the conservatives and completely revamp the base.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the act of doing that is nigh revolutionary and liberals would immediately decry it as an attempt to bring about facism, since they have their own political revolution planned.

       Isn't that a clever way to maintain the status quo so Republicans and Democrats in Congress keep their positions locked down?

       Your what's wrong with this place. The biggest conspiracy in history is currently underway and all these brainwashed retards do if deflect, spin, and try to muddy the waters for anyone who wants to have a serious discussion about it. It's absolutely insane that a forum for conspiracies spend their time defending the most powerful person on the planet.

       You're right, the biggest "conspiracy" in history is happening and people still can't figure it out. Those people are the same that believed the fake polls and were certain Hillary was gonna win. The real conspiracy is us taking our country back. That's what's happening. Take off the blinders, go back and study the GOP Primary debates and Presidential debates and then come back after you're woke tf up.

       the fact that you think there was any real discussion beyond a loosely written script is silly.  this was all a big setup.  nobody is "taking america back".  Trump is another illusion.  there are no "parties", it is the same side.  Trump is doing things that seem crazy on the surface, and if you look more closely you could see it as him cutting the fat so to speak.  put illegalz out of the country, free up money to be used elsewhere.  to some he looks like an asshole to others a hero.  What he really is is a puppet, just another puppet.  He is making it seem as though he is different from previous politicians by making these rash decisions and using twitter to spout nonsense.  Really what they want it for us to feel vindicated.  think about how people who dont follow conspiracies are talking about the deep state, shadow govt, the elite, etc.  Why is it so main stream now? They want to sell the illusion of factions fighting for power/control so they can then give the illusion that the american oeople/good guys prevailed.  Instead they will slink back into the shadows and restructure and replan.  They will switch to green energy (shell), crypto currency (bitcoin uses a cia funded algorythm), and find a way to filter the internet without looking filtered.  If you think this is too far fetched, then your not thinking big enough or tour still brainwashed.  You can see what is going on if you just refuse to participate and become an observer instead.

       I was being sarcastic.  I'm fine with Clinton -- I think she's a replacement-level politician, right in the fat part of the bell curve -- and think it's insane that people pretend she's this all-powerful puppet master when she lost the presidential campaign first to a fresh-faced newcomer and then to a bucket of chicken gristle.

       How does that weaken the ruling class?  I’ve never heard of a transgender billionaire joining the military.  It sounds like a policy decision used to divide the country to me.

       r/politics is absolute garbage as well as 99% of MSM. This sub didn't use to be in support of any political party. This isn't a place for that shit. If I was in luck, people wouldn't become instantly offended and jump right into their panties everything they think somebody is criticizing Pres Trump. That's not what I'm doing here and you have completely missed the point of post. This is not a safe place for any political figures no matter where they came from.

       The fact that reddit Has largely become a safe space for one side of the spectrum makes this redundant here. Trump gets criticism on this sub. I'd say Hillary et al receives a lot less Everywhere Else. There is a reason for that which has little to do with partisanship.

       Looks like you're still here. It sucks that you can't talk about Epstein-Trump or Weinstein-Trump connections without someone jumping in with the mindless "Bill Clinton is a rapist" whataboutism propaganda. But where else is there a large group like this?

       Nah I'm done this sub used to be interesting, and now when we are faced with the biggest most sinister conspiracy of all time 3/4 of the people in here would rather believe some deep state bullshit rather than what's right in front of their eyes. The only reason I commented was I sorted by controversial and OP pretty much summed things up for me.

       Exactly and yet all these people seem to believe that the conspiracy right under their noses can't be the real conspiracy. All because some guy on a show called info wars (obvious disinformation is obvious) tells them their is some grand conspiracy.

       There shouldn't be a two party system to divide people with. The media on both sides of the political spectrum is just propaganda used to keep people on a winning and a losing team. They switch sides back and forth every 4 to 8 yrs so people can fall accordingly into one of those categories. The only logical way to be anymore is in the middle.

       I talking about the illusion of being on a winning or losing team by way of what party is currently in charge, not the media. The media is predominantly liberal news. Bush was garbage. Clinton was garbage. GWB was garbage. Obama was garbage. Neither side cares about you more than the other. This is exactly why I made this post to begin with. This sub should not have a political bias, at all..

       It doesn't.  Everyone hates the left, for obvious reasons, and nobody supports the right.  There are some Trump supporters but that's not right or left, since the right and the left are fighting Trump so hard.

       Divide and conquer is a psyop.  The left is hemorrhaging money and supporters.  To counter this they are pushing this "we all need to come together" bullshit.  How the fuck could we ever come together with the side that wants to abolish American freedoms?  They stand up for violent criminals and muslims.

       It's not happening.  Everyone hates the left right now because they've revealed themselves to be the anti American party.  You're never going to convince anyone of ever supporting them in any capacity.

       Let me try to reason with you just in
case you're not a shill. Have an open mind
for what I'm about to say:
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't realize that you shitting on left wingers and liberals (they are not remotely the same
but you incorrectly keep using them interchangably)
is actually helping the divide and conquer agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
       "We all need to come together" is literally the opposite of
DIVIDE and conquer. So it's not bullshit.
It's what elites are scared of, they don't want humanity
to rise up and take down the elite bankers, corporations, wallstreet, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       T_D is bullshit.
Is this where you got this dangerous narrative from?
You want a civil war?? Because that's what your words are implying.
This is the attitude that the elites WANT.
They want us to fight each other so
THEY maintain control.
T_D is an echo chamber, you shouldn't take it as a serious
place for unbiased information, especially as it has
zionist warmonger shill mods and anyone who dares
question Trump or his administration
is banned swiftly.
I don't like Trump but I think Clinton and Mike Pence are worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, do you REALLY think there are Americans
out there who "hate freedom" ???
That's like saying there are people
out there who hate water, food and air!
Everyone wants freedom (obviously) but different
people have been brainwashed to
think in different ways to achieve it.
That's the difference.
The elites lie through the corporate media
and then people repeat their propaganda.
THIS is what you're angry about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton supporters are brainwashed and so are you
in a different way.
Don't take this as an insult, it's just a fact
that millions fall for identity politics (stereotypes)
over actual political science.
      </p>
      <p>
       /T_D and /politics are subs with no credibility
as they're compromized with Trump V Clinton propaganda
when both are crappy establishment candidates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm a Bernie supporter but whatever your opinion
on Bernie, I'll happily discuss with you
but just look at these
to understand why Lib VS Con is utter bullshit
and just corporate marketting + divide and conquer fuel:

       The left directly supports eroding the 1st Amendment.  The left directly supports eroding the 2nd Amendment.  The left supports open borders, violent criminals, and muslims.  Illegal aliens.  Sanctuary cities and now goddamn sanctuary states.  Expansion of the welfare state and more government control.  They are actively trying to overthrow a democratically elected president.
      </p>
      <p>
       The left is a clear and present danger to America.  I am dividing nobody.  The left divided themselves from the rest of America when they began supporting anti American policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer is a psyop to desperately try to drum up support for the left.  It is not happening.  When you declare yourself anti American the rest of America will be against you.

       "THE LEFT" and "THE RIGHT" are non existent entities
that the corporate use to divide the people.
Are there really only TWO points on the political spectrum?
Of course not, so why do you keep using these nonsense terms?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do all Bernie Sanders supporters think the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do all Trump supporters think the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do all Clinton supporters think the same?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Bernie Sanders the same as Hillary Clinton?
Hell no! So who do you think
"THE LEFT" really is?
You have mislabelled your enemy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton is not left wing and the vast majority of
the DNC (like 80-90%) is far right economically + SJW and authoritarian social policies like state spying. The GOP is almost the same except without the SJW stuff and slightly more extreme on economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bernie Sanders is a REAL left winger,
so when you say "LEFT" you're targetting honest
people like Bernie and other pro-worker people.
Clinton is anti-worker.
DNC is anti-worker.
      </p>
      <p>
       These anti-worker people are pro-establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone has different opinions on things
like immigration, welfare, etc.
You shouldn't group half the entire U.S. population
into one box and group the other half into another box.
Do you see my point?
You get nowhere, except blaming millions
of people for what a few people are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm left wing but not anti-American.
Bernie is not anti-American.
Jill Stein is left wing and not anti-American.
      </p>
      <p>
       Who are the anti-American shills?
The puppet politicians like Clinton/Romney/Obama/etc.etc.
who try to damage worker rights,
reduce pay (to near slavery levels),
impose state surveillance against the will of the people,
give free shit to corporations, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's wrong with welfare?
If it's reasonable, why not?
If it's good enough for corporations,
it's good enough for us
workers right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporations get free shit,
even though it's WORKERS like
me and you who put in the work.
Not the sociopaths dodging taxes, funding wars,
rigging the markets, etc. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Know the real enemy. 
Dem vs repub
is just NEOliberal VS NEOliberal.
Neither party are left wing or centrist.
      </p>
      <p>
       SJW is just something they sprinkle in
to make themselves look left wing.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g. some corporate puppet could have the most
insane anti-worker policies and STILL

push other SJW crap.

       You're falling for the psyop that
is mixing up economics with social issues.
I'm left wing but not a feminist,
not anti-white, etc. etc.

       We have lots of enemies.  The left is a real enemy.  They support criminals.  They cheer for the removal of freedoms.  They support illegals and foreigners over Americans.

       Spoken like a true paid shill, no reasoning,
just parroting propaganda.
I was right about you, and it's a shame.
Completely ignored my comment and repeated the same nonsense.
Clinton/DNC is not left wing, but you keep ignoring that, conveniently.

       Sorry, I had to call him out.
He was pushing the divide and conquer agenda
by smearing all "left wingers" and "liberals"
(they're not even the same thing and he ignores this when I mention it).
      </p>
      <p>
       Check his comment history, full of divide and conquer propaganda.
I'm not criticizing your moderating,
just trying to justify myself. :)

       We have Trump shills (T_D zionist warmonger shill mods + echo chamber
that shits on all left wingers and who they THINK is left wing but isn't)
      </p>
      <p>
       and we have Clinton shills (Shareblue).
      </p>
      <p>
       It's sickening that people
actually think an echo chamber is a legit place for information.
Dem V Repub is bullshit.
Libertarian party is also corrupt and extreme in their Darwinistic
extreme right NEOliberal economics.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to wake up and see the center is a good place to start
and it's NOT where they think it is.
Clinton is NOT centrist, she's far right economically.
Bernie was a European centrist but in the U.S.
he's slightly left of center.

       Identity politics is what shills keep pushing in this sub.

       Check this, Donald Trump needs to actually kick the shit out of the conservatives and completely revamp the base.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the act of doing that is nigh revolutionary and liberals would immediately decry it as an attempt to bring about facism, since they have their own political revolution planned.

       Isn't that a clever way to maintain the status quo so Republicans and Democrats in Congress keep their positions locked down?
