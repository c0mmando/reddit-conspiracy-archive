       Is this the first hand witness account of Vegas? Good read; not sure why anyone would want to down vote first hand information! Especially as rare as this; many phones and Facebook's have already been wiped.

       I don't know I came across it on the internet from some anonymous stranger who archived it and said it was wiped now. Great read, But this very strange fear came over me before I posted it.. in still kind of cautious, but I gotta play my part. Someone followed me to a remote location and pretty much shackled my car. They must've gps me. Be fucking careful you all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also could you elaborate on the " everyone sell phones have been wiped ". Like zapped from behind computers or came and visted AND seized?

       I believe the fbi seized the phones of some victims and they were wiped upon return.

       A lot of initial reports have vanished; luckily people saw this coming and screencapped what they could.

       I'm not posting their Facebook posts to a Reddit conspiracy sub.  If they have them as public it would be easy to search.

       But look at my post history, I'm not a paid still. I am a mod at another sub and live in San Diego. I post mostly in

       They're saying she had epilepsy that was triggered by stress. I'm not sure if adrenaline would have helped prevent a seizure, but I would assume being on the ground in an active shooter event and running several miles would he pretty stressful. Strange that she didn't have a seizure then.

       That lady is long winded.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for posting, it's good to read a first-hand account. A lot of what she says is not in any way supported by any recordings.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Next, while still running, I called my grandma to tell her the exact same thing. But the gunfire wasn’t stopping this whole time. It wasn’t ceasing. It wasn’t slowing down. And It was directly behind us, following us. Bullets were coming from every direction. Behind us, in front of us, to the side of us. But I know, I just know, that there was someone chasing us. The entire time I felt this way. The farther we got from the venue, the closer the gunfire got.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can see how she'd be scared and confused, and that even though it didn't go quite like this, this is how she remembers it. That happens.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not find this at all believable:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        At some point, we ended up at the airport &amp; even entered the building for safety. Everyone as we entered were screaming at the staff “IS IT SAFE IN HERE?” but we weren’t getting anyone to answer us, so after running about 30 feet into the building, not getting the answers we so desperately needed, we decided it, too, wasn’t a safe spot, so we got out of there quickly and continued running.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I can't understand why someone who is being shot at from all directions would willingly exit a building because the staff of the restaurant didn't answer them quickly enough.
       <em>
        Ooop, better leave our shelter and run back into the hail of bullets.
       </em>
       What?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        We finally made it to him, he shoved us all in his car, drove us to our hotel (we stayed off the strip), waited for us to pack (this literally took us all of 10 minutes max to do), and escorted us to the freeway to get us home.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Every report I've heard says all hotels on the strip were on lockdown. They weren't letting anyone in or out. I'm not saying this part of the story is not possible--I wasn't there, I don't know for a fact that all hotels were locked down. But this is the first account I've heard where someone says they entered &amp; exited a hotel without significant delay.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know what to make of this story. If it's an actual account from an actual person then I don't know why they would lie. Some of the inconsistencies could be explained by fear and panic. But I dunno. This is so much different from every other account I've read.

       I think that's an important point.  Fight or flight is in high gear here... Panic mode.  She has no training or frame of reference and is not making rational decisions.  That's why I feel her account is unreliable to a certain degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       Her stress and ability to deal with it were so high, she succumbed to it due to other health issues.  He accounting might be useful in corroborating other accounts, but I don't believe it can stand alone.

       I agree, i had an eye-roll when she said she could feel the heat from the passing bullets; but i had to remind myself there's going to be some dramatics added to the story because it was profoundly traumatic for her.

       Another bullshit story. I was there that night. People were still hanging out all over the strip at the time of the shooting. We were right across from the bellagio. Groups of cop cars screaming up and down the streets, but people were not panicked all over the strip. It was not a war zone.

       I saw this yesterday on different page. I feel like if there were multiple shooters on the ground like she describes then the death toll from the shooting would be be way higher than 58.

       I could give you a copy of my plane ticket,   My rental car agreement, we were staying at the trump hotel that night. We drove up the strip, turned around at the Luxor and parked at Bally's because i didn't want to want in the parking line for the Bellagio. I was standing in line for 2 $17 margaritas and a group of cop cars came screaming up the street. Everyone was like "hunh, that's weird , must be some kind of bust." Some random guy came towards us from towards Mandalay bay saying" I wouldn't go that way, there's an active shooter." I googled it right away, and of course Twitter was the first thing that pops up with someone reporting a shooter.  More cop cars come screaming by but this time go into the bellagio. I tell some random people on the way up the escalator, as everyone around us is just looking and talking about what's going on. We crossed over and watched the fountains at Bellagio with tons of other people. 2 girls came by that had obviously been at the concert. They were on their cell phones, obviously VERY shaken up, but that was out of HUNDREDS of people around us. We stayed down on the strip for at least another hour before heading back to our car. We weren't allowed to go back through the casino at Bally's because we didn't have a room key, security was blocking all the doors. We drove back to our hotel and the driveway was blocked off there as well. Next day 5 cop cars were still in front of our hotel , as I. Believe they were in front of all of them. I've been glued to this site ever since trying to piece together what really happened. I can pm you if you want to see tickets or receipts

       She rambles too much for me to believe shes a credible witness. I'm sure she was there and it was scary. That's about all we can take from this.
