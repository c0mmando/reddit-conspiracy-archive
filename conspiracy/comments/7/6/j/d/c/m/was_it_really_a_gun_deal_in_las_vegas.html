       Alright the "gun deal" and why it doesn't makes sense to allot of people and even me. Since I love to play devils advocate I ask myself why would he purchase the firearms himself? A direct link back to him. Not only that but the profit margin wouldn't be worth it clearly.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to first break our conditioning of a what a gun deal entails. It's ultimately the transfer of weapons for anything else including favors. It's not and never was about the money in my mind. When America does a gun deal we do it by the millions of firearms.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if it was just a weapons transfer? What if he really was a agent for an alphabet? What if the deal was to have Paddock buy the weapons legally and then modify them to then have them "stolen" (transferred) to some type of cell (take your pick)?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which they would then use in a attack. Either they would die with them or leave them. Paddock would become a suspect. But he gets off because the guns were stolen when he was on one of his many gambling trips and he never noticed. Or vice versa ended up reporting them stolen.
      </p>
      <p>
       What would this mean? Gun control and a tighter security state.
      </p>
      <p>
       New laws on storing firearms. How many you can purchase at a time. Restrictions on modification of firearms. Restrictions of civil liberty's under the guise of security.
      </p>
      <p>
       So everything still fits the "modus operandi" even if it wasn't the type of gun deal were used too. In my mind it would be even better to use legal firearms because once the public hears the world "stolen" it becomes harder to curb gun rights of innocent civilians because the majority of the time they can't trace them back to there original owners (filing serial #'s). In my mind if a bad guy can "easily" steal these type of modified weapons from regular Joe down the street that would put more fear into anti-gunners than knowing it was some deep dark back room gun deal that they don't potentially have a voice in the matter over.
      </p>
      <p>
       Might as well toss in the timing regarding silencers and the Senate and the ambiguous rulings around fully automatics and legal modifications that replicate them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not picking a side. With the lack of information one should keep an open mind. Just playing devils advocate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please don't rip my soul out over it..

       The problem with it being a gun deal is he bought everything at retail. You flip something retail on the black market, you typically would expect a loss. If this was a gun deal I'd expect him to be buying lower receivers and boring them out himself.

       It wouldn't have been that type of gun deal. I think that's part of all of our conditioning and what I'm trying to get at.

       This was a way to get legally modified guns from a legal citizen into the hands of bad guys.

       Brazil banned guns (for the most part). Now Rio is one of the most dangerous places on Earth because the only people with guns are the bad guys and the cops. I don't see a reason for the bad guys to search out legally modified weaponry; where is their benefit?

       The black market is much more expensive than retail markets. Black markets exist because people can't get these things via retail. Selling black market goods carries a risk, and that risk manifests via a several hundred percent markup.

       I could go down to the city tonight and buy a 'burner' for $100. The same pistol would cost me $800 retail. Maybe there's a difference between stolen, unknown history, etched serials, and completely illegal v. the black market scenario OP is presenting..

       Oh, I see. I think that's probably true for a handgun. Handguns are often stolen during burglaries, and the thief often just wants cash to get high.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wouldn't think it'd be possible to get a couple dozen semi automatic rifles that way, but I really have no idea, it's just a guess. You may be right.

       Well, I'll tell you I've never been offered a couple dozen semi-automatic rifles in my life.. so I can't assuredly claim what you're saying isn't true either :P - Doesn't sit well with me that a guy who ate the $3 lunches or whatever they were wouldn't optimize his profits if he were an arms dealer, and the way to do that would be by machining his own lowers and building his own rifles. Legal to do and you only need to press serial numbers if you sell them. (and then, at least in my state, you'd require the federal licensing to sell firearms, if he was keeping everything legal)
      </p>
      <p>
       You can build an AR-15 legally for $500-600, and then sell it at retail for $1000-1500, provided you have the permissions to do so.

       I don't know, $17 seems like a much smaller amount of money than $5000. :D

       Not sure where your getting all your information but this entire case is "noisy" due to lack of basis even from the investigators themselves.

       So in light of real professionals not being able to do the same I think I get some leeway with this case.

       The term for this is a "straw purchase" but as you said there's very little profit margin and certainly that's not the way terrorists tend to get their weapons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember those Toyota pickup trucks that a guy in Houston said he's sold and ended up and Isis hands and Syria? That might be something to look at as far as a template for how weapons reach  ISIS

       When was the last time you saw a "desert gun deal" gone down smoothly in the movies?

       The reason they don't is the same people do Craigslist deals in public. The point being if it's somewhere busy it would be allot harder to pull of some fuckery regarding the deal.

        Honestly in my mind a Casino would be a great place to do a weapons transfer. No one would be the wiser and if anything went down at least you have the chance of a paramedic showing up and or hospital within reach or you could just fade into the crowd for evasion.

       Most of our desert is gone. They parts that aren't are national parks, pr BLM managed, and not particularly anon. A casino, during a major convention (G2E), where there are tons of people moving tons of bags around, makes way more sense.

       Back by Black mtn, or out by the Silver Bowl. Maybe even out past Durango...sure. Problem is that is way too exposed. That shit is for the movies. Much better to use a massively crowded place where everyone is moving thousands of bags around. Shit, I carried enough huge bulky bags into G2E by myself, unmolested, that would have been sufficient to move all those guns. And I did that

       This gun deal is a farce. It's not difficult to buy rifles. We have armslist, it's like Craigslist for guns. You can buy/sell 100% legal in a grocery parking lot. No ID, no background. Don't know how many times I don't know their name. Why would he buy them legal with his name tied to it? How hard is it to buy them 20 rifles? I could have it in a couple hours if the sellers weren't busy.

       The point would be to give firearms to people who can't purchase them themselves.

      <p>
       So that means no Craigslist or Armslist.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also that many tricked out bump stock rifles nearly all matching? Good luck finding those all on Craigslist or Armslist especially 20 of them.

      <p>
       Sure they could do it but I'd bet considering I've used both websites for firearm purchases that it would take awhile to procure everything vs a quick stop at a hotel.

        The thing with Craigslist or Armslist is that they requires you to either purchase them in person in a parking lot (face-to-face) and or having them shipped to a dealer (shipped to a dealer, ID required). Both may make suspicion that not needed.

       I also don't know why arguing that multiple straw purchases is better than 1. That's just not critical thinking...

       As someone who's done gun transfers in parking lots. I own a cell phone. If I think your suspicion after the fact I can take your photo. Take a photo of your car. And if I don't have either I can personal give a description of the person. And I have a go-pro on my dash...

       Because if all these weapons where originally owned by  a single person and where "stolen" from one location with ease that would scare more people than a untraceable deal that they may have no say in. AKA in the eyes of a anti-gunner more gun regulations might stop these type of situations.

       Your literally making me copy and paste from my OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is covered in no less than three paragraphs. But since I know your having trouble here you go.
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Alright the "gun deal" and why it doesn't makes sense to allot of people and even me. Since I love to play devils advocate I ask myself why would he purchase the firearms himself? A direct link back to him. Not only that but the profit margin wouldn't be worth it clearly.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to first break our conditioning of a what a gun deal entails. It's ultimately the transfer of weapons for anything else including favors. It's not and never was about the money in my mind. When America does a gun deal we do it by the millions of firearms.
       </p>
       <p>
        What if it was just a weapons transfer? What if he really was a agent for an alphabet? What if the deal was to have Paddock buy the weapons legally and then modify them to then have them "stolen" (transferred) to some type of cell (take your pick)?
       </p>
       <p>
        Which they would then use in a attack. Either they would die with them or leave them. Paddock would become a suspect. But he gets off because the guns were stolen when he was on one of his many gambling trips and he never noticed. Or vice versa ended up reporting them stolen.
       </p>
       <p>
        What would this mean? Gun control and a tighter security state.
       </p>
       <p>
        New laws on storing firearms. How many you can purchase at a time. Restrictions on modification of firearms. Restrictions of civil liberty's under the guise of security.
       </p>
       <p>
        So everything still fits the "modus operandi" even if it wasn't the type of gun deal were used too. In my mind it would be even better to use legal firearms because once the public hears the world "stolen" it becomes harder to curb gun rights of innocent civilians because the majority of the time they can't trace them back to there original owners (filing serial #'s). In my mind if a bad guy can "easily" steal these type of modified weapons from regular Joe down the street that would put more fear into anti-gunners than knowing it was some deep dark back room gun deal that they don't potentially have a voice in the matter over.
       </p>
       <p>
        Might as well toss in the timing regarding silencers and the Senate and the ambiguous rulings around fully automatics and legal modifications that replicate them.

        The thing with Craigslist or Armslist is that they requires you to either purchase them in person in a parking lot (face-to-face) and or having them shipped to a dealer (shipped to a dealer, ID required). Both may make suspicion that not needed.
