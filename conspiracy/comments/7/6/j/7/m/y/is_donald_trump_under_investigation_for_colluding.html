       I've seen no evidence from unbiased media that Mueller is investigating Trump or anyone other than the people involved in inciting civil war in Ukraine for Putin (Manafort/Podesta), or people who were working for Obama at the time (Flynn), and none of those leads have even turned up anything substantial.

       Yet from reading the MSM and

       it seems like his impeachment and arrest have been imminent since the election.

       If the dems continue like the have so far, Bannons prediction from two days ago will be on point: 400 electoral votes for trump in 2020. They have nothing.

       Furthermore. Impeachment doesnt mean wont be president anymore.

       Yeah but that was before people knew how terrible he'd be.

       During the primaries he said he liked grabbing women by the pussy and that he could have made Mitt Romney drop to his knees.

       Neh, thats just leftists. From what I see, the support have only gone up! As the establishment try do harder and harder everyday to out him. Losers.

      <p>
       Considering all the legitime votingfraud, Im not so sure. That does not even matter one little bit, trump ran a campaign on electoral votes, as everyone does in the presidential election in the United States.
Hillary won the popular vote over Obama too. Going to cry me a river over that to?

       Haha you're the one crying not me. There's no way anyone can say he's gotten more popular with a straight face.

       I would never cry about a politician. Of course I've never worshipped one before so I wouldn't know.

       I think Rosenstein was asked to create a pretext other than the campaign investigation for firing Comey in order to make it look like Trump wasn't obstructing justice. When Trump went ahead and blew that excuse up, Rosenstein probably realized he couldn't trust Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       When it came out that Trump had asked Comey to drop the investigation into Flynn it became clear that Trump was willing to interfere with any investigation that wasn't entirely independent. Enter Bob Mueller.

       I can't speak for Rosenstein so this is entirely speculation. Rosenstein must have known that Trump could dismiss Comey at his discretion, and the Deputy AG takes orders from their boss same as anyone else. But once it became public that Trump was willing to interfere, it became important to create an independent investigation, if only to maintain the appearance of impartiality.

       I interpret it differently; Rosenstein and Dana Boenta (who issued the subpoenas in the Flynn case) were the only two US attorneys whose resignation Trump didn't accept.
      </p>
      <p>
       My interpretation is that Comey actually was trying to sabotage Clinton from being elected but knew he couldn't complete the investigation before the election. So he and Rosenstein and Mueller came up with an idea to make people think they were investigating Trump to allow the CF investigation to proceed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If what's alleged about Clinton's Pay-to-play scheme is true it's an entirely league of corruption from what Trump is accused of.

      <p>
       This right here is where you lost me completely. Why would they need to hide an investigation into the Clinton Foundation? Why does Comey have to step outside his authority and decide not to prosecute? (He recommended not to prosecute, but that's mostly semantics.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm failing to see why, in order to continue an investigation into the Clinton Foundation, they needed to set up an elaborate scheme to make it look like Trump had interfered with Russia, allegedly investigate him for it, have Comey get fired, have Rosenstein appoint Mueller, etc. Why would Comey announce his opinion hadn't changed if it actually had? Why would he need to finish the investigation before the election?
      </p>
      <p>
       Forgive me but it seems needlessly complicated. If Comey wanted to recommend prosecution, he could have not made his Nov 6th statement that reconfirmed their original conclusion and just kept investigating her.

       Comey has stated he felt the DoJ under Lynch was compromised by the tarmac meeting, the only way to remove Lynch from office would be for Trump to win; however there was no way for him to communicate the results of the investigation without a statement recommending it be closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If Rosenstein lied in his letter to Trump listing reasons why Comey should be fired, that's a pretty big deal. Additionally why would Trump fire Comey and then meet the Russian Ambassador the next day with a huge grin on his face?
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is a master troll; you should recognize that shit eating grin from all the times he's trolled us before.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also Mueller investigated 9/11 and found no evidence that Bush colluded with Saudi Arabia.

       Trump has obvious mafia and other sketchy as fuck connections yet this flimsy Russia thing is what you are going after.

       He’s trolling bro.
He met with the Russian ambassador literally the next day after he fired Comey for a shit eating grin photo opportunity.

       See I can't buy the trolling argument because it's such an easy way to handwave away anything he says. To say that anything would have already come out in the primaries is presumption, and I'm not going to buy into the idea that absence of evidence is evidence of absence. The Trump Jr meeting happened during the campaign but we didn't find out about it until June.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for the discussion, but I'm out. I can sort of see the theory of what you're putting across, but I'm still having an issue with the idea that Comey would recommend not to prosecute if the entire time he was planning to recommend prosecution. There's also still the question of why the fuck so many members of Trump's campaign lied about their meetings with Russians.

       The part that really threw me for a loop was when I realized that Yanukovych switched sides and became pro-russian after Manafort was already working for him (and the reason the Podesta Group had to keep their support for his opponents secret was that it would have exposed the fact that the US was playing both sides again).

       Its hard to get a grasp for whats going on.  I think the Russia/Trump thing is a witch hunt, that Trump and Russia had nothing to do with one another.  Thats its just the Dems being sore losers and looking to cast blame on something else than themselves.  I think, id love to believe Mueller will pull some insane tricks out of his bag when he finally speaks, like that he was really investigating Hillary and Dems this whole time. After all he and Trump were talking the day before Mueller took over.  Id love it if they both agreed that the issue to focus on was Hillary.  And Id love for Mueller to be fired, or to admit he has nothing and spent the last year doing nothing and then to end up in prison for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As much as I want this to happen, and as much as I know and believe he has nothing.  He hasn't found anything.  I worry.  I worry he will recommend to indict.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you watch Olbermann or the MSM they are absolutely convinced.  100% that Mueller is closing in on Trump and his inner circle and has been since day 1 and that impeachment and jail are imminent.  Not for Hillary.  But for Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will be furious if he recommends to indict Trump or comes out and says theres some connection to Russia without rock solid 100% proof we havent seen.  I just dont think he has it, nor do I trust him to follow the letter of the law enough to not fabricate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       And even if Mueller were to recommend no charges and admit he found nothing, the MSM and left would then turn on Mueller and then say Trump paid him off or that he went easy on Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       I dont think this ends either way.  If he recommends to indict Id be furious at Mueller.  If he doesnt, the Dems would be furious.

       As evidence of this I submit the fact that he shook hands with a scripted grin on his face the day after he fired Comey. Additionally there's evidence to suggest the losing side is more susceptible to irrational conspiracy theories ([
