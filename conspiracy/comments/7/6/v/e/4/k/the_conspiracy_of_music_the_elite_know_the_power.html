       Dude they tried to kill rock and roll because it was too liberating of a music for the masses. It made us feel good and dance and embrace our inner "going against the grain of the status quo". TPTB hated that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, once progressive bands started having an anti war vibe and pro peace with their rock music, they said "ok, fuck this. Let's take over all of the music and make sure it's just shitty rap and synthetic disco dubstep from now on so nobody can have their soul liberated by beautiful meaningful rock music and poetic lyrical content that has social commentary to it. Music and lyrics have a powerful effect on these peasants, better make sure we fuck that up and take control of it too."
      </p>
      <p>
       They take every kind of art we have and they "corporatize" it.....fucking scumbags. Just leave us alone and let us naturally progress..
      </p>
      <p>
       Fucking blows man...I miss good rock and roll music. Good production. They always have to have control over every avenue of free thought, and music is definitely an important avenue they seek to control.

       I'm a musician myself man. I have been doing this for years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hate how some people feel obligated to like a certain artist or genre just because it's  what is popular at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like most kids in high school right now have no say over their music tastes. That may sound harsh, but many of them are simply indoctrinated drones that are going to "pretend" to like whatever music the popular crowd is into, which is usually the shitty pop billboard top 10 hits.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you hear in most pop songs? Starts out with that stupid synthetic bass drum (not a real drum kit, not a real performer, all synthesized), then maybe a bassline (once again, entirely synthesized. Nobody is playing on these records). Then some female vocalist or shitty rapper will sing over it at it starts to "sweep" and get louder dynamically until you reach the "breakdown" and everyone goes crazy...
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus, these songs are so formulaic and lame. I feel embarrassed when I'm next to somebody who pretends to dance and enjoy this kind of music just to "fit in". That's so fucking dumb, how cheap are you? Will you really pretend to like a certain style or "scene" of music just to have friends? Do people do this? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Music is sacred to me. And it saddens me that we are so easily manipulated into thinking we automatically like what plays on the radio...fuck that. It's all smoke and mirrors. No performers, and the person who wrote the song didn't even perform on it.

       Not to mention auto-tune. Nobody playing, nobody singing. Everything 4/4 timing. Three or four chord progressions you've heard thousands of times. Least common denominator.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even our instruments are corrupted. Frets on a guitar, keys on a keyboard, stops on a brass/instrument, even hard-coded intervals in production software force you into the equal temperament, A440Hz box that destroys the mathematical beauty of music.

       Dude I'm 26, and I swear to god when you hear Van Halen's debut album on vinyl with a pair of some legit speakers, and compare it to hearing that same album in your iPod with earbuds on, it's no contest.
      </p>

       And they shove these quickly written sloppy songs, no meaning to them, down our throats, and they just need a basic techno dance beat and people are happy.

       I can't dance to those tones. Those sounds are garbage to me. They make me uncomfortable. Unnatural, just wrong.

       Incorrect. Pythagorean A432 is based on a natural doubling circuit or dividing strings into fractions.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, to derive Middle C on the Pythagorean A432 scale, simply start at 1 Hz (1 cycle/second) and double it to get the octaves:
      </p>
      <pre><code>1-2-4-8-16-32-64-128-256-512-1024-...
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Then you calculate the circle of fifths by multiplying by 3/2.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, for equal temperament A440Hz the frequencies of C are a hot mess -- rounded to 2 decimal places:
      </p>
      <pre><code>1.02-2.04-4.08-8.18-16.35-32.70-65.41-130.81-261.63-523.25-1046.50
</code></pre>
      <p>
       To calculate the other notes, well, here's the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">
        Wikipedia entry
       </a>
       , but you're best off just using a chart.
      </p>
      <p>
       So clearly the "no different" jab is incorrect, if only on a mathematical level. (The real magic happens when you start applying numerological digital compression.)
      </p>
      <p>
       On a physical level, cell mitosis is also a doubling circuit. Cell division can be encouraged by vibrating cells at frequencies based on a doubling circuit. If you ever wondered why plants grow better when classical music is played... now you know. Works on people too.

       If you'd read it, you'd know that if Pythagorean A432 vibrations are beneficial to human health, the pharmaceutical industry would be against it -- not to mention the political motive to degrade the health of one's population, making them easier to manipulate and control.

       My arguments are the same as Adam Neely's which is why I linked the video. I'm not sure where you proved it's beneficial to human health, you didn't provide any proof at all. I'm not even sure why you bring up classical music being good for plants when during the classical era tunings were all over the place and the renditions today are all 440Hz... And it's been shown that playing any music to plants is beneficial to their growth, not just classical.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you can prove to me scientifically that 432Hz is more beneficial to health than 440Hz then I can see where a conspiracy would come into play, but this myth has been going on for decades and no one has been able to prove empirically any benefits.

       Conclusion
      </p>
      <p>
       From the pilot study conducted at the Centre for Biofield Sciences in Pune, India, it can be 
concluded that the Spiritual Results music had a positive effect on the mental health of the 
participants who suffered from a range of conditions. Significant positive energetic changes were 
observed in participants on emotional level as measured by Polycontrast Interference 
Photography, Gas Discharge Visualization, and positive physical changes were observed in 
medical Thermal Imaging and the Electro-Interstitial Scan. It would be interesting to note that 
based on the results seen in MTI and EIS, problems on physical level have shown mild aggravation 
during initial session of music followed by prolonged relief seen in the scans after 7 days. The 
results from the PIP and GDV suggest that Spiritual Results music is helpful in problems which are 
related to emotions and in particular for reduction in stress levels. This can be confirmed from EIS 
results particularly for conductivities seen in pre frontal areas in before and after scans and the 
levels of Brain neurotransmitters. As previously stated, more studies should be performed to 
monitor a longer term use to allow ample time for health improvements to manifest into a physical 
change.

       I think the best argument made from that video is that even if you create a tuning system that follows the patterns of nature it's still just arbitrary because hertz are arbitrary. Hertz is cycles per second and the second is just an arbitrary length of time.

       The direct distribution exists (YouTube, soundcloud, bittorrent), but if nobody knows about you, you're invisible. I guess there's always facebook ads and search engine optimization, but those circlejerk-type events have an effect in turning humble musicians into celebrities.

       TPTB have controlled the development and use of music throughout all of known history. But, control is not primarily achieved through lyrics. The message is more-or-less subliminal. It matters, but the lyrics are not why music is controlled.
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans naturally sync-up with rhythm and tempo, whether or not they want to. So if you control the music, you control the speed at which people that hear it think. Army's have traditionally used music to control how fast people march. By controlling harmony, TPTB can influence internal feeling and emotion. Harmony is based on experience/education/culture.

       I hate to break it to you, but as much as I love Rock-and-roll, it is a dumb down musical art form for the masses. It is dumbed-down so that it can capture a less-than-educated populaces' attention.

       I was just in high school and the team style of musical bullying seems to have died out, at least where I live. Me and my friends used to listen to early metallica and linkin park in school. Pop was popular, same with rap and other similar music but a lot of people would listen to classics from early rock bands especially nirvana. Still there are so few modern bands I find that I can like, especially ones who write their own lyrics and aren't fake.

       People are still making good music... You might have to look past the radio...
      </p>
      <p>
       An aside.... The era of rock you refer to... At the same time those songs were coming out... Radio was still dominated by buggle gum pop bs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look up historical billboard charts from the 60s. It was just as bad.

       I do think that pop music has been consolidated since.. if you want to be a bit more outraged about the shit state of popular music, check out:

       I understand that good music will never ever actually be gotten rid of, although TPTB would like that I bet...
      </p>
      <p>
       It just sucks that it's so difficult to find the good stuff. Or that the avenues we are supposed to trust regarding providing us with good music, music of the people and by the people to help us cope with our existence, have failed to do so.

       Every generation has been saying this shit about pop music going back to the 40’s and arguably earlier than that. People heavily criticized the Beatles as being stupid, dumbed down pop music for simpletons.

       The "elites" have always had control of popular music. If anything it's better today than it was before. At least now you can upload your song onto youtube and let it be heard. You may not get famous, but at least you're independently trying. Prior to the internet you only had 1 avenue to pursue musical aspirations. You had to get noticed by the "elites" to even have a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention when you think of "music back then" you're looking at decades of work, and finding a handful of great music. I could find you a handful of music I find great that was produced in the last 10 years. Tastes differ from person to person, what you think is great I may hate, or vice versa.

       The music you listen to is, with a few exceptions, 100% in your control. There has always been shitty music as long as I've been alive. I still own CDs and see live shows regularly. I pay for a Spotify sub which has most of my music although there's some I can't get there. Music to me is a hobby, and I don't just passively listen to whatever's popular at the time. If it's really that important to anyone, they'd do the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only time it really starts to disturb me is at the gym when other people choose the music, and it's usually new rap. It seems those lyrics get more misogynistic, simplistic, and repetitive every year.

       Not always as an audiophile. Spotify and the like don't have everything, they also often have the shitty remastered versions of old albums that are fatigue inducing, horribly compressed and loudness-war enhanced, compared to the 1st/2nd issue CDs and vinyl that retain dynamics, that you can listen to for hours.. much more smooth and pleasing on the ears  - they are often just quieter.. which in comparison to the loud masters, only requires you to crank your volume. Use ReplayGain for uniformity in volume. A big part of the 'loudness' war issue is the normalization of volume so everything sounds loud on shitty speakers, so DJs dont have to adjust levels as much etc. There is some modern music without this issue, but incredibly rare in the mainstream.

       I think op really nailed it here. Once upon a time, music was art. Then it was a business that involved art. Now it's an industrial product that used to be art.

       Nearly all the "music" you hear is brought to you by one of a few corporate media conglomerates. These are definitely down with any elite agenda and they make sure that the music you hear has no trace of emotion, inspiration or any kind of political message that they don't want to be there.

       Yeah and they use the same recycled major or minor chord progressions in every song. The music executives have a formula they get their song writers to follow, and they have to stick to it.

       There's a fuckton of good psychedelic rock being made today. Probably more so now than any other time post 70s. Then again I'm 24 so take that with a grain of salt.

       It's a interesting rabbit hole to go down. I'm on the fence, but one port of call will be the Laurel Canyon conspiracy theories.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Thomas McGrath: Tell us about Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon. What is this new book’s central thesis?
David McGowan: To the extent that it has a central thesis, I would say that it is that the music and counterculture scene that sprung to life in the 1960s was not the organic, grassroots resistance movement that it is generally perceived to be, but rather a movement that was essentially manufactured and steered. And a corollary to that would be that for a scene that was supposed to be all about peace, love and understanding, there was a very dark, violent underbelly that this book attempts to expose.

       It ties that 60s scene with the military industrial complex, MKULTRA and the like. Many musicians in that era were the sons of high ranking military, such as the father of Jim Morrison (frontman of The Doors) - George Stephen Morrison - who was commander of the U.S. naval forces in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Gulf of Tonkin Incident of August 1964, leading to the Vietnam war.

       Sure it's corrupt but not to the extent that genuine artists are censored or prevented from performing.  Any manipulation that does go on is predominantly in mainstream music which for the most part isn't real music anyway.

       having virtuosos play makes normal trained musicians looks like hacks. especially if they create truly innovative art.

       it becomes hard to compete, people ask for more of something they cant manufacture readily,

       I've thought about this quite a bit. I feel that famous artists have an obligation - a sacred obligation of sorts - to 'wake up' their fans to the reality of the situation we face on multiple fronts. These artists are among the most influential people in the world - more influential than any traditional political figure - yet most of the artists write relatively useless songs about love, lust, sex, and partying.
      </p>
      <p>
       There really aren't many artists talking about the topics that
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       frequents, and the ones who do venture into this territory usually only make vague, passing, metaphorical references.
      </p>
      <p>
       They need to lay it all out in plain English. These artists have the power to change the world. Sadly, I'm sure that their handlers wouldn't allow that to happen.

       Ha, I like this one. Good creative thinking here, classic conspiracy shit.  I disagree that rap is part of it though, rap happened spontaneously on the streets and represents a genuine musical innovation, and was some of the most radical music around in the 80s and 90s.  But just like you saw with rock and roll, all of the popular stuff is compromised now.  Remember the FBI was watching the rap groups in south central LA, especially NWA

       This is how I know you have no idea what you're talking about. There is so much good music out there, you just have no idea how to find it. Yeah, the mainstream shit is all made for money and is trash. But there are thousands of incredible bands that get radio play that have deep meaningful lyrics and totally fucking rule.

       The problem with this theory is that is has never been easier to avoid corporate music. Shut off the radio. Use a streaming service, and avoid the recommended or sponsored artists. There is lots of good music out there, you just have to put a little effort in finding what you like.

       There really is no reason in the 21st century to make this topic. You have access to every form of music, from every period, ever, at the tip of your fingertips. There is no reason whatsoever to force yourself to listen to garbage, mindless pop music like it's the only option. No matter what types of music you like, it takes minimal effort to find dozens and probably hundreds of artists who fit your criteria, and for a lot of those people you can cut out the middleman and buy the music from them directly if you wish to support them.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same thing with movies, TV shows, whatever. Nobody is forcing you to watch 2 Broke Girls or Fuckman vs. Cuntgirl: Requiem for Age of Zzzzzzz. Do some searching and find stuff you like. The age of the Internet has had a lot of negative effects on society, but one thing it has done is it has evened the playing field and given a lot of artists out there a chance to get their products out there to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
       You miss good rock and roll music? I listen to metal, for the most part. Do you know how fucking many good metal bands are out there today? I lose track. My friends are constantly showing me new bands I should check out. I guarantee if you put forth even a slight amount of effort you would find tons and tons and tons of rock and roll artists that you would like. It's your fault for not supporting them, not society or the MSM or whatever the fuck. Unless you're 90 years old and you can't figure out how the Internet works, there's no excuse.

       The fact that good music isn't what's popular is outrageous.  You should see people who listen to nothing but young thug and other trash bullshit.   They can't think clearly at all. They idolize the lifestyle to the point where they imitate it until it destroys their lives.

       Since high school I've always listened to music that wasn't on the mainstream airwaves.  It leaves more choice and much more variety and usually artists with more integrity.  I do agree that mainstream music is terrible, and that goes for each and every genre there is.  But there's tons of good and independent stuff.  We still have a choice.  Of course a lot of people are either too lazy or don't care enough to find these.

       They definitely attacked the music industry, a couple of different times, to inject whatever they needed as far as ideology was concerned.  There's still a ton of great bands out there singing about the "truth" and serious issues, but they don't get the exposure we saw for the war anthems and protest hits of yesteryear.

       True. Seems to me the big thing we lack is the marketing -- notably the cross-platform marketing, the talk show appearances, the award shows.
