       All I can say after reading another thread on here... is thank goodness for 4/chan.... after reading some of that drivel I'll happily go back to the den of iniquity... some of the worlds most brilliant minds. At least they think and dig and argue and engage in discourse of even the most horrid ideas... to the most brilliant. That's the way it should be. I'm surprised this is even allowed on here as it's likely to expose even more hitlery filth and corruption... and far too many of them are still screaming Meh Russia... brain washed fools.

       So after reading your comment, I was slightly confused for a second. The sentence structure is oddly put together, the grammar is a little much with all of the commas and the entire sentence reads as if you purposely wrote it to derail someone who's trying to fluidly read the threads.
      </p>
      <p>
       A quick glance at your comment history shows you primarily comment in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       , you're still pushing the "Muh Russia!" narrative, obviously anti-trump and the best thing of all, nearly all of your comments are either incoherent or just sloppily put together.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's as if your trying to confuse the people reading a thread that
       <em>
        might
       </em>
       contain negative information about Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       odd...

       Rereading his post, it does seem a little oddly put together. But when I read it organically it flowed smoothly and I had no problem understanding it. I don't even know how poor grammar could be a conspiracy

       Poor grammar is not a conspiracy.

      <p>
       What is
       <em>
        part
       </em>
       of a conspiracy is the use of poor grammar in a sentence in order to pull attention away from the topic on hand. It's mind games.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're used to reading proper grammar, most of the time at least, but when it's so bad it trips your reading comprehension up and you have to re-read it twice, three times or even four times to try to understand it.

       Yes, it's mountain Time where I'm at, my point was that he sounds pretty delusional, and it's early regardless of where he is.. hence maybe he needs to get more sleep.

       It's funny, I'm fairly well spoken. I tend to write as a would talk, and no one has said shit in the past. My original comment he responded to could have definitely been put better.. but all assumptions based on that was absolutely delusional.

       Bill Clinton said that about North Korea in 1994 during his nuke deal with them, which from a legislative standpoint it‚Äôs what the Iran deal was modeled after, almost identical. That played out well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gave them nukes, reactors, enriched U, power systems to convert, and personnel all in exchange for oversight. NK lost oversight. Iran lost oversight. There are no Americans supervising their nuclear powers. Tell me more how that‚Äôs good.

       literally even trumps cabinet has said that the Iran deal is working and is in our national interest, congress agreed, the joint chiefs of staff agreed, tillerson and mattis agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump just hates it because it was obama's deal, and so trump has to destroy it no matter the cost to america. just like the ACA, which isn't really that great if we're being honest, but Trump destroying the market places is just making everything worse.

       If ACA was applied to congress then you bet your ass they would‚Äôve written that act better. Hell even McCain said that using Obamacare for his brain tumor treatment would be ‚Äúcruel.‚Äù Their poorly written ACA probably ruined any shot of American healthcare being single payer for a very long time. Pros and cons to both. I would like to be in charge of my medical decisions and my own health. Because I couldn‚Äôt keep my doctor. And I couldn‚Äôt keep my plan. And I couldn‚Äôt see any of it until it was passed. But I see where you‚Äôre coming from, from my perspective he‚Äôs a nationalist president and doesn‚Äôt want foreign wars, and in return the stock market has broken its own record like 40 times since he‚Äôs been in office and all I hear is ‚Äúthis is Obama‚Äôs doing.‚Äù Which it could play a part but not this big of a stock scale. As soon as the bubble pops from being so high for so long down the road it‚Äôll switch from ‚ÄúTrump hasn‚Äôt done shit for the economy‚Äù to ‚Äúlook what trump did.‚Äù Feel free to slide in my messages I‚Äôd like to pick your brain on some other things.

       i actually believe in the conspiracy theory that the Dems sabotaged the ACA on purpose to try to trick america into being alright with single payer, like "oh wow, healthcare is just so broken and fucked, the only way we could ever come back from this is single payer" but then it spectacularly backfired on them
      </p>
      <p>
       i also think the economy is too complex and chaotic to be really understood, and all the "it's trump!" and "its obama!" claims are wild oversimplifications of the reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       although, i believe that some of the push back on the left is because Obama's economy had a really great track record of continuous growth but the conservatives literally never once gave him any credit, and then the second a republican comes into office and the
       <em>
        exact same trends from obama's era
       </em>
       continue, it's suddenly "OMFG trump has fixed the economy!"
      </p>
      <p>
       just more partisan posturing though, at the end of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
       and finally, i firmly believe that nationalism is a poison to society. and i believe the historical examples support that assertion quite well. everytime a nation starts sliding into populism and nationalism, it's a path to totalitarian and fascists regimes.

       And that last paragraph is just plain ignorance. Strong nation states are what makes for good neighbors... FuckinA you're under 30 as the deficits in your education are huge.

Why don't you take your fancy thoughts to Saudi Arabia and tell them how wrong they are...and see how that ends for you.  OTOH hand they're investing a shit ton of money to make sure you stay stupid and have zero issues telling Americans how wrong they are. You don't even know what fascism is. Ask an Italian. Fucktard.

       Who on Trumps cabinet thinks the Iranian arms deal is a good deal? Please quote actual statements. Like North Korea Iran is not abiding by the deal. I'm fairly certain that handing a radical Islamic government nuclear arms was an EXCELLENT deal for Obama.

       OTOH Israel has over 300 nuclear bombs and refuses inspection and oversight. That's also wrong.

       Iran doesn't have nuclear arms, and wasn't handed them.

       So in conclusion, it seems like you are extremely confused about the current situation. I would recommend actually doing some research into.

       It's sad how many people probably actually belive that. I was shocked by the number of people who responded to outrage about the Vegas investigation closing their press conference to any independent media by saying 'what, like you think ANY OLD PERSON should be allowed in there to ask questions?' It's like people have been brainwashed into thinking they themselves are lower life forms or something.

       I think having tangeable evidence (intercepted emails and phone calls along with secret agents for upwards of four years of intel gathering) is good. The most fucked part about all this is that Mueller was the head of the FBI at the time. And he delivered the uranium. And he knew about all of it since 2010.

       Majority of this story has been debunked time and time again since trump started bringing it up.

       What can you debunk about intercepted phone calls and emails? What about undercover agents with cameras and audio? Now how about financial records from multiple different countries that all add up? Or how about Podesta received 75,000 stocks in Joule Unlimited or how Putin donated 146M to the Clinton Foundation after the deal was reached. Is all that debunked too? Asking for a friend.

       Why? Has he ever directly lied? I think he's done some cheeky bullshit, like saying he'd explain how to get Hillary's deleted emails, only to eventually just say that the NSA has it and that it's the NSA we should be asking. I hope you wouldn't say to ignore him because of that joke. That would be really lame.

       Unless you were behind the curtain. I read every single one and I'm so grateful... I watched a chan hack Trump servers looking for dirt. Their security was easy to breach lol windows 03 I think... guess what? Zero dirt. Nada. Just business... if there were dirt to be found they would have found it. Assange says no one leaked any verifiable Trump stuff and if they had he would have published it. 8 years of wire tapping and they didn't have a single thing to get him on. The people stop screaming REEEEE BUT TRUMP... are just plain stupid or Sharia Blue because I'd like to think most people aren't THAT stupid.

       That could be the case.

       However, I believe wikileaks has a history of fuzzing up the exact timing of releases, to screw with any last minute attempts to frustrate their release or for establishment figures to get their ducks straight before the hammer drops.

       I think this is more the case than we know. There are alot of nefarious things going on behind the scenes that the average joe probably could never conceive of. They plan on doing things then it gets blocked by another person or group. Not as cut and dried as everyone may think.

       New Wikileaks drop connected to US politics. Most likely Weiners laptop (which had classified information on it through Hillary‚Äôs private server) was compromised after it was handed over to NYPD. That‚Äôs my best guess. Definitely not thumbing the leaker of the dnc server. That‚Äôs his only leverage for freedom.

       Maybe it really is something. ON Podeasta's twitter, all of the comments on all of his tweets are pizza related. I believe that's why he made the announcement about To The Stars Academy, he is trying to shift the focus. I can only hope that we're getting close to something big

       Assange didn't post "encryption codes," it's a precommittment strategy.

       It doesn't mean he's about to release something. In fact, off the top of my head, I'm not recalling a single time one of these tweets was followed by a release of any kind. It means he's in a conversation with someone else, that none of us is privy to, and that he's proving something to that person.
      </p>
      <p>
       This comes up on this sub every couple months. How is it that so few people have bothered to learn what an "encryption code" even looks like?

       Hannity has also still refused to get waterboarded for charity, as he had promised when he insisted over and over on his show that "waterboarding isn't torture."

       But sure, go ahead and trust him now. I'm sure you won't be burned for trusting an alt-right shill.

       Bill Clinton said that about North Korea in 1994 during his nuke deal with them, which from a legislative standpoint it‚Äôs what the Iran deal was modeled after, almost identical. That played out well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gave them nukes, reactors, enriched U, power systems to convert, and personnel all in exchange for oversight. NK lost oversight. Iran lost oversight. There are no Americans supervising their nuclear powers. Tell me more how that‚Äôs good.

       literally even trumps cabinet has said that the Iran deal is working and is in our national interest, congress agreed, the joint chiefs of staff agreed, tillerson and mattis agreed.
      </p>
      <p>
       trump just hates it because it was obama's deal, and so trump has to destroy it no matter the cost to america. just like the ACA, which isn't really that great if we're being honest, but Trump destroying the market places is just making everything worse.

       It's sad how many people probably actually belive that. I was shocked by the number of people who responded to outrage about the Vegas investigation closing their press conference to any independent media by saying 'what, like you think ANY OLD PERSON should be allowed in there to ask questions?' It's like people have been brainwashed into thinking they themselves are lower life forms or something.
