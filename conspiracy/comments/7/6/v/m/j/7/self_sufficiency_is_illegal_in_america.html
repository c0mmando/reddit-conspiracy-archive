       Apparently making your own water and power, and being fully independent from the teat of the government, is illegal.
      </p>
      <p>
       A woman in Florida was evicted due to harvesting her own rainwater and creating her own solar power.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are claims that she was a slob, mistreated her animals, and was even placed in jail for animal cruelty and had her animals taken away. I find it hard to believe a woman being capable of creating a self sustaining homestead but not being able to take care of two dogs. My money is on those were lies and intimidation techniques to get her to comply.
      </p>
      <p>
       I cannot fathom how anyone could possibly argue that eviction is a just way of dealing with independence from an already overloaded system of basic needs such as water and power.
      </p>
      <p>
       But then of course, our government is not looking out for our needs are they? Only their own.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        "You'll drink our fluorosilicic acid filled, chlorinated, heavy metal water, or else!"
       </em>
       So says the government.
       <em>
        "Then how will you question our authority with your body filled with poison? ha ha ha!"
       </em>
       They add.

       It's not illegal at all.
      </p>

       She's just doing it in a really bad place. Even if you don't use your cities water (say you use well water), you still have to pay money for having it run to, and available for, your house. That's just local bylaws meant to cover their costs and make them money. You can't have the city run water to every house in a new subdivision and then 50% of the people go 'nah im good'. It's a lot harder to run pipe after the fact (and more expensive).
      </p>
      <p>
       Pulling the plug in a subdivision, town/city, county, that has a bunch of rules in place, you're going to have issues. Go buy a bunch of land in the middle of nowhere, live off the grid all you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not about control, it's more about money. In fact, lots of states would love people to generate more then they use with solar, selling the rest back to the electric company. There's actually tax breaks to do that. And the city water vs well water we should have to pay, thats been going on for 50 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no idea whether the woman is in the right or wrong, I don't really care. But the local water issue is money, isn't new, and I don't think its a conspiracy.

       It's not about control until it is. i think they are incermentally clamping down. Slowly but surely. Agenda 21 is very real. Project for a New American Century. The goals of the rand corporation. I think it's smart to be skeptical of what things "appear to be".

       Money is always above control. And the 'control' is about making money. No one is after control if it loses them money, or doesn't make them money. Money is at the top. Always is.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, this seems like stupid local city officials, bylaws, looking for money. I don't see this as a federal/global conspiracy. City wants money. She doesn't want to pay money.
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, live outside of city limits, get your own land, hook up with people who are serious about freedoms and rights. You don't have to be a hermit, you  just have to accept that you're going to drive a little more to get anywhere.

       If how she is collecting water and solar energy is not breaking any laws, why should the government care? Her property, city, county and state taxes should more than cover the 'cost' to lay those lines 20+ years ago.

        Even if you don't use your cities bread (say you use your own bread), you still have to pay money for having it grown, and available for, your house. That's just local bylaws meant to cover their costs and make [the bread companies] money. You can't have the city provide bread for every house in a new subdivision and then 50% of the people go 'nah im good'. It's a lot harder to run bread after the fact (and more expensive).

       I have well water with a pump. Dont pay one dime for water since the well is under my property. I have propane delivered but usually use a pellet stove so the propane heat rarely kicks on. The only utility I pay for is electricity.

       You normally pay when you first build. If they've run water to that lot, normally you have to pay when you start building (part of getting permits). Depends where you live of course.

       Yes, militarized code enforcement officers are getting paid to do the bidding of newly formed hoa committees. Places that were once safe from covenants, even those that did not have any since the beginning of time, suddenly have new rules. Trickery has been used - a new landowner shows up to gather people together for fake meetings, then tries to lump all these people together as racist terrorists hermits, plotting to try to destroy stuff. The tactics are bizarre, and deeply cruel. Not sure who is behind this, but there is a play book out there somewhere.

       How many people total in all of Florida have been evicted due to collecting rainwater and solar power?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the answer is "just this person", then it doesn't seem like that was the motivation to evict, but rather an excuse, likely because of her being an 'animal abusing slob' to paraphrase the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't sound like this should be something to be evicted for a first offence.  I can see laws against it for tenants, though, and an eventual eviction for repeated noncompliance.

       Noone gonna address what OP said? I paraphrased:
       <br/>
       "I have no fucking clue about this case, but my money is..."

       And you all jump in...
