       This is considerably harder to do when youre willing to dismiss photographic evidence that has already been released

       The burden of proof falls on you to prove that those images are fake before anything. "Prove me wrong" is fallacious garbage.

       the claim is that zero evidence has been released.
      </p>
      <p>
       the entire theory is what your crazy little mind rattled together after you established that the evidence has not yet been released.
      </p>
      <p>
       This does not mean that it will not be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your theory is literally just as insane as claiming it was a reptilian mind control device, and the entire event never happened, but was simply an idea implanted into everyones mind via telepathic warfare.

       Devil's advocate here: most would say there is some fuckery going on here.. therefore he is with the majority in terms of questioning the narrative.. so shouldn't it be the people that BELIEVE what's been released that should prove us wrong ?

       You can't prove a negative claim.  Just like you can't prove that God does NOT exist.  The burden of proof is on the one making the positive claim.  That's a basic principle of logic.  The burden of proof is on the side positively claiming that people DID die, not on the side that negatively claims people DID NOT die.

       There have been plenty of photos and videos on liveleak of people dying. In fact, there was a cellphone video of a guy going around lifting up shirts of the dead.

       I could show you two different news stories about a man who had a bullet lodged in his wallet and a woman with an iPhone that got shot. The reason I am not is because you're just going to claim they're fake. That's the point here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're using flat Earther logic. You're going to dismiss any evidence you're presented and go "SEE! NO EVIDENCE" without posting any evidence at all to your own claim.

        <p>
         The entire article is based on an interview with the supposed victim's father.  The only photos are of a smiling young man and a bloodied bullet next to a wallet.  A glaring sign of bullshit is that the dad says his son still has the bullet with him.  That's not possible.  The bullet would be in police custody for evidence and the ballistics report.

         Yes in a mass cas the first thing you do is go around checking pulses and opening airways. If you have equipment, you can apply tourniquets and decompress chests. Absolutely no effort would be made for those pulsless and apneic.

         Im guessing the guy has some training but is operating in a bystander capacity. He is trying to help but lacks the communication and command structure first responders have. It's chaotic, he just witnessed a mass shooting. He is hollering for the lights to be turned on do he can do something.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Maybe he says the shooting has stopped because he hasn't heard any shots for a minute.

      </ol>

       Dumb. As someone who has seen plenty of bodies and victims of trauma, plenty of death and dying, this video is real. You can sit behind your keyboard and come up with these insane notions, but you are wrong.

       Honestly though, that makes even less sense. She would have had to be holding the phone upside-down AND backwards for the shot to occur [and not tear-up her hand]. Also, her grip would have needed to have been monstrous.

       I'm assuming she dropped it... like it was shot out of her hand... the momentum of the bullet was largely transmitted to the phone... but this theory would require her to go back and pick it up... but most people are idiots and idiots do weird things for their phones... or maybe she collected it when they started releasing personal effects to the public.

       Talking on it while being hit would have been completely impossible. The phone has an exit wound. The bullet wold have gone into her head. If she was holding it, it would have to have been backwards AND upside-down to have avoided a hand injury. Unless she was trying to take a high-definition selfie of her vagina, it is improbable that anyone would be holding a phone like that.

       She prolly just pulled it out of her pocket at whatever angle it came out at and ran with it in her hand... I don't think anyone is claiming she was talking on it... It's already improbable that the phone would get hit over the much much larger humanoid... so holding a phone you aren't using upside down ain't too much of a stretch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even more improbable? That no one was shot and then they just plugged a hole in her cellphone at a suspicious angle on purpose to spread around a photo to convince batshit insane people that there were actually bullets fired... cause they care
       <em>
        that

       Your perspective is out of whack, or on crack. I'm just saying that the iPhoto isn't hard evidence of shots fired per OP's subject. I don't buy it.  But, who cares. The point is: that evidence is obviously not enough to quash this topic. There are many people out there that have reasonable question that  so far have been left unanswered.
      </p>
      <p>
       BTW, I don't give a shit either way. I personally have no questions on this topic.

       Nothing on the internet is ever ever ever ever ever definitive proof of fucking anything ever... if you don't believe people got shot you have no reason to believe that North Korea is even a real country or that you get oil from drilling underground or that steak comes from cows or that Angelina Jolie is a real person... the Earth is flat and the moon is made of cheese and I am nothing but your 3rd arm growing out of your back holding a smartphone and you are actually talking to yourself.

       Nope... I hang out on "new" so I see shitposts like these as soon as they are posted... thats the only way to see them cause with 0 upvotes happy horseshit like this gets buried. But I've seen enough to know someone needs a quick visit to a psychiatrist.

       Not necessarily. In my opinion, photos and video from the ground that I've seen on liveleak and social media (not MSM) has convinced me that bullets were fired and people were shot. This doesn't mean I believe the entire narrative, but I do believe the shooting happened.

       You can't prove a negative claim. Just like you can't prove that God does NOT exist. The burden of proof is on the one making the positive claim. That's a basic principle of logic. The burden of proof is on the side positively claiming that people DID die, not on the side that negatively claims people DID NOT die.

       Like if you don't trust the witnesses and the reports and the funerals and all the crying folks and the videos and the pictures... and the fact that just about everyone in the world thinks someone was shot there... then I don't know what to tell you. Prove AA batteries exist to me. Do it now... c'mon. I can shoot down any evidence you could ever provide in much of the same fashion that you dismiss all the evidence that people were shot. You can't prove a negative... so you can't prove no one was shot... but it is easy to prove that people got shot... at least to a normal person. It's a bit different when yer dealing with someone 60 days off meds.

       I can hold a civil conversation... but I feel icky just talking to you specifically... you got this wild hoax hair across your ass you just don't wanna let go. I find it very interesting and entertaining... but I feel a little bad for ya. I'm keen on Psychology... and it has my brain wondering how this kind of belief system you hold impacts your daily life.

       Why would I trust any of those claims in the absence of evidence?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is an abundance of proof that the media lies, and is complicit in propagating other hoaxes such as the Boston Bombing. So, knowing that the media has lied before, why would
       <em>
        anyone
       </em>
       trust
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       they see on the news?
      </p>
      <p>
       In any case, even from the most trusted sources credibility is nothing more than an argument from authority. It's a logical fallacy, it doesn't matter who says what. Perceived credibility does not determine truth.

       Why would you ever trust anything ever? Why wouldn't you just move into a shack in the woods away from society and perfect making pipe bombs? Why stop at no shooting? Maybe Las Vegas doesn't even exist? Right? Even if you think you've been there they just flew ya around in a plane for a while and landed in Canada... Everything is a lie! Trust no one!

       This "miracle bullet" is a blatant prop, and so easy to fake that at the very least you have to admit it proves nothing at all. How much more obvious do they have to be?

       There should be hundred if not thousands of loose rounds. The crime scene should be peppered with impact sites and forensic markers. Where are they? Where is the evidence that a crime took place?

       It's not proof of "death", but the Health Ranger has offered fairly conclusive evidence that there was live bullets being used:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ... specifically, he notes in the audio the lag time between the gun shot and the bullet hitting the ground.  And it's based on these audio forensics that he is able to determine there were MULTIPLE shooters (using live bullets).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now.... I acknowledge that is NOT proof of anyone dying (or even getting hit!)
      </p>
      <p>
       However... the chances that live gun fire was being used... w/o people actually getting hit (at least) is pretty slim, wouldn't you say?
      </p>
      <p>
       Las Vegas was a "legal, bullet-less psyops" (intended to sway Americans to favor gun control), that got hi-jacked by Mossad (who turned it bloody, and started issuing ISIS™ press releases).
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why we see a lot of video of crises actors...
      </p>
      <p>
       ... even though live gunfire is clearly on record.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my opinion.

       Bullets are faster than sound especially from the guns that were supposedly used.
      </p>
      <p>
       each bullet is breaking the sound barrier and over 800 sprayed into a crowd and there is no footage of non lethal wounds? No cop cars shot up, no cars below  the shooter shot up, and no vendor equipment shot up.
      </p>
      <p>
       plus he didn't take advantage of the people leaving through choke points.     The bullet strikes should have been visible and you see nothing in any of the videos that look like bullets hitting the ground faster  than the speed of sound.

       The Health Ranger (THR) acknowledged:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Bullets are faster than sound especially from the guns that were supposedly used.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Which is why we hear the bullets striking the ground...
      </p>
      <p>
       ... then a small delay...
      </p>
      <p>
       ... then we hear the gun shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       If live bullets were not being used, we would only hear guns firing... and ZERO bullet strikes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom Line:  Live bullets were being used -- perhaps not 800 -- perhaps only 40.  But there is fairly clear audio forensic evidence of bullet striking the ground a few tenths of a seconds before we hear the fire.
      </p>

       When I was first looking through the Las Vegas victims list and investigating each victim's social media, their facebooks / Instagrams did seem kind of fishy. 
Except I did come across one victim, Christiana, who I'm sure is 100% legitimately a dead victim.

       Her Facebook seems completely legit and me and her have 1 mutual friend, and many of her friends have 5+ mutual friends with me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, this girl (Anum) seems like a best friend of Christiana Duarte's, and her Facebook profile picture in memory of Christiana seems very legit...

       Investigations are never open to the public until they are concluded.
      </p>
      <p>
       i think the internet age has given people this false impression that they have some right to all the information
       <em>
        right now
       </em>
       but the reality is that the cops aren't going to release ballistic reports, injury reports, all their eye witness testimony, etc etc until they are ready to issue a full public report.

       that's how all investigations work, and always have worked.

       there are  videos and photos . non of which look like they’ve been faked, if they, prove it. having motive doesn’t mean anything. if they have motive to harm then why fake it? 
 there are eye witness and cell phone accounts. just because there is some kind of fuckery going on DOES NOT MEAN IT DIDN’T HAPPEN.
      </p>
      <p>
       besides , if these people are so despicable as to try to fake this to ram thru congress legislation then they’re sick enough to do it the right way, you know with actual death and destruction. why fake it ? when you can actually get the tyranny you want through actual mayhem instead of pretend mayhem

       yep your post  made me relook at the gore video...    after watching it a few times it becomes obvios how easy it would be to fake that.
      </p>
      <p>
       then i found the term moulage....
but what convinced me was when i posted on my youtube why i no longer think its real.  that video was deleted straight away and i got a strike.   all the much worse stuff i posted supporting 2 shooters.   no worries.
      </p>
      <p>
       i'm 100% now its fake  and like you i'm finding it hard to get the truth out.

       i was under no illosion to how controlled the world is but being remineded like this is kinda freaky

       There have been plenty of photos and videos on liveleak of people dying. In fact, there was a cellphone video of a guy going around lifting up shirts of the dead.

       I could show you two different news stories about a man who had a bullet lodged in his wallet and a woman with an iPhone that got shot. The reason I am not is because you're just going to claim they're fake. That's the point here.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're using flat Earther logic. You're going to dismiss any evidence you're presented and go "SEE! NO EVIDENCE" without posting any evidence at all to your own claim.

       I'm assuming she dropped it... like it was shot out of her hand... the momentum of the bullet was largely transmitted to the phone... but this theory would require her to go back and pick it up... but most people are idiots and idiots do weird things for their phones... or maybe she collected it when they started releasing personal effects to the public.

       Your perspective is out of whack, or on crack. I'm just saying that the iPhoto isn't hard evidence of shots fired per OP's subject. I don't buy it.  But, who cares. The point is: that evidence is obviously not enough to quash this topic. There are many people out there that have reasonable question that  so far have been left unanswered.
      </p>

       BTW, I don't give a shit either way. I personally have no questions on this topic.

       Nothing on the internet is ever ever ever ever ever definitive proof of fucking anything ever... if you don't believe people got shot you have no reason to believe that North Korea is even a real country or that you get oil from drilling underground or that steak comes from cows or that Angelina Jolie is a real person... the Earth is flat and the moon is made of cheese and I am nothing but your 3rd arm growing out of your back holding a smartphone and you are actually talking to yourself.

       Nope... I hang out on "new" so I see shitposts like these as soon as they are posted... thats the only way to see them cause with 0 upvotes happy horseshit like this gets buried. But I've seen enough to know someone needs a quick visit to a psychiatrist.
