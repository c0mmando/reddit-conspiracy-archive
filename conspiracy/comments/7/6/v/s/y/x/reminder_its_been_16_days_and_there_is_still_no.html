<p>the entire theory is what your crazy little mind rattled together after you established that the evidence has not yet been released.</p>

<p>This does not mean that it will not be.</p>

<p>Your theory is literally just as insane as claiming it was a reptilian mind control device, and the entire event never happened, but was simply an idea implanted into everyones mind via telepathic warfare.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Why that liveleak video is fake:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDnuylxrAxw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDnuylxrAxw</a></p></li>
<li><p>The entire article is based on an interview with the supposed victim&#39;s father.  The only photos are of a smiling young man and a bloodied bullet next to a wallet.  A glaring sign of bullshit is that the dad says his son still has the bullet with him.  That&#39;s not possible.  The bullet would be in police custody for evidence and the ballistics report.</p></li>

<li><p>Yes in a mass cas the first thing you do is go around checking pulses and opening airways. If you have equipment, you can apply tourniquets and decompress chests. Absolutely no effort would be made for those pulsless and apneic.</p></li>
<li><p>Im guessing the guy has some training but is operating in a bystander capacity. He is trying to help but lacks the communication and command structure first responders have. It&#39;s chaotic, he just witnessed a mass shooting. He is hollering for the lights to be turned on do he can do something.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe he says the shooting has stopped because he hasn&#39;t heard any shots for a minute.</p></li>

<p>Dumb. As someone who has seen plenty of bodies and victims of trauma, plenty of death and dying, this video is real. You can sit behind your keyboard and come up with these insane notions, but you are wrong.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Talking on it while being hit would have been completely impossible. The phone has an exit wound. The bullet wold have gone into her head. If she was holding it, it would have to have been backwards AND upside-down to have avoided a hand injury.

    <div class="md"><p>She prolly just pulled it out of her pocket at whatever angle it came out at and ran with it in her hand... I don&#39;t think anyone is claiming she was talking on it... It&#39;s already improbable that the phone would get hit over the much much larger humanoid... so holding a phone you aren&#39;t using upside down ain&#39;t too much of a stretch. </p>

<p>Even more improbable? That no one was shot and then they just plugged a hole in her cellphone at a suspicious angle on purpose to spread around a photo to convince batshit insane people that there were actually bullets fired... cause they care <em>that</em> much what batshit insane people think... and know they are easily swayed by photographs. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why would I trust any of those claims in the absence of evidence?</p>

<p>There is an abundance of proof that the media lies, and is complicit in propagating other hoaxes such as the Boston Bombing. So, knowing that the media has lied before, why would <em>anyone</em> trust <em>anything</em> they see on the news?</p>

<p>In any case, even from the most trusted sources credibility is nothing more than an argument from authority. It&#39;s a logical fallacy, it doesn&#39;t matter who says what. Perceived credibility does not determine truth.</p>

<p>Thousands of rounds of ammunition were allegedly fired. Where is the evidence for it?</p>

<p>It&#39;s not proof of &quot;death&quot;, but the Health Ranger has offered fairly conclusive evidence that there was live bullets being used:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/75dkh7/forensic_acoustic_proof_of_second_shooter_in_the/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/75dkh7/forensic_acoustic_proof_of_second_shooter_in_the/</a></p>

<p>... specifically, he notes in the audio the lag time between the gun shot and the bullet hitting the ground.  And it&#39;s based on these audio forensics that he is able to determine there were MULTIPLE shooters (using live bullets).</p>

<p>Now.... I acknowledge that is NOT proof of anyone dying (or even getting hit!)</p>

<p>However... the chances that live gun fire was being used... w/o people actually getting hit (at least) is pretty slim, wouldn&#39;t you say?</p>

<p>Las Vegas was a &quot;legal, bullet-less psyops&quot; (intended to sway Americans to favor gun control), that got hi-jacked by Mossad (who turned it bloody, and started issuing ISIS™ press releases).</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we see a lot of video of crises actors... </p>

<p>... even though live gunfire is clearly on record. </p>

<p>Just my opinion.</p>

<p>each bullet is breaking the sound barrier and over 800 sprayed into a crowd and there is no footage of non lethal wounds? No cop cars shot up, no cars below  the shooter shot up, and no vendor equipment shot up. </p>

<p>plus he didn&#39;t take advantage of the people leaving through choke points.     The bullet strikes should have been visible and you see nothing in any of the videos that look like bullets hitting the ground faster  than the speed of sound.   </p>

<ul>
<li>Bullets are faster than sound especially from the guns that were supposedly used.</li>
</ul>

<p>Which is why we hear the bullets striking the ground...</p>

<p>... then a small delay...</p>

<p>... then we hear the gun shot.</p>

<p>If live bullets were not being used, we would only hear guns firing... and ZERO bullet strikes.</p>

<p>Bottom Line:  Live bullets were being used -- perhaps not 800 -- perhaps only 40.  But there is fairly clear audio forensic evidence of bullet striking the ground a few tenths of a seconds before we hear the fire.</p>

<p>Here is a direct like to THR&#39;s forensic analysis:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are  videos and photos . non of which look like they’ve been faked, if they, prove it. having motive doesn’t mean anything. if they have motive to harm then why fake it? 
 there are eye witness and cell phone accounts. just because there is some kind of fuckery going on DOES NOT MEAN IT DIDN’T HAPPEN. </p>

<p>besides , if these people are so despicable as to try to fake this to ram thru congress legislation then they’re sick enough to do it the right way, you know with actual death and destruction. why fake it ? when you can actually get the tyranny you want through actual mayhem instead of pretend mayhem </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep your post  made me relook at the gore video...    after watching it a few times it becomes obvios how easy it would be to fake that.</p>

<p>then i found the term moulage....
but what convinced me was when i posted on my youtube why i no longer think its real.  that video was deleted straight away and i got a strike.   all the much worse stuff i posted supporting 2 shooters.   no worries.</p>

<p>i&#39;m 100% now its fake  and like you i&#39;m finding it hard to get the truth out.</p>

<p>i was under no illosion to how controlled the world is but being remineded like this is kinda freaky</p>

<p>peace bro    keep i touch</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There have been plenty of photos and videos on liveleak of people dying. In fact, there was a cellphone video of a guy going around lifting up shirts of the dead.</p>

<p>I could show you two different news stories about a man who had a bullet lodged in his wallet and a woman with an iPhone that got shot. The reason I am not is because you&#39;re just going to claim they&#39;re fake. That&#39;s the point here.</p>

<p>You&#39;re using flat Earther logic. You&#39;re going to dismiss any evidence you&#39;re presented and go &quot;SEE! NO EVIDENCE&quot; without posting any evidence at all to your own claim.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming she dropped it... like it was shot out of her hand... the momentum of the bullet was largely transmitted to the phone... but this theory would require her to go back and pick it up... but most people are idiots and idiots do weird things for their phones... or maybe she collected it when they started releasing personal effects to the public. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your perspective is out of whack, or on crack. I&#39;m just saying that the iPhoto isn&#39;t hard evidence of shots fired per OP&#39;s subject. I don&#39;t buy it.  But, who cares. The point is: that evidence is obviously not enough to quash this topic. There are many people out there that have reasonable question that  so far have been left unanswered.</p>

<p>BTW, I don&#39;t give a shit either way. I personally have no questions on this topic.</p>
