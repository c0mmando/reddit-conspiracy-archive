       Did you see the archived CNN article announcing Jesus Campos’s arrest as an accomplice?  It was quite specific &amp; mentioned JC being shot in the ARM.  The story was later retracted.  (I’ll look for the link if you’d like!)

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       One long overhead map (i.e. Figure 17) looks like it's showing us that the straight-line distance from the vantage point of where the footage was taken, to exactly where the helicopter appears to be in the footage (above the airstrip), is about 2.5km.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other long overhead map (i.e. Figure 20) looks like it's showing us that the distance from where the helicopter appears to be in the footage, to the venue itself is about 950m, which is within the M60's 1,100m effective firing range.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps it's also relevant to bear that sound travels at 343 m/s, whereas 7.62x51mm NATO rounds can travel up to 833 m/s (2.92 second vs. 1.20 seconds to travel 1km). There would be a second or so delay between the arrival of the (theoretical) volley of bullets and the sound of the M60's muzzle fire. The panic/disruption induced by (alleged) firecrackers, and gun fire from within 500m of the venue could possibly be enough to mask the sound of somewhat muffled muzzle fire from a kilometer away.

       Panorama Towers, by the looks of it.

       the fact that in the footage near the stage you can hear the gunfire clear as a bell while the 110db+ concert is taking place - to me is the clear evidence that the shooters were much closer than the mandalay bay.

       Why not both? Fireworks going on next to the stage, the presence of shooters (i.e. mercenaries) closer than the Mandalay Bay hotel, as well as possible shooters within the Mandalay Bay hotel itself could distract from the a low-hovering helicopter situated above the nearby airfield, firing a mounted M60 in bursts from about a kilometer away. There does seem to be a growing body of evidence to suggest that this is the case.

       As somebody who was also there I feel the need to say I am 99% certain that these witnesses did not actually see anybody on the ground, and they never had anybody chasing them. There were never actually any firecrackers, I was directly next to the first person to go down during the first small burst. Scanning the ground during all those shots I was never under the impression that there were any shooters on the ground. The only thing that made me believe there were multiple shooters at the time were from the media/ Twitter while hiding.

       No, I actually don’t see that at all seeing as I’ve been on reddit for years and only posted to 3-4 subreddits ever, very very sporadically. Not everybody posts to reddit every day. 
I really hope that you treat ALL these stories, firsthand accounts with the same amount of doubt, and not just those that go against your narrative/ belief.

       I certainly do. It's called skepticism for a reason. And yes, it's fucking weird that you go straight to the conspiracy theory subreddit and don't give any links previously showing you were there accompanying your post dismissing the other victims story. That you don't see how that could be wierd, is entirely ridiculous. But how about you continue telling your story and include those links on EVERY post for the LV Shooting rather than place your focus on me for calling you out for your post history?

       You think after being at a shooting and seeing innocent people die right in front of you the first thing you would do is get on reddit to tell everyone? 
This morning I decided to finally give some of these conspiracies a look as I’ve enjoyed browsing this sub in the past. The first post I see about the shooting is this one and it only included firsthand accounts that fit the multiple shooter, helicopter shooter, “false flag” story. Sorry I haven’t spammed these links on EVERY fuckin post about the shooting. 
My proof is pretty straight forward unless you believe both my brothers gunshot wound and Sheldans story/ wounds to be fake. I’m placing my focus on your doubt because I know other people will read this as well. 
If anyone has any questions about my experience I’d be happy to answer them the best that I can

       I don't believe the wounds and deaths to be fake. When will people learn false flag doesn't mean the perpetrators of said false flag attack aren't willing to kill innocents to get their agenda?

       I said that is the only way my PROOF could be fake, I know what a fucking false flag is. 
And yes, that’s what I said in my original comment. Between what I experienced and the 20+ accounts from people that were there with me I am certain there was never a shooter on the ground chasing anybody, nor was there a helicopter. Can I say with certainty there was no 2nd shooter? No, but after ~5-7 minutes of nonstop shots just about everybody on the ground knew the shots were coming from the Mandalay Bay, and could see the muzzle flashes.

       No, you misunderstood him. He is saying there is no point in me making a post because my story doesn’t fit the conspiracy narrative.
       <br/>
       I find the facts around this security guard and the timeline extremely concerning and it is clear to me they are covering something up. I just felt the need to say that having been there, and knowing so many others that were there, I am very, very confident that there were never any shooters on the ground or in a helicopter. I cannot say with the same degree of confidence that there was only one shooter, but I do NOT believe there were two. That is all. You are trying so hard to make me out to be some TPTB shill, which I am not.

       After personally seeing exactly how many people were extremely traumatized by this, including myself, I think that’s really odd and it makes no sense whatsoever that they would need a crisis actor. Plenty of attention seeking REAL witnesses would have gladly said the same thing. Like I said I do believe they are covering something up, specifically regarding the Jesus Campos story and official timeline. It just makes no sense to me that they would need crisis actors to use as witnesses. There were 22,000 of us there, and they had to hire someone to fake an interview?

       Even though real people died on 9/11, they did the same thing--interviewing crisis actors to push a specific narrative (that the heat from fires brought those three steel-framed buildings down).
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it's possible they didn't interview non-crisis actors because they might possibly say something that contradicts the official narrative?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think it's possible they used a few hundred crisis actors and played gunfire over a set of loud speakers to induce panic/chaos in the crowd, which could then be used to obscure the application of make-up/moulage meant to look like bullet wounds (similar to what they did at the

         No. This did not happen. It makes me sick to think people believe this could be the case. I was there with a large group of friends, all in all I probably know 35-40 people that were there. My fucking brother was shot in the leg and is still on crutches. I watched people die. I felt a kid my age hit the ground next to me with a large bullet wound in his face, dead on impact. I watched them go agonal with their eyes flickering. I had previously met one of the victims that died and went to his funeral and saw him in the casket. So no. I don’t think they had fucking actors with makeup disguised as bullet wounds. And it’s fucking disgusting to me to think that people out there do.

       Covering something up regarding who was in that room shooting at us, possible Jesus Campos involvement, the timeline of events, motive, etc. 
As I’m sure you know there’s a difference between a false flag and a hoax. This was NOT a hoax. I ask that you eliminate that possibility ASAP as it will bring you closer to finding the truth. After what I have seen and gone through, it is extremely triggering seeing ANY implications that it was fake makeup wounds and gun shots coming out of speakers.

       Are we at least in agreement it's a false flag then? Brian Claypool, and many of the others they interviewed after the event are clearly crisis actors (which can be indicative of a false flag and possible hoaxing). It looks like they were possibly flying a helicopter around that night too and so many other things about the official narrative don't make sense. Clearly there's some fuckery afoot.

      <p>
       I don't buy the 550+ casualties inflicted by a lone gunman running from window of a hotel room shooting at a crowd 500m away in a 10 minute timeframe. If you are certain there were no firecrackers, no shooters on the ground, nor a helicopter nearby, and that this whole thing wasn't a staged event (in spite of the involvement of crisis actors), then what else are we to conclude?

       I said it COULD be a false flag. “Possible hoaxing” did you not just read my comment? It was not a fucking hoax, please stop spreading that with YouTube videos with 100 views as your proof. There was NOT a hoax. Just get that in your head right now. You need to accept.
      </p>

       If I were to come here and say I saw multiple gunmen on the ground, it seems you would just take that for fact because that’s what you want to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       You  don’t understand the madness that comes with 22000 people being shot at. I had my elbows and knees completely scraped up and I am 6’0 190 lb male. People were trampling each other,  jumping over barbed wire fences, etc. where did you see that 500 people were shot ? You didn’t. You saw that 500 were injured. And the number was higher than that, that’s just the amount of people that needed hospital treatment that night.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know what I saw. I know there was NOT a helicopter above us, as I already told you, for at least 25 minutes. On the ground, we knew the shots were coming up from high up in the Mandalay Bay. What do you think that guy is flipping off in that now somewhat iconic photo? Does it look to you like he is looking at a helicopter or shooter on the ground? WE KNEW where he was. It was obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why browse conspiracy after if its triggering? I waited til I could handle it, but that doesn’t mean some of these theories aren’t upsetting. I came to find info for myself, see what others are saying, and set the record straight to try and squash the most ridiculous of them (eg. it was a hoax with makeup wounds and speakers)

       I don't take anything as fact simply because A) some anon posted it online B) I want to believe it. Should just take what you say for fact? Or should I maybe continue trying to do relatively unbiased research before prematurely eliminating that hypothesis?

        The best way to "squash" the theory that this is a staged event (with crisis actors, moulage, make-up etc.) would be to explain why obvious crisis actors were interviewed and gave testimony of their version of what happened right after the event. Why use crisis actors if it's not a staged event?

       You never answered my question of what/who you think that guy clearly looking up towards Mandalay Bay? So many videos have people looking up in that direction. Maybe it’s because

       You say this directly after sharing multiple conspiracy YouTube videos as fact, even stating that I probably don’t understand them due to cognitive dissonance.

       I already answered this the best that I could. I don’t know if there were crisis actors there. If there were I don’t know why. The fact is it was not a hoax and I quite frankly don’t give a fuck whether or not you believe that at this point. You seem to be set on your narrative the same way TPTB and MSM is set on theirs. So keep digging your head in the wrong rabbit holes if that’s what you’re set on doing.

       Could have been firing blanks from up there... Just sayin'. There also could have been a shooter or multiple shooters up there as well.

       That's not what I said, bud. You might want to read that comment again. I said: "
       <em>
        if
       </em>
       you had [taken the time to watch those admittedly long videos start to finish], we wouldn't still be having that discussion (unless you've got unreasonable amounts of cognitive dissonance or something)". I was not at all implying that you wouldn't understand them due to cognitive dissonance, nor was I insulting your intelligence. You could be way smarter than me for all I know. If you don't want to spend the few hours it'd take to watch those videos, that's fine, though I still recommend taking a few minutes to watch some of Gene Rosen's material:

       Brian Claypool's testimony, among others, makes it clear that multiple crisis actors interviewed shortly after the event, claimed to have witnessed the attack and or provided assistance to alleged victims. I don't know why either, but I feel that's the million dollar question.

       Man, how am I set on a narrative? We both believe this could be a false flag, and I believe that this being a staged event is
       <em>
        within the realm of possibility
       </em>
       . At no point in our discussion did I say this was the narrative I was set on, nor did I say this was definitely the case. I haven't even completely ruled out the helicopter theory, or an iteration thereof, yet.

       Glad you survived and that you're okay - What a shit thing to have to go through - I think the kind of tenacity and dedication to skepticism you find in this post/thread is a good tool have in society, but I also think it's misplaced on trying to belittle your story. So don't bother arguing with people, it'll will never end with a beneficial conclusion
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole point of skepticism is to challenge "established" facts, to think outside the box, to raise the bar of truth, but when you become such a skeptic that everything is seen as an aggression and you begin to presume truths before you have that bar of evidence you're so passionate about, then you defeat your own point

       No, I actually don’t see that at all seeing as I’ve been on reddit for years and only posted to 3-4 subreddits ever, very very sporadically. Not everybody posts to reddit every day. 
I really hope that you treat ALL these stories, firsthand accounts with the same amount of doubt, and not just those that go against your narrative/ belief.
