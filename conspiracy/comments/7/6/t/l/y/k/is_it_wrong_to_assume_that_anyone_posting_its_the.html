       No, I don't think it is all shills. I had to have a talk with a family member about the importance of recognizing and appreciate the difference between Jews and Zionists. I think there are a lot of ignorant people that aren't able to process that difference.

       I think there are also a lot of people who hate Jews but just
       <em>
        say
       </em>
       "Zionist" when talking to a mixed crowd.  I've even seen a few who forget to do the word-substitution halfway through a rant.
      </p>
      <p>
       They also use anti-Zionism (which is fine) as a gateway-drug to recruit people into legit anti-Semitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       They (the anti-semites ) benefit from the confusion, because when they do this enough then people start to think anti-Zionism is a codeword for anti-Semitism. Thus, all the people who are innocently anti-Zionist feel under attack and start sympathizing with anti-Semites.
      </p>
      <p>
       Likewise, pro-Zionists benefit from the confusion as well, since they get to use accusations of anti-Semitism to silence anti-Zionist critics.
      </p>
      <p>
       It stinks, because bad guys
       <em>
        on both sides
       </em>
       benefit from the terms being muddied.

       The conspiracy "community" has so many walks of life you cannot take what some say and apply a broad brush judgement to everyone. That is how they program us to think and fight among ourselves. No one is looked at as an individual, it is all tribalism and trying to fit people into groups and labels. Divide and conquer is so easy when humans are tribal by nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR: Don't let some people speak for the whole diverse set of beliefs and viewpoints that equate to being the "conspiracy community".

       People who actually say "it's the Jews" or act like cartoonish Nazis are probably shills, to distract from and discredit the people with real criticisms of Israel and the diaspora.

       It's not about Jews vs. Christians or Muslims or blacks vs. whites or men vs. women or left vs. right. It's about the people who control all the money on the world vs the people they enslave. I do think that certain people in the conspiracy community need to realize that a lot of Zionist/globalist theories sound immediately antisemitic and that turns people off from listening to the truth in it. I have friends who can go off for hours about it an honestly have no idea that they are sounding antisemitic they sound.
      </p>
      <p>
       People need to focus more on the business end of these people that have controlled us for the last few thousand years by basic examples of financial domination by certain bloodlines rather than talking about the evil cabal controlling the goys because of the protocols of zion. The fact of the matter is these people are sacrilegious to practically any belief system. They use their religious association to discredit people who speak against them and shouldn't be affiliated with the religion as a whole.

       Just like you cant call a crowd of Muslims, terrorists. You know there is one or two hiding in there, ready to blow up the enitire crowd for there beliefs. Same thing with Zionists. There is always one or two watching the crowd on tv, ready to sell out the entire crowd for their beliefs.

       The truth is the truth, regardless of whether it's racist or not racist. We're searching for the truth, and although I don't believe (((they))) are out to get me or anything, if evidence lead that direction someday I would be honorbound to follow it. Seekers of the truth follow only evidence, and put aside personal feelings of where it leads.

       There's quite a few people here who are genuinely obsessed with Jews, think they are broadly malevolent and/or evil as a people, and blame them for pretty much everything. Maybe there are shills/trolls too, who seek to discredit, but I believe there's also plenty of sincerely antisemitic people and Stormfront types.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hell, I was discussing holocaust revisionism and denial here once and some rando decided to start PMing me for weeks on end to educate me on how Jews were evil. He certainly didn't care to distinguish between Zionists, Jews, Ashkenazi or anything like that. Just a straight-up loonie.

       It depends... I've seen obvious shills vomiting out pure hate-speech/violent rhetoric. IMO, they are clearly shills looking to undermine any/all channels such as this.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the flipside, there are conspiracy theorists that believe in a powerful cabal of people of Jewish descent that have an "illuminati-esque" structure... or even control the Illuminati itself. I.E. Zionists.
      </p>
      <p>
       The latter is a bit more believable, and some even go as far to say that this sect of Judaism aren't technically even "Jews". So... it gets very convoluted from what I can see.
      </p>
      <p>
       My vote is to simply hold those who are guilty, accountable. No matter their race/origin/religion... people who simply yell "It's the Jews!!!" are not to be taken seriously, under any circumstances.

       Yes! There are legitimate conspiracy theories focused on Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes! Certain posts here display Jew-baiting and obnoxious antisemitism that discredits this sub and conspiracy theory in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       On one side, if you care about the intellectual history of humanity, thank a Jew. There are so many incredible contributions through the ages by Jewish thinkers, it boggles the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       From Moses to Einstein, the breadth of insight is extraordinary, and we are all the beneficiaries. Considering Jews have always been a very small proportion of the European and world population, it's amazing.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another side, Jews are significantly over-represented in the top level of three  American sectors: Banking, News, and Entertainment, assuming those last two can be considered separate sectors...
      </p>
      <p>
       Add the potency of political Zionism's unqualified support for Israel, and you have ample running room for valid conspiracy theory that has to make sense of those facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just as conspiracy should have no patience for irrational hatred toward persons of color, conspiracy should not let entrenched antisemitic hatred overshadow the legitimate discussion of all possibilities, wherever that discussion leads.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, every race and ethnicity is prone to, and guilty of, the gross deception and brutal violence that conspiracy enables.

       Agreed. Why not just list a few complicating issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        When you see a really nasty antisemitic post, you have several options: You can agree with it, you can dismiss it as false, or you can wonder whether its main point is to derail r/conspiracy, in which case you sort of agree with it, on the basis that the poster
        <strong>
         knows
        </strong>
        that you will be suspicious that maybe the poster is in fact a Jew - which makes it a pretty devastating tool - if it is a tool.

       That is a perfect representation of the one of the problems. Like my brain can hardly even read that, but I know exactly what you mean, and you are 100% right.

       Part of me wonders if the negative forces for zionism are in no small part encouraging the white supremacists, maybe even running them. Because it
       <em>
        serves
       </em>
       them to be victimized by these racially motivated attack groups. And it brings every conversation down to the discussion of racism, when jewish isn't even a race. It is the biggest mindfuck of all time.

       Right. So if you were Jewish, you would want to have enough persecution to claim a special status, but not so much that the persecution actually persecutes somebody. Fake persecution.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I would have to call myself an antisemite for saying that. But I know I'm not one. I actually have a lot of respect for Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, every group seems to have some kind of game on. So blacks know that they get special treatment because they were slaves and discriminated against, so why would they break out of that stereotype?
      </p>
      <p>
       Asians know people expect they are smart, so they spend a lot of effort trying to live up to the expectation.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I agree with others who are saying basically conspiracy should concentrate on the difference between the Powers That Be and the rest of us poor slobs.

       You do not understand the psychological foundation of the issue, and the in-group out-group mentality that is so dangerous. We are saying it is the jews because it is unironically the jews. Half the reason is because they refuse to acknowledge anything that may deter their own benefits. Like the census from the 1900s showing they refuse to assimilate and introduce artificial markets as a result. They killed all of the anthropology of that time because they wanted to immigrate to the U.S. (Goulde).  All of it is now being rediscovered in genetics and population statistics, and promoted by protected jews like pinker and the coauthor of the bell curve. You are all just too distracted by the flashing lights and boobs to actually look and see you are worshiping pleasure and have zero substance. You think that if you accept everyone else, then you can just lead a lazy existence and no one will question you. It creates a fucking degenerative shield.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tp be clear: no one has ever wanted to kill the jews. Hitler
       <strong>
        evacuated
       </strong>
       them to palestine, then later planned for madisgar before the (((((british)))) took it around 1942. They were expelled over 300 times because no one wanted to kill the jews. You liberal idiots have all just become so self absorbed and physically hurt by words, that we literally cannot explain this without essentially committing suicide. And if you ever took the time to figure out what actually happened on this planet, you would be pretty pissed as well. This is literally the reason the first amendment exists, so you can talk INSTEAD of being violent. But certain people can't over come their egos.

       So you mean that Jews started by saying all races should be equal (by taking down 19th century "racist" anthropology) and then later turned around and showed certain races were more intelligent (Bell Curve)? But wasn't that pretty smart after all, since there are more Jews in America than was left in post-WWII Europe, or are now in Israel? They saw a lifeboat and swam toward it.

       Smart yes, devious, yes as well. You can try to play the Bernard Cohen card of "oh this was all God's plan and we the chosen people do what is needed" nonsense, but they have abused that power, created fake worlds in hollywood and used them to enslave unknowing people playing a different game.

       I think someone is philosophically compromised when they are unable to see situations from many directions. I'm trying to do that in this very weirdly touchy subject area of antisemitism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not disregarding the "coincidences" - I'm seeing them from a different perspective (theirs, for one). I am picking up you only want to see the issue from one standpoint - the one that can explain everything bad that happened in history by pointing to the Jew.
      </p>
      <p>
       You should try a few other villains. What about the Normans - they sure screwed with the Old English. American settlers sure screwed with the Natives. History is full of one tribe screwing another.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most of all, I'm not dismissing that this is something intelligent people can and should talk directly about.

       That is a good definition. By philosophically compromised I mean someone who has come to embrace the primitive and degenerative culture that has sprung up.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is a respectable position, and while I am generally one sided on this topic in conversation I have given thought to this perspective. In a lot of ways I can sympathize, but there is a fundamental flaw that needs to be brought to light. They did not build there city or do the work. They take mid level jobs, and flood the media with their ideas, then move on to the next place when everything falls apart. These stereotypes were based on censuses and statistics, not fabricated. The perceived racism was reactionary. The result of making fish climb trees and deer sleep in the desert is obvious. People are animals and good at different things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Their inability, consciously or otherwise to realize this is ridiculous. Of course the inter fighting between them could create an unintentional projection of deception, but it doesn’t matter. The fact is the majority of media promoting immigration and other communist strategies, jews. Who owns publishing groups for science, jews. Hollywood, jews. Money fabricators, jews. They might unintentionally be inclined to promote liberal policies because of perceived persecution, but with that kind of power, they are not going to help the country they are second citizens to.

       This is also a different kind of warfare, at least it was evident there was some aggression. And as for small pox blankets, not sure they knew what smallpox was then, and that is a rather small scale compared to global control.

       I think a lot of them are. Especially if they're going out of their way to practically yell "I'm an anti-Semite!" without actually adding anything to the discussion. Try to ask yourself if the user is actually trying to participate and add to the conversation or not. That's usually a pretty good indicator as to whether someone is worth engaging with, whether they're a real person or not.
      </p>

       There are real bigoted people who hate Jewish people too though. And some of them are likely very knowledgeable about horrible things that Israel has done. And Israel has done many horrible things, especially their apartheid-like treatment of Arabs in their occupation of Palestine, not to mention sponsoring terrorism too. Not all bigots you see are going to be shills just trying to look bad. Some people are actually bigots who just hate all Jewish people.

       any right minded person knows that racism is not rational.  but you gotta think something is wrong with all the power and money this small clique has and the fact that if you speak about it they can shut you down.   plus palastine and how the media has not told the truth about israels role in the worlds madness.

       I'm not against the idea that there may be a lot of Jewish people in the power clique. What I am against is labeling the clique Jewish. That leads to killing Jews indiscriminately when really we just need to prosecute people who are responsible, regardless or race or ethnicity. Racism blindly makes us blame everyone of a race. And I'm pretty sure that all the Jews I personally know are not complicit in globalism.

       Here's the truth: there's no such thing as a "conspiracy community." The only thing that unites the people on this sub is a distrust of some specific "official story". But you can't buy into
       <strong>
        all
       </strong>
       the conspiracy theories, because many of them contradict each other (especially the politically motivated ones). And, even setting that aside, some conspiracy theories are just way more outlandish than others, and not all of us will buy into just anything. (Like, just because I believe a small group of people covered up one thing, doesn't mean that I'm willing to believe the entire government, or intelligence community, or journalism industry works as a single cohesive unit of conspirators.)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanted to divide us into actual communities, there are all kinds of divisions you could make: people who believe aliens have visited earth, people who believe government officials are lizard people, people who think Lee Harvey Oswald was a patsy, people who think 9/11 was an inside job...there's no particular reason why those four groups should have any overlap at all, or should even get along with each other.
      </p>

       So, yeah, there are some racists on here. They're not shilling, it's what they actually believe.
