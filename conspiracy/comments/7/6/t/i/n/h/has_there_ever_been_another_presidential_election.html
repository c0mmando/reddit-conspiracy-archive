       I mean, he started a national uproar by making a big deal out of the flag, in the middle of Alabama, referring to protesting athletes as "sons of bitches". His attempt to continue the southern strategy with his veiled racism is uncanny. And people are still saying he isn't. The real conspiracy is all these non racist/fascists with black friends and cousins.

       Revolutions cost a lot of money.  There is only one banking family on earth who loans that kind of money for that purpose. And no one can afford the interest.  Why do you think things are all fucked up now?   We are still paying for our last revolution, and civil war.

       Yeah, I was going to tell OP that when Dubya Bush defeated Al Gore in 2000, the butthurt was chronic. 'Popular vote', 'Florida anomalies' 'Hanging chad', 'Supreme Court ultimately decides the winner', and on and on.

        Although Ms. Palin writes that she is “proud of the senator” for being bold enough to put her on the ticket, some of her loudest complaints in this volume are directed at the McCain campaign’s chief strategist, Steve Schmidt. Mr. Schmidt, ironically enough, was one of the aides to most forcefully make the case for putting her on the ticket in the first place, arguing to Mr. McCain, as Dan Balz and Haynes Johnson reported in their recent book, “The Battle for America 2008,” that she would shake up the race and help him get his “reform mojo back.” Over the weekend McCain aides fired back at Ms. Palin: Mr. Schmidt was quoted on Politico.com saying that charges about him were “all fiction.”

       Nope.   Once the Supreme Court ruled he shut his yap and was a man about it.  Besides,  Bush became incredibly popular on 9/11. Just 9 months after taking office.  Everyone just fell in line behind Bush for a few years.

       Has there ever been an election where even a year later the winners kept bringing the loser up on an almost daily basis when the. Winner sticks his foot in his mouth or has a MASSIVE POLICY FAILURE or does anything shady or conspiracy related?

       I came here to say this, it's fucking pathetic honestly. I refuse to visit t_d anymore because I'm sick of seeing such pathetic posts. They never really had good posts, but they're just generally pathetic anymore. I'd love to never hear about Hillary again, and you think in general conservatives would feel the same way.. but they just can't shut up.

       To see what idiots think? I'm a conservative, who doesn't know a single conservative that thinks remotely like that brainwashed place.. Even most actual real life "Trump supporters" are fairly critical of him in their views. They generally are okay with him, very few like him, but absolutely none I know mindlessly support Trump's every move blindly.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what makes what I see in t_d and Twitter so weird.. I know hundreds of people I talk to across the country, even groups on LinkedIn and whatnot, and that behavior just doesn't exist.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if Trump is paying people to worship him online, or if it's actually Russians or other state actors.. but I keep watching because by the day, it becomes more apparent, that what we in the subreddits and other social media.. most of them aren't Americans. There's just no fucking way.
      </p>
      <p>
       So as I and other conservatives I know feel less and less happy with the Trump adminstration, I keep watching these imaginary people who aren't even remotely critical on anything he does.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's entertaining to a degree to see the dumpster fire they're trying to create, constantly bringing up civil war.. which I'm sure no actual American wants.

       Trust me, I've asked many, on all sides, no one has remotely entertained the idea.. but most don't use sites like Reddit, and aren't exposed to what I believe to be a straight up Russian propaganda push. Doesn't matter who's pushing it, they aren't Americans.

       Yeah it's funny because 80% of that sub is reasonable counter arguments to the left. There's a slight strain of stupid Trump worship but very little of it is is novel.

       I think you miss the point. I'm a conservative. They talk about what the left thinks/wants, and what the right thinks/wants.. and they're categorically wrong about both.
      </p>
      <p>
       I talk to conservative friends, a lot of them over time, and I float some of the things they say there, and they looked at me like I'm mad. I've shown a few, most are older and wouldn't use things like Reddit, but I got a few to check it out, and we compare the stupid shit they say and laugh our asses off over whiskey.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Reasonable counter arguments" being talking shit about football players, constantly talking about antifa and Hillary.. you know what isn't on the mind of actual conservatives? Hillary. We laughed at her stupid book, and moved on. It isn't reasonable that they constantly talk about her.
      </p>
      <p>
       They sure as fuck aren't conservatives, but some sick and twisted fucking delusional obsessive morons. You know how many times they've mentioned civil war?

       My buddy showed me this one, he's one of the few I know that uses Reddit.. read this shit, it's insane

       Literally, someone who actually
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a conservative, had to explain to the
       <em>
        "lurkers"
       </em>
       , why no one wants civil war. And the comment section, there's mentally deranged people that respond to every actual American, with "well if it did happen.."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm gonna say, I've talked to and shown plenty, we all agree, whether it's Russia or some other state actor, the majority of those people are
       <em>
        not Americans
       </em>
       . No American
       <em>
        conservative
       </em>
       is going to even mention civil war, we fucking have each branch of the government! I'm definitely not a fan of Trump, but I sure as hell don't see any real people on
       <em>
        either side
       </em>
       that have said anything remotely like things are that bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's that sub, constantly saying "the left want civil war!" Where?! I sure as hell don't see it! They're absolutely fucking full of shit, and I'm sure that sub has a moderator or more from some other country, actively pushing shit
       <em>
        real Americans
       </em>
       don't want.
      </p>
      <p>
       You saying anything about that sub is
       <strong>
        reasonable

       It's not even an argument, you just don't like them. Okay buddy, if only Reagan were president amirite? Old school conservatives don't have any bragging rights. They watched as the debt grew, and their culture became the punchline to a joke, they lost education and the youth - you're a living testament to that. What moral high ground do you think you occupy right now?

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2020 is an ongoing re-election campaign by President of the United States Donald Trump, who took office on January 20, 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump began his campaign unusually early for an incumbent President of the United States. He began spending for his reelection effort within weeks of his election, and officially filed his campaign with the Federal Elections Commission on the day of his inauguration. Since February, Trump has held several rallies and a fundraiser for this campaign. He has visited key electoral states. The campaign has fundraised and run two nationwide advertising campaigns.

It goes all the way back to Aaron Burr, who blamed his loses on smear campaigns, was frequently in news, killed Alexander Hamilton in a duel after losing NY Gov race. Andrew Jackson was mad with the rigged election in 1824, was very vocal about it for 4 years. Goldwater in 1964 blamed his loses on other factors than himself for at least a year. Gore's already been mentioned. When you look at most of the elections in our history, corruption and media manipulation has always played a part. Corporatists like Clinton and Trump are perfect examples of how our political system hasn't progressed since the 1800's.

       Our 2 party political machine certainly operates with division in mind. Our media loves playing up the divisions, because "we" tune in when they do, give ratings to them and more importantly raise money for their sponsors (who in turn sponsor the two party system).

       If you like that, be sure to read at least the first chapter of Edward Bernays'
       <em>
        Propaganda
       </em>
       . It is a small book, and easy read, those who are 'too busy' to read it are not actually interested in research.

       I mean, that's not what OP asked. He didn't say "has there ever been a presidential candidate who lost and was sore about it?". He asked if there's ever been a presidential candidate who won and, a year later, the loser still had full media support as they ranted and raved to the point of embarrassment, in so many words. Good history lesson; bad answer to the given prompt.

       in all fairness, there probably wasn't a correct answer to Bush vs Gore and in my recollection Gore, for the most part, did make peace with it and moved on to Global Warming and stockpiling petroleum products, and of course proving to the world that he was a fool

       What I have to wonder about is has there ever been a presidential election where
       <em>
        both
       </em>
       of the major party candidates were both unashamed crooks, and everyone knew it, and voted for them anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm 60, and can't remember any two-crook elections.  There's always been only zero or one crook... although sometimes the crook did get elected.

        The Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2020 is an ongoing re-election campaign by President of the United States Donald Trump, who took office on January 20, 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump began his campaign unusually early for an incumbent President of the United States. He began spending for his reelection effort within weeks of his election, and officially filed his campaign with the Federal Elections Commission on the day of his inauguration. Since February, Trump has held several rallies and a fundraiser for this campaign. He has visited key electoral states. The campaign has fundraised and run two nationwide advertising campaigns.
