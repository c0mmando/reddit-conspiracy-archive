       I find it quite laughable to be honest. Also, many people who claim to be "African" American, may not even have ties to Africa. DNA Testing for the most part is a fraudulent hoax.

       Isrealites don't identify with what we call Africans today.  They believe Africans sold the Israelites in the slave trade because Africans and Isrealites were different groups of people (Duet 28).  They looked like each other yes hence Moses being able to blend in with Egyptians but not the same group of people.  They kinda agree with you.

       Jews claim Moses from the Old Testament 
Muslims claim Moses from the Old Testament 
Rastafarians claim Moses from the Old Testament 
Christians probably claim him to cause he is painted white in children’s bibles and appears white in Christian documentaries.

       In the Bible Old Testament one of Noah’s sons Ham is depicted as African.

      <p>
       No it doesn't. The OT claims Ham was cursed such that all his descendants would be slaves. Some 17th century religious thinkers and most recently Mormons theorized that this meant they were African based on the slave thing. The Bible does nothing to "depict" Ham as African.

       Two of those religions are offshoots of the first so it's not too surprising.

       Some tribes, not all, and not all their slaveries were permanent. Further, most were based on conquest relations, not "race", a concept Europeans invented during the 17th century.

       The Bible shows zero evidence for it, except for using the most painful and awkward stretches of imagination possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Hebrews aren't even a legitimate "race" in the first place.  They're a mishmash of people who left from Babylon into Canaan after the Persian conquest (just like the modern and fraudulent "Jews".)  They plagiarized and fabricated their history using already-ancient texts from other cultures, like Egypt and Sumer.  A ruling class was born from this lie, and they've used religion and empire to dominate our history, since.

       The Lost Tribe of Dan was reported to have moved from the Mid East westward into West Africa.  Whether they stayed or not is of some question.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Rastas certainly believe themselves to be Israelites through Dan.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think today, the AA community finds commonality among the Israelites around the general idea of diaspora and subjugation, and have thus adopted the actual name (tho maybe not claiming the genealogy?)

       "However, at some point 20% of Kingston's population were Jews of Portuguese-Spanish ancestry, while Spanish Town was founded by escaped Jews.[1] The first Jews landed on the island in 1530 just 40 years after it was discovered by Christopher Columbus. While for a time the Columbus family's rule kept out the Inquisition, when their power was eroded and the Church began threatening the crypto-Jewish populace, they aided the British conquest of the Isle. Under the British, Port Royal Jamaica was home not only to privateers bearing letters of marque for operating against the Spanish, some of whom were Jewish, but was also home to a large Jewish community which economically backed the raids against the Spanish."

       Nothing in the bible is "evidence".  It is a story book mostly made up of older preexisting fables and fear inducing ramblings about an insecure creator and his blue collar "son".

       It wasn't just Europeans who owned slaves ace.  In matter of fact Europeans weren't the first to buy slaves blacks were.  There were much more brutal slavery going on between the Indian tribes here too.  There are more blacks enslaved right now then there were ever under whitey.
