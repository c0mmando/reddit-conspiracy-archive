    <div class="md"><p>Isrealites don&#39;t identify with what we call Africans today.  They believe Africans sold the Israelites in the slave trade because Africans and Isrealites were different groups of people (Duet 28).  They looked like each other yes hence Moses being able to blend in with Egyptians but not the same group of people.  They kinda agree with you.  </p>

<p>Yes DNA testing is BS.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No it doesn&#39;t. The OT claims Ham was cursed such that all his descendants would be slaves. Some 17th century religious thinkers and most recently Mormons theorized that this meant they were African based on the slave thing. The Bible does nothing to &quot;depict&quot; Ham as African.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Two of those religions are offshoots of the first so it&#39;s not too surprising.</p>

<p>Never said that either.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Some tribes, not all, and not all their slaveries were permanent. Further, most were based on conquest relations, not &quot;race&quot;, a concept Europeans invented during the 17th century.</p>

<p>The Hebrews aren&#39;t even a legitimate &quot;race&quot; in the first place.  They&#39;re a mishmash of people who left from Babylon into Canaan after the Persian conquest (just like the modern and fraudulent &quot;Jews&quot;.)  They plagiarized and fabricated their history using already-ancient texts from other cultures, like Egypt and Sumer.  A ruling class was born from this lie, and they&#39;ve used religion and empire to dominate our history, since.</p>

<p>The Rastas certainly believe themselves to be Israelites through Dan.</p>

<p>I think today, the AA community finds commonality among the Israelites around the general idea of diaspora and subjugation, and have thus adopted the actual name (tho maybe not claiming the genealogy?)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_pirates">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_pirates</a></p>

<p>&quot;However, at some point 20% of Kingston&#39;s population were Jews of Portuguese-Spanish ancestry, while Spanish Town was founded by escaped Jews.[1] The first Jews landed on the island in 1530 just 40 years after it was discovered by Christopher Columbus. While for a time the Columbus family&#39;s rule kept out the Inquisition, when their power was eroded and the Church began threatening the crypto-Jewish populace, they aided the British conquest of the Isle. Under the British, Port Royal Jamaica was home not only to privateers bearing letters of marque for operating against the Spanish, some of whom were Jewish, but was also home to a large Jewish community which economically backed the raids against the Spanish.&quot;</p>
