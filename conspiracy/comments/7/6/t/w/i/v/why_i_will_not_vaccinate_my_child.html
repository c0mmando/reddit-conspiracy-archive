        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I am one to believe that vaccines are a way for the big guys to control population and profit off of the onset of future problems. I wanted to post this in a community that would be more in depth to talk about it so I decided to post it here I apologize if it&#39;s more of a nuisance!</p>

<p>Here is a list of some of the damaging ingredients in the vaccines on the market today:</p>

<p>MSG, antifreeze, phenol (used as a disinfectant), formaldehyde (cancer causing and used to embalm), aluminum (associated with alzheimer’s disease and seizures), glycerin (toxic to the kidney, liver, can cause lung damage, gastrointestinal damage and death), lead, cadmium, sulfates, yeast proteins, antibiotics, acetone (used in nail polish remover), neomycin andstreptomycin.  And the ingredient making the press is thimerosol (more toxic than mercury, a preservative still used in many vaccines, not easily eliminated, can cause severe neurological damage as well as other life threatening autoimmune disease). These vaccines are grown and strained through animal or human tissue, like monkey and dog kidney tissue, chick embryo, calf serum, human diploid cells (the dissected organs offorcibly aborted fetuses), pig blood, horse blood and rabbit brain (1, 2).</p>

<p>What’s more, recent vaccine testing results published in January 2017 revealed that ALL of them are contaminated with heavy metals not declared on the ingredients list or in the product leaflets. In another round of vaccine testing conducted in Germany, the vaccines were found to be contaminated with the following:</p>

<p>– ALL vaccines tested contained mercury in small amounts (even the ones that were supposedly “mercury free”).
– Half the vaccines contained toxic, carcinogenic nickel in small amounts.
– Slightly over 1/3 of the tested vaccines contained small amounts of arsenic.
– Over 90% of the tested vaccines contained uranium (yes, the stuff used to make nuclear bombs).
– ALL tested vaccines contain minor traces of aluminum, <em>even if not labeled</em>. Gardasil, Gardasil 9 and Synflorix contain TWICE as much aluminum as indicated.
– The aluminum content in the so-called attenuated vaccines is around 1000-6000X times above the safe limits for drinking water! And these vaccines are supposedly “safer”? By the way, aluminum adjuvants commonly used in vaccines have been identified by immunologists as a trigger for later development of food allergies in children.</p>

<p>Can you imagine injecting this cocktail of poison directly into your child’s tissues? Anyone who thinks that these contaminants even in small amounts are safe especially for a growing child is just plain out of his/her mind. At least if you ate these ingredients, your body would have a chance to detoxify and eliminate them before any permanent damage could be done. But, to inject them deep into the body’s tissues where the toxins are absorbed directly into the blood is the most damaging and lethal approach imaginable. How could anyone especially a doctor possibly think this approach to enhancing immunity to infectious disease is a good idea for the long term health?  </p>

<p> A comprehensive survey of nearly 12,000 children in the USA and Europe was conducted in 2010. The research revealed the truth about the health of vaccinated vs unvaccinated kids. The conclusion? Vaccinated children are more chronically ill than unvaccinated children with rates for autism, ear infections, ADHD, asthma and allergies as much as 30% higher than unvaxed children. source - <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130306034323/http://www.vaccineinjury.info/vaccinations-in-general/health-unvaccinated-children/survey-results-illnesses.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20130306034323/http://www.vaccineinjury.info/vaccinations-in-general/health-unvaccinated-children/survey-results-illnesses.html</a> </p>

<p>Another large comparative study of vaccinated versus unvaccinated children published in May 2017 unearthed similar findings. Source - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170504215400/http://oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U.S.-children.php">https://web.archive.org/web/20170504215400/http://oatext.com/Pilot-comparative-study-on-the-health-of-vaccinated-and-unvaccinated-6-to-12-year-old-U.S.-children.php</a></p>

<p>Research out of Yale and Penn State demonstrated a strong association between vaccination and mental illness in children. 95,000 children were analyzed by the Department of Public Health Science at the Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine and Yale University. A strong association between children receiving vaccinations and then immediate development of brain-related autoimmune and inflammatory disorders: ADHD, OCD, anxiety, depression, bipolar, anorexia, and chronic tic disorder was found.

<p>See I don&#39;t just stop here with not wanting to vaccinate my kid it also goes as far as prescribing him certain medications. Due to the possible limitations it would have on a kid. I&#39;d like to have an actual deep discussion if possible. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh there are lots of studies! But most are crap when you really look at them. For example they don&#39;t use a saline placebo. They&#39;ll give a baby in a third would country a shot of aluminum and growth medium, and compare that to a baby that got the vaccine. </p>

<p>Or they&#39;ll say it&#39;s unethical to do a placebo because kids NEED their vaccines, so they&#39;ll test something like: <em>If we give these babies the hep B vaccine at birth, and these babies hep B at day two, and these at day three, does it make a difference in adverse reaction?</em> Days apart...big whoop Merck. Thanks for the info. </p>

<p><strong>They will NOT study completely unvaccinated kids vs vaccinated for long term effects.</strong> I know this is hard to believe, since we&#39;re continually told that studies prove vaccines don&#39;t cause autism. How else would they know that unless they studied it that way? But they don&#39;t. Their science is shit. Since reddit only reads the abstracts, they all circlejerk about what a great study it was. You get the picture.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am anti vaccine, because pharma and cdc do not deserve any trust...at all. Let me tell you from experience how this is going to go for you. In another year and a half it will be time for pre k to learn social behaviors with his peers. You will realize how important it is for his cognitive development and all that jazz. They have you by the balls. Your child will either be a recluse weirdo at home with one of you two, a grandparent or in school learning all kinds of skills crucial to development.  I put off all shots until mine was over 3 and then over 6 months got up to date. If you are familiar with the cdc whistleblower Thompson what matters most is waiting till they are bigger. What matters more than anything is he be raised with his father and mother together as a unit.  So my advice is wait as long as possible then get caught up for school, oh and put a ring on her dude but don&#39;t buy a diamond they are not rare. I think it will be easier for you to convince her to just wait a bit.  good luck and don&#39;t worry too much.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s shitty advice. I was forced to make a choice, one that went against my better judgement. One of my biggest pet peeves on Reddit is watching how fucking ignorant people are about vaccines how their PR firms work. The CDC and pharma(no difference between the two anymore) have promoted $cience papers that whistle blower after whistle blower have come forward claiming fraud about. They produce shame based memes that are like little thumb drives for morons that plug and program this dunning kruger effect on steroids. The measles part of the mmr2 is only 40-45% effective and claimed to be 95%, a fraud perpetrated against the taxpayers. Parents should be outraged that their child&#39;s safety takes a back seat to profit and monopoly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re saying a lot of people don&#39;t fully understand. Are you a scientist? What makes you worth of understanding over those that have vaccinated their children? If you&#39;re willing to risk the death of your child to prevent autism (which has been proven completely false) then I feel bad for you and your views on autism. </p>

<p>Your mind is clearly made up so this isn&#39;t to dissuade you, it&#39;s more for anyone reading who might still be deciding what&#39;s right for them. There are lots of greedy pharma companies out there that have done questionable things, but as someone who works at a small biotech, working directly with the FDA, I can tell you from first hand experience that the amount of scientific data that a company needs to collect, submit, and have reviewed in order for a product to be approved is incredible in volume and complexity. While more information can and will inevitably be found after a product is approved, vaccines are studied in incredible numbers of subjects even by industry standards. For example the Rotateq vaccine was tested in 73000 infants in a placebo controlled trial. I am working on a rare disease and our trials have less than a hundred subjects. The reviewers at FDA crunched through all the data collected by the sponsor and even ran their own statistical analyses to compare whether they got the same results as the company. It takes hundreds of scientists many many years on both company and regulator sides to draw conclusions on a product. I think the mistrust of the Pharma industry shouldn&#39;t be so broadly applied that folks throw the baby out with the bath water. Medical professionals are trained in medical school to be objective and to evaluate the quality of data provided to them. If you really think doctors are so easily fooled by people in suits with fancy pens, then I challenge you to think about whether they have properly evaluated evidence behind the procedures they use in the ER to save lives, or to diagnose meningitis - I guarantee they are using those same brains to assess evidence on vaccines. Also, the strength of evidence follows a hierarchy that places randomized controlled trials at the top rung of reliability. Case reports and anecdotal evidence are bottom tier. In terms of corruption I do know one thing for a fact - Andrew Wakefield is the one person in the whole vaccine controversy to have unequivocally been shown in the court of law to have taken money from lawyers to draw a connection between autism and MMR, to have conducted a &#39;trial&#39; with invasive testing without the oversight of an ethics board, and to be stripped of his license for bad science.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The roto vaccine is good sir. Maybe that explains why your child got sick. Did he not receive an oral dosage?</p>

<p>&quot;Both Rotavirus vaccine are administered orally, by putting drops in the infant’s mouth. Each requires multiple doses:</p>

<p>RotaTeq® (RV5) is given in three doses, one dose at 2 months, 4 months, and 6 months of age.
Rotarix® (RV1) is given in two doses, one dose at 2 months and 4 months of age.&quot;</p>

<p>This study found that when you compare the First World nations, the more vaccine a country gives to it&#39;s children, the worse the infant mortality rate.</p>

<p>Infant mortality rates regressed against number of vaccine doses routinely given</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I just had my first child almost 8 months ago.  I was fairly new to the conspiracy mindset and had only been reading into pros and cons of vaccination for a month or so prior to her birt.  My initial choice was going to be to opt out of vaccination (at least in the beginning until i could further research the topic) and revisit it later in my daughters life.  Well, things did not turn out the way i had planned to say the least...</p>

<p>The amount of push youll receive is INSANE.  Child protection services are very involved in the back end, seeing that each child registered as a citizen is making and following scheduled doctors visits and medical appointments.  Thats all fine and well, the issue comes with these appointments themselves.  The doctors and medical professionals make it EXTREMELY hard as a new parent to opt out or even slow the roll of the medical procedures their guidelines entail.  </p>

<p>Im not sure this is standard protocol, but with my case having CPS involved initially (due to unrelated matters) made it very difficult to choose to delay vaccination.  Anyone i came across where i was questioning the idea of vaccinating, were sure to make me out to look like an irresponsible and uninformed parent.</p>

<p>Just letting you know, the amount of flakk is something youll want to be ready for, otherwise its easy to crumble under the mounting shame</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1901
Mosquito Control Efforts Reduce Disease Cases</p>

<p>With the approval of Walter Reed (his commanding officer), Chief Sanitary Officer Dr. William Crawford Gorgas began to study the effects of removing the Aedes aegypti mosquito population on yellow fever rates. He started his work in Havana in February: workers drained or covered open water containers and fumigated areas to kill adult mosquitoes. Yellow fever cases began to drop, and by October, none were reported. Reports of malaria dropped as well.</p>

<p>By the time laboratory medicine came effectively into the picture the job had been carried far toward completion by the humanitarians and social reformers of the nineteenth century . . . When the tide is receding from the beach it is easy to have the illusion that one can empty the ocean by removing the water with a pail.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– René Dubos (1901–1982), Mirage of Health, 1959</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There was a continuous decline, equal in each sex, from 1937 onward. Vaccination [for whooping cough], beginning on a small scale in some places around 1948 and on a national scale in 1957, did not affect the rate of decline if it be assumed that one attack usually confers immunity, as in most major communicable diseases of childhood . . . With this pattern well established before 1957, there is no evidence that vaccination played a major role in the decline in incidence and mortality in the trend of events.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I to chose an alive child, which is why we chose selective vaccinations. Because I prefer not only an alive child but a HEALTHY child. Which ever side of the issue you are on make sure 1. You are very educated with your choices, and 2. You are ok with the list above being injected into your child. If you wouldn&#39;t hand them a cup of those toxic  chemicals to drink then why would put it in a syringe and inject it into them?
Kids who are on a regular vax schedule are 30% more chronically I&#39;ll, physically and mentally. When Japan raised it&#39;s minimum vax age to 2 years old infant mortality plummeted to such low levels that Japan now has the lowest infant mortality rate in the western world!
In the UK they won&#39;t even require the chicken pox vaccine bcz they found it to be so harmful. Not to mention the # of vaccines that have already been removed from the market because of serious illness, injury or death... I.e. Lyme disease vax with problems like incurable arthritis to severe neurological impairment. The Rotovirus vaccine was removed in 1999 due to life threatening bowel obstruction. Also the gardasil vaccine for young girls... That recalled 743,000 vaccines due to fainting, paralysis, slurred speech. </p>

<p>Just remember you can always get vaccinated but you can NEVER un do a vaccination. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How Much US Pediatricians Make From Vaccines</p>

<p>&quot;So how much money do doctors really make from vaccines? The average American pediatrician has 1546 patients, though some pediatricians see many more. The vast majority of those patients are very young, perhaps because children transition to a family physician or stop visiting the doctor at all as they grow up. As they table above explains, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays pediatricians $400 per fully vaccinated child. If your pediatrician has just 100 fully-vaccinated patients turning 2 this year, that’s $40,000. Yes, Blue Cross Blue Shield pays your doctor a $40,000 bonus for fully vaccinating 100 patients under the age of 2. If your doctor manages to fully vaccinate 200 patients, that bonus jumps to $80,000. V But here’s the catch: Under Blue Cross Blue Shield’s rules, pediatricians lose the whole bonus unless at least 63% of patients are fully vaccinated, and that includes the flu vaccine. So it’s not just $400 on your child’s head–it could be the whole bonus. To your doctor, your decision to vaccinate your child might be worth $40,000, or much more, depending on the size of his or her practice.</p>

<p>If your pediatrician recommends that your child under the age of 2 receive the flu vaccine–even though the flu vaccine has never been studied in very young children and evidence suggests that the flu vaccine actually weakens a person’s immune system over the long term–ask yourself: Is my doctor more concerned with selling me vaccines to keep my child healthy or to send his child to private school?&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s Blue Cross Blue Shield who pay the money as a bonus.</p>

<p>Vaccines are a big growth area for the pharmaceuticals, they don&#39;t need to invest much in testing as the vaccines skip the majority of testing which drugs have to go through, they don&#39;t have to market them as they can simply lobby the CDC to put them in the schedule.  </p>

<p>&quot;The global market for vaccines may only comprise about 2% to 3% of the total pharmaceuticals market but this sector has, and continues to experience a stellar growth rate of 10% to 15% per year versus the 5% to 7% seen in the overall market, according the World Health Organization (WHO). Totaling just US$5 billion in 2000, today the global vaccine market is worth an estimated $24 billion and is projected to rise to $100 billion by 2025.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, HPV and mass Flu vaccinations are driving growth, the ones on the schedule also make good money.  Especially with Big Pharma immune from paying out compensation for vaccine injuries.</p>

<p>No they don&#39;t. BCBS doesn&#39;t make vaccines. So you have an incentive structure where they pay $400 to then have to pay around $1100 to vaccine manufacturers and clinic staff. This is done to cut the costs of covering treatment of the awful and expensive diseases being vaccinated for. That&#39;s how they get their money back.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Mild short-term childhood viruses are nothing to worry about and mostly require no treatment whatsoever, as the immune system takes care of situation single-highhandedly.</p>

<p>However the serious long-term diseases which vaccines cause, such as MS, Diabetes Type 1, Epilepsy etc, these do require drug treatments, the sicker a population becomes the more treatments they require and hence the higher insurance payments the population will pay, so that is why doctors are incentivized to push vaccines so fiercely, as by poisoning as many people as possible, then the bigger the industry grows as the population becomes sicker, and hence the bigger the health insurance industry grows and profits.</p>

You can argue that it causes autism all day, but you can&#39;t say it doesn&#39;t save lives. It prevents diseases and that&#39;s a fact, maybe a side effect is autism but that doesn&#39;t change the fact it prevents illness.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t bother linking any pro-vaccine studies because you&#39;re obviously convinced their falsified to perpetuate vaccine sales, so it&#39;d be pointless. Which ironically actually makes you the one plugging your ears and shouting fake news. And at any rate I&#39;m sure you could find them if yourself if you were actually interested in an honest understanding of vaccines. But there&#39;s nothing they can say to convince you because you&#39;ve convinced yourself they&#39;re lying.

<p>Essentially since it takes so long to test them, they&#39;re released before these tests are completed, the producers tacking on a <a href="https://i.imgur.com/DaYFg7u.png">disclaimer</a> at an attempt to cover their asses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1st off no I don&#39;t expect anyone to agree with me as if you read through the thread you will clearly see that many people don&#39;t agree. 
Now on to it being a big leap tell me how science and statistical evidence wouldn&#39;t show this... [Technavio, one of the leading technology research and advisory companies in the world predicts that pharmaceutical corporations who produce vaccines will reach an estimated $61 billion in profits by 2020.] <a href="https://www.globalresearch.ca/big-pharma-and-big-profits-the-multibillion-dollar-vaccine-market/5503945">https://www.globalresearch.ca/big-pharma-and-big-profits-the-multibillion-dollar-vaccine-market/5503945</a>  and do you also mean to tell me that these same companies that the vaccines don&#39;t profit off of the drugs that treat and help with issues such as 
autism, ear infections, ADHD, asthma and allergies? Cause if these people aren&#39;t making any money then by golly Mrs Molly I&#39;m just gullible.</p>

<p>And yes my mind is set up that&#39;s a fact but I posted this so others could actually discuss it not just agree with me lmao you know be informational! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Of course you want people to agree with you.  You&#39;re making this huge leap that Big Pharma decided to eradicate childhood diseases so they could make more money off treating autism, etc., but you forget the fact of how much money they could make if polio made a resurgence.  People would be willing to spend a ton of money to cure the paralysis in their children.</p>

<p>Just 50 years ago, smallpox was still killing 15 million a year, having killed at least 300 million during the 19th century.  Why?  Vaccination.  The disease was eradicated because of vaccination.</p>

<p>The reality is, there&#39;s a resurgence of autoimmune disorders because children&#39;s immune systems don&#39;t have enough to do, but that&#39;s not a plan, that&#39;s an unintended consequence.  Yes, children should not be dying of peanut allergies, but it&#39;s not because of chemicals.</p>

<p>Oh, and the autism thing was debunked long ago with the fraudulent Andrew Wakefield.  It&#39;s just because some diagnoses have been more refined.  I went to school 30+ years ago that would be diagnosed autistic now but they just called them &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;retarded.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t matter how you feel about vaccines because the government and big pharma have already colluded and made it a crime to not vaccinate.</p>

<p>Informed Consent no longer applies because you don’t have a choice.</p>

<p>If you don’t vaccinate you can be arrested and your children can be taken by CPS. Then they will strap your child down and vaccinate them anyways.</p>

<p>If you don’t vaccinate, your child can not attend school. The Government has succeeded in turning all of your friends and neighbors into Agent Smiths who will pop up and defend vaccinations, chastise and shame you as a tin foil hat wearing anti-vaxxer. They will even report you to CPS.</p>

<p>If you do vaccinate and your child is injured, you have 3 years to have your case heard in Vaccine Court. You can not sue the vaccine manufacturer. Damages are capped and pharmaceutical companies are not liable. US Taxpayers pay all damages.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, you will not be arrested if you don&#39;t vaccinate.  Yes, your child will probably not be able to attend school, but no one can stop you from home schooling.</p>

<p>The school system has decided that protection of children is more important than the feelings of a few parents.  It&#39;s not necessarily altruistic, but there&#39;s concerns about lawsuits.</p>

<p>Michigan Mom jailed for not vaccinating her child.</p>

<p><a href="http://people.com/human-interest/michigan-mom-jailed-after-refusing-vaccinate-9-year-old-son/">http://people.com/human-interest/michigan-mom-jailed-after-refusing-vaccinate-9-year-old-son/</a></p>

<p>This is increasingly the direction that the Government is moving in which means you have no choice anymore. You HAVE to vaccinate your children. The vaccine court has paid out over $3.5 billion dollars in damages, that means that vaccines were proven to have caused thousands of children to get sick with life long illnesses yet you no longer have the choice to refuse.</p>

<p>I would hate to be a parent and have to make that choice.</p>

<p>Herd Immunity is a THEORY. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>an immunologic idea, but rather an epidemiologic construct, which theoretically predicts successful disease control when a certain pre-calculated percentage of people in the population are immune from disease.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll need to give the school a written form explaining your religious or philosophical objection to immunizing your child. Sometimes a simple letter will do, other times you may need a special form from the local school district or department of education.</p>

<p>It&#39; possible that the school won&#39;t honor your objection. A letter from your lawyer explaining your legal right to object should solve the problem. In extreme situations, parents have fought their local school districts in court to gain or uphold their right to keep their child from being vaccinated.</p>

<p>&quot;the marginal advantages of the vaccine in children over one year of age have to be offset against adverse effects of the vaccine itself, which are very common indeed and may be followed occasionally by irreversible brain damage, paralysis and mental deficiency. Because of this danger, or for fear of it, many parents and doctors are reluctant to vaccinate their children.&quot;</p>

<p>Key quotes below:-</p>

<p>Dr. Johnston, pg. 14-15 &amp; 19-20: &quot;The data on its toxicity (shows) it can cause neurologic and renal toxicity, including death.”</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 24: &quot;There are just a host of neurodevelopmental data that would suggest that we’ve got a serious problem.&quot; .... &quot;the potential for aluminum and central nervous system toxicity was established by dialysis data. To think there isn’t some possible problem here is unreal.”</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 31: &quot;we have found statistically significant relationships between the exposure and outcomes for these different exposures and outcomes.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Verstraeten, pg. 44: &quot;Now for speech delays, which is the largest single disorder in this category of neurologic delays. The results are a suggestion of a trend with a small dip. The overall test for trend is highly statistically significant above one.”</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 113: &quot;So we are asking people who have a great job protecting this information up until now, to continue to do that until the time of the ACIP meeting. So to basically consider this embargoed information.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Johnson, pg. 198: &quot;This association leads me to favor a recommendation that infants up to two years old not be immunized with Thimerosal containing vaccines if suitable alternative preparations are available.” ... &quot;I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on.&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Weil, pg. 207: &quot;The number of dose related relationships are linear and statistically significant. You can play with this all you want. They are linear. They are statistically significant.</p>

<p>Dr. Brent, pg. 229 &quot;we are in a bad position from the standpoint of defending any lawsuits&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Clements, pg 247- 249: &quot;that I am very concerned that this has gotten this far, and that having got this far, how you present in a concerted voice the information to the ACIP in a way they will be able to handle it and not get exposed&quot;</p>

<p>Dr. Bernier, pg. 256: &quot;just consider this embargoed information, if I can use that term, and very highly protected information&quot;</p>

A  few  pub lished studies have assessed shedding by healthy adult contacts of  OPV  recipients,  but  most  of  these  studies  were  limited  to  8  weeks  after  vaccination,  possibly  missing  transmissions  that  occurred later &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Furthermore, while India has been polio-free for a year, there has been a huge increase in non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (NPAFP). In 2011, there were an extra 47,500 new cases of NPAFP. Clinically indistinguishable from polio paralysis but twice as deadly, the incidence of NPAFP was directly proportional to doses of oral polio received. Though this data was collected within the polio surveillance system, it was not investigated. The principle of primum-non-nocere was violated. The authors suggest that the huge bill of US$ 8 billion spent on the programme, is a small sum to pay if the world learns to be wary of such vertical programmes in the future.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alright I&#39;m going to very carefully go through your entire post and teach you why it&#39;s wrong.</p>

<p>First up is where you&#39;re incorrect, uninformed or deliberately deceptive on your list of &quot;harmful&quot; ingredients.</p>

<p>MSG is used in certain vaccines. Its purpose is to keep the vaccine viable when it&#39;s exposed to different conditions, such as light. MSG is also found in several other things. Probably the one most humans are familiar with is the tomato, where it is found in higher amounts than in a vaccine. MSG is actually incredibly common in foods, especially at different &quot;Asian&quot; restaurants, where it is often used to enhance flavours. MSG has not been found to be toxic at any reasonable dose, you probably eat it in soups, fruits and vegetables and different dishes every single day. MSG is not a toxic substance, there is no reason to list it as harmful unless you&#39;re suggesting one may want to eat a vaccine because of how good it tastes and accidentally eat the syringe. I&#39;m hopeful you find that possibility as ludicrous as I do.</p>

<p>Antifreeze is a generic term but it is most often made from ethylene glycol. Ethylene glycol is dangerous and should not be consumed. Ethylene glycol is also not an ingredient in vaccines. An ingredient that is often found in vaccines is polyethylene glycol. Polyethylene glycol, if you haven&#39;t taken chemistry, is not he same substance as ethylene glycol. It is also used as a purifier in antifreeze but is actually not toxic. It is found in vaccines, toothpaste, lotion, beauty products and skin care products. It is once again not toxic, and is not antifreeze (though it is sometimes used in antifreeze as well). If you wish to avoid exposure to polyethylene glycol, a non-toxic substance you will need to avoid brushing your teeth and taking care of your skin.</p>

<p>Phenol (carbolic acid) is used in the production of plastics and numerous other products such as nylon. It&#39;s also used in the production of herbicides and a countless list of pharmaceutical drugs. Carbolic acid is not used as a disinfectant in vaccines it is actually used as a preservative in some vaccines. To avoid exposure to phenol you will need to avoid sunscreen, mouthwash, lozenges and other throat pain relieving substances. Phenol is used as a preservative in three vaccines: Pmeumovax 23, Typhum Vi and ACAM2000. Phenol at the dosage found in those vaccines does not affect humans, in the same way sunscreen, mouthwash and hard candies do not affect humans.</p>

<p>Formaldehyde is a carcinogen (causes a higher likelihood of cancer). Formaldehyde is also a chemical produced in the human body, starting before birth. The concentration of formaldehyde found in human infants is several orders of magnitude higher than the amount present in a vaccine. The formaldehyde in a vaccine is broken down and metabolized completely within 30 minutes of an injection. Due to the human body producing formaldehyde on it&#39;s own, formaldehyde concentration where a vaccine would be administered is over 100 times higher than the amount added by a vaccine. That&#39;s not saying the whole human body produces 100 times more formaldehyde than a vaccine, that&#39;s saying just the injection site and affected parts of the body alone have over 100 times the formaldehyde than is found in a vaccine. To avoid your exposure to formaldehyde in higher doses than are found in vaccines you will need to avoid wearing clothes produced using modern means, automobiles, airplanes, trains, carpets, paints, foaming soaps, wart treatments, any disinfectant cleaner such as Mister Clean or Oxyclean, treatment for infections, any farm animal and any farm animal feed, funeral homes, hospitals, going outside, embalmers, museums, photography dark rooms and people who develop photos, as well as developed photos, home insulation, the air in cities which have home insulation, workers in any industrial factory, fires which burn wood, plywood and particle boards, varnishes, floor polish, and finally; buildings. With so many things which expose you to higher does of formaldehyde than vaccines it must seem odd that a toxic substance is so prevalent. Formaldehyde is not classified as a toxic substance, it is actually non-toxic and safe to consume in amounts above several millilitres. It is not dangerous and only a carcinogen when it is breathed in on a daily basis in high amounts, far higher than the amounts produced by the human body and therefore even more higher than the amounts found in vaccines, such as the amounts that factory workers and embalmers are exposed to. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aluminium is an incredibly common metal, used in the construction of numerous products from window frames to airplanes. It is not an ingredient of vaccines. Aluminium salts such as aluminium hydroxide, aluminium phosphate and potassium aluminium phosphate. If you have any chemical learning you will understand that those substances are not aluminium. If you were to separate the molecules of these salts you would find yourself holding an invisible to the naked eye &lt;1 mg. Aluminium is present in the human body in naturally higher quantities by several orders of magnitude than is found in the aluminium salts found in vaccines. Aluminium was associated by the public with Alzheimer&#39;s disease and seizures, there is no causal link between aluminium and those maladies, that is incorrect and has been known for some time. An average infant will drink more than eight times the amount of aluminium found in a vaccine in its first six months from breast milk.</p>

<p>Glycerol (glycerin, glycerine) is found in foods as a sweetener, thickening agent and sometimes just a filler for low-fat foods. It is an incredibly common sugar substitute and is less damaging than regular sugar. Every diabetic in the world avoids damage from glycerol because it is once again, not toxic. It is found in most pharmaceutical products and, if you wish to avoid a dosage of sweetener higher Han any you will ever be able to match from vaccines you should know that ultrasounds often use glycerol. Glycerol is sweetener, found in nearly every piece of baking and fruit in the world. It is as dangerous as regular sugars, pepper flakes and table salt. The most damage it can do to a human is cause obesity, just like anything else that tastes good. Eating a plate of cookies with your hands will cause you to absorb more glycerol through your skin than you would receive from a vaccine. Not a problem though because glycerol isn&#39;t dangerous to humans, and an infant will have received more of it from their umbilical cord than they&#39;ll ever get from a vaccine. </p>

<p>Lead is not an ingredient of vaccines.</p>

<p>Cadmium is not an ingredient of vaccines. </p>

<p>There are thousands upon thousands of different types of sulphates in the world. In food, oceans, animals people and the ground. Calling sulphates dangerous is akin to saying water has molecules and molecules are dangerous.</p>

<p>Yeast proteins are food. Unless you stop eating grains you won&#39;t stop being exposed to yeast proteins. Yeast is not a toxic substance.</p>

<p>Antibiotics are sometimes found in vaccines. Antibiotics are not toxic. They are used for one thing, killing bacteria to get rid of disease. Why are they considered by you?</p>

<p>Acetone is once again produced by the human body in higher quantities than those found in vaccines. Acetone is a common food additive, likely eaten by people on a weekly or even daily basis. Once again in higher amounts than are in a vaccine. It is not toxic in vaccines, just as it is not toxic in food.</p>

<p>Thiomersal (thimerosal for Americans, thimerosol for no one) is not more toxic than mercury. It is used in many vaccines because it is not dangerous. I&#39;m not sure what &quot;not easily eliminated&quot; means. Not easily eliminated from vaccines? Thiomersal-free alternatives are available for every vaccine, only multi-vial vaccines do not have that option because it would be unsafe and irresponsible for them to not have thiomersal. Thiomersal does not cause neurological damage and has never been shown to. Thiomersal does not cause autoimmune diseases and has never been shown to. Thiomersal is not a preservative, it is used to keep viruses in vaccines inactive. I would point to more reasons why considering thiomersal toxic is incorrect but since vaccines are always available which are thiomersal-free I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary. If you don&#39;t want thiomersal in your vaccine just get a vaccine which doesn&#39;t have thiomersal. </p>

<p>Vaccines are actually commonly produced using viruses grown from human cells due to worries that animal tissue cells would have a higher chance of allowing for disease transmission. </p>

<p>Contaminants in vaccines are incredibly low due to being produced in sterile environments. Contaminants are by their nature everyday chemicals which make are present in sterile environments. This means that every contaminant you go on to list would be found in the air outside in higher quantities than could be found in a vaccine. Even wearing a gas mask would expose you to contaminants due to no environment being completely sterile. As soon as something touches air it could be considered contaminated. Keep that in mind for every item on this list. The contaminants on this list are as dangerous, in fact they are less dangerous than the contaminants one ingests by breathing.</p>

<p>You say vaccines all have mercury, even ones which are mercury-free. This is odd, since all vaccines are mercury-free, mercury is not an ingredient of vaccines, much like lead, cadmium and aluminium.</p>

<p>Nickel is found in coins, wires, metal, buildings in general and all over. It is not toxic in contaminant sizes which is why you don&#39;t have nickel-poisoning from handling money.</p>

<p>Are you implying that vaccines are explosive? Not just explosive but capable of a nuclear detonation? Uranium is not the only component to a nuclear bomb. A component of nuclear bombs which is found in much larger quantities is water. </p>

<p>Aluminium is the third most common element, it would be incredible if it wasn&#39;t a common contaminant. Once again handling money would result in a human having more aluminium contamination than would be found in a sterile environment. Aluminium is also not listed as an ingredient for any vaccine. Perhaps you meant aluminium salts, which would be even less noteworthy because it would mean you&#39;re shocked that a non-toxic ingredient used in vaccines which is microscopically small is present in a slightly higher quantity. That wouldn&#39;t be dangerous, it wouldn&#39;t even change a single property of the vaccine.</p>

<p>How do you know what aluminium adjutants are if you think pure aluminium is an ingredient of vaccines. Aluminium salts are not in a concentration higher than what is considered safe for drinking water. They aren&#39;t even higher if you consider the entirety of the salt to be pure aluminium, which is insane on its own but still wouldn&#39;t match your conclusion. </p>

<p>Aluminum adjutants are not considered a cause of childhood food allergies, they are considered an indicator of allergies to aluminium later in life. </p>

<p>Nothing you listed is poisonous, and to claim that a substance is toxic at any dose is absurd. That would make every material in the known universe toxic, as every material in the known universe is dangerous to humans at a high enough dose. The body metabolizes all ingredients of a vaccine, much like it metabolizes all things which are absorbed through skin. If vaccines were as toxic as actual toxic materials, bleach for example, the lethality would not be changed on the slightest if the substance was injected or ingested. It is thought that vaccines are a good approach for managing viral diseases as well as a good idea for long term health is because doctors are often aware of the fact that vaccines have proven effective at immunizing against viral diseases and that there are zero long term consequences to vaccination.</p>

<p>The survey conducted by vaccineinjury.org was actually not a scientific survey. It was not published, was found to be incorrect and was retracted, hence why you only see it on an archived web page. Odd that you failed to notice it&#39;s retraction. </p>

<p>This study was also retracted. Why are you citing studies which were retracted for being manipulated and for having lying responses? You do understand what a retraction is, right?</p>

<p>All it takes to see you&#39;re lying is reading the abstract. This study looked for a temporal link, it did not find a causal link. This study did not find higher rates of these illnesses in vaccinated individuals, your own source contradicts you.</p>

<p>Since you requested a deep discussion I hope you respond to my points.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh there are lots of studies! But most are crap when you really look at them. For example they don&#39;t use a saline placebo. They&#39;ll give a baby in a third would country a shot of aluminum and growth medium, and compare that to a baby that got the vaccine. </p>

<p>Or they&#39;ll say it&#39;s unethical to do a placebo because kids NEED their vaccines, so they&#39;ll test something like: <em>If we give these babies the hep B vaccine at birth, and these babies hep B at day two, and these at day three, does it make a difference in adverse reaction?</em> Days apart...big whoop Merck. Thanks for the info. </p>

<p><strong>They will NOT study completely unvaccinated kids vs vaccinated for long term effects.</strong> I know this is hard to believe, since we&#39;re continually told that studies prove vaccines don&#39;t cause autism. How else would they know that unless they studied it that way? But they don&#39;t. Their science is shit. Since reddit only reads the abstracts, they all circlejerk about what a great study it was. You get the picture.</p>
