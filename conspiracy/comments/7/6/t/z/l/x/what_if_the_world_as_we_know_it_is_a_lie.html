       What if Earth is just a prison. What if we were just put on this Planet because Aliens knew we're such a toxic race they knew put us on this planet to rot, as a prison if you will.
      </p>
      <p>
       It explains why we haven't made contact nor why we've no planet other than Earth (I'm not talking drones) Because we're in prison, Think of how Alcatraz is so secluded from a place because it's a prison, what if earth is that?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if part of Adam and Eve was somewhat true, but it was a experiment of somesorts by aliens to see if we could make our own race and we would end up in time destroying it. It makes sense to think that was the start of it all, aliens wiping our memory to see what we can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is in the wrong place I apologize but I really feel it's true.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL:DR Earth is a Prison, aliens sent us here as a experiment to see if we would end up killing each other.

       What is "evidence" mean to you? A common misconception I find is that for something to be "the truth" it needs evidence. The reality is that real truth doesn't, it stands on it's own. Everyone deep down has their own truth that resonates and will reveal itself to them if one seeks, it's up to you to find it.

       You're completely correct that even though something has no evidence it doesn't mean it isn't real. It just means we need to investigate more and prove why you think the way that you do. It's ok if you believe in conspiracies without "proof", you're doing a disservice to yourself though in not accepting the fact that there isn't any proof for what you're saying.

       You are not wrong but you are assuming this prison is that of Earth. The first step to escaping is realizing you are in the prison. The second step is planning an escape and to do that you have to know why you and others are in it.

       Yes and those are all small parts of something much larger. It's not hocus pocus at all. Prisoners are in prison for a reason much like each of us is here for a reason.

        What if part of Adam and Eve was somewhat true, but it was a experiment of somesorts by aliens to see if we could make our own race and we would end up in time destroying it. It makes sense to think that was the start of it all, aliens wiping our memory to see what we can do.

       According to Assassin's Creed lore (which is filled to the brim with Freemason 'illuminati' stuff), the Annunaki aka 'those who came before' created humankind as slaves (here's where the evolution theory fits in) - Adam and Eve were hybrids and they've escaped the 'prison' - freeing more prisoners and starting humankind as we know it today.

       Wow that's extremely accurate to what I have found to be the case, it's crazy when multiple unrelated sources tell you the same thing... The only thing is missing is what/who helped Adam and Eve escape and what they escaped from.

         How? By stealing the Apple of Eden - a mind-controlling device. The apple could be compared to the mind-controlling media we have today, people have blind faith in anything they see and so their behaviour is being manipulated... aware or unaware of it.

       You are right and wrong at the same time. Eden was a labour camp, but why it existed on the other hand ultimately is not what you think. The Apple of Eden was not a mind control device as you say, rather it was a state of heightened consciousness, the "christ" consciousness if you will. And who is it that taught us this consciousness? I'll leave that one for you to answer.

       i dont dismiss any idea.  i like this and have pondered it myself.  What if we are here to be farmed, in prison, an experiment? i was thinking of the pyramids on mars and how they line up similar to those in egypt.  what if we started on mars but destroyed it and we were given a 2nd chance( earth) and it seems were blowing this chance too...

       What if we were captured, blinded, trapped, memories wiped, and then convinced that we we're something we aren't.  An alien presence keeps us in a state of arrested development, and only gives us the technology which can be used to forever enslave us, providing them with a self sustaining source of energy for ages?  They lead us to murder each other, separate from each other, and even facilitate our own destruction via their constant manipulations.  Not to kill us all off, but to keep us at manageable numbers, so we can be most effectively exploited.

       Yes, but the prison would have to be fairly sophisticated given that you wouldn't want the deity to just think itself back out again. You'd have to come up with a really good way to fuck with its mind and then make sure it's mind stays good and fucked with indefinitely.

       That's why I think we're at a very interesting point, currently.  The Internets we've been given is meant to enslave and surveil us, but at this early point in its development, it gives us truly amazing instant access to information from all around the world, on a sprawling array of topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       In previous eras, one would have to spend months/years/lifetime travelling around the world to various libraries and temples to learn, while we have the ability to search it up in minutes/hours/days.  Sure, it's mixed with crazy amounts of disinfo, propaganda, and such, but there's still a lot of gold mixed in with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm trying to learn as much as I can, while I can, and I hope others do too.  Using it just for porn/shopping/news is such a spectacular waste of this opportunity we have, as "humanity".  In coming decades, it will probably be locked down and astroturfed to the same level as the rest of our "mainstream" media's and institutions.

       The human race is capable of much more than we currently know. The reason we are so lost on earth is because our history, our true nature, and our beliefs about what earth is, are keeping us from Knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is true the masses have been indoctrinated with beliefs, not knowledge. There is a difference. So yes we are in a sort of mental prison where our beliefs cast a veil over reality keeping us from self knowledge. Once you know yourself you are free from it.  And you want others to be free from their self imprisonment. But this takes a total overhaul of perception any many would rather stay I that nice cozy prison they have made than attempting a jail break.

       It is a prison, and this world is straight up slavery. Nobody even owns anything...sure you can have a house on a plot of land, but what happens if you don't pay taxes? You get it taken away. Tax included into gas prices, tax for certain groceries, taxes taken out of your paycheck, land tax, alcohol tax, tobacco tax. Taxes for freaking everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is prison and we are slaves. When we die we just shoot back into another body to start the process all over again. We definitely are trapped here. This is accomplished with magnetics. Read the story of Osiris, Set, and Isis- it explains it a little. Set figured out how to trap Osiris (and all of us) keeping us locked here in this coffin called Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The key out of here are the chakras, these are the 7 seals of revelation, the book of life is you. You are the temple built without hands. The seven energy centers can be accessed while in a trance state (body asleep/mind awake). But whatever you discover, might as well keep it to yourself- nobody will believe you. God chose the foolish things of the world to smite the proud. Keep an open mind and no stone will be left un-turned.

       I feel the world COULD be free if it wasn't due to humans inherently falling into the traps layed for us by the parasites that be, such as complacency and submissiveness. Should have started organizing and hanging bitches a looooong time ago and I don't think we would be in this mess.

       My .02 is that we've failed as a species multiple times and this place is an anomaly in the universe. Reincarnation is real and not anything like the karma based shit that regional planetary deities have espoused. Judging by the way things look here it's probably going to fail again for another cycle and we'll probably all be back in some role until shit gets sorted out. This place is special and terrible all at once.

       If it's a prison, then whatever. I love it here, there's so much beauty, so many great people, and so many interesting things to learn.
      </p>

       If it feels like a prison to you, then I feel very sad for you. Life is what you make it, of you're miserable try and make a change. Get out of your rut and try and enjoy it.
