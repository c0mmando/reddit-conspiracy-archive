       I see a lot of people on here claiming the Russian investigation is some sort of desperate attempt by the left or the deep state to take down Trump. While this may actually be true, I think I've seen enough evidence to actually warrant an investigation. Manafort's and Flynn's ties are undeniable and the Veselnitskaya meeting clearly showed attempts gain dirt of Clinton with the Russian assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have an open mind and pretty independent political views. So I'm hoping anyone with a different opinion can give me a thoughtful answer rather than just claim it's all a hoax because Alex Jones said so.

       But they were doing this while they had a campaign manager who worked for Russian oligarchs to promote pro-Russian interests in Ukraine. I agree that the meeting itself isn't convincing but it clearly shows their intentions and to me it warrants further investigation.

       There is more actual evidence of this nature between the Clintons and their camp with Russia. No one has done anything illegal. Even the stupid raid of Manafort's home is about tax evasion bullshit like going after Al Capone. Does Trump act in any way like he truly gives a shit about Mueller? No. Not at all. He's annoyed about seeing idiots in the MSM talk about it non-stop like it's an actual issue. Dems would have leaked everything to the MSM by now if there was anything to this. It's all a bunch of supposed "smoke" that isn't smoke at all because it's normal presidential campaign behavior.

       First off I'd love to see the Clintons taken down by this investigation, the irony would be fucking amazing.  And yeah I agree with pretty much everything else you said but I'm still not convinced it doesn't at least warrant some sort of investigation.

       To what extent though? Sure there's going to be shady stuff there. Probably even things people can be charged with. But does it amount to collusion? Are we going to do this after every election now? Because I'm willing to bet you could go through every single campaign with a fine tooth comb and tie up most of not all of their time in office.

       Does it amount to collusion? Most likely not that's a very serious charge and they would need the smokiest smoking gun in history to prove that. But after all the evidence we've seen, why shouldn't there be an investigation? I made this thread because it seems a lot of people think there shouldn't be.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like you said "sure there's shady stuff there" very lightly. Shady stuff like having the dude running your campaign working for Russian oligarchs and meeting with Russians to get info isn't exactly normal campaign tactics.

       Are you sure it's not normal though? Many people in Clinton campaign had ties to Russia. The fact is we're talking about powerful people who generally operate on a global business scale. There's always going to be ties.

       I guess I'll rephrase, it
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       be normal. Someone who has actively worked to promote an adversaries interests shouldn't be allowed to work in American politics. And knowing the fucking Clintons they did something similar but hid it better.

       When the ties are "the dude running your campaign gets paid millions to promote Russian interests" you should probably dig a little deeper IMO.

       Fair enough. I don't disagree that it should be looked into. I just think it's much to do about nothing. They'll probably prosecute people for things campaigns have done for years. Because "Drumpf".

       Again, literally everything the IC has found has been leaked to the Dems. EVERYTHING. They then send it to the press. They have not found a fucking thing, yet. I honestly am open-minded about most shit, including this. If there was anything to it, you wouldn't see people involved co-operating. It's people on the Obama/Clinton side who are not doing so (same with the Steele dossier). They aren't being as forthcoming. I don't expect anything to come from this, except bullshit that has nothing to do with "Trump-Russia." I also don't expect the Clintons to ever get charged because Trump has decided he is advantaged by having them still be a presence in politics.

       Of course Trump is bothered.  He's threatened to have him fired several times but someone smarter than him convinced him it would look bad, kind of like Trump wasn't the target of the investigation until he fired Comey because he thought the investigation would come to a screeching halt.

       In 2007, almost a full decade before becoming campaign manager? My biggest problem with the Russian narrative is that it makes Russia seem a lot more powerful than they really are. I'm sure Putin loves the fact that Russia is in the limelight again even though they are basically a third world country at this point.

       Look who James Baker worked with and you could say the same thing about anyone in politics who does consulting or venture capital.  The big players are global.
Going back to when the anti-russia hysteria kicked into high-gear was the baseless assertion that they were behind the hack of the emails.  The Dems were twisting in the wind for the first couple days those emails were out.  I couldn't believe they were going with the "Russia did it" line but even worse when I saw the sheeple buying it.  I stopped having political conversations right then and there because I knew there was going to be a misinformation shitshow like none other from that point forward.  And run by the MSM et al.  The narrative was born as a deflection and the Dems are stick backpedaling.

       It's the fact that trump was a major buisness partner of his for decades before he even considered running for president.  If he committed any crimes, financial or otherwise, well......I imagine it would be hard to be president from prison.

       im sure theres something restricting it. its why the gore campaign went straight to authoritative when they found themselves in a similar situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       look at it this way... a foreign government were attempting to influence the US democratic process by providing trump with damaging info. the russians initiated it. by going along with it the trump campaign would have been colluding with a foreign government to influence the outcome of the election.

       i dont think its exactly the same in the eyes of the law... the clinton campaign asked for publicly available documents, the ukranians, who are considered allies, provided what was asked for. the russians offered illegally obtained private material that was the product of a state driven campaign against the american democratic process

       Mueller is a bureaucrat and I look at it as what 95% humanity does regarding their job  and career.  THEY KEEP IT AND DO WHAT THEY CONSIDER IS BEST FOR THEIR CAREER. THEY TRY TO AVOID CAREER SUICIDE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Political affiliations are not in the equation but just simply a matter of career advancement
      </p>
      <p>
       Come from a country where the Prime Minister gave the country's top job to his friend who once had the same political affiliations that of the Prime Minister. That former political associate and friend then fired the Prime Minister for upsetting the establishments apple cart.

       Correct, his party affiliation doesn't matter and shouldn't matter. He has one job and he should follow through with it no matter who he is investigating.

       I wasn't flattering Mueller. Don't care what Mueller has said his politics are one way or another. Judging by Mueller record, he would screw over a Democrat as fast as he would a Republican should it be advantageous for him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The example I was referring to in my post is (Sir!) John Kerr who was made Governor General of Australia by Golf Whitlam, and who then later sacked Whitlam.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was not a flattering comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a bureaucrat is a person appointed by a politician to do a task, then the Head of the Government in Australia is a bureaucrat. They are a person recommened by a politician (this case the Prime Minister alone) to the Queen of England for the position; the Queen then appointing them for a fixed term. This translates into a politician deciding who is Governor General and the Queen rubber stamping his selection. This person then swears an oath to serve the Queen and her heirs (just as any other government bureaucrat from postie to school teacher) and to do good by her people and from then on are given the ability to fire a government elected by the people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kerr's political affiliations on his appointment was that he had been a member of Australian Labor Party (1948–1955). He was appointed Governor General by a Labor Prime Minister whom he later fired. So much for Kerr's known and confessed political affiliations.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Kerr's performance in the dismissal I have nothing but contempt though people say different. Plain and simple Kerr was a chicken shit who refused to face Whitlam and tell him what he thought was the truth. Years ago I read Matters for Judgement, John Kerr's book on the dismissal, I was sickened. Came across Kerr's sacking Whitlam had more to do with Kerr saving his job then anything else. Matters of national interest and doing right by people rqn a distant last, being a sorry excuse for a horse if he was serious in running it. Reading this book, along with other books and articles since, I have come to believe Kerr was motivated by pandering to the establishment of the time with expectations they would rewards for his actions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Find it credible that the establishment did reward Kerr's pandering too. First by giving him ambassadorship to UNESCO in Paris (position made up and appointed by Prime Minister Fraser who succeeded Whitlam; both Fraser's and Kerr's denial that his appointment had nothing to do with dismissal laughable), a position Kerr never took up due to a public outcry. Second, Kerr received hefty payments for his biography due to an event that only occured due to his incompetency. One who paid a lot of money was Rupert Murdoch for serialisation of Kerr's book in his newspapers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite what Murdoch's papers have since said in defence of Kerr, I don't think Kerr EVER took the responsibilities of Governor General seriously. Kerr was in the position for one reason: himself and what he could get out of it - Australia and it's people were bothersome and troublesome after thoughts. Money and self-interest were why Kerr took so long to decide to take up the position, then only after a pay increase plus other benefits for himself and his wife did he accept the position. Patriotism, love of country, civic duty, or doing good for the greater were absent, having no place in his life prior or afterwards.

      <p>
       On a darker note, and one with real and substantial issues to Mueller and any government investigation in the United States is the alleged CIA connection in all this.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to Christopher Boyce (of 'The Falcon and the Snowman' fame), Kerr was a CIA asset who acted under CIA directions in dismissing Whitlam. Boyce claims the reason for the dismissal was because the CIA were pissed off at Whitlam after he pulled Aussie troops out of the Vietnam, the possibility he was considering the closure of Pine Gap (NSA &amp; CIA eyes and ears in the southern hemisphere) and his pursuit of a independent third way in foreign relations rather than curtailing to USA demands and expectations as had been demonstrated in our involvement in Vietnam.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the allegations are true, then Kerr, the representative of the Head of the Australian Government, was acting under orders of the CIA to overthrow the elected government of Australia, and his actions treasonous.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, if these allegations are true, then any bureaucrat could do the same, pretending to do their job while being under the orders of the CIA who have no interest in justice, truth, or what is best for people but only in their own self interest and profit.

       Well Rodger Stone was Trump's original campaign manager and Rodger Stone and Paul manafort have a working relationship going back three decades Rodger Stone recommended Paul manafort specifically for Paul's expertise and delicate counting which at the time was an issue for the Trump campaign trying to have their nomination stolen away by the Republican Party

       Yes, AP and the Times corrected the numbers, but it doesn't make the assessment any less credible. It was actually 4 (not 5) agencies in the end: FBI, NSA, CIA, and the Director of National Intelligence. The latter speaks for all agencies and thus the "false" initial report came out. But as the article says, the DEA or the Coast Guard are unlikely to collect intelligence on the Russians anyway, so it was just bad reporting.  It also doesn't mean that those other 13 agencies disagree with the assessment.The fact remains that the big 3 concluded that Russia meddled in the election.

       Like, I don't know, investigate the issue? Try to figure out what and how they did it so you can prevent in the future? The answer certainly isn't to stick your head in the sand and pretend that nothing happend. Let the investigations come to an end and see what comes out of it.

       How can you be definitively prove anything against anyone who is saying something  where you can't see the evidence as it is top secret but I know someone who can verify it as truth but I won't tell you who he is?

       It's a proven fact that russia bought ads on facebook in order to influence the American public in the most divisive way possible.  That alone makes it far more than a nothingburger.

       My reasoning for it being fabricated are these.
      </p>
      <p>
       -the MSM has been pushing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       -not even in their wettest dreams have they suggested a single vote was changed by Russia hacking in to the election, so that leads me to believe they have nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       -I can’t figure out why we hate Russia or want a war with them. This relentless push towards alienating Russia leads me to believe the defense industry must want war to rake in billions.
      </p>
      <p>
       -there is more to blackmail Hillary with than Trump for the Russians so why would they want Trump elected?
      </p>
      <p>
       -what benefit is it to Russia to have Trump elected?
      </p>
      <p>
       -did I mention the MSM is pushing it, therefore I don’t buy it.

        I see a lot of people on here claiming the Russian investigation is some sort of desperate attempt by the left or the deep state to take down Trump.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The deep state are doing that but also they are trying to rewrite history.
Russians didn't get Trump elected. The US corporate media did.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mass corporate media pumped Trump 247 to divert attn away from the old socialist who was packing arenas &amp; campuses across the United States since mid 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       They actually gave him unprecedented media time of ANY PREVIOUS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE by a long shot. Ask why did the media decide to do this for Trump?
It wasn't because they liked him or he is so interesting speaking for long periods of time.
      </p>
      <p>
       They wanted to pump up Trump to create a new "populist" candidate that would allow Clinton to go unquestioned while establishment Dems helped her cheat her way through the US dem primary/caucuses. They would let Trump blather away while Clinton wouldn't even stop to take questions from the press....walking past them &amp; waving like the queen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton's strategy was to "elevate Trump" into taking extreme positions &amp; then take him down in the general election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately it was impossible to build enough fake support for Clinton. Her tiny abysmal "rallies" for almost 2 years were reposted on Youtube and were laughably small.
      </p>
      <p>
       I travel cross country all year &amp; Bernie had the most visible support by far (signs, bumper stickers etc....), Trump was second &amp; then Ben Carson.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton had nothing. Once in a blue moon you would see someone with her bumper sticker which is really odd for one reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clinton campaign was actually blind mailing Clinton bumper stickers to people en masse in early 2016. I know several people across the United States who got one in the mail without being a Democrat or requesting one.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is amazing that people actually had one available , but even most Democrats chose not to display it on their vehicles.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is ton's of video evidence of Clinton &amp; establishment dems engaging in panic criminal behavior during the dem primary/caucuses &amp; dem convention. The curious should look for it on Youtube.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Whiting out/shredding ballots CA Youtube
2) Running minority culinary workers between multiple Nevada caucus locations Youtube
3) Training dem primary volunteers to hand out worthless provisional ballots to "certain types" of voters.
4) Delivering voting machinery with no locking mechanisms. CA
5) Keeping locations unsecured at night. NV CA
6) There are videos of women of a certain age caught on camera looking out for whether he coast was clear &amp; then stuffing ballots.
7) Mass media preannouncing "results" for CA primary the night before the primary.
(Causes people to not go out &amp; vote)
8) Bill Clinton showing up illegally outside of multiple voting sites.
9) People's voter registration becoming independent at the last second after registering Democrat.
This happened on a mass scale countrywide. Prevented many people from voting across the US.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deep state doesn't have a full handle on Trump &amp; they also want to erase the history of socialism making it's second massive populist resurgence since the Great Depression.

       In 2007, almost a full decade before becoming campaign manager? My biggest problem with the Russian narrative is that it makes Russia seem a lot more powerful than they really are. I'm sure Putin loves the fact that Russia is in the limelight again even though they are basically a third world country at this point.

       I guess I'll rephrase, it
       <em>
        shouldn't
       </em>
       be normal. Someone who has actively worked to promote an adversaries interests shouldn't be allowed to work in American politics. And knowing the fucking Clintons they did something similar but hid it better.
