<p>In the award pic look at the moles and compare, and in the pic on the left they added the necklace around the collar in an unnatural way. The right arm on the eye glasses is missing. The teeth are fake. But compare the moles and some are not in the same place.</p>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/6DLnPIH.jpg">The new pic from Fox of Campos</a> is similar to the Campos award pic, similar appearance of person, but the nostrils are different. The older Campos is slightly pug nosed, while the younger has less view of the nostril holes from the front. Interesting is the young Campos pic looks like a Polaroid from the 90&#39;s. And the edges of his shoulders are missing. </p>

<p>First impression is that they took an old immigration photo that looked similar to the fake Campos image they edited into the awards pic, and added a few moles and hair ,and released it through msm. I&#39;m starting to think Jesus Campos is all smoke and mirrors.</p>

<p>Investigative reporters have been to campos’ house, spoke to family, they said “we can’t talk about this”.</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on his family?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My thoughts would be anyone is for sale . Or could be taken advantage of. I don&#39;t under estimate the reach of the fbi in their staging of events and the ability to be propping up a family to support this Campos anomaly.  </p>

<p>And If this Campos person is indeed a fake then it begs the question what happened on the 32nd and who did the police really encounter?</p>

<p>The more I think about this it starts to seem like a live drill. But the ones organizing it were at the top and Something strange happened, and it forced their hand to create a scenario with a seemingly lost and slightly autistic looking Campos as being a cover . </p>

<p>Or should I say Campos is literally lost. Like gone. So his part didn&#39;t last long in this, for whatever reason. The family has only one line, &#39; we can&#39;t talk&#39; . So they are essentially powerless and freedom-less and being shielded.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. Why not just make up a story to cover up what really happened. I said earlier too in another thread, but this makes more sense knowing the authorities were and are involved in the whole thing.</p>
