    <div class="md"><p>Basically nobody wants to ban all guns. This is such a fuckin strawman. I just don&#39;t want crazy civilians being able to mow down a hundred people with military grade shit. How do people who want an immigration ban on certain Muslim not see the irony there? When someone murders 50 people, you never blame guns. But when a Muslim does it, you blame Islam. There&#39;s your actual irony. </p>

<p>second, an expectation of perfect safety is unreasonable. why stop at seatbelts? people die with them on. take all the cars off the road. ban wirecutters because people could use those to get through those pool fences. why allow fire at all? ban fire. this attitude is stupid as fuck.</p>

<p>The whole second part of your argument is meaningless because I don&#39;t want to ban all guns. I just want regulations. Like seatbelts, speed limits, fenced pools, etc. You&#39;re argument is so damn weak.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ahh wrong again. She authored the assault weapons ban and in that interview she was asked about a loop hole where it didn&#39;t apply to any of those assault weapons bought before the ban was instated. She said she wished she could round up those previously bought assault weapons if she could, but knew she couldn&#39;t. </p>

<p>So wrong on that. Didn&#39;t expect from you though. </p>

<p>And you do clearly support the muslim ban. Stop whining about me making assumptions about you when I&#39;m spot on. I know every single thing need to know about you by just looking at your Donald fanboy posting history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yea. you already can. there are probably dozens of ways to make car bombs at walmart. if you want to pass that law, youll ban everything flammable and everything that can hold pressure, which is why I say its retarded to have an expectation of safety. </p>

<p>furthermore, trying to ban one thing than another doesnt get to the root of the problem. you could ban all this shit from walmart, and the bad guys will get it anways. your solution DOESNT WORK. it fails to address the cause of the problem, and instead just attacks the scary items used to do it. </p>

<p>anyways, im getting sick of listening to whiny crybaby liberals, you are obnoxious to deal with. your party is dead, we will keep winning, and you can go bury yourself in a hole in the ground where you feel safe. the rest of us will protect ourselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are fire codes (why do u think there aren&#39;t?). It is a law that if you have a pool you must fence it in. It is a law to wear seatbelts. All of the things you said are already laws... but look at people not following them lol. You think a law is going to stop someone? It won&#39;t. If a person has the mind frame to mass murder they give not a single fuck about a law. Ban what u want...there is still the internet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, I didn&#39;t make your point. I made MINE. There are laws for all of those things and people don&#39;t follow the laws and still die.

    <div class="md"><p>So in your mind there is no point to those laws. So let&#39;s do away with seatbelts. Do away with speed limits. Do away with fire codes. And the same amount of people will die every year right? Because hey, people are just gonna break the law if they want any way right? So why the fuck do we even have any laws at all?

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps you don&#39;t understand mine. Why is murder even illegal then? Why do we have any laws? You think just maybe, more people would murder each other if it was legal?

<p>Also I never claiked the UK was perfect but least I won&#39;t lose my house paying medical bills if I happen to get say cancer.</p>

<p>you might lose your house and go to jail if you post on facebook that you prefer a doctor of a certain race. while I dont think its a good to have those kinds of opinions, i dont think people should go to jail for them either. </p>

<p>thats what makes the UK an oppressive shithole.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bearing in mind that our cops don&#39;t have guns either.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just a gun issue but a cultural one too. If you&#39;re living in a society where there&#39;s even a debate about whether or not guns are needed there&#39;s something wrong with that society. Instead of figuring out the best way to handle gun policy and regulation why not just fix the seeming necessity for guns to exist and be present at all? </p>

<p>Also is say armed police aren&#39;t necessarily an issue, again its the culture. America has pretty poor training in comparison to say Germany  (who as well as being trained near concentration camps are taught to only fire as an absolute lasr resort). And I can&#39;t remember wrongful shootings there. Britain has only had about 3 at most since 2000 but kinda tiny compared to the US</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/10/rural-and-urban-gun-owners-have-different-experiences-views-on-gun-policy/">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/07/10/rural-and-urban-gun-owners-have-different-experiences-views-on-gun-policy/</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a great breakdown of the largest cause of disparate opinion, rural vs city living. While there are many factors that could be speculated, a simplistic view of my understanding is as followed. While both sides use guns for protection, rural and to a lesser degree suburban areas have higher percentage of guns for hunting. This leads to increased exposure to guns while young. Thus it is self enforcing.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="/u/banana">/u/banana</a> is correct as the majority of America does not want a gun ban. While this has been the case for as long as polling was performed, the percentage for banning has decreased. </p>

<p>Studies by Pew and Gallop from the 1960s show approximately just under 50 percent supported banning guns except for Police and other authorized personal. Today only about a quarter support the same.</p>

<p>I hope you can glean your answer from this information.</p>

<p>The purpose of gun control is to keep them away from unstable, irresponsible people. To make them traceable if used in a crime. To make them safer, just as cars have been made safer, and reduce accidents. To diminish the gun obsession and consequent oversupply so they are not so easily available to suicidal individuals. Nobody proposes a roundup.</p>
