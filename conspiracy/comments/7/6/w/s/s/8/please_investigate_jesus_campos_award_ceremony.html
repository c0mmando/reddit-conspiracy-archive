       From the deleted thread - "IRREFUTABLE PROOF That the Vegas Shooting Guard Jesus Campos Narrative is a COMPLETE SHAM!"
      </p>
      <p>
       On this page you'll find the "award ceremony" for Jesus Campos given to him for heroism which supposedly happened on October 10th.

       Look at this image specifically:

       That photo was taken at Jean Georges Steakhouse at the Aria. Notice the texture on the walls. The LCD Panel in the back. The chandelier.
This photo was taken in the same room in 2013.

       Why is this a problem? Because this steakhouse was completely and totally remodeled in July of this year.

       </a>
       I've looked at hundreds of pictures of this place. There are no traces of the old decor whatsoever and the only area that can possibly be that old room looks absolutely nothing like what it used to.
       <a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ao5Mk-SxB08xlNP4L44vfUshW-U=/800x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8850001/Jean_Georges_Steakhouse_10.jpg">

       </a>
       So tell me, how did Jesus Campos' union have an award ceremony on October 10th in a room that no longer existed as of July this year?
Edit: For those of you linking images from the virtual tour on the Aria website. That tour is outdated. The images in the above article about the remodel clearly illustrate this. Look at the outside of the restaurant vs. in the virtual tour.

       That's because it was disproven. OP didn't check the private VIP room in the back, and sure enough a virtual tour showed that the VIP room had not been remodeled as the rest of the building had.

       I think this photo that actually has meta data that says it was photoshopped and taken the day before on the 9th is a lot more interesting.

       Up until then the focus was on the wallpaper, the chandellier and the table. It was established that there's more than one banquet room, some had a total overhaul with new wallpaper. It was found the room from the campos photo is called the chefs table, and is denoted by the unique chandellier. There was also some confusion about the table pre and post renovation maybe having been changed. After all that somebody posted the above image taken in July.

       You don't have to go there with a camera. The restaurant has a virtual tour. You can use it yourself and see what is actually inside the restaurant.

       I finally figured it out. There are two private dining rooms. I detailed everything in another post.

       I was the one who posted that image. I think the OP of the original post was suggesting the entire restaurant was renovated. I scanned all of instagram, yelp and tripadvisor to find a picture of the Chefs table (on the restaurant website it notes this is the table that seats 12, as well as others on instagram who sat at the chefs table matching the image Campos is in) and this is the only one i found, on tripadvisor, POST renovation. It looks identical to the image that Campos is featured in, which disproves the claim that the entire restaurant was completely gut renovated. This image was taken and posted in July after they reopened. The chandelier, table and wall are the same as they are in the photo. Until someone is able to show me a photo of the chefs table today looking completely different, i'm going to err on the side of logic and say that while i do believe there's a major conspiracy going on, i don't think it's here.

       Why dont you tell me since your psychic....Im assuming it's one of two things they didn't update it yet because this has been under planning for a while or because with the summer season of tourism they haven't had someone come in yet to shoot a new virtual tour. Seems simple enough.

       Something that bothers me as well are the rectangular frames w/ what looks like manzanita branches in them, widely seen in the new decor. Have not seen any pictures of these in old decor, however, there is one in the backdrop of the Campos picture.

       The Jesus Campos Award picture is real. That picture was taken outside one of the two private dining rooms that are available at the Jean Georges Steakhouse.

       That photo wasn’t photoshopped.  I was a photographer for years and edited a lot of photos.  I commented on the original post about that pic but it is pixelated, lacks definition, and has a flash creating shadows.  My 10 year old would do a better job photoshopping that in MS paint.  I highly doubt any govt agency would just send out a shoddy pic for no reason.

       There is a black blob under his hand. This black blob covers part of the guy to his right's navy blue pants also. If you pull it up in Lightroom and play with the contrast and blacks this area never changes, it has no depth, no shadows, it appears as if it was simply "painted" over.

       That’s his jacket.  He is leaning, his stance would shift his jacket to that side because of his cane.  The jacket falls to the side.  I could actually outline the entire coat for you.  Lightroom isn’t the best program for finding issues but regardless, this is a low quality photo, you’re not going to see tons of depth.  The shadow I spoke of is right below his fingers.  The jacket isn’t a shadow and would be flattened in detail from the flash.
      </p>
      <p>
       Listen, I’m not saying the whole event wasn’t shady, simply that in my opinion...having worked with photos for years, I don’t believe this was photoshopped.

       The thing is, people made this exact same point days ago, and even outlined what is clearly a jacket.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, days ago someone proved pretty clearly that one of the photos has exif meta data that says the photo was photoshopped, and has a date stamp from the day before the article says it was taken. Not saying that the photoshopped part is important, but no one was able to give a reasonable explanation why the date was off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, that's the only questionable thing I've seen, and people are arguing about things that have already been argued. It's kinda pointless.

       If it was opened in photoshop and any type of lighting adjustment was done, it would qualify as being photoshopped.  If it was taken on a phone, the exif data is correct (if it wasn’t changed by some asshole).  If it’s on a camera that no one adjusted the date on, the meta tag would be wrong.  The source is important.  But I believe I saw this was taken on a phone so that part is shady, unless someone went back later and edited the exif data which can easily be done at any point.  If you don’t believe me, do a quick google search on editing exif, and yes, that includes the date taken.

       Here, I found the Reddit thread, someone archived the photo on their website in the thread, and it clearly proved (for me at least) the date. I admit, there's legitimate reason they would Photoshop it.. but you decide for yourself

       There’s no way for me to know without getting my hands on a copy of the image from the source.  One thing that stands out to me is the sizing of the image in the exif data.  It looks like it was resized.  Which would account for the Adobe label alone, as for the date, I can’t know.  Either it was truly taken on a different day or someone edited the exif.

       This whole event was a fraud from the start.  It is a hoax with no shooter, no one shot, no one killed.  Mix of at the very least 600 crisis actors and 21,000 normal people.  Gun shot sounds coming from speakers and wasn’t even real gunfire noise judging by all the videos with people saying it’s fake and smiling/laughing.  All the wounded and they only pictures we get are of bandages taped on supposed high powered rifle chest wounds.  Second shooter narrative used to distract the conspiracy community like it was used for Sandy Hook and all the other hoax shootings.  Look up the evidence.

       There's not "quite a few"  there is ONE on liveleak that could be achieved with Hollywood makeup.  If that's you're only video evidence that this actually occured than it seems like your position is the one with the credibility problem not mine.  500 people shot and not one caught on camera.  Seriously   if you look at it as a hoax like every shooting all the pieces fit together perfectly.  Why did Google scramble their hoax results after the shooting and change their damn algorithms?  Because people caught on too quick with Dan Blizeren's bad acting and doctor Phil girl playing her crisis actor parts.  YouTube is DELETING good hoax videos.  Please tell me why they would do that if the idea is so ridiculous?  Why not leave them up to "ridicule them"?  The reason is the upvote counts showed how 90% of people were believing the hoax theory and that had to be stopped.  Wonder why...

       They are changing algorithms and deleting videos for any number of reasons.  Sure, part of it could be that the FBI is full of shit.  It could also be out of respect for the families of people who died.  I saw one man bubbling spit from his mouth, shot through the head.  People died.  It happened.  Probably not the way they said, but people did die.

       But the video is the only evidence that remotely looked like this whole thing even happened.  They also COULD have faked it.  ALL the other evidence looks bad for it being real. No muzzle flashes from the building, people laughing and smirking during the shooting.  All the people saying it’s a fake gun.  The gun sounds chain fed but also doesn’t because it slows down at the end.  Look up past crisis actor use during pulse and Sandy Hook and compare them to interviews with witnesses in this shooting.

       You believe no kids died at Sandy Hook?  Okay well this discussion is over.  You are on of the people who will never be convinced of anything other than what you believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people were laughing and saying it’s fake because it takes a while for the human brain to fully comprehend a situation like that.  They didn’t immediately see death, so they thought it was fireworks and sound effects.  There were so many people and really only a small fraction got shot, it would be hard for the majority to understand right away that it was a real shooting in the middle of their good time.

       So you researched Sandy Hook yourself and decided it was real?  I don’t think so.  So therefore you received your information from the news that children really died there and now you are repeating it back to someone who actually spent 40+ hours researching Sandy Hook in my free time over the years. Please explain how I’m wrong or tell me what other sources besides the news that said the shooting really happened.

       Someone actually replied to that tweet 2 days ago asking why there's no signatures at the bottom, and he never responded, lol. You've made a great point, his very first tweet sets up his being "banned" as the proof of everything else.. with a picture of a form that's not filled out, lol.

       Someone's going to call you a shill for saying that, but thanks for pointing out something I didn't notice!

       Yeah this guy Falco is full of shit. I have no doubt he went to the hotel to look around. He has a whole string of tweets where he is pointing things out he thinks do not make sense. Then to get attention drawn to his "investigation" that he did, he decides to make up a story that he was banned for life for poking around the hotel. To try any make his claim that he was banned seem believable he somehow aquires a form that's used by security to actual ban people from the hotel. He just does not realize that people will notice his proof of being banned is a letter that needs to be filled out by the hotel staff in order to be valid. I guess the people he is trying to get to follow on twitter are the type of people who will just blindly follow him and agree with anything he states as fact without actually objectively looking at his proof.

       I would like to know where does it say that the event took place at Jean Georges Steakhouse? I've seen the photos that spfpa posted but no where (that I can find) does it tell what restaurant they are in.
 I got the coordinates from a photo analysis tool of where the picture was taken (in the Aria resort building) but not that specific steakhouse. I'm new at this. So I apologize if I'm missing something obvious.

       It's hard to tell but to me, it doesn't look like the same room based on the two photos. The tables look like different colors and the plates sitting in front of the guests are different.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plates could be explained away because the other photo looks like a reserved party. Maybe they had different plates for that event?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I don't see the center piece (brown box-like object) that you can see in the Campos picture.

       But there's not enough evidence either way.

       In the linked image of the bar from the remodeling photos, you can see the long chandelier in the upper right of the bar.  It seems to be a side room for larger parties. This room doesn’t seem like it was remodeled and since the article was about the remodeling, probably no need to photograph it specifically

       It seems to me that in order for you to contend that these pictures are manipulated or fake, or whatever. You need to prove this part:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        That photo was taken at Jean Georges Steakhouse at the Aria. Notice the texture on the walls. The LCD Panel in the back. The chandelier. This photo was taken in the same room in 2013.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Where is the contention, and by whom, that this took place where you said it took place? I don't see that the SPFPA says 'we did this at the Jean George's Steakhouse.' So you appear to be saying 'these guys faked this whole thing because the picture of the SPFPA wasn't taken where they say it was taken,' but haven't indicated that anyone claims it was taken there. That is not proven by the evidence that you have presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, on review your contention 'I've looked at hundreds of pictures of this place. There are no traces of the old decor whatsoever and the only area that possibly be that old room...'
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/0Th2DBo">
        Here
       </a>
       <br/>
       I copied out this photo from the 'Eater' slide show.
      </p>
      <p>
       See the pattern in the back, dead center in the photo? That fully matches the pattern in the back of the SPFPA photo....
      </p>
      <p>
       So... look... this is not sound. You aren't right, you missed obvious visual information.

       Check the EXIF Data. I searched google images for the highest quality version of the award photo. Highest quality means an original source.
      </p>
      <p>
       It appears as if the photo originated on July 7th 2017.

       There's a chance that date is when the phone itself was created. Having a hard time deciphering. I ran the Profile ID which is : ca1a9582257f104d389913d5d1ea1582 through google and it had 1 hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       It took me to a chinese website EXIF viewer (
       <a href="https://exif.tuchong.com/view/5229150/">
        https://exif.tuchong.com/view/5229150/
       </a>
       )  where someone had run a search on another photo with the same Profile ID.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not sure if I'm on a wild goose chase or not, but I'd love some help figuring it out.

       You should have archived the link to the picture, if you're talking about the picture with the plaque, every field now shows unknown.. same thing happened to the picture originally on the police website. A different picture, but this was has exif data, while the original was scrubbed

       I'm telling you guys look at the picture of him sitting down in the OP. Look at his arm and then look at how his hand is positioned on that guy's shoulder. That's physically very unlikely. It's not natural at all. Also zoom in on the hand on the shoulder. It's cut and missing pieces. Look at how long the thumb is with the border of the skin color on his shoulder. Seriously look at this bullshit.

       its not the same decor they just carried over that print which makes sense for brand identity etc. this is what the new boardroom looks like..

       Seriously, why do we assume they're in the boardroom? Is there information that says that's where they are? It's the same light, same space, in the newly renovated restaurant. There is nothing here worth talking about.

       What is also weird is Campos holding up that "thank you everyone" sign without a band aid on his temple and the later award picture has him with a band aid.

       I debunked this yesterday. I thought it was a good lead until someone posted the link to the virtual tour of the restaurant. There are many intimate rooms with similar decor throughout the place.

       that little screen and what look like maybe a socket behind them line up in the Campos picture and the 2013 picture of the "Boardroom". some ppl are using this picture

       to refute this whole thing.. but, a quick search and you find that the Boardroom after the remodel looks like this

       His left hand on the guys shoulder, is completely Photoshopped. In addition to this lo-rez, dead-faced expression. Completely fake. This whole thing was a hoe-x. No one died!

       Here is something mildly interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first picture with the plaque has this file n ame:
       <a href="http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/Web%20GROUP%20with%20plaque_0.jpg?itok=Bztk1lI-">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The picture of them at the table eating dinner has this:
       <a href="http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/Web%20GROUP%20DINNER.jpg?itok=3WPp4-Ia">
        http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/Web%20GROUP%20DINNER.jpg?itok=3WPp4-Ia
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Where as the up close picture of the plaque itself has this filename:
       <a href="http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/IMG_1005.JPG?itok=FdzufPlp">
        http://spfpa.org/sites/default/files/styles/nivo_main/public/IMG_1005.JPG?itok=FdzufPlp
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The last one being what looks like the naming convention from a phone or digital camera, but the other two are clearly saved versions of the image.
Nothing conclusive, but found it interesting none the less.
