       Hes in communication with Julian. Last night and today he was retweeting Julian.  Now they are all gone.  he was saying Julian was the only person with the truth or who knew the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a deal is in the works for Julian to be pardoned or come to the US to testify that his source wasnt Russia.

       they are friends.  Hannity as far as I know the only American journalist to interview Julian in the embassy.  And they trust one another.  Julians posts are still up that were part of the retweet.  Theres no reason for Hannity to delete the retweets.  He literally said this morning on the retweets, Assange is the ONLY one with info and truth.  That retweet is now gone.  The only explanation is what i laid out.  That theres some sort of gears moving behind the scenes.  And that Sean wasnt shut up or told to shut up, but rather, delete the tweets because stuff is in the works and Sean pulled the trigger too soon.

       not to mention the reports increasing the last couple months of Rohrabacher, Rand Paul and another congressman all lobbying to have Trump talk to Julian and pardon him.  Sean himself asked Trump about pardoning Julian last Thursday.  Trump sidestepped the question.  I find it nearly impossible that trump isn't aware of the issues here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something appears to be going on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree about being worried about public perception though.  Unless you are like us on the chans or here, you have been told Russia hacked the election or hacked the emails for over a year now.  If Julian were to leak info about Seth tomorrow and prove what we all know here, that Seth was the leaker and the Russia/Trump connection was bullshit.  But Im worried he'd dump the Seth proof and CNN and the media would say, oh well, Julians a russian agent, and that this was all a lie on his part.  And Russia/Trump wouldn't continue on.  They'd just add the Seth proof to the list of their proof for Russian interference.

       I see it more like, people claim since Assange is a lyer because he didn't turn himself in after proclaiming too if Manning was released.  I litterally dealt with that argument earlier today.

       He chose Fox and RT for interviews because murdoch and pilger are Australian. And Murdoch and Putin are allies. Hannity was sent by Murdoch to do his bidding.

       He has more than that though...I think he will put out a 'good faith' dump, and based on that, 45 administration will look at pardon. But I think Russia won't be first dump. HRC, Seth Rich, Arwan maybe...

       You think he'd do a Seth Rich dump?  That goes against the policy he tweeted about as recently as this past week of never revealing sources.  You really think he'd dump that email or file that proves Seth Rich was the leaker?  I think he should, but WL is pristine, and unrivaled in their status of being spotless and above reproach.

       no, i dont think it will be seth rich. was kinda just listing what WL possibly could have. I just thought of another possibility: Trump and Assange are in cahoots for a US secrets dump. 9/11, JFK, UFOs, Sandy Hook...IDK just kinda throwing it out there, since we all are speculating. It just better not be that BS he pulled during campaign, where you stay up all night for a WL self tug. lol But I agree, WL has been consistent in it's approach

       im getting impatient though.  I want WL and Julian to expose it all now.  Ive been waiting, we've all been waiting so long for pizzagate, seth rich, awan and the russia hack hoax to come up and be exposed.  We've been waiting for sessions to lock hillary up.  Waiting for the truth of seth rich to come out.  Waiting for it all to kick off.  But it never seems to happen.  Im so impatient and restless and ready.  Lets get to it!

       WL knows who gave them the leaked emails.  Thats pretty obvious.  Just as they know Manning and Snowden gave them files in the past.  Sy Hersh and others have said WL paid Aaron Rich, Seth's brother for the leaks suggesting they both were paid.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with your 2nd question is the "hack" wasnt performed to make it seem like someone other than Russia committed it.  It was the exact opposite.  It was a leak, by a pissed off Bernie voter, an American, who then went to a wooded area near American University to hand the files or thumb drives to Charles Murray.  Murray, and Seth and Aaron all gave the files to WL, or to KDC and then to WL.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guccifer 2.0 was the proof of the lies in your 2nd question.  The DNC made it seem like Russia hacked it.

       Snowden released through the Guardian and Glen Greenwald via the press becuase of the reasons I stated above. There are countless videos of him online giving the very reasoning I stated about why he didn't do a data dump and instead decided to use journalists. You dont know what you are talking about.

       The article you just posted is about someone who is associated with Wikileaks who assisted Snowden in the Moscow airport after he already had distributed the data to reporters in Hong Kong (which is all documented in the excellent Citizen 4 documentary so I don't know how you think you can refute that), Snowden did not give the data to wikileaks he used the Guardian. Wikileaks does dump raw data, as was the case with the Manning releases where they put out tens of thousands of files online at once with no filtering out sensative intelligence that would put people's lives at risk or compromise national security, which is what Snowden specifically was trying to avoid.

       Why does it matter even if Russia did do it? I don't think they did, I think it's way more likely an insider who was upset at what they saw going on did it. But even if 'Russia' did it, it's still THEIR emails, it's still THEIR crimes and THEIR election-rigging etc. If they weren't criminals, people seeing their emails wouldn't damage them. Them trying to make out like it was all Russia is just their way of trying to shift focus off their own wrongdoing and shady behaviour.

       With the amount of shit posting going on from both sides I definitely feel like something is going to drop in the next 24 hours but I am not holding my breath that it is going to be anything of material substance.

       You think he'd do a Seth Rich dump?  That goes against the policy he tweeted about as recently as this past week of never revealing sources.  You really think he'd dump that email or file that proves Seth Rich was the leaker?  I think he should, but WL is pristine, and unrivaled in their status of being spotless and above reproach.

       im getting impatient though.  I want WL and Julian to expose it all now.  Ive been waiting, we've all been waiting so long for pizzagate, seth rich, awan and the russia hack hoax to come up and be exposed.  We've been waiting for sessions to lock hillary up.  Waiting for the truth of seth rich to come out.  Waiting for it all to kick off.  But it never seems to happen.  Im so impatient and restless and ready.  Lets get to it!
