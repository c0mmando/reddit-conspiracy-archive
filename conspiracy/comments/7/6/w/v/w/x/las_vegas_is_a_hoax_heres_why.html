       Here's some crisis actors talking about their injuries. It's heavily edited to make a point but you can find the original interviews if you're determined:

      <p>
       Isn't it suspicious that they all claim they can't remove the lead bullet lodged in their body?
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of bullets, where are they? Why haven't anyone recovered a single bullet from the grounds, the injured, or the dead?
      </p>
      <p>
       Be skeptical of users here who say they know someone who died in Vegas.  There are 500K subscribers here (many of whom are not Americans and most of them inactive) which is 0.17% of the US population. Isn't it amazing how so many people in
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       know someone who loves country music and happen to be in Vegas on Oct 1. and is actually one of the 58 in a crowd of 22,000.
These people who claim to know someone who died in Vegas are deliberately manipulating your emotions and they are helping the deep state instill fear and submissiveness on the population.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one of them gives you the guilt trip when you bring up the possibility of a hoax, give them the American salute:

       Just because you don't know anyone who was affected by(killed/injured), it doesn't mean it didn't happen. I know people who were shot and injured at the concert. Someone I personally know for over 10+ years) went with his wife and mother in law. The mother in law was shot, taken to the hospital, and had to be rushed into surgery. She didn't die but was injured. So people WERE IN FACT targeted, shot, and or killed. But who did it? Why? THAT is what the conspiracy is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that you're doubtful. Who wouldn't be honestly. Our govt lies about everything, but THIS one isn't the hoax. Hell, I believe they hoaxed some other terror attacks, fake victims and all. But this isn't the one. If you follow occult stuff and that aspect of it, you can understand why a mass killing like this happened when and where it did.

       So your theory goes that the shooting never happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       First option is that all people at Mandalay Bay where crisis actors. Everyone. The videos where you can clearly hear bullets flying past the cameras, echos, are all fabricated and edited material. Tons of work that has to be accurate. It is possible, but it would take time. A lot of it. Since these videos were uploaded right after the event, they should have started making the fake evidences long before the event, without anyone noticing it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second option is that some actors were in the crowd, popping fake blood sacks and gore on the ground to scare actual visitors. These people would have to lay down on the ground, acting dead, for the whole event, while real people would try to run and probably step on them, because they act dead. Also, shooting actually happened, but that "shooter" was aiming directly at the actors, and miss them just a bit, so non-actors think they got hit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't you think these theories are absurd?

       You make a lot of unnecessary assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody at the Mandalay Bay needs to know besides the owners who hand over control of the surveillance room to the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gunfire recordings can be played on military grade hidden speakers.  Real sounds played in real time heard by real people.  Not real gunfire.  What's so hard about that?
      </p>
      <p>
       To control crowd behavior you have actors pretending to panic and run in a planned direction.  The real crowd eventually joins the flow even though you can clearly see many weren't concerned at all because they didn't sense any real danger.  The police also help direct the crowd.  To the police, it's a drill.
      </p>
      <p>
       The gore scenes are surrounded by crisis actors in an area allocated to crisis actors.  What's so hard about that?  There is no real shooting.  That's why no bullets have been recovered and no one can find a bullet hole anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
       You call it absurd.  I call it a medium budget movie scene in one take with a good make-up team but bad actors.

       The biggest debunk point is the gunshots. Yes, you can play gunshots from speakers. But can you explain me how can you mimic the sound and the effect of bullets directionally flying next to cellphone microphones with a speaker?

       I'm not trying to imply that the whole story of tha LV shooting is true. There's cleaely something going on that we don't know about. But this is certainly not that.

       The entire article is based on an interview with the supposed victim's father. The only photos are of a smiling young man and a seperate photo of a bloodied bullet next to a wallet. A glaring sign of bullshit is that the dad says his son still has the bullet with him. That's not possible. The bullet would be in police custody for evidence and the ballistics report.

       You just said this " a glaring sign of bullshit is that the dad says his son still has the bullet with him." Nowhere in that article is written that this guys dad says that. Where did you just come up with this? Why lie like that? Haha seriously. This is what's actually written. "A hundred-dollar bill stained with Bill Robinson Jr.'s blood after he was shot during the Las Vegas shooting." That's it. Nowhere does it say whatever you just said. You just don't want to believe this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now answer this one buddy. How the hell do you explain a bullet going through a wallet and cash with actual photos showing the evidence. The father corroborating text messages with the son and  a random woman helping the guy who got shot and that guy who was shot still alive to confirm what happened? I mean it's night and day with what you think happened.

       Okay so  if he gets to keep the bullet there's no crime to prosecute because the shooter is dead. What is there to prosecute? Also you can't explain a bullet going through a wallet going through cash lodged in between? Are you gonna say that's a prop and it was placed there before the shooting so this guy has a story to sell? I mean why would anyone work so hard to lie about a shooting going to the hospital with all kinds of witnesses that were helping him after getting shot with a bullet lodged in wallet!

       You give your reasons on what makes you think this is a hoax, but I want to know why you think this is a hoax. What's the reason to fake everything? Don't just say false flag. Explain it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also In most cases, if a bullet has not penetrated an internal organ or caused infection, doctors will leave it in rather than risk surgery. The surrounding tissue encapsulates the bullet, preventing it from dissolving and leaching into the blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       That is a fact. Not just an opinion. Removing bullets can cause nerve damage so there's another reason. You should research more.

       You are a bullshitter.  You know nothing about treating gunshot wounds.  Where are your sources for this "fact"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I've addressed your question multiple times.  It's easier to cover it up when there are no real victims.  Real victim's families will often pursue the the truth until they find out.  Then you have to kill them too.  It's messier.

       You literally danced around my question. So full of shit. You living in the United States buddy? Or you living in Russia? You know nothing about treating gun shot wounds. I would ask if you have an education, but I don't need to stoop low to your level. Good luck in your quest to no where. Your whole theory got debunked, and you dance around questions with no factual information. You just push your agenda on what you think is real when in reality it's all fiction.

       I'm not saying real or fake or anything else here. Im also no forensics guy... But I've seen quite a few bullets in my life both fresh and spent. I've never once seen a bullet that hit someone, or some thing,  and the only bit of mushrooming on the bullet was the tip where it looked like it was smacked with a hammer. I'm not gonna speculate, just pointing out an observation, ya know?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think it was a false flag kind of deal. I believe it did happen. I believe people died. I have theories but don't have any concrete proof for them. Nor am I going to dedicate the time needed to obtain said proof. Just asking a question.

       I agree. You cant prove the validity of every event if your not there yourself to witness, but this one is definitely real. Also, 911 may have been and inside jobs due to the towers collapsing, and tower number 7 also collapsing. Not disregarding the fact that terrorism (in all forms) is real.

       You have to pay out for real lawsuits from the real victim's families, as opposed to settling with the fake families for $0.
Also, some real stubborn families will investigate further and not accept a cash settlement. If they find out the truth that the government killed their loved one and make a fuss, then you will have to kill them too.

       But if nobody was supposedly shot, wouldn't you just have to pay for their silence instead. I mean these are times where the presidential administration can't keep people out of their e-mails or GOT actors can't even get their manuscripts in advance because of the risk of leaks, how do you get people to shut up - and killing them off after the thing doesn't really make much sense either, since it would've been a lot less suspicious to kill them off at the event.

       So basically, you'll never be persuaded otherwise? And how is multiple shooters the conclusion they want? They are trying to convince the public that it was one lone nut even though everything points to that not being true.

       Theres no template here. people probably don't want to you using your time and energy on something that isnt true.

       Look up the occult.  It is a word meaning "that which is hidden"  Youtube people like Jordan Maxwell, Mark Passio, Michael Tsarion.  Google them, look up secret societies, look up the cult of saturn, research the black cube, research saturnalia.

       Mass sacrifice is a real thing.  The elite still do it today.

       Hijacking the top comment because I can help make sense of the "Bloodless Drill At the Hospital" Video. The person in this video is looking at it a bit wrong, and needs to dig deeper.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look at the far wall, most of the Video catches a sign on the wall: Valley Health. Valley Hospital Medical center is NOT a Level 2 trauma center, only secondary injuries would be brought here during an event like this, shrapnel, trample injuries, cuts, lacerations, broken bones would have been sent here. This ER would NOT be taking gunshot wounds. People would have been shirtless if they came into the ER with blood all over their shirts, they would have been removed by staff and disposed of, this is to minimize the impact of possible blood born pathogens.
      </p>
      <p>
       The closest L2 Trauma center equipped to deal with this type of event is Sunrise Medical center, and indeed this is where severe injuries including Gunshots were sent.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three trauma centers in LV capable of dealing with this type of event and Valley Health doesn't operate any of them, what you are seeing here are secondary injuries that were sent to a nearby hospital to free up beds and medical staff of Sunrise to deal with trauma patients.

       You can post whatever videos you'd like, but again the injuries are not hoaxed. I would have thought my analysis above would be more eagle eyed than most, and you'd wonder why, I'm just saying the shooting victims are not hoaxed.

       Which goes for most of those ridiculous YouTube videos too. The analyses are based on nothing. I.e. the shoulder shot and lung damage, you do realize he shot from an angle and thus could easily hit a lung. Moving your arms would then not be extremely painful due to the joint being undamaged and painkillers received. You think these people will go through the next years of life without laughter? No, you try to make the best of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really like active people looking at flaws of events, but it must atleast be based on common sense. The fact that you blatantly copy all these videos show you do actually not question everything, if anything at all.

       How do explain someone who has no known connections to acting, or the government, who for all knowledge of there family, friends, and coworkers, was a regular person that lived, went to school, and worked in the same city there whole life leading up to the event some how being involved in this "hoax!"
      </p>
      <p>
       You really can't, how about instead of trying to convince us it was a hoax, you get a hold of all those victims families, friends, and coworker, and try convincing them it was a hoax, as well as the funeral services they are attending. Show them that the bodies in the graves, and ashes in the urns are all fake, and don't forget to document it all so you have proof to show us when your done!

       I didn't say I knew them, I said they grew up here, they were well known by LOTS of people in this city. The local media has been reporting about them for the past week, and they had lots of friends, family, and coworkers, and I am sure it is the same way for a good majority of the victims, but you say they are all lying, and they are all in on it!

       As a person who knew someone who died. I came to r/conspiracy to look for answers. I'd imagine a lot of other people did too. The person I knew probably knew a couple thousand people in her lifetime. Why would it be suspicious that some of them would be on reddit? Wouldn't it be more suspicious if they didn't.

       This is lame. The "investigation evidence" is sloppy at best. But more accurately I would say it deliberately misleading. Saying someone doesn't exist because they aren't on Canada411.Ca is absurd. That site only lists people with home phones. Who even has a home phone any more. Apparently I don't exist by that standard.

       This is the type of psyop that deep state does to label us crazies.  Don't fall for it. The real event is being covered up. I'm sure the OP is not part of it and is just compiling theories and observations. But to get to the truth, we need sound theories.

       Mathis is a weird one. Worth checking out, he nails it sometimes (the Stephen Hawking piece is the most convincing thing on there).
      </p>
      <p>
       But he also says that the JFK assassination was faked, and that Trump only actually got about 15-20% of the national vote in the last election. Find those pretty hard to swallow. Tread carefully.

       No, that's a total and deliberate misrepresentation. The argument for a hoax is that
       <em>
        all the evidence
       </em>
       for the hoax that isn't completely laughable simply doesn't stand up to scrutiny. And much evidence we would expect to see is non-existent. All we have to back
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of that up is hearsay evidence from random people on the internet claiming to know people who actually died. Or know people who know people.

       Yeah, totally unrealistic to expect, say, a single frame from any of

      <p>
       This has nothing to do with evolution and your analogy is bogus: there is an enormous amount of credible evidence for evolution. For this event, not so much. If anything, you people who insist this event is real are more like Christians who refuse to give up belief in God despite the absence of evidence for his existence. But you're right, neither your irrational faith in the reality of this event nor my reasoned skepticism will change a thing.

       I figured that would piss you off. You're limited by your own cognitive bias.

       You believe in evolution (so do I, but that doesn't matter) and yet you can't answer the question. Somehow, you expect me to answer yours.

       You don't seem to understand that you're asking the wrong person. I can't provide you with credible evidence for the Vegas shooting any more than you can provide me with credible evidence for evolution.

       He was found alone in a hotel room, rented in his name, from which there was no demonstrable means of escape, surrounded by weapons that he had purchased which had been fired. Witness testimony from the floor below confirms the sound of gunfire from above. Hotel security testimony claims gunfire coming from inside the room and into the hallway.

       But my point is that shills and trolls are one thing, but the vast majority of people trust mainstream media implicitly. Or at least some people bizarrely attack it on one topic, but then accept its narrative on another! It boggles the mind.

       It's hard to tell a shill from someone infected with TV-ism.

       The culture of laziness and gullibility in terms of news consumption is a product of CFR policy and exacerbated by worsening economic conditions taking away people's free time and energy.

      <p>
       Corporate media serves as the mouthpiece for their owners who have investments in more important industries such as energy, tech, and MIC.  While making money is important, it is not as important as conditioning the public to accept the agenda of the oligarchy.  I think it's propaganda first and profit second for the MSM.

       So basically, you'll never be persuaded otherwise? And how is multiple shooters the conclusion they want? They are trying to convince the public that it was one lone nut even though everything points to that not being true.

       Theres no template here. people probably don't want to you using your time and energy on something that isnt true.
