<p>He hasn&#39;t actually accomplished anything.</p>

<p>He&#39;s constantly talking trash on Twitter.</p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t qualified for the job in the first place. He&#39;s just a fast talking con man who has a decent amount of cash. </p>

<p>I bet he made most of his money by laughing Russian money. Every few days we find out something new about his organizations ties with Russia.</p>

<p>It would be much easier to believe that there isn&#39;t anything to it but he obviously is being controlled by Vladimir. He won&#39;t say a word against him and he didn&#39;t implement the new sanctions. Sanctions that he begrudgingly signed.</p>

<p>Trump will go down in history as the worst President ever.</p>

<p>How many times has a sitting President invited Russians into the Oval Office?</p>

<p>Just once...</p>

We were allies in the war against the Nazis and the Japanese. Only thing is we treated the Russians differently than our other allies. Doesn&#39;t take much distrust to fester into a real mess.</p>

<p>We had the opportunity to greatly improve the relationship between Russia and the rest of the World but somehow we missed the chance. </p>

<p>We have cooperated in space for many years. I don&#39;t see why that cooperation couldn&#39;t be expanded upon.</p>

Hannity did as much as anyone to beat the drums of war. Sean Hannity&#39;s job as he sees it is to support GOP regime&#39;s no matter what and to oppose democrats NO MATTER WHAT. How can any of you give him one shred of credibility and consider yourself woke?  What a joke this sub has become. </p>

<p>Scroll to the bottom. A lot of the material they released was on the Bush Administration. They&#39;ve also released a lot of stuff on the CIA, NSA, Saudi Arabia, and others, which couldn&#39;t really be put into the category of a &quot;political party.&quot; The stuff they release typically goes above the level of party politics, but they have released stuff on Clinton and Bush. </p>

The left loved wikileaks back when they released stuff on the Bush Administration, then they turned on Wikileaks when they released stuff on the government when Obama was in office.

The more snakes and plots of corruption that we expose within the government, the better. The side doesn&#39;t matter ultimately. That&#39;s the way I see it, at least. </p>

<p>He was a viewed as a national hero during the Bush era. He criticized the Panama papers, but I&#39;m not going to completely nullify the guys work based on saying something &#39;is an attack on Putin&#39; because he criticized the fact the Panama papers didn&#39;t offer open access to the documents online in April 2016.</p>

<p>How about let&#39;s get Assange out, and then let him speak for himself. Because I&#39;m not going to throw away the guy&#39;s multi-year work because he said something you disapprove of and use as &quot;all you need to know&quot;.</p>

<p>I need to know a lot more, we&#39;ve barely scratched what&#39;s happening with Assange. And everyone is so happy to call anyone who assaults their conspiracy narrative as disinfo. I&#39;ve literally heard that everyone who is a conspiracy voice called disinfo and refuse to parlay in it until actual evidence comes out to prove it. So, Julien is just alright with me so far based on his track record and it makes me curious why they want to silence him or poison his well so rapidly and viciously.</p>

In the lead up to the election and now, they remain pretty much the only mainstream news organization that criticizes Dems, doesnt buy into the Trump Russia BS, and they even or Hannity even brought up Seth Rich.  Julian was a hero to the left back when Scott Ritter was around.  He exposed Bushs war crimes.  It was only when he started exposing Obamas transgressions, droning, Iraq war crimes under Obama, PRISM, only then did the same people who loved him, start to turn on him.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m really getting sick of this, &quot;Not everyone agrees with me here? This sub is a joke.&quot; Kind of talk.</p>

<p>Some of us are totally on board with what you just said. Hence the net upvotes. Some people will disagree with you on it.</p>

<p>Some watch Alex Jones. Some call him controlled opposition. Some believe aliens walk among us. Others don&#39;t think they exist at all. Some believe in flat Earth. Some think they&#39;re batshit crazy.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fucking <em>thankful</em> this sub has so many different opinions flying around. We&#39;re here to talk about conspiracy, and ideally, to discuss topics without being judged as if we&#39;re a hive mind.</p>

<p>Even if you disagree with a highly upvoted post, it doesn&#39;t mean the whole sub has &quot;become a joke.&quot; </p>

<p>Please, stop lumping us all together just because we congregate in the same place. It&#39;s all part of &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; becoming more mainstream.</p>

<p>I happen to totally agree with the rest of your comment, I just hate this idea that if someone shares their thoughts that it represents the whole sub. Anyone can post here.</p>

<p>Also, can you guys please stop saying woke? It just sounds like a word the CIA put out to make people who say it look like idiots. &quot;Awakened&quot; would be sort of okay, but woke? </p>

<p>Is everyone else sleep? If you have good work ethic, are you drive? If you really, really care about something, are you passion as fuck?</p>

<p>No, because all of those things sound fucking retarded. </p>

<p>I could easily slap on a, &quot;this sub is such a joke now,&quot; but thankfully not everyone talks like this in here.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t take this comment personally. You seem like a smart person. I&#39;m just annoyed with those two phrases being prevalent. It has nothing to do with you personally. Sorry that you caught the brunt of it, lol.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think anyone said they thought he was the arbiter of truth, jsut htat he was hinting that some big news was coming. Even if he&#39;s not to be trusted in general, it&#39;s still possible that he would report on big news that was coming out and not lie about it. Just because he shouldn&#39;t be trusted in general doesn&#39;t mean that him saying tick tock along with assange and trump&#39;s hints is something to ignore. I think you&#39;re getting yourself a bit worked up over nothing, because no one has said that they think hannity is the new beacon of truth and light.</p>

In the past decade, didn&#39;t they do a bunch of &quot;news&quot; items about how Obama was a secret Muslim from Kenya?

<p>You shouldn&#39;t be surprised there are people in this sub who drink the Fox News Kool-aid. That&#39;s to be expected given the way Fox News presents themselves as an alternative to the rest of the corporate media big-leaguers. I wouldn&#39;t say Hannity is a &quot;hero&quot; myself, but it does appear that he&#39;s been doing a good job of doing actual journalism with regards to Wikileaks and Julian Assange. I haven&#39;t paid close attention to him on other subjects, and I understand actual journalism is a departure for him, but even so, it makes sense to me that many people in this sub would see what he&#39;s doing and be appreciative. I can tell you that I appreciate him doing a decent job of reporting on Assange and Wikileaks even if I don&#39;t particularly like or care about him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just a thought.</p>

<p>Hypothetical really.</p>

<p>What if our government is exposed completely and everyone goes down in flames?</p>

<p>Who does that leave to take over?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say the Dems all go bye bye and we are left with one party residing over us.</p>

<p>What if we were wrong about Trump and Putin and then suddenly the GOP is ousted through use of similar tactics such as smearing and exposing their horrible behaviours?</p>

<p>In the worst case scenario where our entire government id exposed as crooks... who takes over?</p>

<p>Are we beginning to root for our own demise?</p>

<p>We are frothing at the mouth to see it all come falling down but does this actually bode well for we the people?</p>

<p>What are the contingency plans?</p>

<p>I may not be articulating this that well but keep in mind that all governments are corrupt in nearly equal ways except that, regardless of opinion, we have the most freedom HERE and NOW.</p>

<p>Someone needs to have a failsafe ready to replace the current establishment with a better one so that we don&#39;t just get swallowed up by Britain or Russia.</p>

<p>Britain obviously being the better of the two.</p>

<p>Maybe we could just become Canada 2?</p>

<p>Idk but we should be careful as we move forward and start developing contingency plans is all I am saying.</p>

<p>Sorry I am a little stoned haha.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our entire system is rotten to the core, and if you want to see justice and change, there will be a price.  Those in power will hold onto it at all costs - but their desperation is a positive feedback loop for revolution just like in Catalonia now.</p>

<p>They will try to coax people back to ignorance, they will make empty gestures and promises that the people will attempt to entertain, but once the genie is out, it&#39;s out.  Violence will escalate, police brutality will become a norm.  Watch Catalonia very close right now for a taste of what&#39;s to come.</p>

<p>They can&#39;t win though.  In the end, sheer numbers and courage for a just cause win protracted wars.  Don&#39;t fear the unknown comrade, or hardship - because nothing can be worse than the powerless despair of the exploited and enslaved.</p>

<p>When the dust settles, we will decide collectively how to proceed.  We will evaluate our lessons, history, what went wrong, and how we will never allow the few to rule or the governmental structure to erase the will of those it represents while simultaneously controlling the information narratives dissemated to the masses.  We will not allow this injustice and complacent ignorance to ever be systematically built and tooled into the structure of our society again.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll know when there is no gray area.  When the masses come calling, don&#39;t fear the unknown - fear what you&#39;ve experienced in a society ruled by the few, and fear the moral caliber of the man who would still choose to complacently remove his voice in building society.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Aye, we need a tangible, explicit reveal regarding our actions in an ongoing event.  We need to have every troop in the Middle East to break the goon washing by understanding what they are being told they fight for in their masters own words, by being forced to confront that reality psychologically every time their finger is on the trigger in real time, not in the dark corners of memory 20years later when a declassified doc gets a control release.</p>

<p>We need something big and relevant to right fucking now - and I have a feeling our foreign policy and defense industry blood economy is about to be laid absolutely bare.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OP, you&#39;re a fool or a tool to believe anything that comes out of the mouth of Hannity. Assange has been compromised for years--probably with threats of execution (or worse) to his loved ones. He&#39;ll say anything.</p>

<p>If there was any truth to the Seth Rich nonsense, Rod Wheeler wouldn&#39;t be pointing his finger at Fox News as the only source for the rumors he disseminated. We&#39;d have some other source of evidence. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, it&#39;s been clearly demonstrated through computer forensics that the toolsets used to infiltrate DNC servers came from a Russian GRU group. This is not disputable. We know this because the toolsets had evolved over years due to the escalation of tactics used. In some cases, newer toolsets from known Russian cyberespionage campaigns shared code with this particular attack. </p>

<p>So, unless you have some reason to believe SR was working with Russian GRU, then it&#39;s a botched robbery in a busy American city--a thing which happens many times a day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pizza and Seth rich are not going to be the subject of 33k emails - you will find nothing explicit enough to rally the masses in a work email dump.</p>

<p>What we are about to get is absolute proof of not only the personal financial gain of Clinton through the state department, but the complete proof we have been waiting for of how much we pull the strings of terror orgs in the Middle East.  Our foreign policy is about to be laid bare, not as some declassified documents after the war criminal and international terrorist has been buried and exalted as a hero and &quot;muh troops&quot; are back home,  but as what we are doing right fucking now.</p>

<p>We need to be rallying the masses on this point to demand immediate action and accountability.  The wake up call comes tomorrow, and it&#39;s on those of us who aren&#39;t going to be in shock to calll for solidarity against the tyranny of Our government abroad with blood and at home with lies and psyops.  The puppets of the defense industry will make a move to draw the shocked and confused masses back into the complacent ideological trash can and we cannot let this happen.  It&#39;s time to rise together, not play autist loner in the corner pouring over references to pizza and wasting the next precious few days confusing people with conjectures and theory based on evidence that is not absolutely explicit.</p>

<p>In other words, don&#39;t ruin this sperg lords.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I don&#39;t understand is how people are accepting that he survived the raid when the only proof that was provided was video/audio proof, both of which can be faked in real-time if someone (like TPTB) has the resources.</p>

<p>People were speculating on what proof he&#39;d give and whether it&#39;d be valid/acceptable, and it was a video conference after 1-2 weeks of silence after the raid...something they could have set up beforehand...people were so happy to accept any sign of him being alive.</p>

<p>Did Assange ever release more proof??</p>
