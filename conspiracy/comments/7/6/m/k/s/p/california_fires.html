    <div class="md"><p>I saw a video the other day claiming this and I don&#39;t really buy it.  I use to work in the construction industry and still do, but as a supplier, and alot of, if not most houses and 3-4 story hotels are built with wood.  With that said, I&#39;m still very skeptical of them blaming PG&amp;E infrastructure failing and cause 7 different fires accross a large area in less than 2 hours.  I could be wrong, but this past winter we were rocked with storm after storm, and find it gard to believe some how the winds we saw last Saturday/Sunday were capable of cause those fires.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I thought, and I appreciate the update, and don&#39;t take this responce as nay saying, but as a legitamite criticism of this theory.  Most intense forest fires get up to 900c, aluminum melts at 660c, and those pools look like aluminum from my experience... At least the 2nd pic does, I would assume the 1st as well.  Cars aren&#39;t made with steel frames anymore, they have aluminum chassis designed to take a hit.  Look, I&#39;ll entertain the idea of directed energy weapons on 9/11, that pic of the cops car and taxis is questionable since there wasn&#39;t a fire near those vehicles, as far as I know.  But this theory is a trap and easily explained.  Sorry to sounds like a nay sayer, but I don&#39;t like chasing BS theories to drive YT views.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Glass melts at approximately 1400-1600c, so how do you explain glass melting if the fires weren&#39;t reaching inordinate temperatures? </p>

<p>In addition, what kind of forest fire doesn&#39;t burn trees but leaves houses completely incinerated? Normal house fires leave homes charred but the structure remains. This fire destroyed homes entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you have examples of the glass melting?  Maybe the temp increase quick enough to break it.  I guess every time a house is burnt, car is torched and trees are standing (<a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nightly-news/drought-fueled-wildfires-ravage-washington-oregon-n387581">like the pic in this article</a>) it must have been a directed energy weapon.

    <div class="md"><p>I am curious about these fires and it does make me scratch my head. I did fire damage clean up in Santa Barbara during the two fires around 2008. What I did notice then was that, yes, houses and cars would be burned to a crisp and many times plants and trees  near by still left green and untouched. So I don&#39;t find that point particularly sketchy. But it did seem that the 2008 fires did have obvious enough paths of destruction for the most part, but it the Montecito hills the winds can change directions very suddenly and the fire paths could take some unpredictable routes that seemed very surprising. But with these fires atm, it seems people are explaining that a lot of times there were no obvious paths the fires took, and some houses would get burned and some wouldn&#39;t. So to me, that would be the most curious part and not necessarily pointing out the trees would be left green next to an inferno. I can&#39;t explain it myself but I saw that enough that I just chalked it up to the mysteries of mother nature.</p>
