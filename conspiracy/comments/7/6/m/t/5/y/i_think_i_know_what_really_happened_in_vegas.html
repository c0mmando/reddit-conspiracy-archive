       Ok this is kind of fucked up, but bear with me. I'm bad at explaining myself but will do my best.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nobody died in Vegas. I checked 4 Facebook pages of people who died and they were bullshit accounts. There were actors, and they even started freaking out before any shots were fired. Running in one direction. That's why there was drills and shit too before. Some of the pictures are more than likely from the day before. I also believe I heard all the bodies were in the same general are. People probably had blood packs and "EMT's" go out to help them and what not. There is no second shooter. There isn't any shooter. It sounds different because of some bullshit thing the police use (check 2nd video). This is some Sandy Hook shit, except they were more prepared (added 2nd shooter, 4th floor, etc.) because they don't care what you believe as long as you believe people died. Order through chaos. As long as you think people died there is fear. There was even those tents actors usually chill under. I'm not claiming to know the reason I'm just saying I think it's literally all bullshit. At the very most they shot at some peoples legs to injure a few. Is Stephen Paddock even real? There was a post here about the picture they use on the news. Something about the nostrils. It's probably photoshopped around the brothers image. When I heard the brothers interview the first time, I knew in my heart something was wrong.

       Right on man. This is SH on steroids. Some funfax, the girl warning people that they were going to die is your standard Harbinger - a person who warns of impending doom during a sacrificial offering. I'm not buying a single victims report or profile. The main highlighted victim had their funeral at a fucking high school, with four pics showing six people hugging with no tears. Dry eyed bullshit... People can scream "asshole, I know a person who had their head blown off!" all they want. Fuck them. I've studied those posters' history too, and they are fucking liars. Your heart tells you it's a joke, because it's a fucking joke.

       THANK YOU! I'm so happy someone else sees it. My theory goes farther, but I want to take it one step at a time. This is most important. And yes, I've seen lots of "YOU SICK FUCK I KNOW SOMEONE WHO KNOWS SOMEONE!" But yes it's lies. They can change the story everyday and you will still think people died. I think all these actors work in the UN that's why their English is very good. Don't they have their own towns? Army? Maybe that's why they're trying so hard to disarm. They know their army would get blasted by the citizens. Maybe these UN people are he actors and that's why nobody knows them. And they come from different backgrounds too. And I would assume they all know English, as that's part of the UN's one language goal as well. This shit goes way too deep.

       I'll be blunt here and say that these posts are completely ridiculous and only serve to hurt the investigation into the Las Vegas shootings. There are many, many pictures and videos showing actual injured and dead. People have posted on here their own experiences at the concert, I have even encountered people who had family members attending. There is absolutely no reason to use actors for these events when it is so easy to have a few CIA goons or a victim of MK ULTRA mind control rain down bullets on innocent people.

       Did you see the video? Both?
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course there's reason. It could even be to see what we could take. And if they kill people, and it comes out, it looks worse than finding out the truth is they didn't kill people.

       I didn't bother with the videos because I have already seen many videos taken first hand on the ground during the shootings and I have no reason to believe these were faked or the people involved actors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really understand your second point here. The government being involved at all in this event, be it using actors or hitmen, makes them look bad. People aren't going to have a varying range of reaction to this. The way I look at all of these events is that the elite, like everyone when planning an event, are going to go the smoothest route possible that leaves as little witnesses or loose ends as possible. They could simply get a few hitmen from the CIA, trained professional killers who could easily pull off an operation like this and not give a shit they were firing into a crowd full of civilians or they could contract hundreds of actors, presumably normal people with no government connections, and hope they are okay with following through in such a vile and manipulative act. The first way leaves little to no witnesses and you have absolutely no worries of someone fibbing while the second way leaves hundreds of loose ends as you have to rely on not only the actors themselves keeping quiet but all their relations as well and possibly non-actors in the crowd who could spot a fake injury.

       No, but let us say for instance it is legal to propagandize the general public and in the eyes of the law if no death occurred could we hold the government liable? Actually since it is legal to spread propaganda within the united states by the united states government it doesn't specify which form that propaganda would take. Further more do we have any recourse?

       Since when have the elite ever cared for this nation's laws or constitution? Conspiracy, by definition, is an already agreed upon decision to cross these boundaries. The elite aren't going to go through some legal loopholes just so if they were found out they could go "Ha, gotcha!", they will just contract a few professional CIA hitmen to carry out the dirty work, like they have done on record, many times throughout history.

       I don't know how they conduct themselves. I don't know if the TPTB have people that try to remain within the law as to not draw too much attention, I mean if they have the power to shape law, would it be so outside of the realm of possiblity that they would operate within the laws they enact? As to put on a show for the people to say haha you caught us but it is perfectly legal see. then show why it was legal for them to  do so. Obviously this isn't suppose to be out until much latter down the line. Just saying you can't just discount that possibility because you have a preconceived notion on how TPTB operate.

       Again, you are not understanding what would happen in real life if 500 people were sprayed with bullets at a concert in vegas. There would be thousands of lawsuits and screaming angry victims and their families gathered at the concert site, demanding answers, screaming bloody murder that "their young daughter or son was just blown away here, and WHO did it!", etc, etc. But it's crickets, isn't it. You just don't get it mate. Maybe you need to get out more. Open up that third eye a bit.

       But there is reaction from these families. Many prefer to keep quiet and mourn in private, some go vocal and campaign for tighter gun laws and some reach out through the news networks or social media. I don't really think the first thing on their minds would be filling a lawsuit for an obviously unpreventable and unforeseen event. For you to have the nerve to call me out for being out of touch is cute.

       How do you explain the lack of bodies at the 17 hospitals involved? Thats the biggest whole in this theory. The staff at all the hospitals would be pretty suspivipus when np victims show up.

       They can't prove this though. Maybe that's why they did it? Maybe there are doctors complaining, but where are you gonna hear about it. There were other shootings to keep cops and stuff busy?

       Hospitals would be expecting bodies. When they didnt show doctors would talk. Within 24 hours it would be known that no one died.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think all of the doctors and nurses would shrug it off? Not one would go to a local news station?
      </p>

       Much safer to kill people. Faking this event would be a massive failure. So many things could and likely would go wrong.

       If anyone making such bold claims can back up these claims and prove that a single person on this list are crisis actors or that they were already dead..or even anything out of place with the time line, let's see the proof.

      <p>
       No, I'm not a shill. I'm just of the opinion that if a false flag took place crisis actors are loose ends. Would be easier to not have to worry about those loose ends,  so actual genocide seems more plausible.

       Dude, you don't get it many of the victims group up in the cities they are from, and have family, and friends there, they were reletives of local business owners, some fresh out of high school. Those people are gone forever, your telling me they just took the deal of a lifetime, playing crisis actors, and will never be able to go home again?

       Because I'm not going to dox 50 dead victims post there, and there families info on here, go look for yourself, many are having public services, that are reported by there local media, anyone could show up to them, and see for them self. I'm sure at least might be having open casket funeral, but I'm not in to that sort of thing, do it yourself!
