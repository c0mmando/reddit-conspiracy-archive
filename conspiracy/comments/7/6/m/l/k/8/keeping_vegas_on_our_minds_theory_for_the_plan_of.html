        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>On the last night of the concert, the people behind this attack knew security would close off Las Vegas Blvd. Many festivals across the US operate differently at closing on their last night. Exits are typically limited. The shooters knew this. There would be only two exits, both in close proximity, leaking the concert goers onto Giles at Ali Baba.</p>

<p>According to Rocky Palermo&#39;s testimony, the Las Vegas Blvd entrances were closed off by chain link fences minutes prior to the shooting. This was an event staff acting as planned, as festivals closing their last night, typically will go by their original guidelines.[note: this is to expedite the tear down process of a festival] Rocky stated that on the previous nights, attendees were able to leave through the entrances on Las Vegas Blvd. Being the last night of the festival, our shooters knew they would not be afforded that luxury.</p>

<p>After the shooter(s) in Mandalay Bay see the gates close off the entrances on LV Blvd, they know the plan is in motion. The concert now only has one exit. Giles St.</p>

<p>Mandalay Bay opens fire. A few semi-automatic shots to confuse the crowd. When Aldean starts his final song of the night, Mandalay Bay starts raining down automatic fire. This was planned as such, and that last song was the queue.</p>

<p>As concert-goers frantically try to flee in every direction, they are all herded into their only escape on Giles. People hopped fences, pushed through, and trampled one another, to get out of the line of fire. This is where the next team comes in.</p>

<p>A shooter is waiting for the crowd to reach Giles from atop the Catholic Shrine. Their shots are placed in close proximity to wall off the majority from fleeing towards the Tropicana. Mandalay Bay continues suppression fire, targeting officers on the ground at times.</p>

<p>Now, confused and frightened, the majority of the crowd moves towards the airport, because despite the panic, they subconsciously knew where the danger was coming from, and that was their safest out. They know they have fire coming from behind, and now from their left, and it chases them as they flee to safety.</p>

<p>Eye witnesses have described the feeling of the shots getting closer and chasing them.. because they were. These shooters were herding the concert goers as planned. Directly towards the fuel tanks.</p>

<p>The tannerite in Paddock&#39;s car was supposed to be parked next to the tanks, specifically the tank closest to the Shrine, which was easily accessible from all 3 open sides. When the majority of the crowd was close enough to the tanks, they were to ignite the vehicle, blowing the fuel tanks, and killing everyone within the blast radius.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t tell you WHO or WHY, but this is the theory I&#39;m operating on in this moment, until proven implausible. I&#39;m well aware the investigation has denied the presence of two shooters. Without two shooters, much of the witness testimony does not make sense to even the concert goers themselves. While witness testimony is unreliable, it&#39;s also very difficult to believe there are so many accounts of multiple shooters without substance.</p>

<p>You tell me, are we on the right track?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have absolutely 0 leads to that answer. Would really help to understand the situation with Paddock&#39;s vehicle leaving the parking garage while his room was accessed by his keycard, any known acquaintances to him in the area at the time, and who put the tannerite in his car. </p>

<p>Really the first step would be reviewing the parking garage footage to ensure he drove his car at all times throughout his stay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Is the statement that the car was supposed to be next to the fuel tanks part of your theory, or substantiated info? </p>

<p>You have a very intriguing set of circumstances and I&#39;m curious where it might lead. I&#39;m not yet ready to consider multiple shooters, as there&#39;s too much possibility of witness testimony being affected by emotion, lack of understanding of acoustics, and the setting (a city full of flashy-blinky lights and mirrored, close-set buildings). It is these same settings that could be used intentionally, to shed doubt on witness credibility, to make it more difficult to identify where shots eminated from...and for that I don&#39;t completely close the doors on the possibility of more shooters.</p>

<p>I keep throwing out this detail for debate but haven&#39;t seen it get much conversation - the shooter had multiple cell phones - was he going to use them to detonate the chems in his car? Maybe as backup in case he couldn&#39;t hit the target?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>100% part of my theory. There is no evidence pointing towards the use of the tannerite to my knowledge, other than the LVMPD acknowledging the shooter was specifically targeting that fuel tank. </p>

<p>You bring up a very valid point on the multiple phones. I&#39;m not quite sure. If I ran with the theory I&#39;ve presented, which I&#39;d imagine is still flawed, I think placing one as a detonator would be reasonable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I saw bits and pieces on that but it seemed to be debunked because the plate matched. Not 100% sure. Worth looking into. If he had two vehicles with him, that makes the scenario of detonating one more feasible. Although, that would lessen the intelligence of our attacker(s), considering the amount of surveillance in LV.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just as far as position. Were they abandoned because of the incident? Those white ones with blue roof were totally empty yesterday, and they were shitty enough I would believe they were soon to be demolished to build something else.

<p>What do you think of the rumour of automatic gunfire being pumped through the speakers with the shooters not located in Mandalay Bay at all?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Firecrackers seem possible, and could be what we hear in some of the videos. If they were single-shot type firecrackers. I don&#39;t hear any black-cat type. Gio and Kym both alluded to firecrackers before. Is it possible they heard the semi-automatic fire? Or, is it possible we&#39;re hearing fireworks and not semi-automatic fire prior to the last song? </p>

<p>I&#39;ve got no glaring suspicion towards the &#39;who&#39; is behind this, yet. I&#39;m not even sure Paddock was a shooter. Gunshot wound to the chest to commit suicide doesn&#39;t make sense. I think it&#39;s more likely he was sniped, or shot in the room. So then we have those last 2 rounds to speculate on, assuming he wasn&#39;t dead prior to those shots. It&#39;s a mess and I&#39;m trying to make out what could have been with very limited information. Trying to make sense of it and the attack phase has the most information available to look through. </p>

<p>One last note: I don&#39;t believe the suite window was broken until at least 3 minutes after the automatic fire began, for what it&#39;s worth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great job. Leaving this here as a bookmark because I want to write a real response when I get to my computer, but am afraid I&#39;ll never find this thread again. You should cross-post to one of the dedicated subs for the Vegas shooting (<a href="/r/LVtheories">/r/LVtheories</a>, <a href="/r/sinconsistencies">/r/sinconsistencies</a>, <a href="/r/LasVegasFalseFlag">/r/LasVegasFalseFlag</a>), since it will quickly get buried by all the mindless re-posted junk on here. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My brother says the tripod set-up over Paddock’s dead body is designed to shoot from a prone position on the ground, and would not be good for shooting out a window accurately.  Also, why is the tripod set up over his foot and another gun underneath his upper legs? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just as far as position. Were they abandoned because of the incident? Those white ones with blue roof were totally empty yesterday, and they were shitty enough I would believe they were soon to be demolished to build something else. If they were previously empty, it would not have had as many witnesses. And it looks super easy to get in.</p>
