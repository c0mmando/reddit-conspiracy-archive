       I feel like folks are missing the real conspiracy.  They're focusing on vaccines, which are actually very effective and don't make them a lot of money. We've got the pharmaceutical industry selling opiates, and also selling treatments like suboxone, and selling the antidote for overdoses.

       the fucked up part is they don't even want us high, they want us on maintenance drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       like ii don't understand, you want to enslave people give them the good shit. then they wont care what happens. if they really wanna enslave us, openly sell crack and heroin, make it legal and encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
       but nope, gotta be miserable AND addicted. thanks government, for the illusion of security.
      </p>

       theres still health consequences to maintenance drugs, and if I can choose that why shouldn't I be able to choose actual drugs to get high if I'm killing myself anyways?

       It's because cancer is not one thing.  Cancer of the breast is not the same as cancer of the prostate, or bone cancer is not like lymphoma.
      </p>

       Too many rich people have died of cancer.  If there were a cure, for example, Steve Jobs could have bought it. He already gamed the system getting his liver transplant.

       Opioid epidemic is a cover for mass drugging and diagnosis of unproven disorders. Fake pills were more affective. A side bonus is that when people addicted to pain meds run-out, they buy heroin to relieve pain.
      </p>
      <p>
       another "bonus" that no body wants to discuss, is how people addicted to drugs will to anything to get them.

       The whistleblower seemed naively surprised. I thought it is common knowledge that these creeps have no conscience but lots of bucks. Congress critters have no conscience and need those bucks for campaigns. Of course they passed legislation to muzzle the DEA. Of course they kicked the whistleblower to the curb for daring impugn their integrity, although I don't know why they care. I'm sure they sleep so soundly at night with so much blood on their hands that if everybody else was like them, the makers of ambien would never sell another pill.

       A large enough group backed with financing can lobby in any state to get laws passed for profit.

       Yes but also for good. At the core it’s very democratic, pooling resources for people with similar objectives to increase the loudness of their voice. We should reduce the effectiveness of the abusers of corporate lobbying not eliminate the whole mechanism.

       I think officials should take advice from generalized, public, open debates that should be televised and broadcast over the internet, on a variety of subjects weekly instead of the tragedy we call news.
      </p>
      <p>
       you know, get randomized groups, truly randomly selected in an unbiased fashion (with peer review of the methodologies) and actually open up matters of debate with them from different places in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       remove lobbying, because you can easily equally represent industry and common people both independently as groups and separately. and allow for dialogue between all groups involved.

       The irony is the only way to push for it to be illegal is to lobby for it. Since that's actually the only way to get anything done in this trashy government. So basically it'll never happen. If you're big enough to get that kind've pull you're also probably big enough to abuse it in your favor.

       Yeah we can talk about how our war on drugs proliferates the problem. We could also take the correlation that since we been in war in the Middle East, mainly Afghanistan that the rise of opioid epidemic coincides. Why is this? I also have questions as to why we have so many back dated rape kits that haven't been processed while we militarize the police to combat the "war on drugs". I have a lot of questions on this topic. Why are we so concerned on what people willingly put in their body. Who are we protecting? If anything removing the stigma from addiction would go a lot further to help address it than arresting people. So really what are we doing?

       A natural tool for helping opiate addicts recover has been given almost no attention; kratom.  Kratom trees are native to areas in South East Asia, Indonesia and Bali.  Their leafs contain various alkaloids that are similar to opiate alkaloids, but different.  The mature leaves are picked, dried, and ground into powder which is then prepared as teas, beverages, and capsules.  The trees are harvested in a responsible manor so no harm comes to them.  Most kratom trees are also wild rather than gown on farms, so the leafs are basically organic for the most part.  Users consume the powder and about 45min later it kicks in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Kratom has the ability to greatly reduce dope sickness.  It provides enough alkaloids to act as a opiate maintenance medication for many people.  You can't really overdose because you'll vomit before you'll consume a lethal dose.  Dosage does not need to be regularly increased to maintain potency and most users take a regular dose on a regular schedule without experiencing noteworthy tolerance.  Withdrawal symptoms from long term kratom use are 1/10 of what you'd experience from an acute opiate withdrawal.  Tapering eliminates almost all symptoms.  A typical bout of dope sickness from kratom usually consists of 1-3 days with a mild runny nose and minor muscle aches - the symptoms are similar to the final day of a light cold / flu.  It's a night and day difference from opiates.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm coming up to my 4th year clean of opiates and alcohol.  I take a small daily regime of kratom as a maintenance drug, and have absolutely no desire to use pain medication again.  Every now and then I take a week or two off of kratom (using gradual tapering) and I've hardly even noticed any 'dope sickness'.  This stuff probably saved my life, and certainly increased the quality of my life.  I'm not just sober now, I'm happy about being sober.  And I owe a lot of my success to kratom.

       and try to explain to me how congress could pass a bill like that one so inattentively or carelessly. I am floored and upset that this country and its laws can be bought. I am sick.
