<p>like ii don&#39;t understand, you want to enslave people give them the good shit. then they wont care what happens. if they really wanna enslave us, openly sell crack and heroin, make it legal and encouraged. </p>

<p>but nope, gotta be miserable AND addicted. thanks government, for the illusion of security.</p>

<p>theres still health consequences to maintenance drugs, and if I can choose that why shouldn&#39;t I be able to choose actual drugs to get high if I&#39;m killing myself anyways? </p>

Congress critters have no conscience and need those bucks for campaigns. Of course they passed legislation to muzzle the DEA. Of course they kicked the whistleblower to the curb for daring impugn their integrity, although I don&#39;t know why they care. I&#39;m sure they sleep so soundly at night with so much blood on their hands that if everybody else was like them, the makers of ambien would never sell another pill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think officials should take advice from generalized, public, open debates that should be televised and broadcast over the internet, on a variety of subjects weekly instead of the tragedy we call news.</p>

<p>you know, get randomized groups, truly randomly selected in an unbiased fashion (with peer review of the methodologies) and actually open up matters of debate with them from different places in society.</p>

<p>remove lobbying, because you can easily equally represent industry and common people both independently as groups and separately. and allow for dialogue between all groups involved.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah we can talk about how our war on drugs proliferates the problem. We could also take the correlation that since we been in war in the Middle East, mainly Afghanistan that the rise of opioid epidemic coincides. Why is this? I also have questions as to why we have so many back dated rape kits that haven&#39;t been processed while we militarize the police to combat the &quot;war on drugs&quot;. I have a lot of questions on this topic. Why are we so concerned on what people willingly put in their body. Who are we protecting? If anything removing the stigma from addiction would go a lot further to help address it than arresting people. So really what are we doing?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A natural tool for helping opiate addicts recover has been given almost no attention; kratom.  Kratom trees are native to areas in South East Asia, Indonesia and Bali.  Their leafs contain various alkaloids that are similar to opiate alkaloids, but different.  The mature leaves are picked, dried, and ground into powder which is then prepared as teas, beverages, and capsules.  The trees are harvested in a responsible manor so no harm comes to them.  Most kratom trees are also wild rather than gown on farms, so the leafs are basically organic for the most part.  Users consume the powder and about 45min later it kicks in.</p>

<p>Kratom has the ability to greatly reduce dope sickness.  It provides enough alkaloids to act as a opiate maintenance medication for many people.  You can&#39;t really overdose because you&#39;ll vomit before you&#39;ll consume a lethal dose.  Dosage does not need to be regularly increased to maintain potency and most users take a regular dose on a regular schedule without experiencing noteworthy tolerance.  Withdrawal symptoms from long term kratom use are 1/10 of what you&#39;d experience from an acute opiate withdrawal.  Tapering eliminates almost all symptoms.  A typical bout of dope sickness from kratom usually consists of 1-3 days with a mild runny nose and minor muscle aches - the symptoms are similar to the final day of a light cold / flu.  It&#39;s a night and day difference from opiates.</p>

<p>I&#39;m coming up to my 4th year clean of opiates and alcohol.  I take a small daily regime of kratom as a maintenance drug, and have absolutely no desire to use pain medication again.  Every now and then I take a week or two off of kratom (using gradual tapering) and I&#39;ve hardly even noticed any &#39;dope sickness&#39;.  This stuff probably saved my life, and certainly increased the quality of my life.  I&#39;m not just sober now, I&#39;m happy about being sober.  And I owe a lot of my success to kratom.</p>
