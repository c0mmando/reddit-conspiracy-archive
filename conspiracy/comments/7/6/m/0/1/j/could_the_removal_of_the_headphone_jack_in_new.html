       tbh I don't think it broadcasts far. its also very inconvenient...
      </p>
      <p>
       Bluetooth headsets are likely already easily compromised anyways, as well as the phone itself...
      </p>
      <p>
       its just a cash grab because apples whole business is and always has been (since the death of the IIGS, and next the death of the PowerMac) a business based solely around overpriced hardware, and apple-controlled software distribution networks, as well as very specific apple only accessories.
      </p>
      <p>
       external hardware a trillion times apples quality exists, and even comparable at the lower end outside of apple. and the technology is interchangeable and all based off open standards.
      </p>
      <p>
       apple has always been fond of intentionally excluding mainstream compatibility and trying to lock users into their iLife platform.
      </p>
      <p>
       want speakers? you need iSpeakers, compatible only with iStuff. and iTV, compatible ONLY with iShit... etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       it limits market competition, they only get away with it because people are ignorant and think its stylish. in android and PC competition is fierce unless it gets like AMD/Intel or ATI/Nvidia and people become complacent...
      </p>
      <p>
       motherboards, ram, etc are all cheap and plentiful. hardware that can interface with anything you can imagine exists at lower OR higher cost than apple, depending how serious of a prosumer you are.

       We're at a point now where phones are already able to be "too thin". Even if the newest iPhone is thicker (is it?), leaving the 3.5mm jack out gives them extra space to play with in engineering it. Even if they plan from the beginning to make it thicker, the headphone jack takes up quite a bit of internal space that could otherwise be given to other components.

       That sounds legit. I mean there must be a reason why the major phone manufacturers removed the jack at almost the same time. It definitely wasn't to make it thinner, more convenient or have better audio quality. So what is it then?

       It's cheaper to manufacture phones without redundant hardware. If they can say "you don't need a headphone jack because you have bluetooth", that's a feature that they don't need to spend money developing or supporting, not to mention that it frees up space within the device's body, making it easier to engineer the guts of it. I think they're just trying to maximize profits by making cheaper products.

       And it's not like other products don't still have the jack even if some manufacturers are removing it from some of their products. If the 3.5mm jack stops being an industry standard, then there might be something to this idea, but there are still plenty of options that have it. If you don't want to use bluetooth, you don't have to, just buy a device that has the 3.5mm jack.

       The phone jack is a victim of phone anorexia.  The headphone jack is too fat.

       I saw a video somewhere of Edward Snowden and he was saying if you want to use your phone without being eavesdropped on or having your phone spy on you sorry when you're not using it was to disable the microphone and both the cameras physically and then use earbuds plug in your buds and use them when you make calls and unplug them when you're done and in this way you can avoid being listened to through your microphones
