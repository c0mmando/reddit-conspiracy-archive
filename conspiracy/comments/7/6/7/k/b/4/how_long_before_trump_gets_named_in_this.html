       He flew on it twice.  Shortly after returning from his second trip, Trump banned Jeffrey Epstein from Mar-a-Lago.  This was ~2 years before Epstein's degeneracy was made public.

       I have seen them...  I'd dig it up but it's not unusual for Trump, a billionaire celebrity, to have been invited to a very exclusive party-island.  The fact that he only went twice and then basically cut all ties to the guy tells me that Trump is most likely clean.

       There is no evidence that I've ever scene that Trump went to Epsteins island, only testimony from Epsteins brother that Trump flew on the plane once and didn't deplane at the island, instead continuing on to NYC.
      </p>

       Believe me, if you have evidence you should show it, because people have been making this claim for over a year and not one person has been able to show proof.

       you may be right.  I saw the name circled on a notepad page in some image.  i never validated it because, again, it wouldn't be unusual for him to have been invited.  The unusual part is that Trump severed ties with him almost 2 years before the trafficking scandal broke.

      <p>
       The hollywood/DC elite who have decades of more heinous allegations against them all united against him.  That's the side you've chosen in this...  So keep doing their dirty work.  I'm on board with attacking Trump once you've substantiated a claim against him.  Until then, it's all of the people I know are dregs calling him a dreg based on, what?  The fact that he talked shit in a manner all (actual) men talk shit?

       It's cool man most conspiracy theorists seem to be conservative. Trumps their guy. Apparently he's the only not corrupt politician to ever exist. He's about to cut his own taxes. Hopefully that will trickle down to his middle America fans.

       Multiple woman have come out against everyone with money. Dont you think its wierd how all came at once? And how many of them retracted their accusation. I dont think anyone over the age of 17 havent said anything that resembles what he said in that tape, get a fucking grip. All the liberals screaming at him, have you seen all the filthy shit all your heroes on SNL and the others are doing, and have been doing for years? Jimmy Kimmels the man show, thats 10 times more worse then anything trump have ever been accused of.

       Trump travelled with Epstein once, we all know how that guy is, and two weeks later, Trump banned Epstein from Mar-la-Go.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you would like, I can find the press conference Trump held, explicitly talking about the big human trafficking and paedophilia problem, both international and domestically.

       Use your imagination. You are going for the most obvious outcome.

       Scenario : Weinstein was behind allegations of Trumps sexual assault, turned out to be lies(?). Trump, now President, has put events into play as revenge across a range of political and business enemies.

       Unlikely. He’s not that stupid. If there’s a sex tape, Putin has it...or someone else who’s benefiting from Trump being in office. When the benefit disappears, then it will surface. It may not be with someone underage, but I’m betting it will show seriously abusive behavior. Trump”s already on record, having done that with his first wife.

       I meant not stupid about having sex with a minor.  Either that, or it happened a long time ago, and there’s no tape. He’s relatively careful about his image...it matters to him. He also distanced himself from the Lolita express guy. If I remember correctly, he flew twice on it.
       <em>
        Maybe
       </em>
       something will come from that but I doubt it. If it happens, I’m guessing it will be about Trump’s abusive behavior with women. He beat the shit out of Marla Maples.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as being a politician, he’s a bumbling, insecure temperamental idiot.
