        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>During the show of the two Coreys, The two are arguing about the past relating to sexual abuse... Well Haim says himself that he was 14 1/2 when he was being raped by a guy Feldman used to hang around with.(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlZxPPzjIb0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlZxPPzjIb0</a> )&lt;around the 0:50 mark&gt;...not to say he was not first raped by someone at the age 11.. well I researched very thoroughly about the film Lucas that Haim starred in with Sheen, and it was filmed during the summer of 1985...Haims bday is 12/23/71... my calculations show me that he was exactly 14 1/2 during summer (jULY 1985) And yes, I have confirmed this on a fun facts and trivia site where it gives a fact that while shooting a scene with football players it was very hot on a day in July. Given this info along with some other clues here: <a href="http://www.yourtango.com/2016295693/3-clues-identity-corey-haim-corey-feldman-hollywood-pedophile-abuser">http://www.yourtango.com/2016295693/3-clues-identity-corey-haim-corey-feldman-hollywood-pedophile-abuser</a> 
Plus facts that were uncovered from a legal document submitted by ex wife denise Richardson detailing events where she uncovered Sheens liking to underage girls AND boys which she also states Sheen admitted to but wanted her to just shrug it off as no big deal... There are other clues that make me believe that Sheen is the one who put Haim thru hell with the sexual abuse...</p>

A 20 year old in 1985 was a grown man for the most part and when your the 20 year old son of big name actor with lots of money and power growing up and living your life in that cesspool of toxicity it&#39;s extremely believable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well this just isn&#39;t true. The male brain doesn&#39;t fully develop its frontal cortex until the mid 20&#39;s. That didn&#39;t change in the last 30 years, that&#39;s just the way people mature. </p>

<p>I get it, you don&#39;t like young people, but the fantasies you believe about the past aren&#39;t reality. I was born around 85 and at 20 I was in school, by 23 I had moved 600 miles from home where I knew no one. I worked three jobs to make ends meet and I didn&#39;t sleep much. </p>

<p>Fast forward a few years and I have a good job, I own a home, I&#39;m married and I have a kid. I did it myself, not much older than 20. </p>

<p>You very clearly have a view that young people aren&#39;t as &quot;good&quot; as people who are in their 50&#39;s. That is pretty easy to see from what you typed. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>And who says you have to have a fully developed frontal cortex to rape younger kids?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if you had a hard time reading what I wrote but nowhere in my statement did I say Sheen (or any 20 year old) couldn&#39;t have done this. The point I was arguing was the idea you laid forth that young people 30 years ago had some ability that young people today don&#39;t. That&#39;s asinine. Your frontal cortex controls a lot of what you do and how you act, so no, 30 years ago 20 year old&#39;s weren&#39;t &quot;grown men for the most part&quot; they were the same, the time was different but their ability as &quot;men&quot; was the same. </p>

<p>Oddly, before I heard about Charlie potentially being an abuser, I had heard this Martin Sheen story on Opie and Anthony:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyruz1YyeOk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eyruz1YyeOk</a></p>

<p>While it&#39;s not much, for some reason, the end part where he comments about the kid walking by the door, I thought to myself, that sounds like something a fucking pedophile would say, even though the guys took it as some overly dramatic bullshit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Whoever first floated this is trying to deflect from some older producer/director. Charlie Sheen was more of a peer to the Corey&#39;s than a power figure. I really do think it&#39;s disinfo, in large part successful bc of Sheen being a complete hot mess now. It&#39;s some older producer, like Joel Schumacher or someone. The Coreys(and Brad Renfro, many others) were in several of his films. He&#39;s notoriously creepy. And now Renfro and Haim are both dead. I&#39;d bet that there&#39;s a producer/director behind the original &quot;blind item&quot; about an A List actor. Of course it&#39;s only natural to pin this shit on &quot;the talent&quot;. The talent is used and abused. They aren&#39;t the abusers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure why Rob Reiner always comes up. To me it always seems like people are just being contrarian with that guess. I think the same thing with the Spielberg and Hanks guesses. Nothing about either of them fit. None of the clues or ages really fit. I know Feldman worked on The Burbs with Hanks but Carrie Fisher worked on that with them and all accounts of how she handled shit says she would never let that kind of shit go down. Feldman says they were close and she looked out for him. So, I think that takes Hanks out of the running right there. IMO he would not have such fond memories of anyone on that set if someone was letting him get fucked around. He has said some bad things about Charlie Sheen but it&#39;s entirely possible Sheen is just a huge asshole and treated them like shit as kids. I think we all know Sheen is a huge asshole so that could be all it was. Maybe he was really cruel and maybe Sheen was the consensual acts of sex that Haim talked about. 
By all accounts Haim was mad that Feldman was friends with the abuser and introduced them, or at least one of them. Hanks would not fit that timeline because the Burbs came way later than the first alleged incident. The Burbs was filmed in 88 when they were 17, they weren&#39;t little kids by that point anymore. Spielberg really wouldn&#39;t fit either (as far as age) and again that just seems contrarian. Rob Reiner and Feldman still have a good relationship and have been photographed together recently, which I doubt would be happening if he was the rapist. One of them would want to stay away from the other I would think, especially with all the talk of rape Corey has been putting out there. 
Haim mentioned his rape happening at 14 by a 42 year old man, that rules out Speilberg, Reiner, and Hanks. Feldman said Haim was molested at 11 for the first time. I don&#39;t think Haim had come in contact with Reiner or Speilberg until much later than that so that would rule them out. David Nicksay fits and that seems to be the only person that fits as far as age and timing. 
I used to think Schumacher as well but Feldman seems to have ruled him out with some comments he made about how he would have been protective has he known what was going on. His age also doesn&#39;t fit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I read an interview with Corey Haim where he said that Robert Downey, Jr. had “taken him in” at the age of 10 and he went to live with him and Sarah Jessica Parker for a year. In a totally unrelated piece, I saw mention of RDJr.s homosexuality being an “open secret” in Hollywood. He is married to a woman now, but appeared to have been previously married to a trans woman. Sheen will not get busted for Haim, but it’s entirely possible that people will start crawling out of the woodwork now that Pandora’s Box has been opened—as they have with Weinstein and others. Is there any doubt there are others with this guy? He already admitted he’d been paying people to keep quiet. These were women, but now that we have many men coming forward in other cases, I think it is only a matter of time. It is interesting to note that Charlie Sheen’s father has been married to the same unattractive woman for many years—that is nearly unheard of in Hollywood. He is also a devout Catholic (cough) and took on a homosexual role In the early 70s when doing so meant taking a considerable risk with his career. He has played gay men more than once.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes but from what I understand he always had nothing but nice things to say about RDJ. While I wouldn&#39;t doubt that RDJ has messed around with men, especially during his drug days, that doesn&#39;t make him a pedophile. Let&#39;s stop equating pedophilia with homosexuality because they are not the same thing. All pedophiles are not gay and all gay people are not pedophiles. Pedophilia is an entirely different thing. I&#39;ve never heard the Trans thing and I doubt it since he has a child with his first wife. Transsexuals cannot get pregnant so it would be impossible for his first wife to be Trans. That just sounds like a crazy rumor, and again being married to a Trans women does not make you gay or a pedophile. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>heres more of my homework....</p>

<p>In a recent interview about his fallen friend, Corey reflects on how the media had and has treated Haim&#39;s career and personal issues and brings up a parallel between him and Charlie Sheen. Though he doesn&#39;t call Charlie out on his issues, per say, he does insist that there is a double standard when it comes to celebrities. He explains:</p>

<p>&quot;Well I have to be completely honest and say, I&#39;m not a huge fan of Charlie Sheen. I don&#39;t make it my goal to ever talk badly in the press, we&#39;re all in it together, that&#39;s the way I look at it, but Charlie in particular, especially the way that he&#39;s affected other people that I know — point blank, Charlie and Corey started their careers pretty much together, and Corey fought for his entire life to recover from those early experiences and to get his life together.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well human memory is notoriously unreliable and rape convictions unfortunately rely solely on witness testimony. And part of the reason that people are put in prison is to protect the public from them. If someone hasn&#39;t committed crimes in decades, one can reason they are not much of a threat to the public. It&#39;s not really fair for someone to claim you murdered or raped someone 20-40 years after the fact all things considered, although I can understand how frustrating it is to know something is true but to not be able to act upon those facts. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think statue of limitations really has anything to do with protecting rapist specifically. I fairly confident that it&#39;s about what is legally admissible, and provable. Our memories are not concrete representations of the past and things like the <em>mandala effect</em> highlight this. The past is almost an abstraction and seems moreso the farther we are from it. </p>

He literally destroyed the part of the brain that regulates impulse control.

    <div class="md"><p>Corey Feldman made the statement that Haim was taken between two trailers and sodomized.  They had taken  a break between takes while on the set of Lucas, which was filmed in Illinois. This limits the number of people who were around Corey at the time.  If it&#39;s not Charlie, could it have been Martin, who may have been visiting Charlie?  </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s insane people keep throwing out names like Clint Eastwood and Spielberg when they were not a part of that film and most likely not hanging around in Illinois.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the clues that I’ve gathered (A-lister, mogul, powerful, mid-40’s at the time, family man, household name, still active today), I wonder if it might be someone like Robert De Niro... or at least someone with that kind of presence and in that same age range. It’d be disappointing if it was him though since I’m a huge fan.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have to agree. Charlie could well be one guy who had sex with Haim at 14. But both Coreys talked of a beloved Hollywood figure, a family man with children, someone beyond reproach and an A-lister. I read specifically somewhere that CH was raped &quot;at 11 by a 42 year old powerful man.&quot; (Sorry, I can&#39;t find the source at the moment.) Haim was born in 71. This means he was raped in 1982. Simple math. A 42 year old in 1982 was born in 1940. Google &quot;actors born in 1940.&quot; Martin Sheen is the only one that fits the bill, as much as it sucks if true. Several have already suggested MS. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Corey also called him a well respected family man. Charlie Sheen would hardly qualify. At the time Lucas was filming Charlie Sheen was not very powerful either. Even though he came from an acting family I wouldn&#39;t put him in the category of a powerful producer or hollywood bigwig. Martin Sheen was big but I&#39;m not sure this big. I also remember other details being given that the man who raped him was 42 at the time of Haim&#39;s rape which also would not fit Sheen at the time. Haim&#39;s first molestation supposedly took place when he was 11, according to Feldman. When I went back and did the math Schumacher, Brian De Palma, and David Seltzer would fit that. Now it seems there are multiple offenders and multiple incidents though. Haim himself talked about being raped on the set of Lucas and that one happened when he was 14 that I think that is the one he was talking about where his abuser was 42 and he was 14. For that, the only person who fits all the boxes is David Nicksay and he would be a perfect fit for the age of 42 and Haim being 14 at the time. He also is still very successful in Hollywood and Feldman worked with him before Haim did so when Haim accused Feldman of being friends with him before and introducing them that would fit as well. Others have said the Two Coreys were passed around Hollywood for anyone to take a turn so I do think we are definitely looking at more than one or two big names here.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the offenders were all that close in age to the Two Coreys. I think they were at least 15 years older than them or more. Something makes me think that guys like Charlie Sheen, Keifer, RDJ, Rob Lowe, and others might have also fallen victim to this sort of thing as well but they just don&#39;t talk about it. Most of them have or have had major issues with drugs or alcohol and I think most of them wouldn&#39;t talk about it because they would fear what it would do to their careers and being men they are even more reluctant than women to come forward. Most of them continue to have careers so talking about it serves no purpose in their eyes. I also think for guys like Keifer and Sheen the fact that their fathers work in the business with them makes them less likely to say anything if they ever were victims because of the embarrassment. I&#39;m not saying they&#39;re victims for sure but something happened to Sheen to make him so fucked up and it can&#39;t just be Daddy didn&#39;t give him enough attention. I am entirely aware Sheen is an abuser in his own way to many people as well I&#39;m just not sure I peg him for this one. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think you are right and wrong. I think Charlie Sheen probably had a go at Haim but he is not the &quot;big name&quot; that Radar or anyone is looking to reveal.</p>

<p>Radar called him a well respected family man. Charlie Sheen would hardly qualify. At the time Lucas was filming Charlie Sheen was not very powerful either. Even though he came from an acting family I wouldn&#39;t put him in the category of a powerful producer or hollywood bigwig. Martin Sheen was big but I&#39;m not sure this big. The story is that the person smoked pot with Corey and Corey thought he was in love with him and developed a relationship with him. It wasn&#39;t until years later that Corey had realized how wrong it was and how he had been taken advantage of. If there is anyone I could picture being able to do that Martin Sheen does makes sense. He is handsome and very charming. I can&#39;t really see that of Rob Reiner. I love him but not in that way. I think most people find Martin Sheen dreamy. That being said I hope it isn&#39;t him but that is who it&#39;s gonna be right? Someone we are all devastated to learn about. </p>

<p>I think there are several different people we are dealing with here and Charlie could be one of them but I&#39;m not sure he is the &quot;big one&quot; everyone is looking for. 
I also remember other details being given that the man who raped him was 42 at the time which also would not fit either Sheen. Haim&#39;s first molestation supposedly took place when he was 11 and that was a producer according to Feldman. Haim himself talked about being raped when he was 14 by a 42 year old man. For that, David Nicksay would be a perfect fit for the age of 42 and Haim being 14 at the time. He also is still very successful in Hollywood and Feldman worked with him before Haim did so when Haim accused Feldman of being friends with him before and introducing them that would fit as well. Martin Sheen would not fit with with the age and if it happened during the filming of Lucas but if the boys were hanging out with Charlie Sheen that could be it. Again Martin Sheen would definitely fit the description of one of Hollywood&#39;s most respected actors, a family, and most recognizable faces that would shock people. If it&#39;s Martin it could explain why Charlie is so fucked up, he could have been one of his victims and been passed around just the same as the Coreys. 
 Others have said the Two Coreys were passed around Hollywood for anyone to take a turn so I do think we are definitely looking at more than one or two big names here.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think the majority of the offenders were all that close in age to the Two Coreys. I think they were at least 15 years older than them or more. Something makes me think that guys like Charlie Sheen, Keifer, RDJ, Rob Lowe, and others might have also fallen victim to this sort of thing as well but they just don&#39;t talk about it.

I am entirely aware Sheen is an abuser in his own way to many people as well I&#39;m just not sure I peg him for this one as far as the rape. </p>

<p>I do peg him for one of the &quot;consensual acts&quot; or what he believed was consensual. The problem here is that all of this is so convoluted it&#39;s hard to keep track. I think they started messing around and Sheen talked/forced Corey in to anal which traumatized him forever. Since Corey was young and what he was doing was never really consensual it all falls under the category of abuse. He had no clue what the hell he was doing. It&#39;s all very fucked up.  </p>

<p>I think these are the things we do know:
1. Both Corey&#39;s were molested/raped by multiple men 
2. Haim was raped by multiple men in the industry
3. Both of their abusers are known in the industry and still work in the industry 
4. Some or one the abusers are/is a household name/s others are names we would know if we looked at IMDB
5. Haim believed at least some of his encounters to be consensual but at least one went further than he wanted (this may be where Charlie Sheen comes in)
6. One of Haim&#39;s abusers was 42 when he was 14 
7. One of Haim&#39;s abusers is a very well known A list actor to this day and is described by Radar as a family man, one of Hollywood&#39;s biggest actors and recognizable faces. They call him the &quot;kingpin&quot; in a child sex ring. They say he never came out of the closet but that Corey thought he was in love with him and the relationship went on for some time. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea I saw this but Radar&#39;s description still doesn&#39;t fit Sheen. Like I said I&#39;ve never thought Sheen wasn&#39;t capable or the one that was the &quot;consensual&quot; not really consensual act on the set of Lucas but if Sheen is a family man in the Queen of England. They either have another name or intentionally described him in a way that would throw people off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yea and as I said I never doubted he was the one they were describing as &quot;consensual&quot; which was correct. He still doesn&#39;t fit the Radar description.

    <div class="md"><p>My own prediction is that it’s either Kevin Bacon or Matthew Broderick. Both of them had movies filming in Chicago at that time and could’ve maybe been set visiting someone on the Lucas set. </p>

<p>Charlie Sheen was in both Lucas and Ferris Bueller’s Day off, maybe Matthew Broderick was hanging on the Lucas set and took advantage of the situation. </p>

<p>Another feeling is Kevin Bacon. He also had a movie about that time in Chicago (She’s Having a Baby). And while I know he’s an actor and his characters aren’t him, he’s played a pedophile in both Sleepers and The Woodsman...  </p>

<p>I also read several places that the person was a “family man” and I feel like both of those actors really fit that mold.  </p>

<p>Someone sure as hell kicked open the door to Hollywood’s closet. There’s damn skeletons flying everywhere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry for the late reply but i do other shit then come on reddit.Tilapia tale you are a fuckong retarded piece of shit I don&#39;t know o.p and no you definitely don&#39;t know me. Anyway I don&#39;t really understand your reply how could i be op&#39;s sock ? You dumb son of a bitch .You seem what op wrote and got upset because your gay lover Charlie sheen was being bashed.  Yes it sounded as if you were defending Charlie but that&#39;s not the issue . The op clearly has done research more so then you or I it seems. Anyway you are as dumb as Charlies ex Denise Richards it&#39;s as clear as day Charlie is a rapist everyone knows this ..well except you ofcourse there is well documented proof of Charlie and his sick sick ways. op was right and you were wrong I simply asked how you were feeling after op detective skills completely tore your comment to shit ..you are clearly stupid and shouldn&#39;t comment on things you have no idea of ..now go suck Charlies nasty gay aids dick you dirty sperm dragon</p>
