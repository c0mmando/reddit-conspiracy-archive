        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Update: Thank you for EVERY SINGLE comment, explanation, link, etc.  My brain &amp; saved links are full. LOL! I&#39;ve got to go adult now but I&#39;ll be back with lots of questions! </p>

<p>TLDR: I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t believe. A friend shared Navy Seal info &amp; now I&#39;m one of you. </p>

<p>I&#39;m sorry, I was wrong.  This all unraveled this week &amp; this morning and I&#39;m a bit shell shocked.  Although I&#39;ve never publicly addressed any of you, I always thought you &quot;conspiracy freaks&quot; were crazy.  Today the veil was lifted from my eyes &amp; I can NEVER go back. </p>

<p>This past week the Vegas storyline, supposed &quot;facts&quot;, missing Campos, and etc have caused me to start questioning local agencies. Since I wasn&#39;t sure what or who to question, I turned to a friend who is into conspiracies. (He calls them truths.) </p>

<p>As we were talking, a &quot;normal&quot; female friend chimed in. She starting mentioning how the Vegas shooting was 2 days before some gun bill or legislation was about to happen. Confused, I asked if she really thought the government would do something this crazy. 
Here&#39;s what opened my eyes....</p>

<p>Her husband is good friends with a few Navy Seals. Their job was/is to go into foreign countries &amp; make it look like some random dude killed a group of people.  I stopped her and made her say it again. The Seals job is to grab a random person, take him to location &amp; kill him. They make it look like a suicide. Then they get the other people &amp; kill them in the room with the dead guy.  (I&#39;m assuming these are assigned targets, she never explained).  The Seals then said to her husband, &quot;if you don&#39;t think our government isn&#39;t doing this here, to our own people, you&#39;re a fool!&quot;  </p>

<p>This of course let to other conversations &amp; now I&#39;m questioning what happened to Seal Team 6. I will now be reading &amp; keeping an open mind to everything posted here. </p>

<p>Note: We are not bored teenagers. All 3 of us are married with children, aged 30-36, no criminal records. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our troops as well. Too many good young men are indoctrinated used and discarded. I hate what soldiers do but ultimately the blame is not on them. We have all seen the Stanford experiment. (((They))) take advantage of human flaws. Except of course for the troops who are complete pieces of shit. But I feel that percentage is the same 4% sociopath ratio we have in the civilian world, they are just nurtured &amp; protected/promoted in the military and tend to be the scum at the top.</p>

<p>OP Sandy Hook is a complete shit show, the amount of research you have to do is just silly.  While there are a few good documentaries out there so much of it is small details in videos.  Boston Bombing on the other hand we have tons of video &amp; images to pick apart it is easier to just go &quot;fuck, yup that&#39;s fake&quot;. With SH you&#39;ll end up going a little nuts. That is just my opinion(from experience) and I have no doubt I will take flak for saying it.  Both were staged. Besides if your not a walking 9/11 encyclopedia of facts yet we can&#39;t give you the membership card.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many of the republics around the world are based on that last one actually.

    <div class="md"><p>OK, that is fair enough (the last doc was the one I read as it was the closest to a nation&#39;s founding doc.  The other&#39;s were more vision statements by non-states).  Do you have a list of the countries that base their Constitutions off that doc?  The doc itself never made it to &quot;state founding doc&quot; level (but again fair enough, it was close and served as inspiration).</p>

<p>You seem to have some background on this, what are your thoughts on the diff between the two docs?  The French doc didn&#39;t address slavery at all, granting tacit approval, and only applied to men, both of which seemed to be your main argument against the US Constitution.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One step at a time.  If your husband is a history teacher, I would recommend researching Northern European documents pertaining to who was interned, what happened at the internment camps, and what evidence is there by contrast for anything other than &quot;concentration&quot; camps being anything more than work/refugee/pow facilities.  </p>

<p>Ever hear testimony from American POWs in WWII?  Now why is it battle hardened soldiers break down and cry when recollecting the horrors of the Japanese but most holocaust survivors seem to display little emotion when describing their memories?</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll add, the number &quot;6 million&quot; was used heavily in reference to Jews before WWII.  It appears to bear significance to their prophecy in their anticipation of a messiah.  Oddly enough, US foreign policy has been bolstering Israel&#39;s agenda of restoring Zion since the 1950s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I recommend this documentary <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0tnYfBfzB0">Life of Adam</a> free on Youtube. While it&#39;s definitely wrong on many counts, there are nuggets of truth in it that are startling, such as when cops ran activists out of town, and when others were followed by helicopters in Newtown. This was not a case of residents being tired of the attention, these were targeted incidents. It was a cover up -- cover ups are done by having a bunch of operatives spread rumors of a hoax. Then whenever you tell the truth (Adam Lanza was a psy ops victim) people will just group the truth together in their mind with the word hoax. Which it obviously wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Just to let you know, when people use the term MKUltra, there kind of twisting the truth about how psy ops are used today. The truth is that Paddock and many of the other mass shooters were subjects of the counterintelligence disruption program. Although Paddock may actually have been a patsy given the specifics of the Las Vegas event, most of them actually did do it themselves -- after being tortured with very basic tactics that you&#39;d be surprised are so effective. The same stuff they did in Guantanamo and in fact at the water protests last year.</p>

<p>The Intercept is the number one place, and the most credible, concerning those things we know for fact that relate to the actual programs involved. Things like &#39;Disruption,&#39; various whistleblowers and their experiences, Palantir, and various other topics.</p>

And then I came across a 9/11 truther video - thought it might be a joke. And then I started reading, and investigating, feeling out what &#39;conspiracy theories&#39; around 9/11 were the works of nut jobs (and some are), and which had the scary ring of truth about them. Hours later I was completely ruined. At 4am I woke my husband, sobbing my heart out. It&#39;s perfectly normal to feel what you&#39;re feeling. When your eyes are opened, it&#39;s destabilising.

<p>Crying is actually extremely common when a person&#39;s fundamental beliefs are called into question and revised. A friend told me how first year philosophy students all have their &quot;big cry&quot; when they start analyzing their own beliefs in their studies. Kind of a right of passage. I didn&#39;t believe it myself...until a similar thing happened to me. You really do end up crying. Completely normal.</p>

<p>And this <em>is</em> a great nation. &quot;We the People&quot; are strong, and the great American ideals still exist, even if they&#39;ve been trampled and subverted. We know what&#39;s right, and we know what&#39;s just. We only got to get the jackholes out of the cupboards and away from the reins. It&#39;s going to be a fight, but we&#39;re on our way.

<p>I love their work, they do their best to remain objective (as much as anyone can expect from a human) and the facts are laid out alongside some comedy so it&#39;s a win-win. They have a lot of podcasts, some of them are very long, and one is on Sandy Hook.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Take it one step at a time haha, it&#39;s easy to fall into a hole only to come out of it and realize it&#39;s a system of caves... When you dive into 1 conspiracy and really analyze stuff, after a couple cases you start seeing the common threads, common actors or companies involved and then every &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; becomes hard to explain</p>

<p>Saying &quot;Gov did 9/11&quot; is not only too simplistic but technically true and also false as there were multiple parties involved. Saying &quot;9/11 happened so we could go to war for oil&quot; is also very short sighted and really doesn&#39;t explain anything. Even the most advanced researcher on the subject most likely don&#39;t have all the answers...</p>

<p>As for research itself, <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a mixed pot, it&#39;s like mining/searching for jade. You break rocks until you find shiny green. The frontpage is 1/3 decent jade, 1/3 is eh, 1/3 is misinfo/disinfo/propaganda. If you hang around /new/ you might see the occasional pristine info but it will usually get buried in downvotes.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a list of confirmed conspiracies and the likes in the right side bar too which can be a nice read</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure, but r/trueconspiracies might be a good place to visit. I don&#39;t know if his links would check out to their standard.. I&#39;m still skeptical about a lot, things people say about Sandy Hook for example.. but for me, I saw someone comment with a link to a video of a true false flag done in Iraq, with video is people literally running up and falling to the ground, after what was supposed to be a car bomb went off.. that&#39;s what made me more open minded. Maybe someone who reads this will have the link?</p>

<p>For me, this Vegas shooter thing stinks to high hell. First, it was reported that someone staying under the shooter heard him shooting above, and called the front desk to alert them (incredibly hard to find any article that refers to this first publicly released info).. that would certainly say Campos didn&#39;t go upstairs until after the shooting started.. fast forward to now, they&#39;re saying he was there before the shooting.</p>

<p>Although this isn&#39;t saying it&#39;s the official narrative, I remember this being cited as the explanation for the original press release <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/03/iraq-war-veteran-two-floors-below-las-vegas-gunman-heard-gunfire-helped-police-find-gunman.html">http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/10/03/iraq-war-veteran-two-floors-below-las-vegas-gunman-heard-gunfire-helped-police-find-gunman.html</a></p>

Why haven&#39;t the other survivors spoken out? 
Has anyone else mentioned multiple gunmen?
Where is Jesus Campos?
Why haven&#39;t news channels interviewed survivors?
Is it possible to be confused by gunfire sounds?
Maybe the &quot;firecrackers&quot; were a different type of gun?
Maybe she thought she was being chased because gunman started chasing them in his scope?</p>

<p>What else should I be asking?</p>

I&#39;m a mother of two grown kids and I have nieces and nephews. Never in my life did I ever think that I would one day believe that Sandy Hook was a hoax. But I do. I don&#39;t know if people died that day...I will never say they didn&#39;t simply out of respect in case they did. But what I do know and can plainly see...is that it everything else at least is bs. Vegas, not a hoax...false flag prob so. I think Paddock was doing a job and he actually thought he would get out alive...he thought wrong.

    <div class="md"><p>First, welcome. Every set of eyes (and mind) opened is a victory.</p>

<p>About Sandy Hook, it might help to keep in mind my personal theory that the event was a professional &quot;hit&quot; on a witness protection community which was later covered up to maintain program integrity.</p>

<p>It explains a lot of the post-Sandy Hook weirdness. And there&#39;s also some evidence that there were an unusual number of lottery &quot;winners&quot; in the town...lottery payouts being being the perfect way to deliver untraceable, large amounts of money to families under the Feds&#39; protection.</p>

<p>This doesn&#39;t mean the event wasn&#39;t used for political gain (gotta make the best of things), but I feel Sandy Hook being lumped in with other possible false flags can skew the bigger picture of what&#39;s going on.</p>

<p>And I might be wrong. But that&#39;s where I&#39;m at.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>ok, so Team 6 is deep</p>

<p>we will start with Osama Bin Laden, who was supposedly the master-mind of 9/11</p>

<p>the Bin Laden family and the Bush family have been close personal, family friends for many years. the fact that OBL attacked USA under the watch of GWB is WTF </p>

<p>in the early 1980&#39;s the USA-CIA propped up the Taliban, who were then called &quot;freedom fighters&quot; by then-president Ronald Reagan, who even dedicated a launch of a space shuttle in their honor</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqZ-ToXjCz0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uqZ-ToXjCz0</a></p>

<p>The USA was ostensibly helping the locals fend of the Soviet &quot;invasion&quot; of Afghanistan, which in truth was not an invasion but an officially welcomed joint military exercises by Afghan and Soviet forces. </p>

<p>Hillary Clinton admits USA-CIA created Islamic radicals in Afghanistan and Pakistan </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsIp1TDwFLs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsIp1TDwFLs</a></p>

<p>This is around the time and place where a young CIA asset named Barack Obama worked as a CIA pay-master, perhaps even personally handing out the paychecks to the Taliban, AQ, and ISIS forces</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s mother was a CIA asset, which is why she was in Indonesia, where she brought young Barack to live for a while</p>

<p>Obama&#39;s grandmother was also a CIA asset, who worked as the VP of the Bank of Hawaii, which is a well-known CIA money laundering front which services the entire Pacific Rim </p>

<p>Osama Bin Laden himself might not even exist, and is perhaps a cutout character, fabricated to play the role of the bad guy in terror plots. </p>

<p>Osama Bin Laden&#39;s CIA code name was Tim Osman</p>

<p>during the 2012 presidential election, then-candidate Obama said that the USA should not be in Afghanistan...</p>

<p>... and that the USA should actually be in Pakistan, because that is where the real action is...</p>

<p>this obviously shocked his anti-war base, who had been supporting Obama as a change from the Endless War policies of the GWB administration  </p>

<p>later, (((We Are Change))) confronted future VP Joe Biden about his meeting with the head of Pakistani ISI (intelligence) on the morning of 9/11/2001, </p>

<p>watch as Joe Biden lies through his teeth about the purpose of that meeting with ISI boss</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You know.. when I&#39;ve discussed different events with people and they have that innocence of believing what they are told and everything, I always step back, and let them decide what they decide. Part of me is envious of that innocence because undoubtedly looking at these situations with a fine tooth comb is bothersome for a lot of us. In my mind, it&#39;s another form of patriotism that goes largely unnoticed. That same innocence will belittle you for asking questions, as logical as those questions may be. But, without us asking the right questions, we&#39;re allowing our society to be submissive. And if anything has been proven over the multitude of events, it&#39;s this; power will prey on the weak. Good luck in your research and just don&#39;t let any revelation affect your quality of life. </p>

Not steel framed modern skyscrapers designed to take multiple hits from airplanes.  A third skyscraper fell that day and received very little attention.  It was 47 stories tall and was hit by some debris when the towers fell.  It collapsed as well.  It was WTC building 7.  There&#39;s reasons behind why it was taken down, but I don&#39;t want to write a book.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The red pill is a permatrip! You never come down!</p>

<p>Also, my personal recommendation: when it comes to conspiracy theories you can end up with a bookmarks folder full of 4 hour documentaries and you don&#39;t want to commit to any of them because you don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll be any good. I got this book called The Big Book of Conspiracies and I really enjoyed it. It&#39;s a comic book, which probably makes you think &quot;what, learning about conspiracy theories from a comic book??&quot; But the point of it is not to fully inform you on any one theory. It&#39;s an easy on the eyes survey of a wide variety of conspiracy theories, everything from JFK to interdimensional demons. It will give you general knowledge about the conspiracy world and then you can watch 4 hour documentaries about the ones that pique your interest.</p>

<p>To begin:</p>

<p>Did you know about the project by the civil engineering department at the University of Alaska Fairbanks? The preliminary report was just released 2 weeks ago. </p>

<p>Link to University&#39;s project summary: <a href="http://ine.uaf.edu/projects/wtc7/">http://ine.uaf.edu/projects/wtc7/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The research team studied the building’s response using two finite element programs, ABAQUS and SAP2000 version 18. At the micro level, three types of evaluations were performed. In plan-view, the research team evaluated: 1) the planar response of the structural elements to the fire(s) using wire elements; 2) the building’s response using the NIST’s approach with solid elements; and 3) the validity of NIST’s findings using solid elements. At the macro-level, progressive collapse, i.e., the structural system’s response to local failures, is being studied using SAP2000 with wire elements, as well as with ABAQUS, and it is near completion. The findings thus far are that fire did not bring down this building. Building failure simulations show that, to match observation, the entire inner core of this building failed nearly simultaneously.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk man, I&#39;m pretty open minded to conspiracy theories, but people definitely die in these mass shootings. </p>

<p>I personally know someone who died in the orlando pulse shooting. His name was Paul Henry, and we worked together. If you feel like pulling it up, look up the date of the shooting and scroll through my post history to the day after. I posted proof from my Facebook, and i also encouraged people to call in to the bluegreen vacations call center which is where we worked, and ask people if it was real or not. He was a real person. He was my friend and he died. </p>

<p>Since then i started a new career, and the guy who got me into the new job personally knows someone who died in the vegas shooting. I cant offer proof of this one, but if you look through my post history you&#39;ll see im no shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You absolutely can. That is a conspiracy in and of itself though because &quot;the powers that be&quot; (TBTB) want us to think that. We can definitely change the world but it starts individually in each of us. For me it started with medical conspiracy and of course one rabbit hole led to another. I no longer use credit and I could care less about my credit score. I have more money and more free time, peace and better relationships. It&#39;s helped not only me and my family at home. Little by little even neighbors and extended family too are waking up disconnecting from the negative cycles that we so easily fall into. The traps that create stress and anxiety and destroy health and the planet. Yes you can change a lot more than you realize just yet. Don&#39;t let him get defeated before he even tries :) It starts with each individual, TPTB cannot stop that. </p>

<p>You must be having an information overload by now, but if you want to be able to answer such questions next time, you must be aware that there are stilll people who have positive alternatives with a potential to change the world and make it a better place. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s where you can find one of the best optimism sources: High Level Insider&#39;s question sessions. Compiled <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5ee4wk/updated_for_anyone_interested_in_high_level/">here</a>, a recent meta thread <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6semd3/high_level_insider_mystery_schools_reddit_an/">here</a>. </p>

<p>High Level Insider is an anon who appeared on 4chan last year and gave question sessions. He claims to be a member of ∼ 3000 years old secret society called Three, a resistance group opposed to those who &quot;rule from the shadows, conceal knowledge for their own enrichment.&quot; </p>

<p>He revealed some Three&#39;s members, the oldest one he was willing to name was Plato, also Jesus, George Washington, and JFK.</p>

<p>&quot;None of the operators killed in the Afghan helicopter crash had been involved in that mission, officials said.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Family members of some of the SEAL Team Six operators killed in the crash, along with some military personnel, claimed that the U.S. government had turned the members of the elite unit into a target by revealing their role in the bin Laden raid. A congressional oversight committee even held a controversial hearing into the events surrounding the crash in early 2014.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is scary when you wake up to the truth, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>I woke up about 2 years ago. I now question everything. There is an old saying, &quot;Don&#39;t believe anything you hear, and only half of what you see.&quot;</p>

<p>So just question everything. That doesn&#39;t mean everything is false or a lie. But, to be safe, question everything and gather facts. Think for yourself.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s ok to cry. The shit is deep and very very real. Your emotional state is going to be raw for awhile. Remember that we are ALL deeply deceived. That most of what we&#39;ve learned is wrong. In particular the real &#39;who&#39; and &#39;why&#39; behind any event. The search for the truth is hard, time consuming, and well... the best analogy I can think of is walking through a minefield. </p>

<p>The Alt Media DOES NOT equal the truth media. The alt media is full of shills, liars, and wolves in sheep&#39;s clothing. So part of your learning process is to discover WHO is speaking the truth. Your best weapons are your mind (you must think, reason, process) and your heart (what does your spirit, or your gut tell you?). We are buried under many layers of deception. One of the deceiver&#39;s tricks is to get you stuck at the next layer of deception... these people are known as gatekeepers.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been under a spell. Which is thought control. The spell is broken. Now you must continue to fight to free your mind. But remember the purpose of ALL media is not to entertain or teach us, but to control us, to control our thoughts, and if are thoughts are controlled thus are our actions.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t ever stop digging for the truth, and never assume you actually know it. After 9+ years of digging I consider myself only slightly less deceived than the average person.</p>

<p>Here is an article I wrote to help you on your way;

<p>if this is true, you absolutely should not be talking about and that operation is SURELY very very classified.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its really hard to keep an open mind when your &quot;enlightening information&quot; came from second hand sources (sources more removed then I first assumed) that could be lying to you just so they sound cool. Seals are the go to for people pretending to be special or in the know. Happens all the time with stolen valor BS and other cases. JSOC soldiers dont talk about their current work. If they really are talking you should ABSOLUTELY turn them in, because them saying the wrong thing to the right person could get military people killed.</p>

<p>Word of advice, lots of the stuff linked to you in this thread are factually wrong, deliberately false, or worse. You cannot go into conspiracy theories with the mindset that all are fact. Hell there is a TON of disinfo about LV and Campos. So make sure you follow up on the information and not blindly follow.</p>

<p>You said a friend&#39;s husband &quot;knows&quot; some seals and told you secret information about special operation actions that would be classified pretty damn highly. If you truly believe what they told you, you should be letting the authorities know that someone is leaking.</p>

<p>Second there are people on this sub spreading disinfo about EVERYTHING. You cant just jump in and think they are all correct. People will shove crap at you and hope you bite. It happens all the damn time. I have seen it for years. It doesnt mean you cant go down the hole just dont get stuck.</p>

<p>Ever hear testimony from American POWs in WWII?  Now why is it battle hardened soldiers break down and cry when recollecting the horrors of the Japanese but most holocaust survivors seem to display little emotion when describing their memories?</p>

<p>And I&#39;ll add, the number &quot;6 million&quot; was used heavily in reference to Jews before WWII.  It appears to bear significance to their prophecy in their anticipation of a messiah.  Oddly enough, US foreign policy has been bolstering Israel&#39;s agenda of restoring Zion since the 1950s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry. Not everyone here is an anti-semite. There&#39;s a ton of different types of people here, including Jews. We even have hoards of people who don&#39;t believe any conspiracies who show up now and again to remind us of our former, blissfully ignorant selves. I would say there are probably a lot more people here who question and criticize the Israeli government but respect the Jewish people than the number who are actual anti-semites. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a feeling that the majority of people who dislike Jews because they are Jews have never knowingly had a conversation with one. I guarantee you have spoken with or made friends with a Jew and didn&#39;t even know it. Many of them are not very outspoken about their heritage or religion because of the stigma. </p>
