    <div class="md"><p>To confirm:</p>

<p>The New York Times broke the story first; Ashley Judd is the biggest &quot;name&quot; in the story to I.D. Weinstein:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/us/harvey-weinstein-harassment-allegations.html</a></p>

<p>Ashley Judd at the Women&#39;s March. Not her finest hour, IMHO, but considering she was supporting Clinton, props to her for naming Weinstein, one of Clinton&#39;s most generous (financially) supporters.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What kind of proof do you want at this point? Unfortunately, all serial abusers and rapists aren&#39;t keeping neatly labeled evidence of their abuses -and- the people being abused/harassed aren&#39;t ready for evidence gathering before it happens to them. Maybe this is a situation you have never been in, but I am legitimately confused about what kind of evidence you personally need to believe in this instance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mistake, I misread.  </p>

<p>A reliable accuser would be someone who brought him to court, did not retract the lawsuit, and won.  Granted, if it really happened there&#39;s still a chance that they couldn&#39;t prove it through lack of evidence.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If they won, they would no longer be an accuser... </p>

<p>Just because someone retracts a lawsuit does not mean that they are a liar or <em>unreliable</em> - they could have been bought off, threatened/intimidated, and so on. Also, we literally know just because you have a case and evidence does not mean you are going to win, but that doesn&#39;t make you less of a victim. It&#39;s just not that black and white and you&#39;re gonna need a little more nuance than that, my friend. </p>

<p>Just because they drop the lawsuit could also be that they didn&#39;t have a leg to stand on: they were never raped in the first place.  The burden is on the accuser to provide proof.  We operate on a system where you are innocent until proven guilty, but it looks like you don&#39;t subscribe to that philosophy which is quite scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously though, the justice system is much more complicated than that. On the other side of the coin, maybe you are or aren&#39;t familiar with them, but there is a group called the Innocence Project whose mission is to exonerate wrongly convicted persons in various ways such as new evidence, DNA testing, witnesses who come forward, criminal justice reforms, and so on. I&#39;m pointing out how just because someone is found in a court of law to be innocent or guilty does not always mean that they truly are so. The justice system does not always reveal the truth. You are in a subreddit about conspiracies and recognizing that systems and institutions don&#39;t always work in the way they are &quot;supposed&quot; to should be a basic requirement of being here.</p>

<p>That said: I don&#39;t go around thinking everyone is guilty until proven otherwise. To bring it back to what this is about - victims of rape and harassment coming forward about Harvey Weinstein- yeah, I am likely going to trust someone (or in this case, over a dozen people and even more saying they knew about what was going on for years) when they say that they have been raped or harassed because historically and statistically, VERY FEW people lie about that and we literally know that men in high positions of power can be likely to do this. It&#39;s not a mystery.</p>
