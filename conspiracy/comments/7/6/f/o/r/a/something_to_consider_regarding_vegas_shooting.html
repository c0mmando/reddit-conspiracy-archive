        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>You have more and more corruption scandals popping up all over Washington D.C. now that involve the majority of politicians and federal agencies/depts. Each month we see new information, new documents, new witnesses that if it was anywhere else would have already resulted in massive FBI raids and people led in cuffs to the paddy wagon. Citizens on all sides out there are not only pissed at each other but a growing anger FINALLY is starting to focus on our politicians and agencies.</p>

<p>So what happens? a mass shooting. BUT it&#39;s sloppy. There are constant changes in the story, blatant coverups...almost like it was a rush job. </p>

<p>Shortly after we get almost a dozen new bills for gun regulations/bans being pushed...but this time around it&#39;s not just the usual Democrats doing it, but we are seeing Republicans as well pushing for these. And these bills aren&#39;t targeting specific things, they are worded precisely in &quot;legalize&quot; to be vague and give the feds all kinds of power as to what they can claim falls into their definitions in these bills.</p>

<p>Gun legislation to disarm/regulate/restrict the angry public wouldn&#39;t pass in the current congress and hasn&#39;t been able to pass in the previous 8 years... </p>

<p>Unless something big was rushed forward and done to give them an &quot;excuse&quot; to suddenly try a mass bombardment of legislation from both sides of the aisle.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cultural thing. Not an immediate thing.</p>

<p>They are conditioning the future generations to despise gun ownership.</p>

<p>Give it...20...maybe 30 more years...if you own a gun...you will be synonymous with psychopath.</p>

<p>Because by this point, the media will have successfully convinced that anyone that takes an interest in guns or gun ownership are the same people that going postal and firing off guns in public places for no good reason. One patsy after another until it finally seeks in that guns = bad. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep, they tried a federal level assault gun ban (which did nothing at all to the crime levels btw) and after it expired, have never had the votes to ram through a more stringent version....</p>

<p>So they&#39;ve gone to the state and local levels trying to push through laws there first with the incremental plan and the billions of dollars Bloomberg and others have used. The more places they get those passed, the easier it is to get state level shit passed, then enough of those pass and they can then get back to federal level stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This won&#39;t make me popular here, but honestly guys if any of you think governments would do something as risky as a false flag mass shooting over fucking gun laws you are brain dead.</p>

<p>I know a lot of you struggle with logic,  but the US government does not need to take away your guns, your police force is like a military and could already crush any dissent. </p>

<p>It absolutely wouldn&#39;t be worth the risk when the potential reward doesn&#39;t really make a difference, your government controls you and your guns haven&#39;t stopped it, if anything letting you have them makes you all delusional enough to think you have some sort of freedom from tyranny.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I&#39;ll agree that the other user didn&#39;t post the most relevant info regarding the matter, I will also agree with the point they&#39;re trying to make. Were I the other user, I would have linked <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Northwoods">Operation Northwoods</a>. </p>

<p>TL;DR: The US government was willing to commit false flag attacks <em>against American citizens</em> in the 1960s. No doubt, they&#39;d be just as willing today. </p>

<p>Your claim that the gov would never do something like this is completely incorrect. Now, I&#39;m not saying that Vegas was a false flag, but that the US gov is certainly willing and more than able to orchestrate attacks of this scale.</p>

<p>If Vegas was a false flag, I believe the purpose was to push for tighter security/surveillance regulations. I don&#39;t hear as many people as I would imagine talking about the guns. I do hear people asking questions about the lack of security footage, though. </p>

<p>Whether false flag or not, if the government can use Vegas to pass laws to increase surveillance (with a little gun control sprinkled in), they&#39;d be very pleased.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It may seem minor but any laws regarding reporting of stolen firearms are the most dangerous of them all.  The Liberals quietly slipped this into Canadian law recently, and it is the first move of a vicious trap.  </p>

<p>Note how the penalty for not reporting a lost or stolen firearms is extreme.  All they have to do is casually ban a specific firearm and the trap is sprung.  All they have to do then is knock on your door, and you have no choice but to hand it over.  Any attempt to conceal it and claim you don&#39;t have it for whatever reason results in getting slammed with failure to report it - with devastating consequences.</p>

<p>You can expect widescale magazine size limits as a result of this.  Here in Canada a semi-auto rifle can only hold 5 rounds, with a couple of odd loopholes to exploit.  The RCMP has carefully fought the Liberals all the way through this, and would not agree that a welded plug was necessary.  A rivet in the mag is the accepted standard, which was a triumphant compromise for gun owners.</p>

<p>Remember folks, the U.N. wants serial numbers on every cartridge.  Hilary would have pushed that agenda hard had she won the election.  Don&#39;t let any bills pass that talk about limitations on ammo storage, that will be their next target.  </p>

<p><a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1916?r=6">https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/1916?r=6</a> Automatic Gunfire Prevention Act - similar to HR3999, but worse</p>

<p>3998 - violates 4 separate amendments in the bill of rights 3999 - is not only extremely vague, but could be used as an outright ban on all semi-automatics 4018 - a delayed right is not a right</p>

<p>I&#39;m too lazy to keep going</p>

<p>Added: HR3987 - allocates $10 million / year to the CDC for gun violence research and requires lost / stolen firearms to be reported to the police within 48 hours of discovery. Failure to report can lead to a $10,000 fine and / or up to 1 year imprisonment per lost/stolen firearm.</p>
