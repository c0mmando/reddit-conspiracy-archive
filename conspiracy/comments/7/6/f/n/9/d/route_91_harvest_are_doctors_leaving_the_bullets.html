Why aren&#39;t they removing the bullets? Don&#39;t they need to match the ballistics to the gun(s) used? Any chance these bullets that were left in could be removed by another doctor for independent analysis?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having a surgery that isn&#39;t needed is even more nutty. If the bullet is not an area where it can do anymore damage they do not remove it. The body had already been through enough trauma by being shot. It is very common to leave the bullet in if it isn&#39;t hurting anything. Also, depending on the location it could be dangerous to retrieve the bullet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the standard, because it&#39;s the safer alternative. The projectile is sterile when it enters you, and it&#39;s removal will cause more damage than leaving it in. Besides, in 10-20 years it&#39;ll probably eventually work it&#39;s way out of your body and you&#39;ll be able to gross your grandkids out with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The heat of the round being fired sterilizes the bullet on exit. If it isn&#39;t in a life threatening position, removing the bullet can cause more harm than good. </p>

<p>Case in point, President Garfield died on the operating table after being shot, because the doctors were hell-bent on removing the bullet. He&#39;d have probably lived if they left it in. </p>
