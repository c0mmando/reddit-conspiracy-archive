       I've seen a lot of interviews with survivors who state that the doctors left the bullet in. Why aren't they removing the bullets? Don't they need to match the ballistics to the gun(s) used? Any chance these bullets that were left in could be removed by another doctor for independent analysis?

       Having a surgery that isn't needed is even more nutty. If the bullet is not an area where it can do anymore damage they do not remove it. The body had already been through enough trauma by being shot. It is very common to leave the bullet in if it isn't hurting anything. Also, depending on the location it could be dangerous to retrieve the bullet.

       It's the standard, because it's the safer alternative. The projectile is sterile when it enters you, and it's removal will cause more damage than leaving it in. Besides, in 10-20 years it'll probably eventually work it's way out of your body and you'll be able to gross your grandkids out with it.

       Yeah mate doctors are all in on the conspiracy,  the feds did this shooting and figured the best way to keep it secret was to tell loads of doctors to keep bullets in victims, because that could never backfire as doctors are notorious for not caring about patients.

       Some of you on this sub are so fucking stupid I seriously think the government pays people to most insane shit on here to deflect from real, albeit way less exciting theories. Although it's more likely there's just a lot of really stupid people here.

       You'd think they'd want to remove the bullets to dispose of the evidence. If this keep raising suspicion then people may have bullets removed to get evidence.

       Just a note, the under-sheriff explicitly stated on a radio show that multiple weapons were used and multiple calibers of rounds were fired. They already covered their ass on that. Expect to find 5.56 and 7.62.

       The heat of the round being fired sterilizes the bullet on exit. If it isn't in a life threatening position, removing the bullet can cause more harm than good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Case in point, President Garfield died on the operating table after being shot, because the doctors were hell-bent on removing the bullet. He'd have probably lived if they left it in.

       5.56/.223 at that distance would definitely fragment as they are made to and the pieces may be harder to extract then leave in. The one bullet I want to know about is the one that's in Jesus's leg or supposedly in there.

       I've watched these same interviews.  They are crisis actors.  There is no bullet in them.  They were never shot.  Look at these people and ask if they are victims or actors:

       They only remove bullets in the movies. Unless it’s sitting right there during an operation, or is already halfway sticking out of the skin, you leave it in.

       God those movies piss me off! Like when someone gets bit by a venomous snake and some other dipwad sucks the venom out. Yeah jackass, great idea! Let that venom come in contact with your gums and tongue and throat! Real people have died because they copied this shit they saw in the movies.

       Yeah mate doctors are all in on the conspiracy,  the feds did this shooting and figured the best way to keep it secret was to tell loads of doctors to keep bullets in victims, because that could never backfire as doctors are notorious for not caring about patients.

       Some of you on this sub are so fucking stupid I seriously think the government pays people to most insane shit on here to deflect from real, albeit way less exciting theories. Although it's more likely there's just a lot of really stupid people here.

       You'd think they'd want to remove the bullets to dispose of the evidence. If this keep raising suspicion then people may have bullets removed to get evidence.
