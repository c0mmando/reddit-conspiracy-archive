       I almost wonder if that has been half the plan -- to 'create' superstar entertainers which become woven into the fabric of people's lives in an innocuous way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, later, kill them off in some dramatic or difficult way, thereby traumatizing the population who grew up with them.

       When you are watching a TV show or a movie, try and imagine what the actors you are watching had to do in order to get that role.  Who did they fuck?  Who's dick did they suck?  Especially the young ladies....you know they had to sell themselves for fame.  I hope they think its worth it.
      </p>

       I no longer watch movies or TV.  I cant stop thinking about what they had to do to get there.

       well I don't think that entirely applies to every tv show and movie, but when it comes to Hollywood, yeah... pretty much most of the time. I've thought the same things too. Gosh ... sick world that it's come to this.

       I watched Mr. Rogers and Sesame Street when I was a kid. I'm fairly certain that no one on either of those shows fucked anyone to get their roles. Or rather, there is no good reason or evidence to think so.

       Just the broad disparity between how people are raised to be and how people actually are.  I think there's many that were pretty decent all the way through...Tom Petty, Bonnie Raitt, David Bowie, Loretta Lynn, Johnny Cash, Pearl Jam, Rush, even Tool.  I'm 40, so I know what you mean.  I just think it's the people that give up a part of themselves to be famous that have issues, not the ones that are really focused on creating or performing in general.  Check out King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard if you wanna see a band that makes a lot of music.  I like Tame Impala a lot too, but their older stuff more than the newer.  Gotta give it to Kevin Parker...his singing has been WAY better as of late.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, it's far better to look at people for the most part as peers, and not as much else, and that makes life easier.

       When it comes to movies, in particular, you only see the final product that is sold to the audience after it's been honed and polished to the 'nth degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of it is of course completely faked and a put-up job for the money, lots of money, money that can run into hundreds of millions of dollars and that permits huge amounts to be spent on making them and the people in them just as distracting and entertaining as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the ones that don't measure up, there are hefty deductions that allow those who create them to keep even more from the ones that succeed. Some even going so far to actually make bona-fide bombs and losers with well-padded expenses, strictly for that purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you see some of the reality talent shows that abound you begin to see that there's actually no shortage of human talent and ability, only access to being seen, heard, and known by a broader public audience and behind those otherwise ordinary individuals we see in those are countless more who either lack the desire, ambition, and self-confidence to go public or else prefer to keep their ordinary life and lifestyle than ever become entangled in the glitz and glitter of celebrity and the inability to lead anything like a normal life and lifestyle once anyone becomes one.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we're faced with an over-rated and over-glamorized picture created by and populated with self-indulgent people who are driven by the idea of being self-indulgent and living a life of self-indulgence for what amounts to a very small amount of work for very huge returns.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's something that only incredibly shallow and callow individuals can ever be really happy and content with. For many others, however, it invariably leads to extreme and even self destructive behavior when they can't find any true and very ordinary happiness and yet can't let go of it either.

       Ginsberg was a sort of hero for me, simply because I thought some of his poetry was so astonishingly powerful. I always thought that Ginsberg was a member of NAMBLA purely for reasons related to freedom of speech and freedom of expression, not that he was an actual pedophile. It was someone on this sub that basically convinced me that he was.

       As much as it felt terrible, I feel that it's more important to know the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is a very strange thing these days. It is so deliberately hidden, obfusticated and confused that in many cases, it is almost impossible for the average reasonable man to be sure what the truth actually is. There are simply not enough hours in the day. And yet, it is more important than ever before that we have an understanding of the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many people involved in duping the masses for different agendas; many of the perpetrators, it seems, will never ever be brought to justice. It is important that justice is not only done, but that justice is seen to be done, and when I see repeated incidents, over and over, in which powerful people perpetrate great wrongs against the entire world without consequence, it sort of makes me understand at least a little why so many citizens are wilfully blind. The truth has become a terrible, terrifying and personally destructive thing to know. Even though it destroys me, I insist that the truth is all that matters.
