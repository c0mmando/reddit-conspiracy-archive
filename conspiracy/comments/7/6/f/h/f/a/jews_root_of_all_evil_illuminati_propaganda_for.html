        Jews, root of all evil: Read these 10 lines so that you'll never ever click again this type of illuminati propaganda
       </strong>
       <br/>
       - Israel is totally controlled by a gang of illuminazi infiltrators since the 1975 coup led by Peres and Rabin.
       <br/>
       - Other than traitors, this gang includes: fake Jews and other impostors, such as the impersonator of hero Ariel Sharon, murdered during the 1975 coup.
       <br/>
       Illustrated with a fake marriage: "Netanyahu (real name John J Sullivan) stepped on stage as Ben Nitay, was renamed to have "Netan" sound like satan for the global audience while served as "Bibi" for the Jewish human cattle.
       <br/>
       His "wife" Sara was selected to look like a pig.
       <br/>
       - All "popes" after Pius XII (since 1958) were illuminazi agents increasingly propagating hatred against Jews.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Key facts about the IV Reich
       </strong>
       <br/>
       - The invisible senator "Harry S Truman" who became 33th US president after Roosevelt's fake death and days before the III Reich's surrender was in fact Robert Ritter von Greim, Hitler's last Luftwaffe commander.
       <br/>
       - Angela Merkel and Hillary Clinton are half-sisters, both Adolph Hitler's daughters.
       <br/>
       - The Illuminati Grand Master or in other words the the current real leader of the IV Reich, since at least 1993: Alexander Adolf Hitler, older son of William Patrick Hitler.

       April, 2013 - Welsh actor Jonathan Pryce steps on stage, this time to play "Francis (no number), Peter the Roman". One of his roles: push hatred against Jews to new limits.
       <br/>
       6 Months later this illuminati joke, using one of the countless fake Jewish fronts, in this case the "Forward" newspaper:
       <br/>
       'Forward 50' List Of Top American Jews Acknowledges Pope Francis:
       <br/>
       The Jewish Daily Forward just released its annual "Forward 50" list of newsworthy and notable Jews, with an additional "Plus" category to recognize the contributions of prominent non-Jews.
       <br/>
       One of the names on the list this year is none other than Pope Francis, the global leader of the Roman Catholic Church.
       <br/>
       The Forward cited Francis' outreach to the Jewish community, his clear denunciations of anti-Semitism, his intention of opening up the Church's Holocaust archive, and his plans to visit Israel as indications of significant change in the relationship between the Church and the Jewish world.
       <br/>
       "It’s a truism to say that Francis has the power to affect how more human beings view the Jewish people than any one else on earth. It’s reason enough to take him at his word — and hold him to it," The Forward explained.
       <br/>
       Angelina Jolie was the other public figure named in the "Plus" category, due to her courageous decision to undergo a preventative double mastectomy after testing positive for the BRCA gene mutation, which is disproportionally prevalent in people of Ashkenazi Jewish background.

       For fake Jews start with the Federal Reserve Bank and the imminent BIG BANG:
       <br/>
       Janet Yellen is Martha Stewart, Ben Shalom Bernanke is Paul Krugman without toupee. Best joke: Stan Fischer is governor of Bank of Israel

       Contrast "Netanyahu's wife" Sara with the impostor impersonating Ariel Sharon from 1975 to 2006 and "film director" Michael Moore.

       mrsuns10, read again what you're replying to, and then admit that you made a fool of yourself.
       <br/>
       The post you're "replying" to explains that the "Jews, root of all evil" is nothing but illuminazi propaganda.

       When you puke out streams of "factoids" (a term I use loosely here), it's not even discussable.  It's just an incoherent mess of stuff, and debating any one of the points is kinda pointless, when there are gems like Martha Stewart = Janet Yelled, and Michael Moore is designed to look like a pig on purpose.

       Well, I wasn't really detecting any coherent message hidden in your 4th Reich "facts", but you fully lost me at Janet Yellen = Martha Stewart.  All I can come up with is...  No.  Just...  no.  If we're supposed to debate the nuances of why Martha Stewart is not Janet Yellen, then I think humanity is toast.

       Let's start with the very first claim:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Israel is totally controlled by a gang of illuminazi infiltrators since the 1975 coup led by Peres and Rabin.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So, you're using hyperbole instead of facts ("totally controlled"), vague epithets instead of facts ("illuminazi" which I presume to be a portmanteau of Illuminati and Nazi?) and the unfounded claim that there was a 1975 coup.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, just in that one sentence, there are three reasons that the average reader, here, will not be able to follow a) what it is you're claiming and/or b) why you're claiming it.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        hyperbole instead of facts ("totally controlled")
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Not hyperbole. Start with the KEY facts, in brief:
       <br/>
       1. The list of illuminati TV stations includes ALL TV stations that you get on cable or only on satellite ... and beyond.
       <br/>
       2. GLOBAL HEADLINES - ALL ACTORS used to mock human cattle and reduce the rest to the same condition.
       <br/>
       Anyone or any event making global headlines is a psy-op advancing the illuminati agendas, with a few, very few exceptions, in areas such as natural catastrophes.
3. What goes for TV stations is also valid for any other mass media and beyond: ALL TOTALLY controlled by the illuminati.
       <br/>
       <strong>
        That's why NONE of these outlets will question let alone contradict ANY of the core lies propagated by ALL TV stations.
       </strong>
       <br/>
       Examples: evolution theory; who were the real UK and US allies in World War II; Srebrenica "massacre" 1995, a milestone for fake blood, one year after fake mass blood was first used to launch "humanitarian wars".
       <br/>
       4. Everyone "reporting" or "commenting" national or international politics is an illuminati agent, who knows exactly what lines in script he's supposed to tell.
       <br/>
       The list includes about anyone else appearing regularly in the media, with a few, very few exceptions, in areas such as weather forecast or cooking.
5. There's NO such thing as LIVE TV.
       <br/>
       In other words: it's impossible for a truther to unexpectedly expose any illuminti core lies because the broadcast would be interrupted during the time gap, the buffer of a few seconds delay used to prevent it.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "illuminazi" which I presume to be a portmanteau of Illuminati and Nazi?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Correct.
       <br/>
       The term was coined due to the Ordo Teutonicus alias Ordo Illuminatus literal composition of German nobility.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        unfounded claim that there was a 1975 coup.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The foundation for the claim of a coup begins with remembering what the traitors DID, i.e. "actions speak louder than words".
Patriotic leaders were replaced with nazi agents such as "Netanyahu", others such as Sharon were murdered and replaced with impersonators.
       <br/>
       Reminder:
       <br/>
       <strong>
        Whoever fails to recognize treason has failed, no matter how much of the rest he did get.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        a) what it is you're claiming and/or b) why you're claiming it.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Anyone who has not totally lost their capacity for logical reasoning would be able to answer both questions.

       Just abandoning your original unfounded assertions in favor of more unfounded assertions doesn't solve any of the problems at hand.

      <p>
       What, exactly, is an "illuminati TV station"? Is it a TV station that has a philosophical leaning inspired by the Bavarian Illuminati of 1776? Is it a TV station that's some cartoonish supervillain straight out of
       <em>
        The Illuminatus! Trilogy
       </em>
       ? Or is it just a word you like shoving at the front of other things when you want people to consider them evil?

       When you capitalize the word "truth" the things you have said do not be truer, and in fact, I would suggest that they should always be more suspect.
