<p>Bernie Sanders is the closest thing to /ourguy/ we&#39;ve had in a long time. Personal politics aside, he&#39;s the only one with the freedom to question the banks and the other ingrained systems. Nobody in the DNC or RNC has the freedom he has right now, and he&#39;s way too popular to be disappeared. They have to just deal with him stealing a portion of the stage.</p>

<p>He almost won, too! It took the coordinated efforts of the whole DNC + associated media network to hold him down.</p>

I&#39;m a bigger fan of Dennis Kucinich, Gravel and (although questionable recently) Nader than of Bernie.

    <div class="md"><p>in all honestly, you probably also thought Sanders wasn&#39;t basically the kid running for elementary school class president who promises to put soda in all the water fountains. </p>

<p>all he fucking ever does is complain about rich people (while he has three houses) and promise free shit, while never actually offering a solution that is based in reality. the reason he ends up squarely on the left with liberal democrats despite claiming to be an independent, is because his politics are 100% divisive identity politics. the things he says are designed to gain support for him by making people angry at other people who have more than they do. </p>

<p>do you know why socialism will never work? because there is absolutely nothing stopping everyone who believes in socialism from pooling their money redistributing it equally. they could already be doing that <em>now</em>. none of them will, because they all secretly believe they would only stand to lose money.

<p>You could&#39;ve actually provided so many reasons, yet you&#39;ve come up with something more illogical than how illogical you believe socialism is. </p>

<p>Logic is telling me you&#39;re not only a snowflake but a fool who gets triggered by the fact that Sanders would&#39;ve beat Trump had the Democratic Party, you know, the same people you hate, not interfered in the primaries. Isn&#39;t the enemy of your enemy supposed to be your friend? We&#39;ve got some similarities. It seems like you mean well. My advice to you would be to actually stop and think for yourself instead of listening to the memes. &quot;Bernie is a sham!&quot;, &quot;Bernie has 3 houses!!!!&quot;, &quot;Bernie is Marx reborn!!!&quot; fucking give it a break and relax. </p>

<p>Allow me to show you what I mean by using your stupid quote:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the truth is Bernie endorsed Hillary. what more evidence could anyone possibly need?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, he waited a considerable amount of time before doing so, which made Clinton have to open up a bit. But I&#39;d say the biggest reason he ended up endorsing her was to gain the support from other Democrats. Had she won, he would&#39;ve been had more power to do the things he wanted, like breaking up big banks. It&#39;s not black and fucking white, ya sith pede. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the point. Regardless if she was going to win or not, and regardless if he actually supported her, that was his best move in our faltered 2-party system. In doing so, he maybe gained support/popularity in the Clinton supporters who didn&#39;t originally think much of him (the delusional base who think feminism is the most important outcome of the Presidential election) and cemented his place in the party (still with independent motives). </p>

<p>Had he not, no one outside of the Bernie supporters would&#39;ve gained an appreciation for him.

    <div class="md"><p>You made me laugh ... I admire the spirit , though!</p>

<p>Bernie is , unfortunately, a small fish (with big ideas) in this cesspool of sharks.
If he&#39;d won, he wouldn&#39;t change a single thing. He was too afraid or blackmailed to call out the primaries rigged. What do you think he would done if he was elected president? He had his first test and failed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Bernie? LMAO!! He is a Jewish Communist. 90% of the Red Army Leadership was Jewish during the Russian Revolution. They were doing the same thing in Germany. That is why Hitler did what he did. The whole Russian Revolution was just a Jewish Bolshevik invasion to loot Russia. Which is exactly what they did. A lot of people believe they are doing the same thing here. That is why they are pushing so hard for degeneracy, Open Boarders and retarded socialism.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh my God this is the most embarrassing thing I ever read on a Reddit I think. Bernie would be worse then Epstein, Clinton or Trump if he wasn&#39;t too lazy to ever reach their level of success. The guy never had a real job in his life. He is just some scum who got kicked out of a hippie commune for being lazy and whose wife committed fraud. He is famous because he conned a bunch of retarded College Students out of a ton of money by promising GibMeDats.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s not the point. Regardless if she was going to win or not, and regardless if he actually supported her, that was his best move in our faltered 2-party system. In doing so, he maybe gained support/popularity in the Clinton supporters who didn&#39;t originally think much of him (the delusional base who think feminism is the most important outcome of the Presidential election) and cemented his place in the party (still with independent motives). </p>

<p>Had he not, no one outside of the Bernie supporters would&#39;ve gained an appreciation for him. Republicans would just use that to their benefit to point more fingers at and ridicule Clinton and the Democrats, and the other Hillary-supporting side of the DP would&#39;ve rejected him even more. </p>
