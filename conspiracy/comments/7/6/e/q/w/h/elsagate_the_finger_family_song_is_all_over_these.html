       .     This strange song is all over elsa and spiderman videos that we always hear about accompanied by the same five colors (red,blue,yellow,pink and green). which is extremely weird considering recently i found out about some supposed mk ultra videos on kids channels (you can view them in my posts) and they call out these colors.These 5 colors and this song are somehow related considering they are always in the same videos together,can someone help me out here and confirm if im just being paranoid or not?

       I was watching a yotuube video a long time ago that connected those 5 colors in that particular order to MK ultra techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
       MK ultra is very complicated and many children's cartoons are connected with it. Its like a pre-programming type of thing for children. I am not 100% sure how it works, but I think it preps the masses so that when they pick out kids from the masses, they are already somewhat pre-programmed.

       Kind of. They target them in ways that works for MK ultra. For example, intelligent young girls are easier to MK ultra so they go after them.

       Did you also check the comments ? I just clicked trough a couple of videos just now. And noticed alot of "codes" or cryptic messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       On another elsagate expose video, i saw some of these messages lead to url links when you decypher them and it leads to other "darker" websites with equally dark content. I'v only known about these videos for 2 weeks, so i havent invested alot of time checking it out.

       Also the views on these videos are crazy.

       Check the other videos I posted earlier,they have alot of the same cryptic messages you're talking about I think.the first video is called The execution of Henrietta and Igor,which has to do with a cult who kidnapped kids in the 80s, its scary enough but the fact that it's a supposed to be a mk ultra video on a kids channel makes it so much worse

       Red: is often linked to alpha programming; these are often they most easily accessed alters in a person's system, including lots of eager to please littles. Also, sexual programming/prostitution may be places here. Historically, the cult has linked the color with sexual abuse and sexual ceremonies."
      </p>
      <p>
       Blue: protective; may be linked to beta in some people. These are they aggressive protectors in a system, the tough guys that know how to fight. Military programming may also go here, in some individuals.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yellow:often represents spirituality/positive messages. The cult realizes that to much theta/black can destroy, and in order not to lose their members to sucide, will put in lifesaving or positive messages, and allow some positive spiritually."
      </p>
      <p>
       Green: cult loyal. Green is traditional color for "family", and intensely loyal alters may see themselves as this color. Cult loyal protectors, trained to protect another higher cult member, may also be this color. Recontact alters mayb also be in this group.

       The color pink is traditionally associated with femininity, sexuality and purity. It is also used to characterize a child-like personality, which is why in programming, it is almost always associated with child alters, which are related to the core personality of the victim. Programmers typically view this alter as weak because it is easy to breakdown and make cry. They can exploit it to their advantage by attacking the true-self of the victim. If the handler wants to advertise the virginity of the victim to other handlers, they may dress them in all white or pink, signalling that the child is still a virgin, which means a lot more money for the handler when the victim is sold into prostitution. As the victim grows older, it is less and less likely that they are still a virgin, which is why the color pink is also used to symbolize sexuality.

       I concur.  Finger family song is everywhere not just Elsa type videos. I play it on guitar a few times a week.  It is very popular.  People without kids always think it's some kind of dirty song "Daddy finger where are you" To a single guy without kids it sound like some sick fuck stuff but it's really just finger puppets.

       I am sure those elsagate creeps love it for their own reasons though.

       A child who isn't already being conditioned in the labs will not magically get programmed by being exposed to creepy videos, that's not how trauma conditioning works. Kids toys are brightly and simply colored in general, that in itself is not some conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The use of color in programming is real however, SOP is to end up with 8 colors corresponding to 8 major sections of the alter system. Colors, especially primary colors, are easy for children to remember and to use in associative ways.

       I’m dubious as to why /pol/ and random youtube users (prime vectors for disinformation campaigns) are spreading references to color programming around. It doesn’t make sense that a perp would leave revealing trigger devices randomly on the internet to be discovered by armchair sleuths. While a few generalized trigger commands that may be common to a handful of subjects sometimes get embedded in mass media, most of the time, triggers are delivered to the subject directly, as most programming cues are specific to the individual.
      </p>
      <p>
       This elsagate reminds me of an ARG from about a decade ago. The ARG had at least one conspiracy community chasing clue after clue down a nice, deep rabbit hole with a big nothing at the end, except a lot of wasted time. I’m pretty sure the perps ran that one too.

       The color pink is traditionally associated with femininity, sexuality and purity. It is also used to characterize a child-like personality, which is why in programming, it is almost always associated with child alters, which are related to the core personality of the victim. Programmers typically view this alter as weak because it is easy to breakdown and make cry. They can exploit it to their advantage by attacking the true-self of the victim. If the handler wants to advertise the virginity of the victim to other handlers, they may dress them in all white or pink, signalling that the child is still a virgin, which means a lot more money for the handler when the victim is sold into prostitution. As the victim grows older, it is less and less likely that they are still a virgin, which is why the color pink is also used to symbolize sexuality.
