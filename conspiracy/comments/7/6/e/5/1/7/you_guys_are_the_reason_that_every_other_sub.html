       All of you spouting these incredibly unsubstantiated “theories” about the Las Vegas incident being a complete hoax are the exact examples people are using to mock conspiracies in general. The entire event is such a red flag for corruption, that it doesn’t need these wild and outlandish claims such as “the gunshots were played through the speakers” and “everyone was a crisis actor with a blood pouch”.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you aren’t just a fool trying to troll the entire forum, then you are a legitimate damaging threat to the entire cause. Almost so much so, id call it cointelpro.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is enough evidence here that needs to be discussed in regards to a certifiable false flag event, stop murking up the waters by taking it off the deep end. You’re only hurting the efforts made by legitimate truth seekers. You aren’t edgy, you aren’t the “only person who can see the truth”, you’re just a delusional fool.

       They could be trolls. Some of the stuff posted here is so loony, and I don't just mean the Vegas shooting theories - that it is possible a bunch of trolls are having a good laugh after posting some of this nonsense.

       So, first wave this morning is the spam of a few users I have never seen before making posts, and commenting several times
       <em>
        in every fucking thread
       </em>
       , about hoe Vegas was a complete hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now we get the reverse. Where a bunch more users are going to swarm in indignant and accusatory, calling all of us a bunch of crazies, and pointing at that first wave as proof.

       The current mod team refuses to enforce the "no trolling" part of Rule 5 so it's your own fault this sub is so full of troll and hoax posts. You can't keep allowing them to post then bitch about them being here. And if mods can't tell the difference between hoaxes/trollposts and legitimate conspiracy theories then they should not be mods.

       The good news is...everything they do eventually blows up in their faces...every single time.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're Achilles heel is this...they believe things that aren't true. We're all a bunch of "crazy, tinfoil hat people" incapable of critical thinking and observational analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they never plan for reactions that include those abilities. They treat everyone like the "dumb sheep" they constantly accuse everyone of being. Confirmation bias is a bitch.
      </p>
      <p>
       We've all done it. And many times when we do, someone will kindly suggest that it be the case. Those of us able to, take it as constructive criticism and step out of the box.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't have that. They have an echo chamber of "yes people"...it makes for good entertainment..
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact of the matter is this. They're scared. Reality is telling them that "yes, Hollywood is infested with sexual predators and pedos..yes, the Imran Awan case is way bigger..just like we've been saying for months, yes..the FBI does indeed prey on people with mental health issues to create business...and many more..
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not going away..we're not going away...whose reality is crumbling right now?

       Captured video footage is the only thing that speaks volumes. Youtube just allows variables and narritives to be added to the equation. Then discounts the same video for having a questionable idea about said content. But its all there, in front of your eyes.

       Don't you think the treads here pointing to hoaxes are done to destroy our real research and deductive reasoning about what really happened?
      </p>

       I mean if they come after us with "down votes" and shit post comments why not make crazy hoax posts here to that discredit our entire sub?

       As of this moment there are 508,000 users in this sub and counting. I would think that there would be some users you have never seen before.
I agree there are a lot of bullshit posts concerning Last Vegas ....links without an opinion.  Good stuff gets buried or ignored because of the clickbait with bullshit titles.

       I made such a post a week ago. I was wrong. But when the MSM can't seem to interview a real victim of the shooting, can you really blame anyone for thinking the whole event was entirely staged?

       I still see way too many flat earth and pizzagate hoax posts spammed here daily so apparently you guys are only banning a small portion of the trolls. It's frustrating to see the mod team allow the anti-r/conspiracy trolls ruin this sub with hoaxes. I've suspected for quite some time now that the mod team has been infiltrated by them and that some of the mods are actually alt accounts of others. AATA is especially well known for using alts for manipulation..

       We have to cut a fine line between effective moderation and not inhibiting speech. Although, patience seems to be wearing thin across the board.
