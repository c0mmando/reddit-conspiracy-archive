        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>All of you spouting these incredibly unsubstantiated “theories” about the Las Vegas incident being a complete hoax are the exact examples people are using to mock conspiracies in general. The entire event is such a red flag for corruption, that it doesn’t need these wild and outlandish claims such as “the gunshots were played through the speakers” and “everyone was a crisis actor with a blood pouch”.</p>

<p>If you aren’t just a fool trying to troll the entire forum, then you are a legitimate damaging threat to the entire cause. Almost so much so, id call it cointelpro.</p>

<p>There is enough evidence here that needs to be discussed in regards to a certifiable false flag event, stop murking up the waters by taking it off the deep end. You’re only hurting the efforts made by legitimate truth seekers. You aren’t edgy, you aren’t the “only person who can see the truth”, you’re just a delusional fool.</p>

<p>Now we get the reverse. Where a bunch more users are going to swarm in indignant and accusatory, calling all of us a bunch of crazies, and pointing at that first wave as proof.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The good news is...everything they do eventually blows up in their faces...every single time. </p>

<p>They&#39;re Achilles heel is this...they believe things that aren&#39;t true. We&#39;re all a bunch of &quot;crazy, tinfoil hat people&quot; incapable of critical thinking and observational analysis.</p>

<p>So they never plan for reactions that include those abilities. They treat everyone like the &quot;dumb sheep&quot; they constantly accuse everyone of being. Confirmation bias is a bitch. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve all done it. And many times when we do, someone will kindly suggest that it be the case. Those of us able to, take it as constructive criticism and step out of the box.</p>

<p>They don&#39;t have that. They have an echo chamber of &quot;yes people&quot;...it makes for good entertainment..</p>

<p>The fact of the matter is this. They&#39;re scared. Reality is telling them that &quot;yes, Hollywood is infested with sexual predators and pedos..yes, the Imran Awan case is way bigger..just like we&#39;ve been saying for months, yes..the FBI does indeed prey on people with mental health issues to create business...and many more..</p>

<p>It&#39;s not going away..we&#39;re not going away...whose reality is crumbling right now?
