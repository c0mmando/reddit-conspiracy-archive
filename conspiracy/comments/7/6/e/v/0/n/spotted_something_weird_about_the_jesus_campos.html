       - the ''ceremony'' pic of him
      </p>
      <p>
       Notice how in the ceremony picture he is wearing a band aid on his head? Whereas in the photo shortly after the shooting he doesn't have any lesions on his head. This suggests that he got this injury due to something other than the shooting, after it happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be nothing, but I thought it could be something to consider.

       It just looks like a hostage situation in that first picture,  he might aswell have been holding up a paper with a date on it of that day. Honestly, i think that was the original picture and they went "nope; that's just too obvious"

       If he truly didn't want to speak out as opposed to being stopped from speaking, wouldn't he (or family) just issue a statement like Marilou did. Something like ''please respect my privacy at this time''. The whole thing is sketchy as fuck

       Electronics can control your mind. Give you fake thoughts.

       Numb you out is the food plus cereal is filled with magnetic iron filings making it even stronger. Intelligence agencies help demons get control of humans in mass. Healthcare is a huge parasite feeding off of us. People need to give blood constantly when they go to the doctors while these people inject it into themselves to stay younger.

       What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

       There is at least one recent  pre-shooting photo of him circulating, and his face is lively and expressive. His face at the dinner where he got the plaque is mask like. So, meds, pain, blood loss, something has him looking like holy hell and not like his normal self.

       Thanks for the answer and everything, and this is not in response to you, but that's just one picture, and like you said, the difference could be something as simple as pain, meds, maybe even the stress of the situation.

       It seems like a crummy bit of publicity to drag a sick colleague out like that, especially if he's a hero. Major awards can wait.  He looks positively gruesome.  What's weird is not just the  comparison of his hale fellow well met face in the older pic, but the setting and context of the party pics.  He sits among back slapping and broadly smiling important union guys, where he is the hero honoree.  In defense of nuts who say that's a popped up corpse, he does kind of look like a stiff.  Even chalking it up to the effect of meds and blood loss, as I do,  he looks terrible.

       Maybe in the sign picture he put all his weight on his good leg? So that he could hold the sign and not need to hold his cane for the 3 seconds it took to take the picture? Idk

       That is so weird. THe pics really do show a person not doing so well at the command performance award "ceremony," or rather, as mentioned, a dinner with five hulking union brutes. It's not impossible that he had some kind of fall related to meds or injuries after the shooting incident, and is sicker now. But it is definitely a person in a worse state than the first photo released.  It's also possible that's an old photo of the security guard doctored up with a sign that says "thank you," I guess, but he looks a lot less like death warmed over in that pic for sure.

       just because one photo was posted before the other, doesn't mean they represent chronological order. maybe the 1st photo you shared was something absolutely not related to this incident - maybe he was running for office with Pedro or something. Maybe this is photoshopped. We all assume the 2nd photo is him getting an award post-incident - but we have no proof. just some sketchy, barely referenced photos by media desperate for click-count and viewership.

       It's the same head injury that the Pope, McCain, John Kerry, Bush, and many others have had.  I saw a great photos on her highlighting all of these people in high government positions with the same pesky head injury and always on the same side.  Who just got a head injury and said it was because they fell over exercise equipment and hit their head?

       I'd chalk it up to "very strange" and common but I don't believe a head injury in that area is common for most people.  I can't say that I know a single person in my life who has hurt themselves in that area requiring bandages...including myself.  Yet somehow MANY major senior public officials have it happen on what seems like a common basis.

       We saw this picture after the shooting before that fundraiser started. He was just standing. I think it's an old picture, the photoshopped on the board on the photo on the left for the fundraiser. The picture is prior to the shooting.

       I uploaded the photo of Campos holding the "Thank You" sign onto one of those "photo forensic" sites thst detect alterations of original photos. Here's the link if someone with more knowledge of how to interpret the results could maybe shed some light as to whether or not this appears adulterated

       Unfortunately, since it's a low quality image to begin with, not many conclusions can be drawn.
      </p>
      <p>
       My first impression is that there have been edits. I'd be more confident in saying this if I knew that the highest quality (and least resaved) copy of the photo was used.
      </p>
      <p>
       So here's my impression:
      </p>
      <p>
       First, we have the two red/green mix patches to the right of either side of his head and the blue patch on the right side of the image above his shoulder. These should be consistent with the black area. In particular, the red/green mix is an effect called "rainbowing" that is possibly indicative of photoshop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next we move to his face. The bottom right corner of the frame of his glasses (on left eye) has been edited. This is confirmed visually on inspection of the non-ELA. I would not be surprised if the glasses were photoshopped onto the image because the edges of the glasses in the ELA should match the edges of his left shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
       His eyes also appear to have been modified. Upon examination of the non-ELA photo, the iris of his eye does not appear to be circular. This is not the result of glare because of how ELA works.
      </p>
      <p>
       His right shoulder (on the left from our perspective) has a higher level of error than his right. This error level matches that of the buttons on his shirt (but not the button at the neck) and the text on the sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sign was likely present in the original photograph, but the content almost certainly was not. The giant maroon/red patch is telling. The background in the ELA image should almost certainly be black with white noise, as seen in the top right corner and bottom corners.

       I have a theory about the Band-Aid®:
      </p>
      <p>
       In the first picture of Jesus to appear after the shooting, there is no sign of any wound above his left eye. Supposedly, this was before he had surgery to his leg to remove the lodged bullet, but he appears to be standing, just fine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then, in the more recent pictures, we see the band-aid above his left eye and he is now using a cane. Theatrics.
      </p>
      <p>
       The head injury is as significant as all the other symbolism involved in this event. Not only just as a head injury, but its location above the left eye is important. As Campos's appearance on the timeline represented a monkey-wrench in the narrative, the appearance of the band-aide now signifies that he is on board and is no long a threat that could compromise the operation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think that explains the lack of press at the little SPFPA ceremony and his "disappearance" to the media. The less he speaks, the better for all involved. Some people are propped up in front of the media, making the rounds to all the news programs, while others are hidden away.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whether I believe this or not is another issue... But when I consider things like this, and things like religion and mythology, lore, etc... I always consider that whether I believe it or not, the people that practice these ideologies, do - devoutly.

       I'd chalk it up to "very strange" and common but I don't believe a head injury in that area is common for most people.  I can't say that I know a single person in my life who has hurt themselves in that area requiring bandages...including myself.  Yet somehow MANY major senior public officials have it happen on what seems like a common basis.
