       I'm a mod, and I am directly answering you. There have been some really weird slips by automod lately. But we have a 7 day waiting period. Some new users request permission to post in modmail, and we review it and allow or disallow on a per case basis. If you see a new account trolling, report the post and PM directly with a link.

       2 hrs later and you all have 17-21 upvotes. 
Someone start a thread about how often you upvote content.  I bet lots of our votes never count as things in new are perpetually LOW in vote count for the number of users.

       why? why is this even necessary? It's not. I've yet to see a single post from a NEW USER that was so important it couldn't have waited. Seriously... how does this even make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is a 7 day waiting period - it should be for everyone... across the board. The NEW USER posts I have seen lately haven't contributed anything to this forum. They have all been bullshit posts but you guys manually approved them???

       I have seen a great many posts by new users that were higher quality than 90% of the material that is generally posted here, especially in the last 2 weeks, that have been from users new to reddit altogether. You don't see it because you don't do it for a job.

       I am probably the only one to respond because I saw it and responded first. If I was incorrect, I am sure one of the others would have jumped in to correct me.

       I tried to answer you and you didn't like the answer, so we have this long thread of whining and I am done with it. We have dozens of established malicious accounts that attack our board constantly, and you want to complain about the handful that get approved and do something shitty. We have bigger problems dude. We try to allow as much as possible. As part of that, when people ask politely, we usually give them a shot. But you don't like that, you want us to be your own personal gatekeepers or something. Go make your own sub and censor it as you see fit. For the meantime, we are going to continue to do what we think is best for the sub.

       In fairness to the mods, I came here with a brand new account and tried to post a few things, but kept getting messages telling me that because my account was less than seven days old, I couldn't post. I had decided to make a new account for a variety of reasons as I'm sure many of you can understand - so I wrote to the mods explaining that I wanted to get engaged in the LV discussion before it was no longer a hot topic; I shared the details of my normal reddit account with them as a means of proving that I'm not here to troll and I'm grateful that they accepted.

       Every single time I get the same response... they will let you if you message them and ask.

       I have asked the mods in PMs as well as text posts to please explain the reasoning behind these New Users being allowed to post...

       I'm going to have to disagree with you on this during the run up to the election on the front page sometimes over 50% of the posts were negative about HRC and a majority of the rest were pro-trump. Literally the only way to use this sub was to only look at the new section or controversial.

       no said that or thinks that but a war with NK would be devastating to SK, to go to war with NK to stroke Donnies dick is asinine. he's too stupid to attempt to calm things down like every other reasonable prez has done or to let someone else do it and he won't stfu about it on twitter. War is usually not the answer and especially in this case regardless of the idiot leaders involved on both sides. There are millions of civilians that would be affected by a conflict in that region.

       You pointed out to me it was Eric. I was wrong. You think I'm fake? I'm literally one of the most active people on here and I consistently provide proofs and videos that usually open new leads. Look at my post history and see if I give a fuck about shilling for anyone.

       It's only used for forum sliding. Fill the sub with nonsense, use bots to vote it to the top, fill the comments with nonsense, use bots to upvote the comments you want everyone to see (or to bury the comments from real people you don't want visible), then you have made the forum useless for the actual exchange of information among real people.

       I upvoted your post, OP, because I believe you and agree with you. Accusing me of being a new account posting BS stories is horseshit. I reposted my link as a Connection to Paddock. I was made aware that it was Eric in the videos. I'm still not wrong that Eric is in the videos.

       You made this in response to my post though, that much is pretty obvious. I'm just saying, we need to fight the battles where they exist, not just a general "we're overrun" post. We need to point out these accounts, and have moderators ban them. That doesn't happen enough around here.

       It wasn’t in response to your post it was in response to someone posting bs and me commenting that it’s not conspiracy related and getting 7 downvotes on my comment in 3 minutes and their post getting 19 upvotes in the same amount of time. I’m keeping track of the accounts and will let mods know, we’re on the same side mate.

       It's just some asshole troll using a phone app, slide downvoting everything then switching accounts and doing it again. 12 times so far looking at this threads comments. Report it to the admins and they'll blitz the accounts.

       Mods have no control over votes whatsoever. People always yell about how the votes aren't the same as they used to be and all the trolls should be banned, not realising that banned users can still vote on threads, and they do.

       You should see the vote manipulation going on in the new queue right now, you can always tell when a psy-op hit piece is manipulated to the frontpage of /all.

       It doesn't help that people keep posting the same junk over and over again -- and not even just the same news/topics, but the same exact links and same exact titles. So you come to the page and it looks exactly like it did a few hours ago and assume there's been no new activity, when in fact, the new activity is all buried beneath these broken record re-posts.

       This account is new but it's because I had to step away from my 8 yr, 10 times guided account; the PM's and downvotes around Vegas discussion were indomitable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm afraid to log back in my inbox is probably filled with toxicity. I'm used to "that theory is moronic gtfo" responses from time to time, but the sheer, flat "you're a fucking idiot" type commentary just clogged up any decent discussion I was trying to follow in my inbox. Being on mobile I don't know how to block users.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Vegas happening is fucking sideways. To say otherwise outs you at this point. Nothing ads up and it doesn't take more than some light research to realize how backwards it all is.

       That sort of behavior is very deceptive on Reddit...often I will post my thoughts and before I go to bed maybe I will have a few upvotes/agreement.  Then I go to bed and wake up to extremely negative downvotes.  It just goes to show how the acceptable norms/narratives are pushed.

       That specific incidence happened to a few threads and started +20 to a random post. About 10-15 minutes later all comments save AutoModerator got -20.
      </p>
      <p>
       IntellisaurDinoAlien, a mod here in conspiracy, stated he believed it was DronePuppet due to his grammar and phrasing.

       In addition, you have this post planning to bot attack Conspiracy that was removed by Reddit Admins:
       <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170830162732/https://np.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyRight/comments/6wx3iv/how_were_going_to_beat_the_shills/">

       My assumption this is further bot manipulation by DronePuppet and compnay.

       Take the tinfoil hat off bud. I assume I’m like a lot of people and found this sub because I wanted to see what all the nuts were saying about the Vegas shooting. It’s not a nefarious plot but some showdown organization. It’s a bunch of regular people that found the sub and decided to make fun of you guys.

       You haven’t spent much time here as those blinkers are firmly welded on. Perhaps you’ll learn a little critical thinking during your visit. Until then I hope your life brightens as you’re clearly suffering a miserable existence.

       I archived this thread a few times as it was happening. A lot of comments were downvoted way outside of the norm. In the first two, it doesn't show the comments that were new but downvoted below 5 so that they'd be hidden. For some reason the archive doesn't show that, but most of the comments less than an hour old were hidden.

       I see what you mean then, and yep, the normals have come to visit on the back of the Vegas 'event'. This happens whenever there's high profile Govt. fuckery, a few psy-op ringleaders and a whole boatload of useful idiots fresh from the latest frontpage hit piece. We can ban them but we can't stop them voting.

       I'm new here, but I really don't see why I see this mentality keep coming up.. isn't the idea to have healthy debate? Find some semblance of truth? If I'm wrong, I want to be told I'm wrong, not just have what I think confirmed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen more evolution of theories concerning the Vegas thing, than I have in any of the wilder conspiracies I see, that only some choose to participate in.. More voices simply mean more ideas, more discussion.. I see no harm in that.

       Its easy to find the mainstream narrative that is being pushed or common, look around you and you will see it and hear it. The point of this place is to do exactly what you suggested and use our own judgement in place of the judgement that is generally fed to us so that we parrot it further and not actually discussing what happened. Nothing is being automatically dismissed, its just that its easier to start at an alternative spot compared to whatever is being pushed. Sometimes its just a bunch of stupid people not accepting what does seem to be fact, but truth is fickle and subject to perception and hopefully we can sort through it and get closer to Truth.

       I mean, I'm with you, for the most part I guess. I don't blame the media for reporting what they've been told in regards to the Vegas shooter, I blame shitty police work. I don't condemn an entire news source, I look at the merits of lack of, of the individuals reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the case of the Vegas shooting, there's nothing about the timeline that makes sense. What they claimed this past Monday made the most sense, but they got called on their bullshit Friday, and are back to their bullshit story. It's clear they straight up lied on Monday to put out something more plausible, but that's not the reporters that lied, that's the law enforcement lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I agree, I want to get closer to the truth. If I'm wrong I want to be told I'm wrong, and I don't think they should ban people who would tell me I'm wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       The sheriff in Friday said he refers to conspiracy theories as conspiracy fantasy. I think he had a point, there's people that use their imagination more than they use fact, and they get upset when someone pokes holes in their Fantasy. Then there's people who try to gather facts that they believe show that something else possibly happened. Most aren't trying to imagine what they think happened and build backwards.. they're trying to build a logical case for something, and they seem more than okay with being wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of it belongs here. There's nothing wrong with being wrong, but there's also nothing wrong with entertaining ideas that might not be so plausible. Sometimes it's that kind of divergent thinking that will reveal something useful, even if it's not the original idea.

       I've lurked here a very long time. I've seen two types of people, people who react positively to criticism, and those who react badly. The latter going so far as to call them shills and whatnot, for simply disagreeing with them. I've seen it be far more volatile than it is now, a few months ago I never would have joined..
      </p>
      <p>
       But I've seen more moderators enforce the rule against calling people shills, allowing discussion rather than remove comments that they don't like or disagree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I think the argument about "mainstream media" is where the issue is. The guy I responded to can use a mainstream source, but then accuse someone of being condescending for using one to say he's wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I simply don't get it, people getting upset because of sources, or criticism. It's a
       <em>
        discussion
       </em>
       , and as long as everyone acts civilly, it should be allowed to continue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get upset about being wrong.. an example was that one of the pictures was photoshopped of Campos. Someone made the claim, but didn't provide the source. I said they wouldn't. Then they did. Then I couldn't recreate it.. then I found out archive.is doesn't archive each element of the page, but the picture itself was archived.. and I found out I was quite wrong. Edited my comment to show I was wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not upset, I'm glad there's now evidence that I can confirm myself was edited and had the wrong date. Verifying or debunking is what's going to lead to the best truth. Media is simply regurgitating what the officials are claiming happened, and it is up to us to verify or debunk what they claim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, I think if there was a more concerted effort to evaluate what they present to us, to see if it can be debunked, would give us better ways to see what better explanation might make more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But not if people here generally thinking disproving something is bad. Not if they think or assume it's so someone can feel superior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Idk, hopefully I've clarified a bit. Discussion and debate seem healthy, and more likely to lead to us finding out what did happen, since for the most part I think we all agree, something isn't right.

       Thank you for clarifying. The point is that the MSM cannot be trusted. The fact that Obama's passed a law allowing the government to use propaganda on its citizens via mainstream media, speaks for itself. Not only that, they've been caught lying over and over again. I'm sure they report some truths mixed in with those lies, but it's nearly impossible to go through each story with a fine tooth comb. The easiest solution is to write them off imo, and I think the majority on this sub feel the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do agree with you that many people do not handle differing opinions very well. Something about conspiracies can really make people get worked up in defending their ideas. I don't hang on very tightly to ideas and leave myself open to changing my mind on things, sounds like you're the same, so I apologize for being wrong about you.

       I see your reasons as far as mainstream media goes, and I agree to a degree.. but I also see who benefits from telling us what we want to hear. If people start turning to generic websites absolutely covered in ads, like many of the ones I'm seeing posted in this sub related to the Los Vegas shooting.. what's their motivation? To spread truth? Hard to believe considering the number of ads.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea of "fake news" has made it profitable to say anything that disagrees with what they say. Do you doubt that there's anyone here who saw that potential, because as you said, most people here agree.. isn't it likely there's many individuals that are writing what we wanna hear, truth or not, to get ad revenue, because they know we'll eat it up? Likely posting their own sites.
      </p>
      <p>
       So now there's solid reasoning to doubt all media really. Real news because of their motives, but actual fake news, also because of its motives
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, I don't think blanket ignoring any source is going to leave anyone better informed. We have to question everything regardless, hope we're smarter than those that would manipulate us, regardless of the motivation to.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you're right, I'm not clinging onto any ideas, I tend to be reserved on my judgements, but I'm pretty sure most things I believe, I'm pretty open minded about them. And I think it's pretty cool this discussion didn't turn into the typical shit show that many do here.. I think most of the time, it is because we assume way too much about the other person. I try not to, but I've definitely been guilty!

       There's a big difference between differing opinions and outright lying and propaganda though, and the MSM are guilty of the latter. Therefore, if someone tries to use CNN as a source for example, then they're most likely new to the conspiracy world, or are still asleep at the wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with open discussion where people have differing ideas, that's how we learn and grow. At the end of the day, I want to be wrong if it means I'm getting closer to the truth, and it sounds you're the same.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, thread after thread the top comments get hijacked by people bitching at each other, while being totally off topic and resorting to personal attacks. I get it though, it hurts the ego for some people to be wrong and they take that negative feeling and attack the person who showed them they were wrong.

       Let's examine the idea of "differing opinions" though. Sure, they can float things that are opinions that differ.. but when their pure motivation is clicks/ad revenue, and technically they have no reputation to really worry about losing since they aren't a reliable source.. why
       <em>
        wouldn't
       </em>
       they lie, if it makes them more money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think about 4chan, I've seen multiple people say, even if it's wrong 99% of the time, that 1% is totally worth sifting through all those lies. Using that logic, people will choose to believe what confirms what they think, as long as sometimes it ends up being true.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mainstream media, at most, has biased opinions. I've never seen outright lies with intent, just half truths. Stretching the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just not the type that thinks everything government is pure evil. I think most people at the top probably have motives that don't represent us: money for the rich, make laws against the poor, make loopholes for my rich friends.. etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think some, at least, want to make things better, and though they may be distracted by those same motives, some.. aren't purely evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where we might differ is on the president. Far too many seem to think he's going to
       <em>
        drain the swamp
       </em>
       , while he has a history of doing
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       to save a few bucks. I think he's the worst swamp creature possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think a Hillary presidency would be more of the same, nothing really noticeable going on.. then we have Trump, mainly just undoing anything Obama did, and when he's bored he's just dividing our country, threatening a nation with nukes, telling people who happen to mostly be black what to do during the anthem.. you know, just constantly distracting people from whatever he's actually doing that matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       While most think every government official is likely a socio/psychopath actively trying to kill us for whatever reason.. we have a president who's obviously narcissistic, cares more about how he's perceived than the ramifications of his actions.. and motives are unclear. Destroy health care because Obama. Get in pissing match with North Korea, because.. reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would Russia have to destabilize our country, when we have a president that is rather good at dividing, distracting, and destroying anything he just doesn't like?

       I think a lot of people get excited when they see something, and instead of search to see if it's been posted.. I commented in a post about this this morning, that was already pretty popular by the time I saw it.

       People upvote things they haven't seen, and downvote to keep posts from looking like spam when the same thing is posted multiple times.

       make sure you're viewing by NEW, not HOT. A lot of stuff in this sub gets buried and it's the best way to get good information. Conspiracy or not, a lot of factual data with Las Vegas is getting down-voted massively.

       Because the ridiculous claims make for a good laugh. But seriously, all I see here are outrageous claims about some hole in the narrative. Of course there’s incomplete information and contradictory information coming out, it’s an active investigation by numerous LE agencies and covered by 100s of media outfits. Shits gonna get confusing. It’s like you guys believe that all information collected by law enforcement should be immediately available to you. Just because there’s something that doesn’t make sense to you or information that isn’t readily available to you doesn’t mean it’s a massive conspiracy.

       Of course some conspriacies are going to be ridiculous, some are seeing things where there is nothing there. But the whole point is critical thinking and asking questions and eventually people stumble upon some things that make no sense and start to add up.

       I had this discussion with my boyfriend earlier today. He's very big into conspiracies and I tolerate them but am more skeptical about some of them, I even said something similar to him- that it's an active investigation and just because they correct information doesn't necessarily mean anything. But there are other odd things about the LV shooting than just corrected information. You can easily explain one thing off but when there are a lot of holes, then something feels wrong. A lot of people making guesses will be wrong, but that's ok. There is no harm in conjecture and questioning. Questioning and being wrong is always better than blindly accepting what you're told.

       But then you end up with people going to far, like when they started attacking the parents of the kids killed at sandy hook for being actors. That shit can hurt people.

       No, sorry. That's the same specific excuse people parrot constantly for the reason to not question
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       conspiracies and it's crap, to be frank. Some people are crazy, that's not going to change by not questioning things. People get hurt daily from other people's actions, that's life. One instance isn't a reason to stop talking about everything and to stop asking questions. People talking about the potential that sandy hook didn't happen didn't force anyone to harass the parents, they did that on their accord. Talking hurts no one, accepting things without question hurts everyone.

       There is not possibility that sandy hook didn’t happen. You’re a tin foil hat wearing, wanna be Alex Jones. It bothers me that there are people like you out there. I wouldn’t trust someone like you to fly a plane I’m on or drive a bus near me or even make my McDonald’s fries.

       Lol so now the character assassinations, cute. Didn't take long. I never said I believed sandy hook didn't happen, nor could it even be implied from my post. You brought up an example of why we should never question anything and I called you out on the parroted crappy logic.

       Also for the note, I have never watched, read, or listened to anything Alex Jones has said. However, it's a guaranteed attempt at an insult with people like yourself. Predictable.

       If you wanted to take it seriously you'd put in research and not ask for a 'too long, didn't read' on an ongoing investigation that hasn't provided a motive and has only led the public to believe of a single entity behind the crime, from start until present.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you had any inclination to find out if there is substance behind people's concerns regarding Vegas, you wouldn't have asked your question in the manner that you did.

       I was going to take your answer at face value with the grain of salt being that it's still an open investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       My take is that they're still looking for a second shooter and don't want to give much up to better catch him.

       That would be false. The sheriff, under-sheriff, and special agent of the FBI leading the investigation have all claimed without a doubt, there was not a second shooter.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's plenty of information available to question their narrative in that sense. If you have any interest, put in the time. If not, good day.

       Very soon it’ll be un-American to talk about Vegas. The jesus freak right and left wingers will say we’re pissing on the flag and that we’re insensitive to the dead. The endgame is that we’re not patriots, That we must be medicated, and taxed to death. Everything in the current MSM shitscape is sectarian overload. If you don’t pledge your soul to the machine your shit, if you sit or you stand, you’re shit. We’ve not at war with eastasia, we’ve always been at war with eastasia. FUCK THEM.

       Ever since Weinstein went down, the_donald has been taking trips on the short bus over here to post non stop about democrats and Hollywood being evil Satan worshipping pedophiles. I don't remember this sub being so upset when O'Reilly went down. Apparently it's much more important when a democrat goes down.

       It's always a good idea to hit the new button and up vote threads with low karma, prevents them from being buried before people can engage them.

       This is my most frequented sub (ok second, r/gonewild is amazing!!!) &amp; I will get bored &amp; post some off the wall shit for fun. I have honestly seen that my BS is not down voted as hard as my actual thoughts. Example: there was a post earlier about pictures of Campos being dead im them. Some one posted "you'd be amazed at what an excellent mortician can do" I responded w/ "no, as an excellent mortician I wouldn't" instant down voting. It's in my god dammed username &amp; I get down voted for telling a jerk he's wrong?

       Noticed that was happening right after Las Vegas. It makes sense from TPTB perspective. It makes the whole sub more noise than signal. Maybe a lasvegasshooting dedicated sub would be better with a strong mod.

       Not saying you are wrong, but that would be the sort of thing that would be very easy to provide evidence for. So, why didn't OP provide it?

       Right before I made this post I had posted about Jesus Campos being admitted to a clinic. That post had 30+ downvotes in one minute and then then was buried under about 30 random non-conspiracy posts, most of those posts made by accounts that were under a month old. I didn’t screenshot each post and write down account names in the moment I just made this post. And immediately every comment here was getting up to 50 downvotes within minutes of the comments being posted.

       Firstly, all you did was provide words, not evidence. Second of all, if I were just to take your word for these things, it still wouldn't be evidence towards the thesis of this thread. The thesis had literally nothing to do with downvoted which is all you've claimed here. Like I said, I'm not saying it's wrong, but evidence would be appreciated.

       What kind of evidence can I provide now after the fact? I hear what you’re saying but since I didn’t screenshot the posts that buried the Campos/clinic post you’re right it’s just words and I wish I HAD. Luckily several mods saw what happened with this post while it was happening. We’re on the same side friend.

       So you're saying that only for a brief moment in time the sub was being flooded with non conspiracy posts from new accounts? Cause I got the impression you were implying this is the new standard.

       Yes, it was slow on here and refreshing “new” wasn’t showing new content
       <em>
        until
       </em>
       I posted the Campos clinic article and out of nowhere refreshing “new” showed 30+ bs content non conspiracy links and the article was downvoted hard and buried. And some of the accounts were a week old, none were older than a month.

       They sacrificed the megalomaniac sexual predator under the lens effect. Classic propaganda. Is what that piece of shit horrible, yes. However, if you didn’t think this existed, or currently exists in Hellywood you’re a goddamn fool. I don’t give a fuck about that in comparison to the blatant fuckery of Vegas. Deal with it.

       Ok, so if 234 million unique visitors is "lame" and "not mainstream", then I think you need to define the point at which something becomes "not lame" and "mainstream" so that we can be on the same page.

       While I respect everyone's right to voice their opinion, I hope this can be gotten under control.  Despite how people try to paint this thread, it is actually one of the best places I've seen for discussions.  The commenters are respectful, the content is interesting and thought provoking, the tone is sympathetic to all people for the most part, not just those who agree with you.  Much better than the subs with clear political slants.  I think this one has a good mix of both right and left perspective, both coming from a position of wanting the seek the truth.  I hope trolls don't ruin it.

       I remember coming to this sub and learning so much new and exciting information. Since the last presidential election, Reddit as a whole has just been bought/bot driven. Literally one of the last frontiers for honest opinions and open discussions, now home to the hot button topics of the water-cooler.

       I wish there were more alt-history, alt-science, elite corruption, and deeper rabbit holes than the surface level junk we've all read so much of in the last year.

       I think in the wake of Vegas this sub blew up with a lot of genuine conspiracy threads that uncovered real discrepancies in the official narrative. There was a huge spike in the subs popularity, certain people took notice, and a new effort was made to inundate the sub with disinformation and gain control of it. Somewhere in that timeframe the Harvey Weinstein story broke...

       It's only used for forum sliding. Fill the sub with nonsense, use bots to vote it to the top, fill the comments with nonsense, use bots to upvote the comments you want everyone to see (or to bury the comments from real people you don't want visible), then you have made the forum useless for the actual exchange of information among real people.
