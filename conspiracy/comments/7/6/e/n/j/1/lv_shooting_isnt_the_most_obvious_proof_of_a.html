    <div class="md"><p>In all of the shooting though, how often do you hear two guns at once?  Granted, the second window is really strange.  Is it possible he planned on another person being there?  Maybe Jesus before he backed out?  Easiest explanation for all the guns, all the ammo, and two windows would be somebody got cold feet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>LVPD says the second window was used for the fuel tanks. I also don&#39;t think Paddock&#39;s window was broken during the attack, as photo analysis doesn&#39;t show a broken window in his suite during the shooting. Also the fuel tanks thing doesn&#39;t make any sense, because he can literally hit the tanks from either window very easily.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He also wasn&#39;t stupid. You can&#39;t just shoot a jet fuel tank and have it explode. You need consistent heat applied to create the pressure needed for it to burst. Paddock would have known that if he considered the fuel tank as a target. Who wouldn&#39;t know about the fuel tanks issue? Someone who&#39;s trying to set Paddock up, create havok, and shoot everything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the preciseness of the top shot on that tank leads me to believe otherwise. someone who thought it could do damage, but also knew they could make that shot. is it possible it was just 2 shots trying to be on target? sure. </p>

<p>I can&#39;t prove intent in the same way the FBI can&#39;t prove they were missed shots on the crowd that hit the tanks, by chance. However, they have assumed intent, and I will assume marksmanship beyond our &#39;shooters&#39; capability. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah he’s a genius. Too bad no matter what round it wasn’t going to explode. Fuel vapor? Dafuq u talking about. He had a scope.

    <div class="md"><p>the tanks have to vent off vapors to avoid over-compression and subsequent explosion. having a scope or not doesn&#39;t make it call of duty; his sighting would have had to been adjusted correctly, and the distance wasn&#39;t a &#39;gimme&#39; by any means. shooting on a crowd of 22,000 is one thing, whereas hitting a target from 600+ yards out is another. I&#39;m not talking about the shot to the side of the tank, but the one that hit the upper most section. Maybe it was a lucky shot? I&#39;m not discounting that notion. Appears to be odd regardless. </p>
