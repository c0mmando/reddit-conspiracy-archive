    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t even talking about AJ. I was almost 10 when the year 2000 hit, so I remember it. all 1999 and 1998 it was all over the fucking news, they were hyping it up in the mainstream and people were buying out supermarkets and shit by the end lol.</p>

<p>most people still believed it was crazy -- or worked with technology and had some greater degree of understanding that regular people didn&#39;t at the time. I wasn&#39;t fortunate enough to have my own computer and the internet yet... </p>

<p>but still, it made no sense, most devices weren&#39;t interconnected yet anyways, they were all analog, and even as a 9-year old I knew every electronic device couldn&#39;t possible fuck up.</p>

<p>some/most didn&#39;t even KEEP the date on the chip.</p>

<p>it was really only an issue for companies, business and accounting, and I&#39;m sure at that point they kept a lot more solid records.</p>

<p>like I said some businesses in Europe couldn&#39;t afford to hire the massive programmer squads we did here to fix all the bugs in corporate and consumer software datekeeping -- really all they had to do was switch the type of integer from like, 8-bit to 16-bit.</p>

<p>it was just a huge deal because of how much software, including OSs etc, was lazily programmed for earlier, lowerspec machines and just ported without any thought put into it.</p>

<p>but it affected businesses in Europe -- who just kept chugging along knowing in their head that 1900 was 2000 until you know, they bought a new system lol.</p>

<p>the question here Isnt is AJ a shill, its why everyone was shilling so damn hard for Y2K and making up what were clearly and entirely myths about the event specifically to tell the public via mass media?</p>

<p>the frenzy was entirely manufactured... it had (literally) almost nothing to do with consumers aside from the fact the date would be wrong on the VCR or PC at worst. but since NONE OF US WERE ALIVE in 1900, there were no business records on PCs at that time anyway, so it wouldn&#39;t even overwrite shit.</p>

<p>I just don&#39;t understand how it ever blew into such a major conspiracy theory -- bigger than that 2012 bullshit was -- when we actually had a hard definition of what the problem actually WAS in reality.</p>

<p>I think y2k is a good example of the disinfo that was possible to spread before the internet became what it is... </p>

<p>today you can just look up the basics of programming and also the y2k problem and within minutes you will see factual information based off what the problem was...</p>

<p>back then people were idiots in the dark and just listened to what they were told unless they were computer professionals -- who I can only assume thought these claims were patently ridiculous as I did when I started learning about computers...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trump is so far removed from the common man, he has no idea what it&#39;s like. He was born into money, his start in life was also just given to him. What common man do you know that had that start? Do you own a business? </p>

<p>We don&#39;t need a useless middle man though. Humans are doing labor, they are preforming a service. Why should such a high percentage of the money made go upward? Why should a CEO make millions more than their grunts when the CEOs are just as necessary as their employees, but not. That&#39;s not the mentality. It&#39;s more like &quot;you should be thankful you have a job.&quot; &quot;Just work <em>really hard</em> and you can make it&quot;. You can&#39;t have a nation of CEOs. You can&#39;t have a nation of business owners. In other words, if everyone had the &quot;American dream&quot;, who would work at the entry level? You think only teenagers are working minimum wage jobs? </p>

<p>The system is inherently flawed. Any working within in the system is still acknowledging it as a thing, something that&#39;s &quot;real&quot;. When we throw it aside, as one does when something no longer serves us, then we can make real progress. Corporations must be served by people, bar none. Why are they necessary? There is a demand and a need for products and services, we should allocate resources appropriately for this. Without the hindrance of a arbitrary monetary system, we can actually do some good in the world of <em>everyone</em> not just a few. That... is for the common man. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, trump and anyone who&#39;s a part of the &quot;elite&quot; don&#39;t have to have come from a poor background to understand what its like to be poor, just like a white person doesn&#39;t have to be black to understand how racism works. Human beings have the ability to learn from other peoples experiences. It is why we record history. Trump may not have experienced being poor but he surely has comprehension of it. Just like we can comprehend what Its like to be a billionaire.</p>

<p>Also, the reason a CEO makes more then the one flipping burgers, or cashiering is because of what it took to become the CEO of a massive company. And of course there are exceptions like the Walmart kids. But generally speaking someone comes up with an idea, formulates a business plan, gets a loan, builds a business, hires people to help run the business and then they appoint other management to help run the business while they explore further opportunities for the company and network and build on their creation. The people who are working at the bottom did nothing but apply and interview and then do basic work for basic income. You make what you earn. Complaining about how much money the .1% has makes you exactly $0.00 an hour, but trying to join them will fill you with passion and dedication which are worth more then how much money you also will make. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not quite. There&#39;s usually a little more empathy attached, some that&#39;s required to connect with other people and care about other people. </p>

<p>I would expect confidence from someone who is alpha, not over the top arrogance. He&#39;s wrong about so much, misses basic details but man, does he have a mouth on him anyway. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t run out of love for anything except for money and power. Why do you think he got to where he is? Saying the pledge of allegiance? The only thing he likes about America is the system itself that allows him such levels of lust for power and money, while even being celebrated for it. Pretty sad, in my opinion. And we wonder why we have issues in our country. They&#39;re feeding us a shit sandwich and calling it a filet mignon while they&#39;re eating filet mignon their selves. These people got to where they are on the backs of other people and he can&#39;t even muster up a tiny bit of empathy?

I can see why you think that, because its easy to fall into that trap because its a simple answer as to why you&#39;re poor and don&#39;t have what they have, and how its so hard to get there. But once you start breaking down that theory to specifics, it falls apart pretty quick. You&#39;re a nihilist, and a cynic. And while you might think you&#39;re onto something or see deeper than others into the cesspool of Washington, you don&#39;t. You&#39;re just justifying your insecurity and laziness. Man up. </p>

When did a republican in the primaries talk about that?  They didn’t.  Now you’re talking about the general election.  Of course the democrats will bring that shit up.  The Republicans in the primaries didn’t though.  If they were so afraid of Trump being their nominee and were using “dirty tricks” to try and stop him why didn’t they bring that shit up even once?</p>

<p>Mom drop you on your head a lot? Or is English just not your first language?

    <div class="md"><p>Like i said, it&#39;s easyer when you are not part of it. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll try to explain what i see .I had typed something out before in a topic about the break of the climate accord, so i&#39;ll just copy paste and add some.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know if i am right, i am Dutch and just looking from a distance at the American system and try to figure it out.</p>

<p>I see Trump as a goldfisch thrown in a shark tank.</p>

<p>Trump thought he new all the rules and tricks that comes with doing buisness and he thought running the country was like playing the same game on a bigger level. But seeing he is a selfmade man he was not aware to the &quot;evil plans&quot; and connections of the real PTB and he was left out of a lot of information.</p>

<p>Now he is finding out that the rules and even the entire game is very different as he tought and friends are turning into enemies without him knowing why.</p>

<p>The covernment is corrupt to the bone and is playing a whole different game with a whole new set of rules. And if you don&#39;t know the real game and the real rules you will fail in your work. This also explains why there are Builderberger people in Trumps government, i think he did know of all the conections, he just did not know the more evil parts of them. And i have a feeling that Trump, even now he is president, is not beeing told the (complete) truth and he is trusting on the wrong people or presented false information.</p>

<p>This is Trump now, struggeling to get a grip on the situation, trying to find out who and what to trust, trying to find the truth. And now he is learning the game, the rules and how to play and he is becomming aware the consequenses of it.</p>

<p>Quitting the Paris agreement is, to me, a huge move and is pointing in the direction that Trump still is fighting for the right cause. This might seem controversial and look likes i don&#39;t give a fu.k about our world, but is see the world in a whole different way as mainstrean everything promotes. In my world free clean energy should be availeble for everybody, but if you remove the oil the whole system of TPTB falls together, so you can&#39;t promote this in the current time, especially not when you are a president.</p>

<p>The Paris agreement cost a lot of money and, to me, it is not well spend and is keeping people from beeing independent. Trump might know the secret of free energy also, the Trump family is linked to Nicola Tesla and i would not be surprised if they got his resurch.</p>

<p>But if the president would bring out this info too soon all hell will break loose, there for it might be better to play it like he does now and save a lot of money from useless articles now and bring on the real change later on.</p>

<p>I also can see it in all the mainstream media reporting about Trump, the blatent bias shines throug everything. The Rusland narrative has started in the end term of Obama and the media are still running with this, eventhough the whole story falls apart at the seems and is quite possibly the exact opposite as they are reporting.</p>

<p>And there are many more pointers to Trump fighting for the &quot;good&quot;, but somehow they all are bend to the opposite or burried. This too says a lot for me and this is also why i do not believe the mainstream narrative. The same goes for the polaire media as Reddit, Twitter and Facebook, here is also a very big push back on both Trump as wel as the truth.</p>

<p>Ah well, i might just see it all wrong and i am also being tricked into believing in Trump, but for now i still have a little bit of hope left.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You tried to make a binary argument that you say leaves us only two options. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t buy into any of this, including the OP. </p>

<p>Alex Jones is not a plant. He&#39;s just who he is. There&#39;s no reason to think he&#39;s anything other than that, although I can understand people making an argument he may be part of limited hangout. If he is part of limited hangout, I&#39;d argue he&#39;s not aware of that and thinks he&#39;s independent. </p>

<p>Trump is not part of the deepstate, but he is likely getting controlled to an extent by them as he&#39;s complying with them more now. This happened likely because he was having issues with them refusing to do what he wants and he&#39;s trying to work with them to accomplish things. He should have drained the swamp instead as he said he was going to. </p>

<p>The deep state does not control elections, but could if they decided to. The electronic voting machines are easily hacked, and this would be how they would. The 1% controls the elections quite well however with their influence from lobbyists and their wealth via donations and even sponsoring protesters. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes in general lately I have gotten very unsettling vibes from AJ. Those who seek and speak the truth tend to have an air of sobriety and plainneas in the midst of chaos as their ultimate goal is to find the real truth (which requires steady skepticism) and help others understand the truth (which requires clear communication) . AJ seems less and less interested in the truth these days and more interested in sensationalism. </p>

They are bad, trust me and the other threads that talk about alex jones being bad.  he is bad i said so and that is that OKAY.   AGREE WITH ME AND OBEY!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Evidence is abundant to anyone with the internet. The deciding factor is within yourself. I can&#39;t say for sure Jones is 100% shill, he may just be genuinely successful and very nuts. The CIA may have been fucking with him for years (I think they fucked with Cooper for sure). The strongest evidence for Jones are very select clips you can find on youtube and the like. Clips where Jones carries the water for Israel, tries to say that Arabs run Hollywood, absolutely loses his mind about Hillary Clinton and says she&#39;s a goddamn demon and precedes to argue with the voices in his own head (this last one happened after I stopped watching his show on a regular basis). </p>

<p>Take it from a guy like me. From Peter Jennings and Baba Wawa, to CNN, to Glen Beck, to Orielly, to Jones, to Rense, to Icke. They&#39;ve all got their own agendas. Many things can be learned from all, but don&#39;t think for a fucking second these people are here to help you. </p>

Do you think millions of people are tuning in to a wacky nut job? “He makes theorists look bad.” You have absolutely no evidence to point to that proves this.

    <div class="md"><p>You are free to believe that. I actually loved him on Piers Morgan but not for the right reasons. Alex&#39;s abrasive style is divisive to many. Entrancing to a few. I was once entranced. After awhile though, you see that his method of action is great for amassing himself a small fortune, but not so great at actually producing change. He&#39;s not the first maverick, he won&#39;t be the last, so please let go of your cognitive dissonance. A tarnished Alex Jones doesn&#39;t negate his truths, it only makes it easier to spot his lies. Look into how often Alex Jones criticizes Israel. Look into why. There are many factions of Elite. Some are globalists, some are nationalists. Some are religious, some are secular. It&#39;s not all black and white. AJ, by choice or by gunpoint, is leaving certain things off the table and saying some extremely insane shit from time to time that is not helpful to the truth movement. </p>

<p>His style seeks to further the divide, he cements us in with our confirmation bias but pushes those who didn&#39;t already believe further away in his madness and aggression. I find it totally plausible the intel spooks are and have been driving him crazy for awhile so it may not be all organic but it&#39;s totally there plain as day. From one seeker of truth to another if you fail to find any such clips, I will gladly fire up the search engine and gather them for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if you had proof that Alex Jones is a nationalist elite, doesn’t change the fact that the system he is constantly pitching (free market, pro-Constitution, pro-Bill of Rights) sounds a lot more attractive to your average person than what the globalists are constantly pitching (1 World Government, and Hollywood runs the show). Look at how Hollywood is collapsing. Those “few” you say are entranced by Alex Jones style has actually risen to a hell of a lot more than a “few.” And he’s 100% a part of the truth movement exposing Hollywood for the pathetic shit show it is and always has been. Also, and no disrespect, you seem to be making some illegitimate claims here like the OP. You claim he’s “saying some extremely insane shit.” What are you referring to exactly? He says a lot of insane shit that always happens to end up being true. “His style seeks to further the divide.” I’m sorry but this is just false. If his style is seeking to do this, he’s been failing himself greatly because all he’s managed to do is create a movement and bring millions (literally) of like-minded people together in order to fight globalism with information. I understand he’s just reporting news at the end of the day, but he just so happens to be the most watched news reporter in the history of America. In fact, you can argue Alex Jones is causing a divide... a divide between the globalist elite and the rest of us, and thank God he’s doing that. Helps us identify who and what we’re up against.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Alex Jones has always been more aligned with libertarians and constitutionalist. It just so happens, that for the first time in WHO THE FUCK KNOWS, a guy running to be president checks off a lot of those check marks (that a libertarian such as myself) said FUCK IT, and threw his support in. If the &quot;powers that be&quot; really wanted Trump to be the guy, you would have witnessed positive Trump propaganda by the MSM, and we all know that DID NOT happen. So, with the possibility of this being the last election to reclaim power from true authoritarianism, I completely understand AJ throwing his full support in. I truly believe he was the last hope, before that last falling domino. </p>

<p>Plus, you&#39;re right, the exact appeal of Trump is that he appealed to the disenfranchised conservative voters. Would any of them been persuaded by the media they don&#39;t trust? Quite the opposite, it would have made them realize that he was just another slick-tongued politician being shoved down our throats by the establishment, saying the right things, while in reality selling snake oil... </p>

<p>It&#39;s still dumbfounding to me that people think Trump cares about the common man, when every action he&#39;s ever taken has suggested the opposite. Electing Trump wasn&#39;t going against the establishment, it was just taking out the middle man.</p>

He&#39;s got a cult following that swears any criticism is CTR. He can do no wrong. He&#39;s draining the swamp right? By filling his administration with billionaires and selling cabinet positions and director positions to the highest bidder. It&#39;s business as usual and the common man hasn&#39;t benefited in the slightest. Surprise surprise. He&#39;s not our lord and savior. Turns out he&#39;s an old white billionaire who has never once in his life experienced what just being a normal person is like. He&#39;s so out of touch with reality and people think he&#39;s going to save us. No one makes it to the office of president without selling out the American people.

    <div class="md"><p>While I do think (to the credit of all involved) his show does do something for getting people to difficult first step, or maybe more fittingly, see the rabbit hole, that&#39;s a <em>really</em> small step looking back in perspective.  The problem is most people often don&#39;t get to have the perspective of looking relatively far back as I describe because their development of knowledge is caught up in a bunch of questionably verifiable, non-actionable, bumper sticker, cookie cutter, criminally negligent, mainstream alternative media that, more often that not, tells you what they think you want to hear  (and they&#39;re usually right.).  So I suggest to the bottom 95% of us, maybe generalize to ones that look over where they&#39;re not supposed to, try to remember, &quot;If you&#39;re not confused, you don&#39;t know whats going on.&quot; The top 5% already tend to.</p>

<p>Am I saying everything Alex Jones says is garbage? No, the most you&#39;ll get out of me is judging every claim piece by piece, and maybe a suggestion to avoid becoming the victim of one&#39;s call to arms one way or the other. That, and I&#39;ll drop a 83k word article on Alex Jones, his background as well as his superclass ties, as well as a few links below I&#39;ve posted in comments before on the topic of past people &quot;telling you what they they you want to hear&quot;. I feel like a broken record with these, but its a case where imo the source(s) are often required reading tier and its being slept on because these walls of text and drier, thorough video documentation are in competition with the 15 minute dopamine hit, the hot topic videos of people wildly speculating about &quot;something strange happening&quot;.  I digress.</p>

</ol>

<blockquote>
<p>As usual, the article became much longer than expected. Less usual is the considerable amount of philosophizing and theorizing in the last two segments. The fact is, despite his admission and despite everything already established in ISGP&#39;s Cult of National Security Trolls article about Jones&#39; new age sister show Coast to Coast AM, at this point it can&#39;t be proved with absolute certainty that Jones is CIA. What has more or less been established beyond reasonable doubt though is that he clearly is an agent of influence for the conservative establishment. That alone should disqualify him from being accepted as the public face of the modern conspiracy movement, as his opinions and antics only serve to discredit it.</p>

<p>Jones&#39; primary objective should be to reopen the NIST investigation on the World Trade Center collapses, but with Jones refusing to consistently or even occasionally address the numerous key flaws in the report, and instead to focus on disinformation, unimportant information, or making superficial and incoherent rants, this is unlikely to happen in the near future. Jones is his own worst enemy and one wonders to what extent this is by design. Already years ago, ISGP published an article entitled The Media&#39;s Psywar Manual: 54 Tactics the Mainstream and Alternative Media Use to Undermine Conspiracy Thinking. Take a look at the identified tactics for the alternative media and think about how many you recognize in Jones. Probably more than half:</p>

<ol>
<li>Study major controversial events like conspiracy researchers would do, but look for points to manipulate and exploit so skeptics can debunk them and false debates can be created.</li>
<li>Ignore new revelations and insights into a conspiracy as much as possible once false debates have been generated.</li>
<li>Invent a conspiracy theory about every new news report.</li>
<li>Only make use of publicly released documents. Don&#39;t do any unique investigative work.</li>
<li>Limit the amount of new information made available to an absolute minimum.</li>
<li>Protect your allies and bosses in government and the private sector.</li>
<li>Keep it in the (dysfunctional) family, from fellow conspiracy theorists to skeptics-for-hire.</li>
<li>Only allow questionable &quot;insiders&quot; to do the whistleblowing.</li>
<li>Link conspiracy to anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial.</li>
<li>Link conspiracy to ridiculous cliches as the Illuminati, reptilians, the Anunnaki, and the NWO.</li>
<li>Protect sitting administrations with the claim that a &quot;rogue cell&quot; or &quot;shadow government&quot; perpetrated a major conspiracy.</li>
<li>Behave like a mentally deranged or highly obnoxious individual.</li>
<li>Lump everything together: UFOs, the new age, geopolitics and conspiracy.</li>
<li>Take witness testimony and physical evidence out of context.</li>
<li>Come up with theories that cannot be proved nor disproved.</li>
<li>Accuse someone of not being &quot;open-minded&quot; if they refuse to take your made-up theory serious.</li>
<li>When a claim of yours gets effectively refuted, do not acknowledge this fact and instantly switch to other arguments and questions, preferably ones your debating partner hasn&#39;t gotten a chance to prepare for.</li>
<li>Draw somewhat proper conclusions, but based on easy-to-discredit arguments.</li>
<li>Have a prominent conspiracy advocate uphold the official story (mainly think respected leftists of the &quot;liberal CIA&quot; network).</li>
</ol>

<p>...</p>

<p><strong>The good news is that ultimately I think having someone around like Alex Jones is great for us and detrimental to the West&#39;s economic and national security elites.</strong> <sup>[emphasis added]</sup> Why? Because there&#39;s a core of truth there that keeps inspiring and intriguing people, more so than with Coast to Coast AM, which clearly aspires to being &quot;100% B.S.&quot; But even in case of Coast to Coast AM and even with the implementation of a North Korea-style communist dictatorship with modern NSA capabilities, I think it is inevitable that in the long run people&#39;s consciousness will grow and they will see through all the manipulation. It might take 10 years, it might take 10,000 years, but we will get there. Our consciousness will evolve along with the physical evolutionary process that has been going on for hundreds of millions of years. Jones is just another teacher along the way. </p>

<p>First, I would like to direct you to this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6shdlr/psyops_need_to_be_discussed_more_openly/dlcs2yc/">comment</a> because its highly relevant to someone like Alex jones or any media organization.</p>

<p>Alex Jones is running a complex long term operation. He starts by saying the truth and attracts an audience. He keeps building this audience and his audience starts becoming loyal to him since hes saying the truth all the time. At a critical time in history(now probably), he starts his disinfo campaign to steer his audience in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>Trump is an outsider and they are fighting him, hard.  His own party is ensuring he can&#39;t get legislation passed.  Why do you think Trump is on their side when they are so against him?</p>

<p>He&#39;s not controlled opposition. It&#39;s easily explained by him being a scam artist who managed to scam the trumpist Alt-right because they&#39;ve gotten so goddamn stupid.</p>

It&#39;s heartbreaking to watch all The Donald cultists rally around him. Imagine how many distributed Mae Brussells and Hank Albarellis we could Voltron up, if only the signal:noise ratio in here was better. The idiots turning free speech from a refined social practice into a sacred cow to love/root for shoulder a lot of the blame here, IMO. This isn&#39;t conjecture or mush, this is how the global post-WWII franchise we all know and love, whatever you want to call it, did coups in South America. And it&#39;s something which the COCOM &quot;VOICE&quot; series programs (Earnest Voice most famously, but all COCOMs have one) are only just ramping up to take advantage of. Meanwhile, let&#39;s keep waiting for the next iteration of ripe MK-fodder to bow down to the New powers of Kek once generating photorealistc human avatars and voices becomes a $1k software package and makes its way to the trackers.</p>

<p>I would expect confidence from someone who is alpha, not over the top arrogance. He&#39;s wrong about so much, misses basic details but man, does he have a mouth on him anyway. </p>

<p>He didn&#39;t run out of love for anything except for money and power. Why do you think he got to where he is? Saying the pledge of allegiance? The only thing he likes about America is the system itself that allows him such levels of lust for power and money, while even being celebrated for it. Pretty sad, in my opinion. And we wonder why we have issues in our country. They&#39;re feeding us a shit sandwich and calling it a filet mignon while they&#39;re eating filet mignon their selves. These people got to where they are on the backs of other people and he can&#39;t even muster up a tiny bit of empathy? Not a good way to do anything, especially when running a nation <em>full</em> of people. </p>
