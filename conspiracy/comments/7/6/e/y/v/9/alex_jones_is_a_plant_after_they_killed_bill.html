       I wasn't even talking about AJ. I was almost 10 when the year 2000 hit, so I remember it. all 1999 and 1998 it was all over the fucking news, they were hyping it up in the mainstream and people were buying out supermarkets and shit by the end lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       most people still believed it was crazy -- or worked with technology and had some greater degree of understanding that regular people didn't at the time. I wasn't fortunate enough to have my own computer and the internet yet...
      </p>
      <p>
       but still, it made no sense, most devices weren't interconnected yet anyways, they were all analog, and even as a 9-year old I knew every electronic device couldn't possible fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       some/most didn't even KEEP the date on the chip.
      </p>
      <p>
       it was really only an issue for companies, business and accounting, and I'm sure at that point they kept a lot more solid records.
      </p>
      <p>
       like I said some businesses in Europe couldn't afford to hire the massive programmer squads we did here to fix all the bugs in corporate and consumer software datekeeping -- really all they had to do was switch the type of integer from like, 8-bit to 16-bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       it was just a huge deal because of how much software, including OSs etc, was lazily programmed for earlier, lowerspec machines and just ported without any thought put into it.
      </p>
      <p>
       but it affected businesses in Europe -- who just kept chugging along knowing in their head that 1900 was 2000 until you know, they bought a new system lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       the question here Isnt is AJ a shill, its why everyone was shilling so damn hard for Y2K and making up what were clearly and entirely myths about the event specifically to tell the public via mass media?
      </p>
      <p>
       the frenzy was entirely manufactured... it had (literally) almost nothing to do with consumers aside from the fact the date would be wrong on the VCR or PC at worst. but since NONE OF US WERE ALIVE in 1900, there were no business records on PCs at that time anyway, so it wouldn't even overwrite shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't understand how it ever blew into such a major conspiracy theory -- bigger than that 2012 bullshit was -- when we actually had a hard definition of what the problem actually WAS in reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think y2k is a good example of the disinfo that was possible to spread before the internet became what it is...
      </p>
      <p>
       today you can just look up the basics of programming and also the y2k problem and within minutes you will see factual information based off what the problem was...
      </p>
      <p>
       back then people were idiots in the dark and just listened to what they were told unless they were computer professionals -- who I can only assume thought these claims were patently ridiculous as I did when I started learning about computers...

       Humans create corporations to make their own money and naturally fuel the economy. Trump wants the average American to be able to open their own businesses. How is that not for the common man?

       Trump is so far removed from the common man, he has no idea what it's like. He was born into money, his start in life was also just given to him. What common man do you know that had that start? Do you own a business?
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't need a useless middle man though. Humans are doing labor, they are preforming a service. Why should such a high percentage of the money made go upward? Why should a CEO make millions more than their grunts when the CEOs are just as necessary as their employees, but not. That's not the mentality. It's more like "you should be thankful you have a job." "Just work
       <em>
        really hard
       </em>
       and you can make it". You can't have a nation of CEOs. You can't have a nation of business owners. In other words, if everyone had the "American dream", who would work at the entry level? You think only teenagers are working minimum wage jobs?
      </p>
      <p>
       The system is inherently flawed. Any working within in the system is still acknowledging it as a thing, something that's "real". When we throw it aside, as one does when something no longer serves us, then we can make real progress. Corporations must be served by people, bar none. Why are they necessary? There is a demand and a need for products and services, we should allocate resources appropriately for this. Without the hindrance of a arbitrary monetary system, we can actually do some good in the world of
       <em>
        everyone
       </em>
       not just a few. That... is for the common man.

       Okay, trump and anyone who's a part of the "elite" don't have to have come from a poor background to understand what its like to be poor, just like a white person doesn't have to be black to understand how racism works. Human beings have the ability to learn from other peoples experiences. It is why we record history. Trump may not have experienced being poor but he surely has comprehension of it. Just like we can comprehend what Its like to be a billionaire.

       Also, the reason a CEO makes more then the one flipping burgers, or cashiering is because of what it took to become the CEO of a massive company. And of course there are exceptions like the Walmart kids. But generally speaking someone comes up with an idea, formulates a business plan, gets a loan, builds a business, hires people to help run the business and then they appoint other management to help run the business while they explore further opportunities for the company and network and build on their creation. The people who are working at the bottom did nothing but apply and interview and then do basic work for basic income. You make what you earn. Complaining about how much money the .1% has makes you exactly $0.00 an hour, but trying to join them will fill you with passion and dedication which are worth more then how much money you also will make.

       I mean, he hates blood, saw blood, turned away. A lot of people do that. There are not many heroes. So yes i do think that. Hes an alpha guy who knows how to make a shit ton of money, hates being told no, loves his country so deeply he ran for fucking office while living the dream. If you look at him objectively, no bias at all, im sure you will find goodness and some hint of pride in him being president. But no i don't believe he is heroic, just head strong and nationalistic in a good way.

       Not quite. There's usually a little more empathy attached, some that's required to connect with other people and care about other people.
      </p>

       I would expect confidence from someone who is alpha, not over the top arrogance. He's wrong about so much, misses basic details but man, does he have a mouth on him anyway.
      </p>

       He didn't run out of love for anything except for money and power. Why do you think he got to where he is? Saying the pledge of allegiance? The only thing he likes about America is the system itself that allows him such levels of lust for power and money, while even being celebrated for it. Pretty sad, in my opinion. And we wonder why we have issues in our country. They're feeding us a shit sandwich and calling it a filet mignon while they're eating filet mignon their selves. These people got to where they are on the backs of other people and he can't even muster up a tiny bit of empathy? Not a good way to do anything, especially when running a nation

       You're making so much of that up in your head it actually feels like you're writing fan fiction. What planet are you on man? He loves this country BECAUSE he was so successful and because of our history. And don't start going on about slavery as if that's the only piece of history we have.
Do you think he is just some evil hateful man who's pretending? You really believe that. Dont let your pride of sticking to your guns control you. Actually ask yourself if you believe that Donald trump HATES America and Americans and wants to hold all of us back so he can stay rich?????? As he gives up making hundreds of millions to do the most complex job on the planet and have him and his entire family slandered in the media? Racist sexist bigot homophobe transphobe islamophobe cis scum white piece of shit etc...?????

       But what does trump benefit with being president vs being an independant billionaire til death? History books? And if he fails???
I can see why you think that, because its easy to fall into that trap because its a simple answer as to why you're poor and don't have what they have, and how its so hard to get there. But once you start breaking down that theory to specifics, it falls apart pretty quick. You're a nihilist, and a cynic. And while you might think you're onto something or see deeper than others into the cesspool of Washington, you don't. You're just justifying your insecurity and laziness. Man up.

       Then why exactly are the globalists out to get him? The same globalists that own MSM, haven't exactly been treating him like one of their own. So far, he's actually been undoing the past 8 years by killing off thousands of regulations. Wouldn't that be counter-productive?

       I laughed at first.. but these accounts that spend at

       70%+ of their time defending Trump or those who are pro Trump are highly questionable. Say Hillary won, and these people were trashing her all over the place.. I wouldn't be going all over Reddit to defend her.

       Trump serves and protects the elite. His followers are heavily manipulated. It's sad to see, because without him I think they might actually be supporting someone like Ron Paul, or not talking about race and sjws all day but instead talking about the Fed scam, the military industrial complex, the bilderbergers. You know, things that actually matter. The 'divide and conquer' method is so visibly effective here. We argue with each other over football players kneeling while the elites continue to tighten the chains of economic slavery. Trump was meant to
       <em>
        distract
       </em>
       from issues that our survival depends on, and he's doing an amazing job.

       They tried everything in their power to do that. With the numbers Trump got, it was just impossible to get rid of him. It would've been the end of the Republican party.

       With the numbers Trump got?  He did worse than Romney in a lot of states and total vote wise they were comparable.  He got less votes than Obama in the 2 elections he won (and less than Hillary even in the election she lost).  Trump didn’t have such a giant following that he couldn’t have been pushed out if the RNC wanted him out.  Bernie had tens of thousands of people showing up for his rallies too and the DNC was able to block him.

       They are relevant if you are talking about how it would have been impossible to block Trump from getting the bomination because of his massive numbers.  His numbers were comparable to other candidates.. he wasn’t pulling in 10 million more people than previous candidates.  If they wanted to block him they could have blocked him.  He would have gotten the Ron Paul treatment instead of nonstop media coverage.

       The difference between the Dems and the Repubs is the Dems actually cheated Clinton to the win. The Repubs did every dirty trick in the book, but within the rules, to crush Trump. At the end of the day, even though they all hated him and they even continued to work against him, they listened to their voters.

       I did follow the primaries.  When did republicans attack him for the sexual assault claims against him?  Or the rape claims from his former wife?  Or attack him about Trump U being a fraud nonstop?  Or his toes to Epstein?  They didn’t do any of that.  That would have been “dirty tricks.”  Attacking him for being inexperienced or unqualified isn’t dirty.

       No they didn’t.  You are flat out lying.  The media talking about shit isn’t the same as the candidates bringing it up during interviews and debates.  Not once did a candidate mention sexual assault allegations against Trump during one of the debates.

       He had sexual assault allegations against him since the 90s.  He settled claims against him from employees decades ago.  When did a republican in the primaries talk about that?  They didn’t.  Now you’re talking about the general election.  Of course the democrats will bring that shit up.  The Republicans in the primaries didn’t though.  If they were so afraid of Trump being their nominee and were using “dirty tricks” to try and stop him why didn’t they bring that shit up even once?

       Which has nothing to do with what they were talking about when you decided to jump into the debate they were having. If you wanna prove the dude wrong, start by reading what they're talking about, and providing some sort of evidence that shows they're wrong

        about what they're actually talking about

       Define what you even think projection even

       . You must be
       <strong>

       <em>
        no one was talking about the general election

       Like i said, it's easyer when you are not part of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll try to explain what i see .I had typed something out before in a topic about the break of the climate accord, so i'll just copy paste and add some.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't know if i am right, i am Dutch and just looking from a distance at the American system and try to figure it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see Trump as a goldfisch thrown in a shark tank.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump thought he new all the rules and tricks that comes with doing buisness and he thought running the country was like playing the same game on a bigger level. But seeing he is a selfmade man he was not aware to the "evil plans" and connections of the real PTB and he was left out of a lot of information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now he is finding out that the rules and even the entire game is very different as he tought and friends are turning into enemies without him knowing why.
      </p>
      <p>
       The covernment is corrupt to the bone and is playing a whole different game with a whole new set of rules. And if you don't know the real game and the real rules you will fail in your work. This also explains why there are Builderberger people in Trumps government, i think he did know of all the conections, he just did not know the more evil parts of them. And i have a feeling that Trump, even now he is president, is not beeing told the (complete) truth and he is trusting on the wrong people or presented false information.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is Trump now, struggeling to get a grip on the situation, trying to find out who and what to trust, trying to find the truth. And now he is learning the game, the rules and how to play and he is becomming aware the consequenses of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Quitting the Paris agreement is, to me, a huge move and is pointing in the direction that Trump still is fighting for the right cause. This might seem controversial and look likes i don't give a fu.k about our world, but is see the world in a whole different way as mainstrean everything promotes. In my world free clean energy should be availeble for everybody, but if you remove the oil the whole system of TPTB falls together, so you can't promote this in the current time, especially not when you are a president.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Paris agreement cost a lot of money and, to me, it is not well spend and is keeping people from beeing independent. Trump might know the secret of free energy also, the Trump family is linked to Nicola Tesla and i would not be surprised if they got his resurch.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the president would bring out this info too soon all hell will break loose, there for it might be better to play it like he does now and save a lot of money from useless articles now and bring on the real change later on.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also can see it in all the mainstream media reporting about Trump, the blatent bias shines throug everything. The Rusland narrative has started in the end term of Obama and the media are still running with this, eventhough the whole story falls apart at the seems and is quite possibly the exact opposite as they are reporting.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are many more pointers to Trump fighting for the "good", but somehow they all are bend to the opposite or burried. This too says a lot for me and this is also why i do not believe the mainstream narrative. The same goes for the polaire media as Reddit, Twitter and Facebook, here is also a very big push back on both Trump as wel as the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ah well, i might just see it all wrong and i am also being tricked into believing in Trump, but for now i still have a little bit of hope left.

       You tried to make a binary argument that you say leaves us only two options. Unfortunately, I don't buy into any of this, including the OP.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones is not a plant. He's just who he is. There's no reason to think he's anything other than that, although I can understand people making an argument he may be part of limited hangout. If he is part of limited hangout, I'd argue he's not aware of that and thinks he's independent.

       Trump is not part of the deepstate, but he is likely getting controlled to an extent by them as he's complying with them more now. This happened likely because he was having issues with them refusing to do what he wants and he's trying to work with them to accomplish things. He should have drained the swamp instead as he said he was going to.
      </p>
      <p>
       The deep state does not control elections, but could if they decided to. The electronic voting machines are easily hacked, and this would be how they would. The 1% controls the elections quite well however with their influence from lobbyists and their wealth via donations and even sponsoring protesters.

       RINO = republican in name only, which is what you're saying trump is. in this argument RINO republicans should be trying to support everything about trump. so actual republicans would be against him, as you said in your first sentence. no?

       The vast majority of trump supporters had no other viable choice.  Robbing the GOP which is technically the DNC with another name was much wiser than running independent.  Now, the GOP can be purged of the bullshit and made great again.

       Once he took a complete 180 on pizzagate after being threatened, I was 100% sure he was a controlled opposition. He disabled comments in that specific video and in the few videos after that, people were calling him out on it in the comments.

       Yes in general lately I have gotten very unsettling vibes from AJ. Those who seek and speak the truth tend to have an air of sobriety and plainneas in the midst of chaos as their ultimate goal is to find the real truth (which requires steady skepticism) and help others understand the truth (which requires clear communication) . AJ seems less and less interested in the truth these days and more interested in sensationalism.

       It's his job at the end of the day. For us on here it's a mere hobby or something we're passionate about- not something we rely on for income. It's not surprising Alex has monetised people like us by being sensationalist. I think he's also saw the opportunity to exploit right wingers during the campaign hence his support of Trump.

       The latest one where they got high AF. If you YouTube it you'll find it. They were talking about government conspiracies and Alex went off on one about aliens and some other shit. He's pretty incoherent. I wasn't even sure what he was trying to get at. That's the kind of stuff that discredits him though.

       So he’s not even allowed to talk about aliens yet you are? Aliens are not a normal feature of his show. He almost never mentions it except when talking about how the MSM lie and says he talks about reptilians and aliens.

       I think you're missing the point. Going off about aliens gives the MSM and deep state ammunition to make him look like a loony which is the last thing free thinkers like us need. How can we encourage others to join in free thinking when they associate conspiracies with Alex Jones who then link him with crazy rants.

       omg Trump is racist! Alex jones is such a shill.  dont listen to infowars! theyve been warning aobut a one world government, but they are liars!  if you listen to infowars you are a supporting a shill.  alex jones is a zionist jew israel spy with russian connections that is totally a shill.  I mean when he exposed bohemian grove and exposed 911 attacks, and exposed eugenics and omg when he exposed flouride in the water and omg when infowars exposed vaccines and omg when infowars says things that the MSM will never even talk about, that was so shilly.  They are bad, trust me and the other threads that talk about alex jones being bad.  he is bad i said so and that is that OKAY.   AGREE WITH ME AND OBEY!

       Evidence is abundant to anyone with the internet. The deciding factor is within yourself. I can't say for sure Jones is 100% shill, he may just be genuinely successful and very nuts. The CIA may have been fucking with him for years (I think they fucked with Cooper for sure). The strongest evidence for Jones are very select clips you can find on youtube and the like. Clips where Jones carries the water for Israel, tries to say that Arabs run Hollywood, absolutely loses his mind about Hillary Clinton and says she's a goddamn demon and precedes to argue with the voices in his own head (this last one happened after I stopped watching his show on a regular basis).
      </p>

       Take it from a guy like me. From Peter Jennings and Baba Wawa, to CNN, to Glen Beck, to Orielly, to Jones, to Rense, to Icke. They've all got their own agendas. Many things can be learned from all, but don't think for a fucking second these people are here to help you.

       Alex's agenda isn't this. Maybe at one time it was quite similar, but his agenda now is survive and thrive at any cost. The truth being the sacrifice in exchange for more airtime and more revenue from his his more hardcore financially independent audience.

       The real threats are killed. Alex Jones is safe because he does more to discredit truthers than push the movement forward. The Illuminati does not give a shit if their secrets are known by some people, as long as the masses consider it 'absurd' or 'offensive'. The people who actually start to reveal the extent of the network Satanism and Pedophilia in our government are QUICKLY silenced. 
Infowars is about 20% credible truth and 80% complete fucking non-sense that can easily be proven false.

       It’s totally possible he’s a plant, although I don’t buy it. This is a guy who has consistently exposed globalism as the cancer it is. You describe him as a wacky nut job... I’m going to go ahead and assume you don’t even watch InfoWars. He’s never seemed that way to me, an avid watcher. Do you think millions of people are tuning in to a wacky nut job? “He makes theorists look bad.” You have absolutely no evidence to point to that proves this. Why does the worst theorist have all these viewers?? Make no mistake. The infowar exists, and knowing is half the battle.

       You are free to believe that. I actually loved him on Piers Morgan but not for the right reasons. Alex's abrasive style is divisive to many. Entrancing to a few. I was once entranced. After awhile though, you see that his method of action is great for amassing himself a small fortune, but not so great at actually producing change. He's not the first maverick, he won't be the last, so please let go of your cognitive dissonance. A tarnished Alex Jones doesn't negate his truths, it only makes it easier to spot his lies. Look into how often Alex Jones criticizes Israel. Look into why. There are many factions of Elite. Some are globalists, some are nationalists. Some are religious, some are secular. It's not all black and white. AJ, by choice or by gunpoint, is leaving certain things off the table and saying some extremely insane shit from time to time that is not helpful to the truth movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       His style seeks to further the divide, he cements us in with our confirmation bias but pushes those who didn't already believe further away in his madness and aggression. I find it totally plausible the intel spooks are and have been driving him crazy for awhile so it may not be all organic but it's totally there plain as day. From one seeker of truth to another if you fail to find any such clips, I will gladly fire up the search engine and gather them for you.

       Even if you had proof that Alex Jones is a nationalist elite, doesn’t change the fact that the system he is constantly pitching (free market, pro-Constitution, pro-Bill of Rights) sounds a lot more attractive to your average person than what the globalists are constantly pitching (1 World Government, and Hollywood runs the show). Look at how Hollywood is collapsing. Those “few” you say are entranced by Alex Jones style has actually risen to a hell of a lot more than a “few.” And he’s 100% a part of the truth movement exposing Hollywood for the pathetic shit show it is and always has been. Also, and no disrespect, you seem to be making some illegitimate claims here like the OP. You claim he’s “saying some extremely insane shit.” What are you referring to exactly? He says a lot of insane shit that always happens to end up being true. “His style seeks to further the divide.” I’m sorry but this is just false. If his style is seeking to do this, he’s been failing himself greatly because all he’s managed to do is create a movement and bring millions (literally) of like-minded people together in order to fight globalism with information. I understand he’s just reporting news at the end of the day, but he just so happens to be the most watched news reporter in the history of America. In fact, you can argue Alex Jones is causing a divide... a divide between the globalist elite and the rest of us, and thank God he’s doing that. Helps us identify who and what we’re up against.

       Alex Jones has always been more aligned with libertarians and constitutionalist. It just so happens, that for the first time in WHO THE FUCK KNOWS, a guy running to be president checks off a lot of those check marks (that a libertarian such as myself) said FUCK IT, and threw his support in. If the "powers that be" really wanted Trump to be the guy, you would have witnessed positive Trump propaganda by the MSM, and we all know that DID NOT happen. So, with the possibility of this being the last election to reclaim power from true authoritarianism, I completely understand AJ throwing his full support in. I truly believe he was the last hope, before that last falling domino.

       That's not how it works. Voting machines are very easily manipulated and controlled, just one of the ways that presidents are anointed, not elected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus, you're right, the exact appeal of Trump is that he appealed to the disenfranchised conservative voters. Would any of them been persuaded by the media they don't trust? Quite the opposite, it would have made them realize that he was just another slick-tongued politician being shoved down our throats by the establishment, saying the right things, while in reality selling snake oil...
      </p>
      <p>
       It's still dumbfounding to me that people think Trump cares about the common man, when every action he's ever taken has suggested the opposite. Electing Trump wasn't going against the establishment, it was just taking out the middle man.

       Thank you. We really don't need this place filled with trump supporters. That's not what this place is about. There's a divide and conquer strategy that has always been at play in America and "the Donald" plays that role like no other. He's got a cult following that swears any criticism is CTR. He can do no wrong. He's draining the swamp right? By filling his administration with billionaires and selling cabinet positions and director positions to the highest bidder. It's business as usual and the common man hasn't benefited in the slightest. Surprise surprise. He's not our lord and savior. Turns out he's an old white billionaire who has never once in his life experienced what just being a normal person is like. He's so out of touch with reality and people think he's going to save us. No one makes it to the office of president without selling out the American people. And he's just playing his role of dividing the country like no one before him could. He's as much of an enemy of the Jewish controlled media as two pro wrestlers.

He just wants to be paid attention to, and he's interested in more money, more power. He's just a fucking cunt. But a dumb, lazy cunt - he's not anything. He's just a dumb fucking cunt. Nahmean?

       Trump is not a libertarian or constitutionalist. He's been shutting on the constitution since before he won the primaries and...You know what fuck it. You're a trump-supporting Alex jones watching delusional retard. You don't live in reality. You are what's wrong with America. Fuck you, seriously.

       Trump is neither a libertarian nor a constitutionalist. Does a constitutionalist talk about revoking the license of the free press and spend most of his time bullying them? No, they don't. Go read what Cato, the libertarian think tank, thinks of Trump. They hate him. And he has no problem using big government to increase his power. What kind of libertarian milks the government by staying at his own properties and overbilling for it?

       You mean a slandering free press that has indoctrinated many impressionable minds that result in violent incidents like congressman and country music fans being shot? 95% of media coverage has been negative towards Trump, and you think he's the bully? Limiting the size and scope of government while reducing taxes are the core beliefs of libertarians, and so far he's on track to keep those promises

       I don't consider him a shill, but rather a sellout.  He'll jump to whatever 'topic du-jour' and get people riled up and laugh all the way to the bank.  He can't do that if he pisses

       Dumbest shit I've read in a while on here. You are confusing left and right with Democrat and Republican. Ron Paul, Trump, Alex Jones, they all know the Republicans are full of shit even though they run as Republicans because its a rigged two party system and you must. Very low level of thinking in the OP post. If God himself ran as a Republican, would you call anyone who supported him a plant? lol

       While I do think (to the credit of all involved) his show does do something for getting people to difficult first step, or maybe more fittingly, see the rabbit hole, that's a
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       small step looking back in perspective.  The problem is most people often don't get to have the perspective of looking relatively far back as I describe because their development of knowledge is caught up in a bunch of questionably verifiable, non-actionable, bumper sticker, cookie cutter, criminally negligent, mainstream alternative media that, more often that not, tells you what they think you want to hear  (and they're usually right.).  So I suggest to the bottom 95% of us, maybe generalize to ones that look over where they're not supposed to, try to remember, "If you're not confused, you don't know whats going on." The top 5% already tend to.
      </p>
      <p>
       Am I saying everything Alex Jones says is garbage? No, the most you'll get out of me is judging every claim piece by piece, and maybe a suggestion to avoid becoming the victim of one's call to arms one way or the other. That, and I'll drop a 83k word article on Alex Jones, his background as well as his superclass ties, as well as a few links below I've posted in comments before on the topic of past people "telling you what they they you want to hear". I feel like a broken record with these, but its a case where imo the source(s) are often required reading tier and its being slept on because these walls of text and drier, thorough video documentation are in competition with the 15 minute dopamine hit, the hot topic videos of people wildly speculating about "something strange happening".  I digress.

        As usual, the article became much longer than expected. Less usual is the considerable amount of philosophizing and theorizing in the last two segments. The fact is, despite his admission and despite everything already established in ISGP's Cult of National Security Trolls article about Jones' new age sister show Coast to Coast AM, at this point it can't be proved with absolute certainty that Jones is CIA. What has more or less been established beyond reasonable doubt though is that he clearly is an agent of influence for the conservative establishment. That alone should disqualify him from being accepted as the public face of the modern conspiracy movement, as his opinions and antics only serve to discredit it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jones' primary objective should be to reopen the NIST investigation on the World Trade Center collapses, but with Jones refusing to consistently or even occasionally address the numerous key flaws in the report, and instead to focus on disinformation, unimportant information, or making superficial and incoherent rants, this is unlikely to happen in the near future. Jones is his own worst enemy and one wonders to what extent this is by design. Already years ago, ISGP published an article entitled The Media's Psywar Manual: 54 Tactics the Mainstream and Alternative Media Use to Undermine Conspiracy Thinking. Take a look at the identified tactics for the alternative media and think about how many you recognize in Jones. Probably more than half:

        <li>
         Ignore new revelations and insights into a conspiracy as much as possible once false debates have been generated.

         Invent a conspiracy theory about every new news report.

         Limit the amount of new information made available to an absolute minimum.

         The good news is that ultimately I think having someone around like Alex Jones is great for us and detrimental to the West's economic and national security elites.
        </strong>
        <sup>
         [emphasis added]
        </sup>
        Why? Because there's a core of truth there that keeps inspiring and intriguing people, more so than with Coast to Coast AM, which clearly aspires to being "100% B.S." But even in case of Coast to Coast AM and even with the implementation of a North Korea-style communist dictatorship with modern NSA capabilities, I think it is inevitable that in the long run people's consciousness will grow and they will see through all the manipulation. It might take 10 years, it might take 10,000 years, but we will get there. Our consciousness will evolve along with the physical evolutionary process that has been going on for hundreds of millions of years. Jones is just another teacher along the way.

       Ya controlled opposition would totally nail 9/11 on the head months before it happened because everyone knows the best tactic is to have a public figure give out your plans that potentially anyone could pick up on
/s
And yeah the two party system during Bush/Clinton era was two sides of the same coin and now that Trump is throwing a wrench in BOTH parties no wonder he’s backed that side.

       Same thing happened with Glen Beck. I remember him early on and he was well reasoned with a libertarian, constitutional edge to him. Then one day I saw him on fox and it didn't even seem like the same person I remembered. Probably one of the oddest things I remember about MSM news.

       Alex Jones is the largest disinfo agent on the planet - mixing credible conspiracies with nonsense, and conflating the conspiracy movement with white supremacists and antisemitism .
      </p>
      <p>
       And Trump has filled his administration with Bilderbergs, Bohemians and Masons.

       Alex jones is playing a unique role for his audience. His area is black propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, I would like to direct you to this
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6shdlr/psyops_need_to_be_discussed_more_openly/dlcs2yc/">
        comment
       </a>
       because its highly relevant to someone like Alex jones or any media organization.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alex Jones is running a complex long term operation. He starts by saying the truth and attracts an audience. He keeps building this audience and his audience starts becoming loyal to him since hes saying the truth all the time. At a critical time in history(now probably), he starts his disinfo campaign to steer his audience in the wrong direction.

       To be realistically fair. AJ warned about what was going on in Hollywood before this subreddit. Roger Stone, Ron Paul support him so if AJ is a sell out so is everyone.

       He's not a plant.  He's just an idiot.  The more outrageous he behaves, the more money he makes.  It's pretty simple.  His audience is isolated, angry, gullible people.  The more he screams and shouts, the more stupid supplements and stuff he can sell.

       Yeah, that's what a lot of people think.  The 2 party system is a sham.  We see this now.  Republicans control everything yet they can't pass any legislation.

       Trump is an outsider and they are fighting him, hard.  His own party is ensuring he can't get legislation passed.  Why do you think Trump is on their side when they are so against him?

       It's so fucking obvious he's a grifter. He makes money selling fake vitamins and "male supplements". He never cared about politics at all, he's a scam artist.

      <p>
       His target audience used to be normal 'libertarian' conspiracy theorists. Now it's shifted to welcome alt-right conspiracy theorists as well, who are even more gullible.
      </p>
      <p>
       He's not controlled opposition. It's easily explained by him being a scam artist who managed to scam the trumpist Alt-right because they've gotten so goddamn stupid.

       . It's heartbreaking to watch all The Donald cultists rally around him. Imagine how many distributed Mae Brussells and Hank Albarellis we could Voltron up, if only the signal:noise ratio in here was better. The idiots turning free speech from a refined social practice into a sacred cow to love/root for shoulder a lot of the blame here, IMO. This isn't conjecture or mush, this is how the global post-WWII franchise we all know and love, whatever you want to call it, did coups in South America. And it's something which the COCOM "VOICE" series programs (Earnest Voice most famously, but all COCOMs have one) are only just ramping up to take advantage of. Meanwhile, let's keep waiting for the next iteration of ripe MK-fodder to bow down to the New powers of Kek once generating photorealistc human avatars and voices becomes a $1k software package and makes its way to the trackers.

       Then why exactly are the globalists out to get him? The same globalists that own MSM, haven't exactly been treating him like one of their own. So far, he's actually been undoing the past 8 years by killing off thousands of regulations. Wouldn't that be counter-productive?

       Not quite. There's usually a little more empathy attached, some that's required to connect with other people and care about other people.

       I would expect confidence from someone who is alpha, not over the top arrogance. He's wrong about so much, misses basic details but man, does he have a mouth on him anyway.

       He didn't run out of love for anything except for money and power. Why do you think he got to where he is? Saying the pledge of allegiance? The only thing he likes about America is the system itself that allows him such levels of lust for power and money, while even being celebrated for it. Pretty sad, in my opinion. And we wonder why we have issues in our country. They're feeding us a shit sandwich and calling it a filet mignon while they're eating filet mignon their selves. These people got to where they are on the backs of other people and he can't even muster up a tiny bit of empathy? Not a good way to do anything, especially when running a nation

       As someone who was a Paul supporter, he had a fraction of the votes, supporters and even less of the media savy that Trump has.
      </p>
      <p>
       The difference between the Dems and the Repubs is the Dems actually cheated Clinton to the win. The Repubs did every dirty trick in the book, but within the rules, to crush Trump. At the end of the day, even though they all hated him and they even continued to work against him, they listened to their voters.
