       They are baiting us into rebutting bullshit, which then gives them comment history that can be used as ammo when they accuse us long term users of being shills.  We have got to be more vigilant about what we allow to hit our front page. Don't upvote an exciting submission until you are satisfied it is credible!!

       I have been following signal coherence across accounts of common age, theme and time of initial participation with the sub vs Reddit at large. There is a clear trend which indicates approximately 25 days ago a 'Noise' campaign was initiated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Noise campaigns in the context of propaganda exist for the purpose of creating cognitive dissonance and distrust within peer groups that undermine centralized authority. The reasoning is that by introducing a sufficient degree of chaos into the discussions of any dissenting group its members cannot attempt to discern the meaning or reality of what is being said and thus more likely to reject any ideas in conflict with those of the central authority as unreliable.
      </p>
      <p>
       This campaign did not begin with the Las Vegas shooting. Its timeline is parallel to efforts by major social media and technology groups to terminate 'fake news'. This effort does not appear to be bot driven; its patterns suggest a number of individuals have been hired to do this as a job. Further evidence suggests that part of this operation is being leveraged through students participating in the program at the University of California, San Diego.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's actually quite interesting. Outside of more advanced schools of social manipulation the concept of applied 'Noise' to reorient engagement around a target central authority is generally poorly understood; it's execution prone to suffer from overtures of satire or simply drifting into irrelevant conceptual space which disconnects itself from the target audience. To correctly apply the strategy you must understand whom you are trying to manipulate, what paths of information you mean to discredit and the correct blend of overreach within the scope of common topics to successfully achieve cognitive dissonance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have an interest in events of structured social manipulation like this and have observed in the past when they have appeared in various subreddits. This is the first time I've ever witnessed an attempt to disengage a population from vectors of information, rather than information or interpretation.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be specific, the goal here is to create strong disassociation from with vectors of information originating in public discourse forums or media. In particular the emphasis here is placed on 4chan, Normal Youtube videos not affiliated with official channels, Vimeo, Archive websites and blog-like reporting sources. These have not been chosen arbitrarily, nor are similar mediums of communication comparable; Twitter, Facebook, Youtube channels and similarly reliably moderated platforms are specifically not included.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because it is against the rules of this subreddit, I am not going to name anyone I have identified as actively participating and will instead periodically begin reporting users and posts which meet the criteria of concern.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, if it makes you feel any better... your observation is neither inaccurate or misplaced; there is indeed something afoot. The goal is to sew distrust and disinterest within the community discussions and it is carefully interwoven to make itself appear as representative of the community. It is hard to identify a participant until you've been able to deconstruct their message strategy. It will not be useful to anyone but the people who hired them to sew distrust if you accuse individuals at random.
      </p>
      <p>
       For the record, I do not know what corporation/government/etc is actually behind this. If I had to guess, it would be a service managed by a specialist marketing firm contracted by larger corporations who may be trying to re-brand their tarnished image. If I happen to find proof of any particular thing, I'll be certain to share.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The OP is partially correct; it appears this subreddit is the victim of a targeted viral marketing initiative with an atypical goal that focuses on discouraging users from exploring information originating from certain types of sources which cannot reliably be curated. It is not related in particular to any single event or story and appears to be a brand initiative. I have been and will continue to study individuals to identify them and report them to the moderates to evaluate if their behavior warrants reprimand.

       Those links would have no effect if people didn't upvote them and post comments like, "I knew it!" or "This is more plausible than the mainstream media story!" etc. etc. So these links are achieving what they set out to do, which is see how gullible conspiracy users are, and to make them look stupid. But remember: if falling for stupid things makes you look stupid, you might just be.
