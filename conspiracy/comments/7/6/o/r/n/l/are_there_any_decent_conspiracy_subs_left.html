       I'm so fucking sick of this one and it's obsession with US Politics, the people screaming "bots!" "shills!" when their nonsensical post gets downvoted and all the other cancer that has developed since Trump started running for president.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just want the fun stuff back. Aliens, Mythology, Black Projects like Area 51, Project Bluebeam, Tesla's work that was taken and has not since been released, the illuminati, suppression of world changing information and the rest of the fucking myriad of interesting conspiracy topics out there that we could be discussing rather than the politics of a country that is on the brink of collapse...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure I speak for a lot of redditors that are not based in the US when I say: I do not give the slightest fuck about Trump, Clinton, Hollywood sex scandles that is being covered by every MSM branch in existance, your guns, or anything else that is specific to the US only. I want the real shit back and this was the best place to come in the past. Now it has turned to absolute shit and I don't see it returning to the way it was.

       It's too late, we got several brigades of new fake accounts using Amazon API to fake their traffic. The accounts all came right when the shooting happened, and the subs hiked up around 40k. I'm not sure what it would take to get all of them out for good and get back to what you're talking about.

       I also think it's too late for this sub, I'm trying to find alternatives that are in the same vein that this sub used to be. Something similar happened with AboveTopSecret a while ago, haven't been there since and I was a frequent visitor.

       ATS supplied people with an environment to supplement their neurosis leading to actual killers being connected to it on multiple occasions.

       I don't touch ATS anymore and haven't since around 2010 but from memory someone called Jared was a mass shooter, some other person who was an ex-marine got shot in a cabin after taking out people and that Norwegian killer Anders Breivik have all been shown to be killers who have posted there (To date).

      <p>
       Obviously Springer and the beardy poof with the pugs don't want people talking about
       <strong>
        genuine
       </strong>
       issues which they profit from but there are lots of mentally unstable people who use ATS to back up their deranged opinions and then go out and actualize them on people who are unaware of the context.
      </p>
      <p>
       I spoke to a guy there once who thought that being a rape councilor/pastor was a great way to pick up chicks and didn't see anything wrong with it in the least. Lots of other people supported him on his assertion and he wasn't trolling or being 'edgy'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lots of bad people go to ATS and lots of deranged people get manipulated by them.

       2010 is around when I left too, but do you have a source to back this up with? Not trying to give you shit, just can't believe anything without a credible source. Thats the kind of thing that I'd suspect gets quite talked about quite heavily, though I couldn't find anything through Google searches.

       Best I could get using Bing was
       <a href="https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Jared_Loughner">
        this link to Jared Loughner
       </a>
       which shows he went by the username erad3 and
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jared_Lee_Loughner">
        the official wiki page for him
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The rest is from memory but search ATS using my username here and you'll see that the admins there were happy to cover up their part in fueling killers with their shenanigans and silencing anyone who dare cause their purses to get lighter.

       Yes, Amazon hosts like half of all sites with any volume of traffic. The vague allegation you're making is like accusing your wife of sleeping with Carlos Slim only because she visited Mexico, a country he happens to live in.

       I'm calling what I'm seeing. I'm seeing an influx of people who intentionally are anti-conspiracy and continuously strawmanning the entirety of what we do here. Reddit has been under NSA watch since the 2009 switch over to Amazon, and I wouldn't be surprised if they're behind it. Then again it could just be
       <a href="/r/t_d">
        /r/t_d
       </a>
       or some other community that hates us. But it really seems like "anti-conspiracy" is a real popular thing in politics today. Not trying to make allegations, but who do you think is behind these troll accounts?

       This place can and is a battle ground. There are legit things that get posted here, that should be investigated, but much is drowned out by bickering and stupid shit (a few mods here don't seem to give a shit, imo). Supplement this sub with
       <a href="/r/AlternativeHistory">
        /r/AlternativeHistory
       </a>
       (and others). We are like a nice warm pub on a winter's night. You can say: "fuck off", just don't get too rowdy. Cheers!

       I agree completely. There are still legitimate discussions being had here, the interesting stuff that I'm talking about, but it's so overrun lately by all of the US Politics that it makes it hard to sift through all of the crap to find something good.

       If you want to see those topics discussed, why not make a post about them?

       Everyone is tired of the nonsense that gets posted here, I know do. Just sort by “new” and ignore the obvious disinformation.

       So go create your own conspiracy sub. Unfortunately, there are a ton of bots/shills and has increased right with the LV shooting (whether you fucking care or not).
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, unfortunately, the things you mention end up in conspiracy since MSM doesn't cover them. Conspiracy covers all, including US politics. Fuck, it is a US site. What the hell do you expect?
      </p>
      <p>
       While I do sub to other spots to get non-political conspiracy type posts, I view this one as a catch-all for all conspiracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sort posts in a different way, create your own posts, create your own sub or search on the topics you mentioned and you should be able to find another sub to check.

       I also think it's too late for this sub, I'm trying to find alternatives that are in the same vein that this sub used to be. Something similar happened with AboveTopSecret a while ago, haven't been there since and I was a frequent visitor.
