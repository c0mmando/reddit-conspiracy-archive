       You're always going to have political dynasties in a republic. Same thing happened all the way back in Ancient Rome. The capital required to run for a House or Senate seat is enormous.

       He's taking one of the senate seats in 2020. Either liz or markey are going to be out of there in 2020. Maybe both of them, but I[ll bet it's liz's as that was teddy's seat.

       That's significant for someone's first time on a national show. He was natural/comfortable, very likable, and is obviously smart growing up with that Kennedy political education. He wasn't egotistical either. That's all really impressive given everything else he has.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he jumps in, he's going to glide like a Canadian on a frozen lake. He has so many similarities to Junior, I actually think he'll have even more opportunities.

       Caroline Kennedy is a borderline moron and was sent to Japan to be away from the public eye because she's embarrassing. her son is a hybrid orthodox Jew and catholic. Not very electable for the population imho unless nepotism gets you all the way to the finish line. Massachusetts has politics stuck in the late 1800's so I'm sure a Kennedy will have a senate seat in varying degrees for next couple hundred years here.

       Any Washingtons who might come up wouldn't be George's descendents, since he never had kids, only step-kids. In fact, his lack of children was part of his appeal as the first President, since he wouldn't be able to establish a new monarchy. Instead of being a dad, he was the "father of our country."

       I hope he doesn't.  I won't vote for a dynasty, no matter the party affiliation.  No Bushes, Clintons, Kennedys, Reagans, etc. need apply to the Whitehouse.  We should ban any direct descendants or close relatives of sitting presidents unto the 7th generation, or something like that.

        Not even if that pedigree is built on fighting power and the establishment? To the point that your family has a history of getting assassinated by the establishment? To the point that the very family hides their kids from celebrity and establishment influence and educates them on on civil and political service outside of conventional thinking?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This sounds very much like a family that thinks itself privileged and stationed above the riff-raff it aims to govern.  "Take up the white man's burden", as it were.  And really, what American political dynastic family is built on fighting power and the establishment?  I don't see that in any of them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want dynastic leadership, elect a king (or queen).  At least be up front about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will note that there is something to be said for a constitutional monarch with little real political power, as they have in the UK.  It provides a nationalist/patriotic figurehead largely divorced from politics, as well as the fairy tale media pageantry that many Americans do indeed desire.

       Well now, if you are talking about the premise of the thread, ie that Clinton somehow arranged that fatal plane crash - I agree with you.  I think that is waaaaay out there.  I was simply complaining about another Kennedy (or any other dynasty) running for office.

       Pretty close - one step away from grandchild.  The point is, just like Hillary and Jeb, the biggest reason he is getting serious consideration is because of his family name.  And, for the record, although I voted for Obama twice, I would not vote for his wife nor his daughters for high office, for the same reasons.  I don't want "royalty" to have a place in our political system.

       The mainstream media would drum home the point that Kennedy should never have flown because of bad weather. The evidence, however, shows otherwise. FAA Flight Specialist Edward Meyer took the unusual step of releasing a public statement. Meyer stated, "Nothing of what I have heard on mainstream media makes any sense to me...The weather along his flight was just fine."

       And as people were pointing out the day after this guy made his statement, it is completely based off of assumptions of his piloting skill and almost nothing concrete.  There were literally pilots and airports in the area who had said that visibility was terrible and this guy was if that the weather was "just fine" and "a little hazy".

       I'm a Pilot IRL. There is nothing suspicious about that crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       He put himself in a bad training environment, he was poorly trained and woefully unprepared for night flying across water, let alone in an aircraft that wasn't  equipped to do such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       He crashed due to being lost and totally unprepared for the flight itself and to handle spatial disorientation. (Where in cases of just suddenly moving your head at night flying makes you think the plane has rolled violently) That's how we died,
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is something fishy going on the military would of taken care of the investigation, this time there were multiple radar sources confirming his location, height and speed showed he was totally lost out there and was flying erratically before his demise.

       More likely it's because you said you're a pilot without proving it. It's extremely common to lie about things like that on the internet to strengthen your argument, so it's rather silly to expect people to blindly trust you.

       Is there any group out there that gets as much flak as the donald. Do you not have anything to contribute other than singling out a group of people for their beliefs and belittle them every time you open your mouth. Are you a bigot or just a racist posing as a bigot. You all sound like little hitlers saying how the jews are bad and destroying our society. Put the donald into concentration camps where they won't affect society.

       Another armchair expert I see.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me tell you this. If you're flying an aircraft, pitch black at night, where you have no reference of your position at all. And then you suddenly FEEL your aircraft is pushed upsidedown?
      </p>
      <p>
       What are you going to do? at that exact moment? Instantly react to your survival instincts and correct the orientation of the aircraft, wait till you've figured your bearings and check what something on a instrument panel is saying? All while you feel you've been pushed upside down.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you were even unaware of this phenomenon like you were 5 minutes ago. I'm sure you would of picked the first option.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you've gone as far as looking up pictures of a artificial horizon indicator, you could go further and look up Egypt Air Flight 604 and find what I said is exactly how a commercial pilot made the same mistake... Despite rigorous training to ignore such feelings otherwise.

       But to answer your question. In this situation, absolutely. But generally, no. Pilots deal with instrument failures more than you think, so we're trained to critically evaluate our readings when something doesn't feel quite right about it. And try to figure out what is wrong and maybe other alternatives to get that needed info, or to double check it.
      </p>
      <p>
       As pilots that blindly trust their faulty instruments are the ones that get killed.

       Nah, not true. Pilots are taught to fly visually (at the level he was at). You spend a little bit of time "under the hood" (this is where you wear blinders, kinda like a horse, so you can't see out the window and can only see your instruments), but it's not emphasized. He wasn't undertrained. He wasn't supposed to be flying in that situation and it cost them their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not until you go for your instrument rating, which allows you to fly in inclement weather, that you really focus on instruments intensely. Also, as the other guy states, there's commercial pilots that are highly trained that still sometimes revert back to instinct. Human instinct is strong as fuck. It's not surprising that someone without this training at all would have problems with disorientation.

       He wasn't an instrument rated pilot. While it's taught at the PPL level, it's not emphasized as much because you should only be flying in high visibility with a PPL. You don't go into intense detail with instruments until you go to school for your instrument rating. Shit, trained commercial pilots have problems with spacial disorientation and they've spent countless hours training to trust their instruments. It's not a surprise that someone trained to fly primarily from visual cues would fall back to instinct over instruments. In fact, it's more likely.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he was flying a plane solo he wasn't familiar with...huge fucking mistake that you're taught to NEVER do. In fact, an instructor told him NOT to do it before the flight!
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, he was flying with a broken leg. He literally walked to the plane on crutches! Kinda hard to push that flight critical rudder with a broken leg.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, while not illegal depending where you are, he made no contact with ATC. This is really stupid if you're a new pilot...which he was. Hell, it's stupid if you're seasoned, but especially so if you're new.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's no conspiracy here. Just a cocky pilot that got way in over his head.

       i mean...not a pilot. but why was the fuel relay switch cut off? not something that would happen accidentally or during the crash. Why did they recover everything but the passenger seat? Why did his plane suddenly nose dive? if they knew where his plane was, why did they spend the crucial hours searchning 90 miles away from where the wreck actually was? why the huge discrepancies between the FAA and the coast gaurd/navy reports ?

       Yeah, if you read up on the aftermath, this is not very subtle. It's a little disingenuous to even say it was a "crash" without suspicious quotations around it. Regardless of whether that video of gunshots is real, and if the guy who took it was actually shot, then hospitalized, then his machines unplugged and stabbed to death in that hospital, regardless the Russian response to the crash is very very revealing.

       It actually gets a lot weirder. For example her husband was presidentt when he crashed and the search and rescue was taken oveer by
       <em>
        the militarry
       </em>
       . On top of that, they couldnt find him, even though local news stations werre mapping on their shows where the plane would be (and was). The navy and airforce were going in literal circles for days I believe. Then there was funny business with a backpack and flightt logs.

       What is the Clinton death toll up to these days? I find it ironic that San Juan's mayor can falsely proclaim, "Trump is killing us" and it is the lead story on the teevee's national news, but never a mention of the long list of suspicious deaths associated with the Clintons.

       If that's your honest analysis of this post you need to work on critical thinking. This posts goal is 100% to further the narrative that Clinton is a boogeyman who can simultaneously kill anyone and do anything but also couldn't win an election that would have been stupidly easy to rig.

       How many people do you personally know that have died in plane crashes?

       Now go through one of those ridiculous 'Clinton bodycount' lists and tally how many plane crashes they have lost friends, enemies, and coworkers to.  Then convince yourself it is all a statistical fluke.

       You don't think our federal government influences the weather patterns?
      </p>
      <p>
       The US has done it since vietnam and only since the Geneva convention was it "illegal" to manipulate the weather, but even in that clause does it only state that " "widespread, long-lasting or severe effects as the means of destruction, damage or injury" is disallowed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those in power argue that manipulation of the weather is therefore allowed as long as it has no long-term impact on the zone.

       Its not worth the back and forth. Look at the downvotes throughout the thread. Objective comments are getting huge downvotes. It not shills anymore, its become too partisan. I agreed with you in you saying this place has always been non partisan. Its the opposite now. Which is pretty fucking ironic since most of the people gravitating here are so inclined to bash this sub in the first place but wont hesitate to post/comment when it fits their narrative. Their easy to spot when they say shit like “you guys,” excluding themselves from the community. Fuck em.

       Then why is does the sub seem to lean rather pro-Trump when he is basically the stereotype of a corrupt CEO? Dirty deals, refusing to pay his contractors because he can get away with it, lives is a penthouse suite decked out in a tacky amount of gold, etc.. You'd be hard pressed to find someone as blatantly a member of the elite than Trump.

       Literally every time a new scandal breaks, people are claiming that the deep state is trying to discredit Trump (Despite the fact that he would be, at best, part of a splinter faction if not part of the main group). I'm constantly seeing posts in the sub about Trump making decisions which for most, are obviously stupid, but people are claiming it's the lead in to something big (see Trump's 'coming storm' comment). Plus, there's the fact that people seem to be paradoxically think that the Vegas shooting was a government conspiracy, but for some reason Trump wouldn't be involved.

       One of my good friends around this time was a cargo plane pilot rated in single and double engine passenger planes (Beechcraft 200's, Piper Navajos), as well as the larger cargo jet planes he flew (Dassault Falcon 20s).  He was also a pilot instructor, and taught at a local university's aviation school before it closed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We went up a few times, and recreated some of these situations in the single engine planes he had access to at the university, and understanding what went wrong so that if it happened to him, he'd know what to do.  Stalling, finding the correct glide speed, training oneself  to look only at instruments, etc.  testing out how to explain and demonstrate these things to his students.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were four of us who watched MNF together every week, and those other 2 guys were so sick and tired of us dicussing aviation, they finally told us to STFU and go get a room.

       Yes. Very good.  He was recreating SPECIFIC scenarios from the news to pass on lessons to his students.  And took me up to go through them with me to make sure he was explaining it to a student level person, not another aviation expert/pilot.

       I suspect you're probably playing "devils' advocate" with this post due to the tone of it, but it does bear analysis from a parsimony perspective because it's helpful to justify why a "conspiracy theory" can legitimately be a rational argument despite parsimony:
      </p>
      <p>
       The concept of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc">
        post hoc
       </a>
       fallacy is a part of the toolkit of parsimony (colloquially Occam's Razor) which is meant to exclude options that are based on correlations that are not necessarily causal.  Logically, an event following another isn't necessary causality.  But, this doesn't mean it
       <em>
        couldn't
       </em>
       be causally related, either.  At best, parsimony is a "rule of thumb" which is used to limit the number of tenuous associations made in logical arguments.  That rubric is very efficient at cleaning up a logical argument because it excludes these kind of contingent claims which depend on an implicit assumption.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, the limitation of parsimony is that it, itself, becomes fallacious when it is used to oversimplify the facts to a point they become inconsistent with reality.  The final check of parsimony is the consistency with the data from the environment.  A
       <em>
        post hoc
       </em>
       fallacy operates by the assumption that the more tenuous connection is the one that is perceived as more "complicated," or... more accurately... a remote possibility of the connection being valid.  If that possibility is not remote, this assumption is wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, we need to account for the facts.  There's actually a lot of evidence that's relevant.  To name a few examples, some planned others enacted,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mockingbird">

       ,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareblue">

       .  There's all these times the CIA has manipulated governments around the world and covered it up for decades.  There's the fact Obama has
       <a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/07/14/u-s-repeals-propaganda-ban-spreads-government-made-news-to-americans/">
        repealed a ban on domestic propaganda
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       It is important to realize that, at this point, the public is so far "in the weeds" that nobody can claim to be certain of anything being causally related merely from the selective disclosures we are given.  But we do have proof that there's a web of lies, deceit and concealment of information.  Therefore, the "mainstream narrative" itself must be treated as suspect because it can be easily manipulated by the government and businesses to present a narrative that promotes disinformation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parsimony works well when there's a high degree of consistency.  But we do not have "knights that always tell the truth" so this isn't highly consistent.  And the inconsistency isn't a trivial case of "bad faith" such as where the "knights always lie" either.  Instead, we have an
       <em>
        intelligent
       </em>
       deceiver that acts as "knights that sometimes tell the truth and sometimes lie."  The story is altered strategically to manipulate the course of the reasoning that people relying on parsimony will perceive.  The scope of historical investigation is limited by convincing the public "history is boring" and distracting them with games..  The goal of this Orwellian manipulation is evidently creating a delusional sense of normalcy, covering up crimes and causing the public to ignorantly contribute to the cause by mistakenly identifying the culprit as an innocent party.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must formally reject the idea that parsimony is the universal panacea to irrational claims.  It may be useful, but it's a rule of thumb that fails when "plausible deniability" is the environment.  What we may be reasonably sure of is that powerful people really can be
       <em>
        evil
       </em>
       enough to do things like this.  Ruling that possibility out is simply willful ignorance or willful complicity in the deceit game.

       Wow, so we were on vacation when when this all went down. Every TV station was talking about it. I dont remember much but there was something centered around the planes black box and how retrieving it would be hard or impossible. I also remember my dad stating that he must have been close to figuring out what happened with his dad. They (my parents) also mentioned the curse of the Kennedy's. This all led to my interest and curiosity of this subject

       If you want an eye-opener, read up on the subject because the crash was, in reality,
       <em>
        very strange
       </em>
       . Far too many oddities to simply dismiss it as an inexperienced pilot screwing up. Just one example...the FAA is mandated to begin a search for a missing aircraft within minutes of it disappearing. But...they waited 15
       <em>
        hours
       </em>
       before launching a search and even then they sent search aircraft 100s of miles away from where John's aircraft was known to have been when it disappeared off radar.

       They're not mandated to do shit. In fact, since he was flying VFR, he wasn't even required to tell anyone where he was going and where he was.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the US, under VFR rules, it's perfectly legal to hop in your plane and fly to another airport without talking to anyone (granted you're departing and arriving at uncontrolled airports).  No air traffic control. No radar. No transponder. Hell, your plane isn't even required to have a working electrical system if it's daylight.

       . This person has no idea what they're talking about. Nobody was required to search for him because he didn't file a search and rescue plan. In fact, he wasn't talking to ATC at all, nor was he required to. He made a series of stupid mistakes that hot him and his family killed.

       He literally walked up to the plane on crutches. You absolutely need both feet to fly. He flew a plane he wasn't familiar with. Dumb!

       He trained in a 182, if I'm not mistaken, but purchased a complex aircraft he had little-to-no training in. Dumb!

       He flew into inclement weather that he wasn't rated to be in. Dumb!

       He didn't speak with ATC. Dumb! (Given weather conditions and time of night with low visibility)

       Imagine hoping in your car with a broken foot, on a rainy day with no windshield wipers. Then you don't tell anyone where you're going. Then NASCAR driver Dale Earnhart Jr stops you right before you drive off and says 'Hey, not even I would drive under these conditions'. But you're like screw it, I have a date to keep! It would be no conspiracy that they'd find your car overturned in some ditch the next day. This is the flight equivalent of that.

       Fascinating read. Couple things about your comment jump out as a bit incorrect from my understanding anyways.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <ol>
        <li>
         He trained in a 182, if I'm not mistaken, but purchased a complex aircraft he had little-to-no training in. Dumb!
        </li>
       </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       According to report he DID receive a sign-off to fly the accident plane:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The pilot obtained his private pilot certificate for "airplane single-engine land" in April 1998. He did not possess an instrument rating. He received a "high performance airplane" sign-off in his Cessna 182 in June 1998 and a "complex airplane" sign-off in the accident airplane in May 1999.
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         He ignored an instructors advice to not do the flight without an instructor, since he was unfamiliar with the plane. Dumb!
        </li>
       </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I don't think I found this on the report, in fact, the CFI (Certified Flight Instructor) that signed off on his "Complex Aircraft" rating with the accident plane had this to say about Jr.'s experience flying accident plane to the same location Jr. was flying that night:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The CFI had made six or seven flights to MVY with the pilot in the accident airplane. The CFI stated that most of the flights were conducted at night and that, during the flights, the pilot did not have any trouble flying the airplane. The instructor stated that the pilot was methodical about his flight planning and that he was very cautious about his aviation decision-making. The CFI stated that the pilot had the capability to conduct a night flight to MVY as long as a visible horizon existed.
       </p>
       <ol>
        <li>
         He literally walked up to the plane on crutches. You absolutely need both feet to fly.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Mixed information on the report but his orthopedic had the below to say, and from my own flying experience (not much) if you can apply brake in a car during an emergency situation, you can fly a plane.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The pilot's orthopedic surgeon stated that he felt that, at the time of the accident, the pilot would have been able to apply the type of pressure with the left foot that would normally be required by emergency brake application with the right foot in an automobile.

         It doesn't take many hours to get a sign-off. It took him over 10 years to get his PPL. 10+ YEARS! This will send off alarms in any instructor that worth a shit. For comparison, it took me 8 months to get to the same point he was at in his flight abilities, while working full time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The instructor says he had the capability to fly the route. That doesn't mean that he would react properly to unforeseen circumstances. He had so little hours of actual solo time that it's highly unlikely that he ever faced a confusing situation previously. Therefore, it's extremely likely that he wouldn't have reacted properly to an emergency situation.
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         It depends on the plane. Much like cars, all planes have different pedals that require different pressure. In an emergency, say a rudder control issue, you may need a good deal of pressure on a pedal. I've never been in any plane that was a soft as a car brake though. If you need assistance walking with crutches you damn sure shouldn't be the sole pilot of a plane.

       1) No, no one was required to search for them but considering that family was waiting for them at them at the Martha vineyard airport they were to set to arrive at and when they didn't arrive on time they immediately notified the FAA one would think a search would be started asap instead of the 15 hours it took to start...Also what happened to Petty Officer Ted Burgen? The first responder so to speak who claimed he spoke with John on his flight meaning there was prior contact with the air traffic controller...He was immediately silenced. Wanna know what happened next the Pentagon took over.

      <p>
       2) John as you state wasn't rated yet every instructor he ever had would beg to differ..
John started training in 1982 and was rated for and did not stop training until April 1999.
His instructors thought he was "very good".
At the link you will also find he was certified for a " complex plane" and that 6 of his evaluations were done at night and there were no problems with his abilities.

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       On that alone you can see where you are mistaken in your evaluation of his abilities and performance. Since you are a pilot I'm going to post a video for you to watch which I'm pretty sure won't make your head hurt as much as it did mine. I can't even tell you how many times I had to pause it to research what he was saying so that I could better understand avionics. Let me know what you take of the technical portions of the video rather than the conspiracy portions..Remember that at the time of the accident John was a 20 year flight veteran...This wasn't some guy saying "fuck it, I do what I want.".

       1) This link is nonsense. The investigator believes fuel selectors are made in a way to prevent accidental switching to the off position. ALL instructors will tell you that it's extremely easy to accidentally flip to the off position. Turning to off won't make the plane just dive into the ground. that's utterly ridiculous.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) From the report, it's obvious he was not even close to being a veteran pilot. Years don't matter in aviation. Flight hours is what matters. He had VERY little. To make matters worse, he started his lessons in the 80's and finished in the late 90's. JUST TO GET HIS PPL. Most people do this in 3-6 months. Why? Because any instructor will tell you that gaps in training is very bad. It makes it harder to retain the information. This means you'll have to constantly go back over information that should have already been assimilated. I would never get in a plane with someone with a record like his. It's far too dangerous. He was not a veteran. Shit, he was barely a pilot. He had only 72 solo hours. He had only 36 hours in the plane he died in. These are novice hours. He had no IFR rating at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       As far as that video, it's more complete nonsense. I skipped ahead to where he talks about the flight, but tapped out quick. His knowledge of how fuel selectors work is all wrong. It's incredibly easy to accidentally flip to the off position. So much so that instructors hammer it into your head during training. Also, if why all the stupid voices to make his points? It's because he can't use technical knowledge to make them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would suggest you go to
       <a href="/r/aviation">
        /r/aviation
       </a>
       and ask some pilots and instructors about his points he made. You'll find that they'll all think the video is laughable. If there is a specific segment of the video you want me to comment on just tell me the timestamp, because i'm not wasting 2 hours watching this dumb shit.

       As to you pointing me to the aviation reddit....you haven't participated in a aviation conversation in 6 months (I scanned all your posts wish I could have gone further back) so forgive me if I don't take your opinion for much.

       I don't get your logic. You believe that since I don't post in a specific subreddit I don't know what i'm talking about? That really makes sense to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I made another account that I specifically use for aviation on Reddit. Hence the reason you stopped seeing posts there from this account. That's really irrelevant though because, again, I told you to ask other pilots/instructors in that sub so that you don't have to just take my word for it. If I wasn't confident enough to say it I wouldn't point you to a group of people that could easily prove me wrong.

       I'm not trying to change your mind. I don't know you. I'm just contributing knowledgeable information based on the NTSB report and my own knowledge in aviation as a pilot. If someone posts something that doesn't add up then I'd take it into consideration. Nobody has done that though. You don't have to take my word for anything. Not at least trying to talk to other pilots/instructors before believing random articles from non-pilots and youtube vids by non-pilots won't help though.

       Sorry broseph but you're not this planets lone pilot.
Like I said other pilots don't agree with the official story.
If your stance is that your opinion is valued over theirs than that's all you.
You feel no one else is capable of research than again that's all you.
YOU have one opinion...OTHER PILOTS have others.

       Let's take 911 some people believe some guys in a cave did it.
Others like architects and engineers for 911 truth don't.

      <p>
       See what I'm getting at?
We're We're at a cross roads and we're not heading the same way.
Just try to not silence others just because you disagree. 
You're not the authority and beyond that no one can verify your credentials.
You're some guy on the net just like me with opinions.

       where pilots and instructors are. I only stated facts. Fact - He was not a proficient pilot, which his logbook clearly shows. Fact - He was flying as the sole pilot while using crutches. Fact - He had almost no experience in the plane he was in (less than 10 solo hours).

       Yes, obviously take the majority of the video with a huge grain of salt, but since it's one of the few pieces that really dove into the details there are many things worthwhile contained in the video.. most notably all of the press conferences, and the fact that all of the reporters knew the location of the crash because they got the information about the beacon location, yet the government saying that location wasn't important, refused to acknowledge the crash beacon, and refused to search the crash site for almost 24 hours, despite the becaons location being exactly where the plane went down.

       So why was the fuel selector valve switched to off? Identical to the Egypt Air crash when a terrorist stormed the cockpit. He was by all accounts a meticulous and well rounded pilot.

       I wasn't in the plane. I don't know why any switches were in the position they were found in. I stated what I do know as 100% fact. He was not a well rounded pilot and his logbook reflects that. Fuel selectors can very easily be accidentally switched to the off position. That's why checklists tell you to check it so many times during a flight.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you comparing a large commuter plane to a small craft is like comparing the handling characteristics of a Honda Civic to a Formula 1 car. Just because you're proficient in one doesn't mean your proficient in the other.  He had less than 10 solo hours in the complex aircraft. That's what we call in the military a shower shoe.

       Okay, now you're being ridulous. He was nowhere close to having the hours needed to be an instructor. The fact that you said that means you don't know the requirements. He had 72 hours of flight time TOTAL.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like my NASCAR anologies, so here's another one. If his trek from non-pilot to instructor was compared to this past Sundays race, he flew the equivalent of about 5 laps in his entire lifetime. Yet, you're talking like he's Dale Sr.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Features he wouldn't have even used on a flight he had completed hundreds times before."
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides the fact that he hasn't logged enough hours to fly anywhere 100 times. That's not how planes work at all. You can't hop in a complex plane and say I just won't use things things I'm unfamiliar with. You'll die! 100% guaranteed.

       I should have been clearer. The 72 hours is solo time that I was referring to. That's very low time, and less than 10 hours in the complex aircraft he was in. He wasn't even remotely close to being an expert aviator. He was also several stages from an instructor. Again, it took over 10+ years for him to completed the lowest and easiest stage - PPL. He had huge gaps in training. There's so many red flags for this flight, which is why so many schools use his flight to teach safety. He made so many of the mistakes you need a student to be aware of. They don't have to jump from case-to-case to show a bunch of different safety issues. They can get many of them covered in this single case.
      </p>
      <p>
       Guess he's famous now for making thousands of pilots safer.

       It's ironic that people will trash the Clintons on this board for being a powerful political family with deep ties in government, but the Kennedy's are being paraded as some noble house that serves the people, even though there is just as much shady shit in their past.

       Trump is definitely not anti-government. He certainly has had no problem using eminent domain laws to his own benefit historically, he's increased the size of our military budget substantially, and he's made his contempt for the first amendment pretty clear.

       This Again? Oh well, I guess somebody has to do it again. Kennedy died in July 1999. That’s a year before the NY primary. Kennedy hadn’t even announced 
 and the whole conspiracy is based on a 1997 poll. That’s like claiming that if Mark Zuckerberg or The Rock die tomorrow Trump killed them cause they figured on Presidential polls.

       He went "missing" for several days when JFK Jr. died...even his own staff had no clue where he went.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen it speculated that he was forced to be a part of the assassination so they would have "dirt" on him if he didn't stay in line...also these sick fucks do everything ritualistically...since poppy Bush was clearly involved in the original JFK assassination, it fits their MO to have his son be involved in the death of Jr.

       Uhhhh, no. I'm a pilot and I can tell you for a fact that there was nothing at all suspicious about that crash. I'm guessing you don't know what a rudder is and why it's critical in flight.

       He was the favorite to enter the race and win and it appeared that JFK Jr. was going to flex his Kennedy political muscles... And then he died.
What could have been?  Well he probably would have won the seat and if so, there would have never been a Senator Clinton or probably a President Obama and Secretary of State Clinton.  I think JFK Jr. was a big threat to the Middle Road/Corporate Democrats that took over the party in the 70s/80s/90s.

       I personally subscribe to the theory that W was involved in this.  There are good videos that explain it.  Most notably, JFKjr was planning to do a final expose on who killed his father in his new shiny magazine, which he named
       <em>
        George
       </em>
       .  The thepry goes that W killed Kennedy as his final initiation into the Enterprise, the worldwide criminal-nazi syndicate which has been run by the Bush family since WWII.

       Her announcement to run was done at "Pindars Corners". That has major importance and energetic meaning. The leader of the Earths Illuminati is called the “Pindar“. The Pindar is a member of one of the 13 ruling Illuminati families, and is always male. The title, Pindar, is an abbreviated term for “Pinnacle of the Draco”, also known as the “Penis of the Dragon”. Symbolically, this represents the top of power, control, creation, penetration, expansion, invasion, and fear. The holder of this rank reports to the purebred Reptilian leader in the Inner Earth.

       You could argue that this explains why Ted Kennedy wouldn't endorse Hillary in 2008.  The Clintons tried very hard to get his endorsement with both Bill and Hillary reaching out to him several times.  Instead he backed a young Obama who had little experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the explanation of his endorsement could have less conspiratorial reasons:  health care.  He wanted it in the 90s and the Clintons, with Hillary spearheading it, couldn't deliver.  He knew he didn't have much time left and wanted it done before he died.  Instead of the wonky Clinton he believed the inspirational Obama stood a better chance of getting it passed.

       Hillary Clinton is the most corrupt politician in the history of the United States. There is a long list of "suicides" and "accidents" that seem to follow people who were investigating her or people around her.

       I agree.  He was so into himself he thought he could pilot a plane through a bad storm, but he was an inexperience pilot.  So, he was a dipshit and overconfident.  I doubt there's a conspiracy here.  At the same time, I don't want a dipshit, overconfident senator.  Humm?

       I think she (and more importantly Bill, at that time) thought he was a nobody.  Who cares, only one dead body.  Bill and Hillary are snakes.  Even now they are trying to shift blame from Whinno-stain to Trumpo by equating the two as both being sexual freaks, while ignoring Bill's proven cigar incident.  Yup, American politics.

       And maybe people are starting to react negatively to yet another Hillary conspiracy theory on this sub because it's becoming tiring hearing about how an irrelevant loser who holds no elected office is somehow the ominous mastermind lurking behind the curtain of all the world's problems.  Trump already beat her, but his cultists still can't move on from her for some reason.

       And as people were pointing out the day after this guy made his statement, it is completely based off of assumptions of his piloting skill and almost nothing concrete.  There were literally pilots and airports in the area who had said that visibility was terrible and this guy was if that the weather was "just fine" and "a little hazy".

       I'm a Pilot IRL. There is nothing suspicious about that crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       He put himself in a bad training environment, he was poorly trained and woefully unprepared for night flying across water, let alone in an aircraft that wasn't  equipped to do such a thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       He crashed due to being lost and totally unprepared for the flight itself and to handle spatial disorientation. (Where in cases of just suddenly moving your head at night flying makes you think the plane has rolled violently) That's how we died,
      </p>
      <p>
       If there is something fishy going on the military would of taken care of the investigation, this time there were multiple radar sources confirming his location, height and speed showed he was totally lost out there and was flying erratically before his demise.

       Pilot here. There was far more to it than weather. In flight school we spent a good bit of time on this case study. He basically did everything he could to ensure that flight would be a disaster.

       Trump is definitely not anti-government. He certainly has had no problem using eminent domain laws to his own benefit historically, he's increased the size of our military budget substantially, and he's made his contempt for the first amendment pretty clear.
