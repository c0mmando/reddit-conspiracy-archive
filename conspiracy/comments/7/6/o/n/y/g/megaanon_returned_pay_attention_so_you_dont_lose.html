       I think this is what anon meant, and wanted us to know:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Just know that either way, wherher Assange gets to drop the last piece of his delayed surprise exactly one year later or you find out JFK was murdered by "our own", it's going to be a good couple of weeks, for justice. If GHB unironically kicks it within the next week or so, you'll know it's probably going the JFK route. Hope it's not though... no one directly involved back then will pay for JFK. They're all dead or too old to even bother with. Pray we get the Assange release."

       Well, idk I believe this but since we're in a conspiracy forum.. what if that's why people are saying the LV incident "should" or "was meant to be" bigger/worse, to distract us even more about this upcoming release of emails.

       If you think this is just about Hillary, you haven't been paying attention.

       It's taken a year to sanitise the
       <em>
        650 thousand
       </em>
       documents and scrub them of links to names like Kissinger and Bush. Hillary going down is one thing but Huma exposed Bill, both Georges, and a whole lot of others in a scandal orders of magnitude bigger than Watergate. That cannot be allowed to happen, so let's go get some pizza.

       It's important that we realize that the dark elite's end goal is not "unlimited pedophilia."
      </p>
      <p>
       Their end goal is unlimited control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pedophilia is just a way for them to exercise control, especially by filming new recruits into the dark elite doing pedophilia, and then blackmailing them in the future with the tape.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure for many of the dark elites, they use their power to do that to children, but their end goal is always power first, everything else second.

       The links don't go to 4chan directly, they go to 4plebs archive. Here you are nevertheless (without the context of the other posts):
      </p>
      <p>
       "Close. It's the mirrored 650k files, the NYPD took from Weiner's computer and also kept a copy of. Hannity will be first to interview Assange upon the release. Trump will LET the clock, run out. As in, on purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
       See?!? First disclosure will follow... FBI? Gone. Credibility and validity lost. Why?! Cause after Assange publishes the files, EVERYONE WILL WONDER WHAT TOOK THE FBI A FUCKING YEAR AFTER HAVING IT and more importantly, why they CLOSED HILLARY, out of the investigation w/o charges, A WEEK BEFORE TGE ELECTION.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's your mic drop, /pol/.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is your file trip to enter to download the files, in case anything happens. Just like you got with Vault 7, the DNC and Podesta emails... FUCKING. DUH.
      </p>
      <p>
       Really?! This is what he's been waiting for, hence OCTOBER! October 21, 2016 was SUPPOSED TO BE the 3rd file drop for our pre-election OCTOBER SURPRISE. It's a year later, TO THE FUCKING DAY, ON PURPOSE. It's a big "fuck you", to them. Holy shit, I give up. It's like you all forget the work you put in a year ago. This should be COMMON SENSE TO POL.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
       /pol/,

       Pay attention so you don't lose the opportunity to approach this right and look like fucking heroes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember when I said you won't see Hillary go down for pizza, but you will see her go down for big shit?! Then, I told you if you keep looking for her being charged for pizza, you'll miss all of the big wins and REAL HAPPENINGS?! This is exactly what I was referring to. This is Assange's final release (to the EXACT DAY, A YEAR LATER) of his promised, pre-election "October surprise". He was set to release it on 10/21/16 and since 10/14/16, you've hardly seen him since the embassy and his Icelandic HQ went dark, with the rest of his employees other than Jacob.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said in the thread before, these are the Weiner files the NYPD mirrored/retained as evidence before handing the hardware to the FBI. Some of the files are pizza-coded creepy, just like Podesta's don't get me wrong but, the NYPD recovered ALL of the files on Weiner/Huma's computer, which in their majority, are directly tied to ALL of Hillary's dirty Secretary of State Middle East dealings and her backdoor foundation profits thanks to hundreds of millions in cashed payroll checks for their dirty "cooperation". Yes, the pizza will burn, but she will ultimately go down for the shade she threw to our nation, as our Secretary of State.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just want to be clear... you're not getting 650k of pizza related files. You're getting 650k of NYPD recovered files from Weiners/Huma's computer that will mostly focus on their EXTENSIVE international/Terror funding and fueling crimes and as you read through the files, yes, you'll see a bunch of creepy Podesta-style, back and forth files/communications, sprinkled in between. PLEASE don't let yourselves get so excited over pizza, that you completely miss the actual fucking happening you're being given in this release.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yup. This is also what I was referring to as part of 3, 3 letter disclosures. By the time this is out, it's going to be REALLY HARD for the FBI and CIA to explain how the fuck Hillary even made it to election night as a candidate, instead of just watching it from a 14" analog TV, in a max security, isolation cell bunk in federal prison. Two down, the Fed to go...

       Not really. The JFK files are what's brought us right up to today. How/why exactly do you think this is ALL HAPPENING?!
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like (((they))) threw Weinstein to you hungry tigers like a steak, hoping they'd distract you long enough to make the EPIC cluster fuck, now known as Vegas go away, Trump has been hanging JFK over their heads, since the DAY he took office. He tried to play nice, rationalize, negotiate, etc. but, here we are. They know it. He knows it. If he doesn't have to release JFK, he won't and in reality, you shouldn't want him to. Like 9/11, the societal impacts would be devastating. We know what happened to JFK (and almost Reagan), but the majority of people won't be able to swallow that pill, rationally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just know that either way, wherher Assange gets to drop the last piece of his delayed surprise exactly one year later or you find out JFK was murdered by "our own", it's going to be a good couple of weeks, for justice. If GHB unironically kicks it within the next week or so, you'll know it's probably going the JFK route. Hope it's not though... no one directly involved back then will pay for JFK. They're all dead or too old to even bother with. Pray we get the Assange release.

       It's just like all the other keys he posted for his first two October surprise releases - Vault 7, the Podesta and DNC emails, Snowden's leak, etc. this is standard protocol and if you scroll up to my post earlier, you wouldn't need to USE ALL CAPS ASKING ME WHAT'S GOING TO BE IN IT, YOU'D ALREADY KNOW BECAUSE I ALREADY TOLD YOU!
      </p>
      <p>
       I've heard it's been "comped", but you know me... I'm not into the trendy /pol/ terms... ;o)
      </p>
      <p>
       Ha! Because he's losing his value. He only cared about "vindicating" Seth Rich because he thought he could piggy back off of our interest and demands for justice, to testify on Rich in exchange for a pardon for his crimes and hopefully get his shit back. He only cares about himself and has only ever exploited Rich for his own purposes/interests. Yes, he knows what info Seth had, he stored it for Wikileaks, but he knows he's irrelevant, otherwise. We will get the info on Rich, one way or another... and without Kim.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not so much Kim. Kim is one of several now 3rd parties Wikileaks works with. Hannity and a few others, will get the initial Assange scoop. Again, Kim has become increasingly irrelevant since he tried to exploit the murder of SR and his knowledge of Rich, for his own gain."

       Of course hes full of shit... in order to gain the info this guy supposedly has he has to be sitting in some pretty high places. Why would a man of that standing in that position to know things that 95% of the population will never even hear about go to 4CHAN and risk his life to tell everything to a bunch of average joes sat behind a computer screen? Likely scenario is that its someone who researches and has a decent knowledge of how things work coupled with a wicked imagination. The reason we choose to believe it is because we WANT to believe it so badly! A mysterious hero telling us whats gonna happen and when and giving us the power to save everyone! Come on guys, i thought people on this sub would at least be aware and wary of this type of thing without jumping in and being so gullible.

       It's a narrative-shaping operation.  I know a lot of bombshell public information that never gets posted here.  I could start posting small portions of it to cast one party in a certain light.  Meanwhile the whole truth remains hidden, and the arch-criminals sacrifice smaller presidents so their operation can continue.  That's what all of the 4chan larpers are doing.  A modified limited hangout.

       It's a narrative-shaping operation.  I know a lot of bombshell public information that never gets posted here.  I could start posting small portions of it to cast one party in a certain light.  Meanwhile the whole truth remains hidden, and the arch-criminals sacrifice smaller presidents so their operation can continue.  That's what all of the 4chan larpers are doing.  A modified limited hangout.
