<p>that&#39;s the airplane that just &quot;vanished&quot;. I always found that so weird. </p>

<p>IMO someone on that flight knew something about someone (super specific I know.....) who had the authority and lack of morality to bomb the plane over the ocean and that&#39;s why we don&#39;t know </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah it got posted on here a lot after the plane went missing. I didn&#39;t actually click your link, but if it&#39;s still the same story as it was originally: </p>

<p>1) the names of the &quot;patentholders&quot; mentioned are not even listed on the flight manifest (there were scanned copies floating around online), </p>

<p>2) that&#39;s not how patents work. If someone owns one and dies, it is typically passed down just like any other property/real estate </p>

<p>3) the names listed ARE actual names, on a real patent, but if you pull up the text of the patent, you&#39;ll see that they&#39;re listed as  inventors. They came up with it while working for Freescale, meaning the company already owned the patent from the start.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. Just because we&#39;re not screaming doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t care. Until new info comes out what is there to do except look. Spamming the same stuff over and over and over is just going to dilute the message.</p>

<p>If you keep screaming about this sort of stuff in person or on facebook or wherever you talk to normies they&#39;ll just shut down and stop believing anything you say. It takes bombshells to stir the masses.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Trying to comment against the main narrative gets you buried or in some places your account breached or posts removed for bullshit reasons.</p>

<p>Weinstein was an intentional distraction and TOO convenient. You also have to realize that the IRL people mostly watch MSM so will be driven by that or Facebook (removes some posts or your acct gets hacked) or Youtube (oops removed those pesky vids and changed algorithms). </p>

<p>Many who care are silenced and just herded to places where they &#39;think&#39; that they have a voice.</p>

<h2></h2>

<p>Also, no one died or at least not in any of the many vids or pics that I&#39;ve seen. It&#39;s a hoax and even if it wasn&#39;t, there sure as hell weren&#39;t &#39;hundreds&#39;. There are only what.. 58 fake memorials up?</p>

<p>Then again, your post comes across full of ignorance so I&#39;m not surprised that you can&#39;t count and have stupid people in your real life. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My guess he can only link to &quot;Are you good, my brother?!&quot; and then there are never any fucking wounds. There is a recent one (prob released because of criticism since the official story is that phones were wiped) but of a body being drug around and some fake-ass crying / screaming. If there does show a real vid, I would be highly suspicious at this point since people who had phone vids uploaded and ones who left phones had em wiped. Then again, &#39;they&#39; seem to be intentionally boxing themselves into a corner right now.</p>

<p>For sure no videos I have seen show any blood or obvious gunshot wounds. </p>

<p>But the police scanner audio seems to have them saying people shot and bloody people. </p>

<p>Even the stories of people shot are a bit off. </p>

<p>The person shot in my home town Vancouver  was said to be with his girlfriend. She said she tried to find where he was shot she didn&#39;t see where. And then they get seperated. </p>

<p>Later a bartender said she was with him and he died but no specifics on blood or where he was shot. Then she uses his cell phone to call his family. </p>

<p>A second man in my province was shot in the head, they showed a small scar on his scalp and claimed the bullet when though and through as if it was just a flesh wound. And a bullet into the skull wouldn&#39;t break the bones on exit. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the police went into it as just another training exercise. You can look up the LVMPD active shooter drill they did at their city hall. The set dressing / bodies look about the same. Their actions and decisions also speak to it being just another drill. They knew no one was actually shot, so didn&#39;t worry with the &#39;victims&#39;. </p>

<p>Look at the pic of the shooter. There are so many things wrong with it but it probably wasn&#39;t intended to be forensically correct or actually fool anyone. Was just supposed to be like the crappily dressed bodies similar to the city hall staged training.</p>

There should of been dozens if not hundreds of videos with people being shot or killed.  I&#39;m sorry but one video of &quot;dead bodies&quot; (that did not even seem authentic IMO) should not be proof that the &quot;facts&quot; that the news are saying are true, that would be pretty naive considering their track record.    </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny because I&#39;ve heard the exact opposite as proof it was a conspiracy. Someone was saying &quot;If it was a real shooting with people dying everywhere, why would all these people be pulling out their phones to film it instead of running away! Total hoax!&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it seems like most everyone was just standing around as the alleged initial shots were raining down.  I&#39;ve see people filming and saying that they can not see anyone actually hurt, but just people running.  It wouldn&#39;t be very hard to get a group of people to start screaming and running to create chaos and panic and make others do the same thing and follow them.  </p>

<p>Either way this one has all the same signs as the others like Aurora, Sandy Hook, Boston, etc.  They all have the crisis actors and the &quot;official stories&quot; make absolutely no sense with dozens of plot holes.  It&#39;s social engineering as most people think seeing something on the news equals true reality without ever actually doing any research for themselves. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since you listed all of those other attacks, I gotta ask why you think it&#39;s so unlikely that someone with a gun or a bomb would go crazy? I mean there are close to 250 million adults in this country, almost all of which have relatively easy access to guns and explosive materials. Is it really that unlikely for some of them to go crazy and kill some people every so often?</p>

<p>It seems like every mass shooting or domestic terrorist attack that happens is considered to be fake here, so if that&#39;s true then why aren&#39;t there any real ones like you would expect from this kind of population? I mean I am surprised these things don&#39;t happen more often, so if all the ones that do happen are fake then why doesn&#39;t it happen? Are there just no crazy people with access to weapons in the entire country?</p>

<p>I never said that nobody has ever gone crazy with a weapon did I?  I listed specific events that if you take the time to actually researched you will come to the glaring conclusion that the official stories are completely bogus.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>People die everyday from violence.  We are talking about specific cases.  If you are new to researching news stories for yourself this may come as a shock to you but agencies such as CNN, MSNC, FOX, etc have been caught countless times fabricating and out right lying to push agendas and social condition everyone.  That means you have to rely on actual evidence and not just that CNN said so.  They have been caught lying so much it is a complete joke by now.     </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It seems like every mass shooting or domestic terrorist attack that happens is considered to be fake here</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again you are being vague and saying &quot;every mass shooting considered fake here&quot; like everyone here has the same opinion or thought process or every event is the same, that&#39;s a nice tactic.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>so if that&#39;s true then why aren&#39;t there any real ones like you would expect from this kind of population?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Real violence does happen but just not these &quot;random mass killing&quot; events that are manufactured to make it seem much more prevalent than it is. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>I mean I am surprised these things don&#39;t happen more often</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why?  You are just conditioned to have that feeling. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Are there just no crazy people with access to weapons in the entire country?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Crazy people do stuff with weapons everyday, what are you talking about?  Who said that every weapon incident in this country was fake?  Hopefully nobody said that.  Just because they weren&#39;t on the TV doesn&#39;t mean they didn&#39;t happen.  Actually the tv stations supress mass causualty events if the agenda being told to the people.  The events that CNN and the others push the hardest are the ones that you should actually research for yourself to see if the evidence matches what they are saying.  If you actually do this you will understand they are terrible sources if you are looking for truth.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you look into what happened behind the scenes, there&#39;s just no way that&#39;s the case. A small handful of reporters were working on the Weinstein story for a long time -- well before Vegas happened. If you&#39;re willing to believe that those reporters were doing that so that they&#39;d have a compelling distraction in their back pocket, then you must believe that whoever orchestrated Las Vegas also gives orders to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>

<p>But you&#39;re probably not thinking it&#39;s the Republican-run US government who orchestrated the Las Vegas shooting (why go to all that trouble when they could unilaterally pass gun control measures on their own, in the House and the Senate?), and you probably also don&#39;t think they run the <em>New York Times</em>, which is not exactly the GOP&#39;s favorite rag. And, there&#39;s no other organization that has the power, influence, and money required to give orders to American mass media -- a massive industry employing tens of thousands of potential loose ends -- <strong>and</strong> would benefit in any way from disarming the American populace. (Certainly not the Democrats, who control not much at the moment; and if you&#39;re one of those people who thinks the Republicans and the Democrats are all the same, then again, there&#39;d be no need to orchestrate Las Vegas, they could easily pass all the legislation they want.)</p>

<p>In the fox news article, it&#39;s clear no one understands the technology involved, it says 5700 logins, but 5400 were unauthorized.. clearly, they don&#39;t understand how it even works. Unless they&#39;re saying this guy hacked the network (which the language doesn&#39;t say), I&#39;ve administered networks, a user simply can&#39;t login if his rights were revoked.</p>

<p>Then something about them altering an image.. pretty sure they don&#39;t know what an image is, but the process doesn&#39;t allow being altered after the fact.</p>

<p>Basically, I think the real problem here is uneducated people investigating, uneducated reporters reporting, and uneducated people reading the shit.. and no one knows what the fuck they&#39;re talking about.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Everyone is a conspiracy theorist in some fashion unless you believe that everyone is good, there are no agendas and everything wrong has just all been a silly misunderstanding...</p>

<p>Also, it is good to not believe 100% and to continue to question. I mean, I&#39;m convinced it is a hoax but hell, what if all of the released pics/footage/interviews were the fake bits to hide actual deaths?</p>

<p>I think that people have trusted major sources of media for so long but started to realize during the election that things might not be as they seem. I think that LV hoax (if thats what it is) can actually turn out to be a good thing. I was angry and upset at the thought, but have learned a lot in the past couple weeks. Even if regular people are just sincerely questioning the narrative (even if they think it happened), it still means that they are thinking.. </p>

<p>Awakening the public is like turning a large ship. It&#39;s been headed in a direction for so long with some speed, so you can&#39;t immediate fullstop or 180. Even if you could, you&#39;ll hurt the passengers or make them sick.</p>

<p>Maybe even just occasionally watching shitty tv shows just to be able discuss and point out areas of concern to &#39;zombies&#39; is a way to help them understand and make them start to think.. Then again, I do have my limits, so I might have to just start posting puzzles or playing something like &#39;would you rather&#39;.. </p>

<p>I do my digging and my research before I speak. I check multiple sources, and I make sure to let people know that all I can do is speculate on the information given to me and then give my opinions. It is amazing that more people are starting to do that in the wake of the LV shooting.</p>

<p>Something bugs me about what you said, though.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Speculate! Brainstorm! Guess! Sure, give a disclaimer or whatnot, but brainstorming ideas is how you even come up with shit to research. Don&#39;t wait on information to be given to you. Even if you don&#39;t share them with others, ask crazy questions and then go research it. I like seeing &#39;what ifs&#39; that aren&#39;t just meant as a distraction or a way to shift the narrative.</p>

<p>&quot;What if it were all a hoax? What does fake blood look like? What does REAL blood look like? Why does it look that way? What does an active shooter drill look like? What does an active shooter drill already done in the past by the LVMPD look like? Why did the Sheriff accidentally call it Mandalay Bay training? Did he actually say that? Where would you find the video? Who are the people in his regular press conferences? What is the definition of a false flag? What is the definition of a hoax? If you were pushing gun laws, wouldn&#39;t you rather have someone dead? If so, does it mean that hoaxes are legal and false flags aren&#39;t in the US? What is the law that made propaganda legal in the US? If it exists, did it get signed in before Sandy Hook? If your spouse was shot and you had medical training, would you run away from their body? If so, as a doctor wouldn&#39;t you be charged with failure to render aid? In the fake video with the bodies that some pass around, if it were real, why would they turn the lights off at the end? Why aren&#39;t actual EMS with med kits and stretchers out there? Why aren&#39;t people crying?&quot;</p>

<p>Brainstorming is fun and engaging. It&#39;s entertainment that actually strengthens you. You fall down more paths though when researching the shit you think up, though, and just because you can draw a path from A to Z doesn&#39;t mean that it necessarily played out that way.</p>

<p>He was upset because it was the single largest mass shooting in American history, which again will lead to no meaningful gun regulation. If him being upset about 58 people being murdered makes you angry then that says more about you buddy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Calm down shill. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m God. I don&#39;t think Kimmel and co are evil.  The &quot;masses&quot; are not idiots...people are generally pretty smart. </p>

<p>It&#39;s funny, you&#39;re gaslighting right now, trying to make me look like an idiot or some &quot;mightier than thou&quot; type figure. </p>

<p>This is why if you look at edit2 you&#39;ll see I&#39;ve elaborated on my views in the posts below...but you&#39;ve decided to skip that and just argue with me. </p>

<p>Gun regulation is not the answer, we have a mental health crisis.  If someone wants a gun, they can 3D print one. There&#39;s tons of books on how to make lethal weapons. Guns are here to stay. I&#39;d love it if there weren&#39;t guns, but there are. We need to take action to make sure people aren&#39;t using guns for evil.</p>

<p>Guns don&#39;t get up and kill people, people kill people. Are you going to ban cars or alcohol or knives or fire or anything else that <strong>people</strong> use to kill other <strong>people</strong>?</p>

<p>Now I will concede that we have taken shit to the next level with guns, but it&#39;s here to stay.</p>

<p>Gun ban is a temporary solution to a long term problem. Instead, educate people on gun safety, do more research on mental health, create stricter gun laws. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>America does have a mental health crisis, as highlighted by any city on the west coast. To suggest, however, that gun regulation wouldn&#39;t help is absurd. I never advocated people to be stripped of their guns, you decided to create a strawman argument. All that is needed is much more rigorous background checks and regulations, which you agree on. Good. </p>

<p>However, the whole &quot;people kill people&quot; argument is such tired garbage. Guns are specifically made to kill other humans. Cars aren&#39;t. Most Knives aren&#39;t. Yes, they are used to kill people but they much less effective. Do you think the gunman in Vegas would have killed 50 people with a knive? He would killed a fraction of what he did. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re missing the point man. People like guns. How do you expect to take away EVERY SINGLE gun? And even then - if people want a gun, they can 3D print it. Perhaps I wasn&#39;t clear? I do agree that gun regulation will help. The last sentence in my comment was &quot;create stricter gun laws&quot; - Did you not read that?</p>

<p>The knowledge is out there on how to make a gun - so those who want to harm people with them will find a way to get them.</p>

<p>So you have to understand the core issue is to stop people from wanting to harm one another. You have to attack these problems at their base. </p>

<p>Banning guns is like barely cutting weeds expecting them to go away. You have to pull them out at the roots. Ergo, get to the root of the problem.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem a bit dense, if you don&#39;t mind me saying. </p>

<p>I outright said that I don&#39;t won&#39;t a ban of all guns, just better regulation. I pointed out that we both agree on that being the way forward. If you took the time to read slower instead of getting all angry you would have seen that. It&#39;s you that&#39;s projecting the whole &#39;ban all guns&quot; argument. </p>

<p>I agree people who want guns badly enough will find them, however, you can make it tough enough that people will be dissuaded to try. It would be nice for people to stop killing one another but it won&#39;t ever happen. Violence is just human nature unfortunately.</p>

<p>I encourage you to read my post again and edit your reply to avoid further embarrassing yourself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Say what you will, it&#39;s the internet. I am enjoying our conversation, it&#39;s nice to have someone to talk to who views things differently than myself.</p>

<p>This entire conversation between you and I started when you mocked me for disagreeing with Kimmel&#39;s choice to not question the narrative.  </p>

<p>It seems to me that we agree on stricter gun laws, but not on the cause of these attacks. I believe it&#39;s a mental health &amp; educational issue more-so than a gun control issue. </p>

<p>I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on this. Many of these shooters all seemingly have a past of mental health problems. I believe that if we can fix the mental health problems, we can drastically reduce violence. At the same time I would also like to see much stricter gun laws.</p>

It shows how the media only cares about fresh blood on the street, shocking &quot;news&quot; to reports, attention grabbing, scandals, rumors, etc. Years ago the phrase &quot;that&#39;s so five minutes ago&quot; was overused.  Ever since TV/media went from nightly news to 24/7 they re-re-reair the same thing until a not-news story is made up. News makes money off ratings, too. If something is &quot;old&quot; news, turn attention to anything else especially if it means drawing attention away from something that doesn&#39;t fit their narratives.</p>

I have a huge list of things to do, projects, books/articles to read, etc.  And I end up logging more hours on Steam and stumbling down the rabbit hole of completely random threads. I believe it was Huxley that predicted that the truth would be buried in a &quot;sea of irrelevance.&quot;  The truth/actually important things are drowned out by spam/disinformation.  Whatever gets the most upvotes, though, right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just putting this out there... If the people IRL around you hear your spouting off about, oh I dunno, say: sandy hook, war on drugs, war on terror, 9/11, Harry Weinstein, Seth rich, pizzagate, elsagate, the OG Watergate, MK Ultra, Government complacency in shady shit, FEMA camps, hidden Nazi submarine bases in the Arctic, PLanet X/Nibiru, Hollow-earth/flat-earth/wall-of-ice-surrounded flat earth/oblong earth, CEO/corporate complacency, underhanded stock market tactics, vaccination/autism links, and last but not least aliens; </p>

<p>then your IRL friends may have not stopped wondering what &quot;really&quot; happened in LV but may have decided to avoid the typical 2-4 hour discussions the average &quot;theorist&quot; would like to have about a topic with YOU. I.E they are reddit stalking this sub or YT&#39;ing different stuff. </p>

<p>note: this was not directed at OP or anyone else just an observation about why this may be the case in OP&#39;s or anyone else&#39;s case; Because I know for a fact MY fiancee can&#39;t stand to hear LV mentioned by someone because of the fear I&#39;ll &quot;go into one&quot; and &quot;we&#39;ll never get outta here/get them to leave now!&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. The US is in a unique position as the leader of the free world. With Trump seemingly doing everything in his power to break from alliances that were created by the USA I don&#39;t think there&#39;s been a time since post WW2 when we&#39;ve needed a strong federal government to ensure that a total collapse does not happen.</p>

<p>Can you imagine secessions taking place with the almost mandatory unrest that will follow? This country can&#39;t afford to go through that turmoil especially with all the foreign policy quagmires the country now finds itself in.</p>
