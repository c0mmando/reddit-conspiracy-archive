       You guys are really letting us down upvoting this shit. She had epilepsy, she had tumors, and she recently had activity with seizures. Just because someone fucking died that was present at the festival DOESN'T mean TPTB fucking killed her. She didn't give a statement to anyone except on her Facebook wall. THOUSANDS OF THE PEOPLE THERE DID THAT SHIT. So if you want to say she was murdered, why? She had no pertinent information, she didn't have any proof, and most importantly, she wasn't a threat to ANYONE. You fucks that upvote that shit are propagating bullshit that we don't need. When there are atleast 5 threads gaining traction about this case, and when there is literally not ONE THING that links her death to the case, it's really dumb how it's on the front page EVERY DAY.
      </p>
      <p>
       You really think the feds killed Kymberley because she had a shitty worded Facebook post that might of claimed multiple shooters? Then why didn't they kill the 5,000 that also claim that (that were there), and also the thousands more that actually have audio proof of the multiple shooters,

       If I don't make this post, it keeps getting upvoted and on the front page. It's not a fucking lead. Like, not in the slightest. There's nothing linking her to the shooting, so why fucking speculate the worst? She was one of 22,000, no one killed her because she claimed multiple shooters on Facebook.

       "People are actually making the connection that she was killed off because she talked. Which is fucking hilariously wrong."
      </p>
      <p>
       This implies you are asking people to stop speculating. To stop making ASSumptions. However, I must point out, that you have done exactly what you so self-righteously demand that others do. You are speculating, and making ASSumptions that she was NOT killed after her posts. Do YOU have proof that she wasn't? No. You are making ASSumptions. Get off or your self-righteous, 
sanctimonious high horse.
      </p>
      <p>
       That does not go to say that I believe she was murdered. I am just saying...who do you think you are? Your post implies you have the inside scoop. From looking at your other posts, I am pretty sure that isn't the case. So many people with antisocial personalities on the Internet. It's laughable. No, it's really just sad.

       Wow you're really blind if you think the Kymberley case will lead anywhere. That's all I was saying, and I don't need to have the "inside scoop" to fucking know this isn't what it's been blown out to be. She fucking died in her sleep due to the stress of the shooting, epileptic seizures, and other EXPLAINABLE health issues. You're actually dumb if you think her posting a comment to Facebook = her getting offed by the feds.

       Every time I say an unpopular thing that needs to be said I get downvoted and attacked personally. No one even argues for the other side, and if they do I refute it with a good response. Then they just sling insults at me and that isn't cool.

       You don't have the ability to comprehend information. You need to reread, and COMPREHEND, my comment. I never stated the Kymberley Suchomel case was going anywhere. My comments were directed specifically at YOU, and what I believe is likely an undiagnosed personality disorder for beating your chest, like a child, and insisting what people should and should not do, and should and should not think. Yes, I was PERSONALLY ATTACKING YOU! Now you've got it! I was personally attacking you because for anyone to post such a comment fully exhibits their ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have ANY INKLING of what the military, the CIA, the FBI,  has in their goody bags? Even the SLIGHTEST idea? Because if you did, you would realize just what a foolish comment it is to insist Kymberley Suchomel was NOT purposely murdered. Do I, personally believe she was? No. But would I ever make such a grandiose and naive comment to INSIST she was not? No, because I do happen to know a few things in their arsenal. Here is just a tiny, tiny example.

       Ahh alright now you're just writing nonsense dude. Please explain to me how she was chosen out of the thousands that claimed multiple shooters. How was she chosen to get killed? If you ask that question you immediately should understand how stupid what you're saying is. No one shot her with a fucking heart attack gun man, she had pre-existing health conditions. Not everything is a conspiracy.

       Do you have proof she was murdered? His whole argument is that there's none she was murdered.

      <p>
       Then your proof is that the deep state has the ability to do it.

       To be fair I'm pretty sick of all the misinformation that constantly gets upvoted because it sounds juicy. This just in! The FBI handler has the same last name as this other person, I've cracked the case everyone. Also did you know saudis own the floor paddock was staying on?..... Doesn't it annoy you how easy it is to disprove both of the things I said yet those ideas consistently work their way to the top because nobody wants the truth, just the juiciest story.

       It wouldn't be that big of a deal if the FBI would actually provide the American people with some facts, a non-changing timeline of what actually happened, and if hero security guards didn't suddenly go missing.
The whole thing stinks.  I was able to hang my hat on "Incompetence" and "Inter-agency pissing contests" until everything just went sideways the past few days.
Seizures:  The people who have had seizures that die from them are usually not the people who have had them before, they usually manage them.  Tumors:  How many times have you ever read this statement, "She died from tumors".
She was obese, so why didn't she die from a stroke or heart attack if she was suffering from stress like that fat chick from Charlottesville?

       He was. At first he thought it was because he was allergic to the kitten I brought home from college, but it continued even after I left, so he thought it was an allergy to mold because he was living in a basement. Kept getting worse do he finally got it checked out. At first they thought it was a piece of gum that he'd aspirated, or a parasite he may have picked up from a recent Caribbean cruise. Then he got pneumonia on top of it, so they surgically removed that lobe of his lung, and discovered the "foreign object" was a bone tumor. After that he had bad sleep apnea and his girlfriend (a radiologist who worked at the hospital where he had the quarter of his lung removed) would stay over and awake all night to make sure he kept breathing. But he seemed to be getting stronger over time so everyone relaxed a bit. Then 14 months after his surgery, he started working in construction again and re-joined his softball league in the same week. That Sunday, on a night his girlfriend didn't stay over, he went to sleep and never woke up. Autopsy showed another tumor had formed, and his doctor is convinced the strain of work and softball that week combined with the new tumor are what caused his death.

       You are seriously speaking out of your ass. A seizure is a seizure first or last time. Yes medication can HELP control them but you can always have break through seizures. Dealing with seizures caused by a brain tumor is a whole other story. Do research before you spout off as if you know.

       If the government was willing to randomly fire into a crowd of people at a country music festival, why wouldn't they be willing to kill a person who immediately releases unwanted details about it on their social media?
      </p>
      <p>
       While I agree is it dumb to state anything like it is fact without knowing all the details, I think it is also dumb to assume that she died when she did because of pre existing health conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being physically ill does not exonerate you from the possibility of being murdered. I don't think there is anything wrong with looking into it and having that death under investigation by an agency that isn't afraid of exposing the truth.
