       I honestly think the only way of going anout it is to only all accounts over 30 days to post, but allow newer user account trying to post anonymously to ask the mods to allow their post.  I'll be honest, I not even a fan of that, but it's the only effective way I could see it being done without making vague rules to be inforced arbitrarily.

       My sub has like 1400 subscribers and it's difficult to moderate at times. I'm sure it's way different when there are over 500,000!

       Not necessarily, but I think it would be easier to remove users who are clearly not hear to discuss conspiracies but to ridicule the sub and it's users, and make it more difficult to right back in with throw away accounts.  Although I'm still on the fence about it, I prefer for the sub to be as open as possible.

       I've seen a few of your post, I don't believe I've left any comments on them. I'm new to community. Thanks for the amount of effort you put into your post. I didn't know about this sub and it seems I joined at a rather odd time. I'd hope it can get to a place where discussion can proliferate.

       In all honesty what can be done. At this point? Censorship will only root out potential participants. I think what really can be done is hold ourselves accountable to the content in which we post. Take the troll comments, the shills and whatever else they throw our way with a smile. If no reaction is given then what can they achieve. How will they know their work is actually working. The prevalence of post that call out shills or call to attention that this sub is being swarmed only encourages more of the same. It shows that their efforts are working and discouraging. Perseverance seems to be the only thing that can effectively counter what is going on in this sub.

       Ah I see, I can delete my comment as not to draw unwanted advertising if this would be the appropriate thing to do. I can't really speak on the difficulties of nodding a sub, I presume it can be pretty intense. I also don't understand if mods are paid or are they just volunteers. I'm pretty ignorant on how reddit actually works.

       Actions of the individual, are needed to improve something, doesn't mean that action can't make things worse. I haven't been apart of reddit for very long and don't really know how the subs function. How ever I suppose most any politic sub would be filled with bias dumpster fires. Politics invokes an emotional response because it is more or less a belief system. When interacting with someones belief system, that system puts up its defense systems. No belief wants it's power taken away. If you don't beliefs are powerful well, most everyone runs off a belief system. In fact i'd go as far to say each individual has their own belief system and that is how their world is shaped. Not by just one belief but rather a plethora of beliefs. Being able to take in new information that challenges your belief system is really hard to some.

       Without knowing the background of what's transpired with reddit and how it's been manipulated and controlled through the implementation of moderation and sub rules, it's going to seem like it came about organically.  I don't have the time right now to pull up a bunch if the examples to show you, but if you look for a thread along the lines of 'how reddit was destroyed' (I think that was the title, it will provide a lot of information on what's transpired over the past 6-7 years.

       Kit, thanks. I've did a brief overview on a post

       this isn't surprising. I mean this is the nature of the beast so in that sense it did come out organically. From past experience we learn to improve. Overtime are "improvements" become hinder-some. Once it is fully improved everyone abandons ship because nobody wants to be on a fake ass boat that is bound to sink. It's anchored down by its own weight. It has no hope to sail free in the sea.

       I don't think our definition of 'organic' matches up.  Monsanto's is a by product of capitalism and science, but that doesn't mean their products are organic.  Reddit litterally started as a platform for free speech, it was touted all over the place.  Hell, this was the introduction message on reddit, "A source for what's new and popular online. vote on links that you like or dislike and help decide what's popular, or submit your own!"... until they killed r/reddit.com, by the way, check out the top post when they killed it and read through those comments to get an idea of how this place has changed.  This is one of the only subs that still operates like old reddit, very little censorship.  Trust me,

       I meant how humanity currently operates in the modern form. Everything is meant to be obsolete that even means our social sites. It is organic because it is very much the system we've been using for a very long time. Most things start out with a vision then when you try to appease the masses that vision is rendered null. Is this not organic if it is a reoccurring theme throughout human history?

       My point of organic would be a untouched tribe deep in the amazon.  There is a documentry, can't recall now, of a film crew becoming a part of a native tribe, they explain suicide to the tribe and they all laugh.  They couldn't understand why anyone would ever do that, becasue they aren't slaves.  Just because it seems natural for an authorian system to keep being authoritarian in order to control the population, doesn't mean it's organic.  None the less, I understand your point and agree, but I think if you reread my initial comment, you might see we have a different definition of organic.

       You are correct, I did miss how you presented it. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss.  I think we have a understanding of organic. Both you and I, we rather used it quite well to illustrate it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Organic: denoting a relation between elements of something such that they fit together harmoniously as necessary parts of a whole.(definition you most likely related to as organic)
      </p>
      <p>
       Organic:characterized by the systematic arrangement of parts; organized; systematic. (probably not as common use of the word)

       It's a valid point you bring up with the various definitions of organic.  I love watching the way the english language (definitions of specific words) get's twisted by lawyer and politicians in order to push an agenda.  I'm now curious what the various definitions of organic are and when specific versions came into play... Anyways, keep it up, your doing a good job, the fact you seem to have a solid grasp on the Awan situation speaks volumes... unless your doing for a political identity, than fuck that shit.  Both sides are equally up for criticism IMO.  Sorry for the diatribe, just like to put it out there now adays.  Have a good one and look forward to seeing your user name around here!

       Thank you Kit, I've found this place quite cozy. I've no problem with bullies or being harassed, most of what people present is misinterpreted in the digestion of the content. If someone aims a jab at me I've plenty of ammo to aim back, Sometimes I fire. Sometimes I see their side or place assumption on the individual that might not be truthful but placates myself from doing anything further.

       there probably should be separate sub for longform posting and polite discussions. my inclination (as someone who’s been here a bit longer than this account) is to critique your post and call you out, but that’s not what you are looking for.  if it was my world there would be better spam filters (eg multiple shooter youtube guy would get detected and halted, reposting nettlenet shit over and over) but for many years the arrows have worked better than any other known system

       Much of the mocking, negative and general condescending comments would retreat if the mods were to implement changes to remove shill incentives.

         Remove this sub from their clutch of controlled subs by opting out out of r/all.

       This wouldn’t prevent the vote manipulation, but it’d screw with the losers who like to use this sub as another platform.

       It’s unfortunate that the only way to navigate this sub now is via ‘new’. Regular users have given up on the front page, which should be a concern for mods.

       You're making it more complicated than it needs to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't like it when anyone disagrees with you and you call them shills. You may not realize how arrogant you come across as. Everyone is just supposed to believe you for some reason, and they must be getting paid for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself don't like your Christian persecution attitude. A lot of Christians think they have the right to run people's lives. I'm an atheist, and I'm a good person. I know that my actions have consequences in this life, and I know I can't ask a god to forgive me and magically I'm and a good person again.

       Hmm well I do my best to make posts that are not condescending to those who do not accept my worldview.

       I don't downvote people just because they are atheists or anything like that.

       Also it shouldn't warrant attacks.

       I'm new here, I'm lurked on Reddit a long time. I think over time, what they said has become apparent. Look at your edit, yet your next comment you apologize for being wrong, but leave the edit.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're incredibly defensive, you don't take criticism well, and you're ignoring the idea that anyone who's seen your many repeated posts hasn't gotten you.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure you have some fans, as I'm sure you have people that simply don't like your essays. The first post you linked seemed somewhat philosophical, even if it was a bit sophomoric. Your second post criticizes a show I'm sure a lot of people like, and has a very political agenda. Why are you surprised at it not getting a positive reception?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like you're disconnected from the reality that people simply might not like what you have to say. That they might perceive your latter post as a sad attempt to inject political bias into a TV show. The premise of the "conspiracy" being the writer or whatever, and the first comment says "they haven't been involved for 4 years", and you reply with "so what".
      </p>
      <p>
       What I absolutely hate about this post is that you're comparing completely unrelated things, while obviously being ignorant of the many reasons people's responses might have changed, namely.. you are the biggest factor that there's more hostility towards you.
      </p>
      <p>
       And you coming in here arguing that moderation needs to change because people don't like you.. when I've seen your sub where you straight up moderate like Hitler. Anyone who doesn't agree, let's see if they're a top mind, what reason can I find to get rid of them? Are they too negative (as you claim about whoever you're responding to), are they..
      </p>
      <p>
       You're just really really terrible as self reflection and accepting criticism. Sometimes, when you see trends, people treating you a certain way over time.. sometimes you need to realize the problem is you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Work on self reflection. Read your old posts and your new ones, and think about how
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       have changed over time. Look at whether you're a likeable person, rather than assuming you are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen your comments a long time, I've given you criticism as gently as possible.. but you've got this way of somehow trying to turn everything around on anyone who points out your flaws.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's the problem, self reflection, you'd be pointing out your own flaws. It's healthy to do so, to self examine, to make adjustments of things you realize you don't like about yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've recently done it. It's something that you should never stop doing.. it you can easily build self defense mechanisms, like your projection, your victimization.. your lack of ability to even consider looking at yourself critically, rather than just think you're this sweet nice person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Stop blaming everyone else when you've consistently been trying to build a case of it being everyone else. For once, take some responsibility for how people perceive you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't believe me, make a new account.. sure, people might recognize the stuff you write, but you won't get automatically downvoted by the people who simply don't like you, or what you have to say.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for God's sake, realize, not everything you say deserves upvotes, because you put in effort. I'm sure there's hundreds, if not thousands of people who have never had anything they say reach the front page, yet here you are complaining because it isn't happening often enough.. like you're views are more superior to that of everyone else. Or that everyone else should even be nice to you, that they should respect you.. no one is obligated to treat you any certain way.

       There's rules about people attacking, and honestly, I don't see a lot of attacking going on.. but regardless, you can report them and go on. Your overall argument is that rules or moderation needs to change, when really all I see is healthy discussions and debate.. along with some things that can be moderated if they break rules.
      </p>
      <p>
       But there's something you're not getting. Why people aren't responding favorably. This entire post, I don't think any reason you've given explains it. I don't hate you, I simply don't agree with the things you tend to post, and I can see a variety of reasons people wouldn't respond positively.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your family Guy post. It's about something I'm sure a lot of people like (I don't), you've made an argument that seems pretty political in its basis. You disregard that the person you based the "conspiracy" around hasn't had anything to do with the show in 4 years.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just simply.. what's there to like about it? You've made it about politics, about religion, things people typically don't like. The only part that was conspiracy about it doesn't matter to you once you are informed he has nothing to do with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, what I've seen constantly is you just not understanding the many reasons that people wouldn't like or wouldn't care what you have to say. That just like you probably have a fan club (your sub), you've probably got an even bigger group that doesn't like you to whatever degree.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got all the way through this post, not realizing who posted it, till the comment where you accused someone of being a "top mind", then it all made sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I'll say again, because you're response was really dismissive. I don't think it's the sub. I don't think it's brigades, I don't think rules need to be created in order to.. whatever it is that you think needs to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the thing that would change
       <em>
        everything
       </em>
       the most, is the person all that revolves around in your argument.

       You're again attacking me. This isn't about my posts or even if they are well-received. I write some controversial stuff and agree it isn't always well liked.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's about general attacks, being linked to mocking subs, and a general feeling of negativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel that there could be some discussion rules that should be changed to make the sub better.
      </p>
      <p>
       If people disagree then that's fine. I have my own subreddit anyway and that can reflect what I think is right.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're making this about me and my ego. I could care less if people like me or my words here on Reddit. Rather, it's about me being attacked and mocked consistently. "You are mentally ill" is not good for discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's also about the manipulation of information and forum sliding. I talked about that in the post.

       The word attack is probably wrong. But you're basically saying that I'm some ego maniac who can't accept criticism. If that isn't an attack,  I don't know what it is.

       It's an observation, which I've made based on the things I've observed.
      </p>
      <p>
       People can say negative things about me, it isn't attacking, and I've actually changed my views because of this. Criticism isn't a bad thing. I've grown more as a person in my lifetime by getting honest criticism, than people being to nice to tell me the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       My biggest point now, would be that your views on what are "attacks", might just be criticism that you're refusing to acknowledge.. personal growth is difficult by nature, but without accepting healthy criticism (you said I called you an ego maniac, look back, I said no such thing) it's nearly impossible to grow as a person.
      </p>
      <p>
       By views in my 20's are wildly different than they were when I hit 30. I was probably too positive and naive then, and I've swung too far in the opposite direction since then.. which was reinforced by someone's response in this sub, of all places.
      </p>
      <p>
       The word is criticism(not attacking), and it isn't inherently a bad thing.

       In my defense, you should see what people say to me daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yours was more of a criticism than an attack I admit but it still missed the point of my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further, it felt passive aggressive than actually helpful critique.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I am being serious when I say I'm not concerned that you or others don't like me or my posts.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am concerned about the discussions in the sub in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way this is going in circles. I removed the post so you got what you wanted in the end.

       That isn't what I wanted.. and your post wasn't about discussions in general, they were discussions you made. I see plenty of posts with really healthy discussion, I'm sure it wouldn't take long to find an example.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I was being very direct in my words, to be passive aggressive requires me not being direct. Again, I think a lot of this isn't what the other person is saying/doing, but how you interpret/perceive what they've said.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can only speak of our interaction, where I've tried to be very frank and direct, and you've still managed to interpret it differently than I obviously intended it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wish you no I'll, if anything I hope something I've said gives you something to mull over.

       Here's an example of a highly upvoted post in the last day, that seemed to have really healthy discussion, even though it was a bit controversial. I pointed out that the screenshot was bad, and Laura Loomer had given an entirely different date, no one attacked me (even though that goes against the OP's point), and someone corrected me when I thought that a photo that was photoshopped might be a hoax, and instead it was proven to be true. Lots of good and positive came out of that post. Didn't see any name calling, no comments having to be removed..

       The last few months in this sub has seemed less volatile, I decided to join after the Las Vegas shooting occurred. I haven't experienced (much, yet) the attacks that were much more prolific in the past. I've seen more healthy discussions and debate.. hence I'm here.
      </p>

       Do realize, people can lurk for years and never feel like they have anything important enough to say to make it worth creating an account.

       Now, rather than just observe, I wanted to participate.. and your post seems to be arguing in such a way that would make things worse in my opinion. I think the rules are adequate, and I'm not seeing them abused (much).

       I don't think our definition of 'organic' matches up.  Monsanto's is a by product of capitalism and science, but that doesn't mean their products are organic.  Reddit litterally started as a platform for free speech, it was touted all over the place.  Hell, this was the introduction message on reddit, "A source for what's new and popular online. vote on links that you like or dislike and help decide what's popular, or submit your own!"... until they killed r/reddit.com, by the way, check out the top post when they killed it and read through those comments to get an idea of how this place has changed.  This is one of the only subs that still operates like old reddit, very little censorship.  Trust me,
