       This Russian narrative is to slander Trump for 2020 and align Bernie Sanders ideologically with Trump and Putin - Mccarthyism - they're all commies!
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, as we see that DHS is now overseeing elections this same narrative will be used to censor

        Hillary Clinton behind the Russians hacked the election narrative.

      </p>
      <p>
       Personally I disagree with this timeline. She hatched this plan after the second to last debate where Trump basically said he has no problem with Putin. After that the bs claims began.

      </p>
      <p>
       “all 17 US intelligence agencies agreed” that Putin had directed the theft and public  dissemination of DNC e-mails in order to benefit Trump. But in recent weeks the former  heads of the CIA and Office of National Intelligence have themselves stated publicly that that foundational allegation is untrue: Only three agencies (the CIA, FBI, and NSA)
 prepared the report, and not even those agencies themselves but “hand-picked analysts.”  Still more, the former director of the FBI, James Comey, has admitted that the FBI  itself never examined the DNC computers in question.”

       The intelligence community has backed off election hacking is now broadly claiming ‘collusion’ but they don’t say in what respect. Collusion to buy ice cream?
      </p>
      <p>
       They

      <p>

      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Clinton was paid $35,000,000 from the Russian company Rusnano. One of the founders of Rusnano is Vladimir Putin.
       </li>
       <li>
        Clintons were paid a $500,000 "speaking fee" from the Russian company Renaissance Capital.
       </li>
       <li>
        Clinton sold 1/5 of all U.S. uranium rights to Russia.
       </li>
       <li>
        The company that bought the uranium rights subsequently donated $145,000,000 to Clinton's charity.
       </li>
       <li>
        Powerful Russian officials such as the Mayor of Moscow, business tycoon, and various government officials donated millions of dollars to Clinton's charity.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       However a different figure was reported:

       <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/08/26/clinton-foundation-spin/">
        The New York Times reported that a Russian company assumed control of major uranium reserves in a deal that required State Department approval, as the chairman of the company involved in the transaction donated $2.35 million to the Clinton Foundation.

       Nothing has changed except the Hillary democrats and her media machine (WaPo, CNN, Msnbc)  are using Romney/Republican strategies. Its not surprising as Hillary was a Republican, a ‘Goldie girl’ for Goldwater - the anti-civil rights, commie chasing, McCarthyism spreading loser.

       First the NSA finds 'moderate confidence' in the conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Second The DNS?? Same people who brought you wmds and Iraq war.

       <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/07/01/this_man_is_still_lying_to_america/">
        The same former director who was busted lying though his teeth.
       </a>
       But for a massive leak (Snowden) he wouldve got away with his massive and disgusting lie.

      <p>
       Third: "? An assessment of attribution usually is not a simple statement of who conducted an operation, but rather a series of judgments that describe whether it was an isolated incident, who was the likely perpetrator, that perpetrator’s possible motivations, and whether a foreign government had a role in ordering or leading the operation."
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Can their assessments be anymore vague?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Fourth - Wikileaks refutes this idea  as does a UK ambassador who both say it was a leak and not a hack.
      </p>
      <p>
       FIFTH - WTF
       <br/>
       This 'intelligence' report is referring to Guccifer 2.0 as the Romanian hacker. Either they are incredibly stupid or they are misleading on purpose and confusing the facts.
       <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/romanian-hacker-guccifer-expected-plead-guilty-federal-court/story?id=39351270">
        Guccifer
       </a>
       with Guccifer 2.0. AND Guccifer 2.0 denied being connected to Russia. This is the most pathetic report.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sixth - They take issue with publication of anti Hillary facts without doubting the facts themselves. RT or any other outlet is to be assumed meddling where they are reporting
       <em>
        TRUE
       </em>
       facts?? Good god thats the heart of the First Amendment. Who cares where it comes from, if its true. And it was all true, it was HER emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im sure there are more points but I couldn't read anymore without feeling like its a complete waste of time. The CIA is a lying machine. They paid 600 million to the WaPo and you can see the results.
      </p>
      <p>
       It used to be illegal for the government to use propaganda against its own citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its now legal for the ‘Intelligence’ agencies to feed propaganda to US citizens, a change in the past five years.

       Yes, I've argued with myself. I understand that proof and reason weren't in my vocabulary. Blinded by emotion. I no longer consider myself liberal or any political affiliation. I'm American. I don't think they can't be reasoned with. People will see the proof in their own lives first. Keep on chipping away at the unaware. Soon enough they will be faced with reality.

       Well, I inherently thought I was doing good, not so much I didn't like what I found. I realized that my actions where coming from a stance of weakness. I've victimized myself even if I were actually a victim of heinous crime. When I positioned myself as a victim, then the only out come I can expect is that of a victim. It has taken a long time for this to click. If I am not the product of my environment  and circumstances don't dictate my actions. Then all of my actions have always been in my control. The only thing out of control was my emotions.

       -This Russian narrative is to slander Trump for 2020 and align Bernie Sanders ideologically with Trump and Putin - Mccarthyism - they're all commies!
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Absolutely. Deep state is trying to cover their tracks for manipulating the presidential election.
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       They know they elevated Trump 247 in the media to avoid talking about the multiple mile long lines of people waiting in the sleet &amp; snow for the old socialist had between 2015 &amp; 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump literally copied Bernie Sanders stump speech &amp; threw in the wall while the media pumped him on tv night &amp; day.
      </p>
      <p>
       He had more free coverage than any presidential candidate ever in the history of the television.
I believe if we had equal time in the media for presidential candidates it would be harder to scam citizens during the election.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now they are trying to blame Trump/Russia while trying to coverup the massive populist following that Sanders had/has before 2020.

       Youre a spot on. So on that there are emails from Hillarys clan to the media telling them specifically not to denounce the extremists
       <em>
        such as Trump
       </em>
       and to prop them up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume Hillary thought that extremist right wing candidates would make her Republican ideology look moderate.

       Literally everyone in Trumps cabinet knows that Russia interfered in our election. Every single republcian except Trump knows this. Hillary created it all? That's hilarious. Because they argued about Assange and Russia in their final debate. Trump jokingly asked Russia to find her deleted emails. Did you forget that shit? You can't even pretend that Hillary made this shit up after she lost the election because the timeline doesn't fit.
      </p>
      <p>
       So much fucking whining because your guy is under a criminal investigation. It boggles my mind that nobody believes our government but somehow believes everything Russia says. A dictator that kills journalists. And that's your go to guy for news. Stop whining. If your guy didn't collude with them, then you have nothing to worry about. Maybe he shouldn't have surrounded himself with foreign agents working on Russia's behalf.

       You wanna know why they are all in bed together.  Learn about the Awan scandal. 7 million dollars worth of fraud and a massive data breach has been uncovered.  Pelosi and Ryan must have conspired to cover it all up. We have IT specialists now saying that it would have been impossible for all the data to be uploaded. It had to be a local breach because not enough bandwidth to move the data off the servers.

       This is the scandel and Muh Russians is the diversion. It will all come out soon enough the fuse is is already lit.

       No mention of the Awan scandel. Once you see that for what it is the rest makes sense.  The only collusion is between the leaders of both parties to cover up their own incompetence(at best)or corruptness(at worst) hide it from the rest of us and blame it on the boogy man.
