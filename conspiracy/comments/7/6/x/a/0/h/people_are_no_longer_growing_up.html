<p>At home I can eat way healthier than I was at work. When I was working I&#39;d have a coffee a couple days a week and eat a sandwich most days for lunch. If you know what a good diet really is you avoid those things at all cost. </p>

<p>Aging is an illusion if you eat a sandwitch every day and coffee every  day you&#39;ll age way faster than someone who eats fruits and vegetables every day instead.</p>

<p>I needed my sand witches when I was in high school to numb my brain out. You guys need to research health better idk how these conversations even go on here.

You could starve yourself back to good health. Instead, what we do now is if we&#39;re in cancer sick we have a sandwich every day. If we have cancer we have sandwich and juice every day.

    <div class="md"><p>Not at all.</p>

<p>Coffee is linked to many positive health benefits. Negative effects are possible, primarily when over used. Unless the negative aspects are from how it&#39;s sourced, I&#39;d like to hear the detriments of coffee consumption.</p>

<p>Sandwiches have such a vast variety that saying all of them are healthy or unhealthy would be a false statement either way. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All milk is the cause of lymphatic stagnation. Coffee is one of the worst things you can consume. Period. Bread is up there. There&#39;s metal in all cereal. Oxytocin injected in cows every day (That alone cover cheese, milk, steak and beef) there&#39;s all kinds of questionable chemicals in the bread.</p>

<p>All of that attacks your neurons. Neurons are wires in your body. Once your neurons get too weak you can&#39;t hold a train of thought or think anymore. Welcome to the real world I hope this was valuable input.</p>

<p>PS we&#39;re 200 trillion in debt and are literally complete slaves, being fed poison so that we never realize it. Living inside of a reality rich people invent. Being taught diet by these people.</p>

<p>What do you think happens if a human eats only fruits? They don&#39;t die. There&#39;s about 40 calories in an orange. Try hitting your 2000 calorie limit eating oranges.</p>

<p>There&#39;s 16 calories in 100 grams of celerie. Enjoy eating 10 kilograms of celery and still only getting 1600 calories. Comprendez? They teach you how to think and what to think so that you fry your body and spend all your money on literal bullshit.</p>

<p>Our entire news/TV shows are at a basic 4th grade level at this point. People who watch TV and are still entertained by it I would argue have a form of autism. And if that accounts for 98% of the population, so be it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, consuming coffee is bad because of milk? </p>

<p>We all know fruits and vegetables are healthier than processed foods. </p>

<p>A limited amount of properly made bread isn&#39;t all that unhealthy. I&#39;m not talking about wonder bread here. Grains have been a part of the human diet for quite some time. It is possible for breads to be a part of a nutritious diet.</p>

<p>Any mass farmed meat will be less healthy than wild game. This is due to how meat is mass farmed. </p>

<p>Coffee, in and of itself, is not unhealthy. Neither is water. If you use that water to make Kool aid, then you have an unhealthy drink. Similar to drinking a frappuccino, or whatever sweetened foamed milk beverage one makes with coffee as an ingredient.</p>

<p>Sandwiches can be healthy. Not if you&#39;re making it with wonder bread, miracle whip, Oscar Meyer Bologna, and Kraft singles. Although, that can be tasty.</p>

<p>You never mentioned the acidity of coffee being it&#39;s negativity.</p>

<p>Insulting and cursing me aren&#39;t helping either. You should probably remove your head from your rectum and have a conversation. Maybe actually state the facts that cause you to have such strong convictions.</p>

<p>Yes, coffee is acidic. So are citrus fruits. That doesn&#39;t make coffee unhealthy. </p>

<p>Your assumptions and lack of intelligent conversation seem to show that your negative views of others may well be projections of self. Perhaps you need to reflect. Some meditation might be in order. Or, maybe a nap.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Smoking weed isn’t the problem. I and many others use it as medicine to help us work, be more creative, and manage health issues. Alcohol is far more responsible for disconnecting people and lowering their vibrations.</p>

<p>Not to mention much of the social immaturity stems from both sexes. It isn’t exclusively men. There’s plenty of immature women refusing to grow up as well. I’ve met far more men that desire a family in the future than I’ve met child age bearing women who actually want to start a family.</p>

<p>Anyhow, aside from a few stereotypes and generalizations you’re not wrong. There’s very little incentive to start a family and the systems that control us absolutely are designed to make reproduction difficult and unsustainable. Meanwhile the Boomers themselves can’t even handle their own aging let alone the idea of their precious children they’ve robbed of a future of ever growing up.</p>

<p>In the end though even the Boomers are victims of the powers that be. We’ve all been subjected to brainwashing and social engineering.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every parent I know plays video games and enjoys cartoons or whatever you describe, it&#39;s not some growth-stunting thing, it&#39;s just what they like to do, often with their kids.</p>

<p>And complaining about how this generation has it easy and is lazy and doesn&#39;t have the same work ethos is something that has always been a thing also. </p>

<p>What is relatively new is the high difficulty to buy a house or get through college without accumulating debt or get a job that isn&#39;t shitty. What you are perceiving as perpetual adolescence is just a generation midway through the end in terms of the American dream. </p>

<p>The people should be able to keep their own. We can create our own social safety nets without being coerced into giving up our earnings with the <em>hope</em>, not guarantee, that we&#39;ll get it back one day. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>While I understand your sentiment, I disagree with your attitude. I believe it was Mark Twain who said &quot;As I grew I put away childish things such as feeling a need not to appear childish&quot;</p>

<p>The mark of adolescence has long been an &quot;edgy&quot; effort to appear old through appeals to sex and violence. Think 1990s comic books.</p>

<p>Cartoons, like many other forms of media, are not inherently juvenile or mature. It depends upon the content of the individual piece. </p>

<p>This reminds me of the inherent flaw in Fahrenheit 451s notion that the idiot box rots your brain unlike good books.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather take a National Geographic documentary to 50 shades of grey, for intellectually stimulating content.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe they&#39;re the smart ones. I&#39;ve been in the rat race long enough to know that it is awful. Wake up at the crack of dawn to do a job you can&#39;t stand (most of us would rather be doing something else), spend 1/3 of your day at it, then spend another 1/3 sleeping, and the last 1/3 catching up on chores while barely having time to pursue hobbies and interests. No time to think. Imagine what the world would be like if we all had time to think, create, and innovate?</p>

<p>Then they keep pushing back the retirement age, so we&#39;re now slaving away into our 60s. By the time we retire, we&#39;ll be too old and tired to do anything. </p>

<p>There has got to be a better way than what we&#39;re doing now. Until everyone realizes that, we&#39;ll be stuck doing the same old, same old. </p>

<p>Aging is an illusion if you eat a sandwitch every day and coffee every  day you&#39;ll age way faster than someone who eats fruits and vegetables every day instead.</p>

<p>I needed my sand witches when I was in high school to numb my brain out. You guys need to research health better idk how these conversations even go on here.
