       I think it proves Pizzagate was a red herring. All the research into Pizzagate and you won't see any threads about Harvey in conspiracy until the incident. Go ahead and search. Not only has it failed to predict this sexual assault case it fails to predict any. You've got research focused on supposed perpetrators and no victim has ever been identified.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, plenty of sexual assault cases have risen. Besides Harvey we have O'Riley, Ailes, Bolling, and more. Pedogate and Sexual Harrassments among the rich and powerful are ripe. But using pizza slang as code words have led us nowhere.

       This is such a bad post dude. No offense. No, the allegations that have been raised against Weinstein do
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       prove Pizzagate is real. You know that. However, the fall of Hollywood might lead to the fall of Washington, if these pedo scandals get out. As many have said, Washington is Hollywood for ugly people. If this were to happen, it would prove Pizzagate is real; the idea that there is a pedophile ring in the nation's capital, which isn't too far-fetched.

       I don't really see the Pizzagate connection here.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, just go to r/movies r/television or r/videoes. There a lots of videos of celebrities who came forward about Weinstein, but nobody believed them. Now they do.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wonder, is there anyone really prominent and occupying an high office with similar allegations - and would the other half of the country even care?

       Pizzagate was only about the child sex trafficking around the pizza parlor. However, Weinstein is a movie director or something? I’m not quite sure what he does but he is certainly affiliated with Hollywood so I don’t think it proves that pizza gate is real (although I do believe it is) but I do think it exposes Hollywood as a whole.

       It was called pizzagate because of the
       <em>
        supposed
       </em>
       code language found throughout many of the Podesta emails that were leaked by WikiLeaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comet Ping Pong, the pizza place you are referring to, was linked with all of it at some point but it was not random. Internet sleuths found a connection between DC elites and the pizza place, which happened to be the owner, James Alefantis. Alefantis was the former boyfriend of David Brock, and was named one of fifty most powerful people in DC. Some of the things that were discovered which made Comet Ping Pong a major point of focus were musical acts that made disturbing references as well as an Instagram account which had disturbing pictures of children (with captions just as bad).

       I’ve been researching and watching videos on Pizzagate for a long time now. That may seem like bullshit since I didn’t seem to know where it originated but I do. I misspoke, sorry. Ive read the emails with all the code language and the “handkerchief” code. I’ve seen the Instagram photos and it’s sick. I know just about everything there is to know about Pizzagate. However, back to my original point... I don’t think Weinstein has any sort of direct connection to Pizzagate but I do certainly think he has a lot to do with child trafficking in Hollywood just as every other elite and well known Zionist.

        This code language referred to "pizza" and other foods which is actually verified pedo code language. The term "cheese pizza" has been around for a while.

      <p>
       I always see around Pizzagate how it's "verified". How is it verified. Frankly from someone outside it looks like someone just replaced pizza slang with pedophilia and used that to make connections. Most normal people love pizza, and while I'm not a fan I've met many who like the plain cheese.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it's go a long way if someone clearly demonstated how it's verified, hopefully by some concrete sources like past pedophilia rather than a 4chan anon.

       It just seems like the basic foundations for a theory should be well documented. At least understand it seems suspicious that the rest of us not on the dark web need to blindly accept it's been verified by an unknown source somewhere in the dark web.

       I don't care if it's official or not. What kind of source is it? Can you say the reason Pizzagate won't put the verification proof on the internet where people can see? You said it is documented, have you seen any of the documents for verification yourself? Have you done dark web digging yourself and encountered such code?

       Search "pizzagate terminology" on a search engine and look at the image results.
      </p>
      <p>
       The pizza terminology is not just used by pedos at this point anymore on the dark web. The broader more basic terms, ie "cheese pizza" aka "CP" (are you following why they use that term?), are used in many other dark web communities to warn people against posting such material. This terminology is even commonly used on the regular web now. I can't provide you evidence of what "walnut sauce" is code for.

       I did, I actually already tried doing my own searches for any verification I the code. I'm not looking for what words they use. I'm looking for the source evidence where pedophilia is directly tied with pizza terminology. The most I could find is c.p. was used in chat boards. Like you mentioned cheese pizza for c.p.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could not find any evidence for cheese pizza being used for that context. Specifically I'm looking for evidence of code than emails, rather than emails and a code being made to fit them. Since all of the emails are based on already using the code it isn't independant for analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       You had me intrigued by listing the code as already verified pre emails. However it seems I cannot get you to divulge who and how it was verified. Thus goodbye and have a good day/night.

       I dont know what to tell you. It's common knowledge what CP is and the reason people jumped in their seats when combing through the Podesta emails is because how well known some of the terminology is at this point. It didn't happen the other way around.
