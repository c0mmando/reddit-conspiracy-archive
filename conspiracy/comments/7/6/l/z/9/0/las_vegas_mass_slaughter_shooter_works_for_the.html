       (986.) My analysis on Stephen Paddock (10/14/2017)
      </p>
      <p>
       The gunman of Las Vegas shooting case is described as a gray-man:
No criminal record.
No political ties.
No religious affiliation.
No history of mental illness.
No history of violence
That also fits for a figure works for intelligence unit such like FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       [quote] Paddock worked for the federal government from about 1975 to 1985. He was a letter carrier for the U.S. Postal Service from 1976 to 1978. After that, he worked for six years as an Internal Revenue Service agent, until 1984. Then, he was a federal auditor for one year, in 1985, focusing on defense contractors. Towards the end of the 1980s, Paddock worked for three years as an internal auditor for a company that later merged to form Lockheed Martin.[15] His work career after this period is not entirely clear. He is known to have run a real-estate business with his brother Eric.[16]

       It's not so easy to find a job in those offices yet he jumped among them. That means he had a special background. Then he went into real estate business.
      </p>
      <p>
       FBI and DEA have no fat budget. Most operation fund comes from victim's. (see #8)
      </p>
      <p>
       [quote]8. FBI's profit
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything shows that law enforcement agent use isotope money tracing if you have cash savings at home. But how could they steal from innocent people?
      </p>
      <p>
       Later I learned from 'National Geography' (1961, June) In article " FBI: public friend number one ". ' Mr. Hoover prides upon the "profit" it shows annually. During fiscal 1960 the FBI received $113,600,000 in operating funds. Fines, savings, and recoveries of stolen property and contraband in cases investigated by the FBI amounted to $142,822,244, or $1.25 returned for every dollar invested by the taxpayer.' It's that 'profit' chase makes FBI a looter. It's that black box practise makes FBI closed and untouchable and new high tech weapons killing without trace makes them ruthless. How do you expect them be in justice while their purpose is pursuing 'profit'?[/quote]
      </p>
      <p>
       And I found the Feds made a large profit from real estates business.
      </p>
      <p>
       [quote]430. Monopoly the house in north San Jose (8/25/2006)
      </p>
      <p>
       .....
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The most important thing is that housing market becomes the best way for Feds to make a profit. They take it as a business. e.g. In my community, a 4 bedroom single family house in 1991 was about 200k. (When Feds started to buy in. The first stage) In 1997, the price went up to high 200k. (when Feds started to buy in house in large scale, the second stage) Now the price is about 600k. If they bought a house in 1991 with 20k down payment, the profit is 400k. (Or 100k after deduct 15 years housing cost if the house haven't been rent off.)[/quote]
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Stephen Paddock might then worked for the Feds as  their housing business team member. News said he gambles big in casino. Because the money came too easy and it's not his? He probably lost his life as a scapegoat for this reason.

       The REAL Katsung47 predicted Sandy Hook exactly a year almost to the date BEFORE it happened. He also predicted other events accurately too if I remember correctly.

       Look at real estate in both shootings, right? All those houses that sold for some weird amount next in the same neighborhood as the shooters moms neighborhood. Like a pod of homes all sold for something low in or near December 25 or 24?

       Now this is interesting and makes more sense than the official narrative. I'm eager to know more. I know my imagination gets the best of me, but I don't really have to imagine much when the government has shown what it is capable of doing time and time again.

       Who is Paddock? what is your conclusive proof that he is "the killer" or even was there at all?
      </p>
      <p>
       We have literally NOTHING that links "Paddock" to the 32nd floor. All is hearsay from the FBI and police, served by a lying press.

       This is by far the best narrative I've read about the shooter. Everyone should be questioning his employment with Lockheed Martin. If you read just a bit about their company you can find that they use mind control on employees and can program people to do things while erasing all memories of "Why" they are doing it. The MSM's consistent narrative that after his employment with Lockheed he went off the radar in 1987 I believe. They also insinuate that he was a professional gambler playing video Poker. I've worked in table games in the casino industry and this is asinine to me. Video Poker is comparable to slot machines that consists of no talent or intelligence to play unlike a real Poker game. The amount of money laundering that goes on in a large casino is absurd. The casinos turn a blind eye to this if a player is considered a high roller. The news also mentions that Paddock was spending anywhere from $10,000-$30,000 a day gambling but were unaware of his win/loss. I guarantee you that any casino he regularly played at could give a detailed rundown on how much money he is in and what he's winning or losing. That was part of my job description as a floor manager. Tracking the buy-ins and win/loss of players. 
Another insane piece to the puzzle is the security and survelience of Mandaly Bay. Every sq.ft. of any casino is on film and recorded. How did he get 20+ guns into his room without one person taking notice? While I'm sitting box on a craps game I'd have survelience call down for hawking "watching in wrong direction" the dice. 
One last common sense question to the alleged pictures of the room where Paddock was. It looks as though he unloaded a full clip and threw guns all over the room. Who does that? That makes NO sense at all...the guns laying all over the room like they showed. I could go on and on about the absolute crazy inconsistencies in this case. I believe we will never get a clear reasonable answer for this tradegy unfortunatly.
