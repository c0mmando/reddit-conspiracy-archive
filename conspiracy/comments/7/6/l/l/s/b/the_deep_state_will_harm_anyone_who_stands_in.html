       Hold on. The deep state is defined as unelected people working in and around government. You think that those people do not exist? Do you believe there is absolutely no one anywhere working in and around government who are unelected? So the media that tells us about the government, they were all elected? Government officials working in offices, they were all elected? Agents of the "intelligence community", literal spies, they were all elected?

       All states have survival as their highest priority.  That's just a core requirement of the nation-state system and we are stuck with it as long as there are nation states.
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Most theories see the nation state as a 19th-century European phenomenon
       </em>
       --Wikipedia
      </p>
      <p>
       We may disagree on the best way for the state to survive (I think we spend too much on the military and foreign intrigues and not enough on prosperity and a stable democracy for example).  But the hawks have been ascendant the last few generations and I'm as much out in the cold as you are.  But I still think my nation/state are worth fighting for and worth trying to steer in the direction of more justice, not less.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are roaming free because they were working for survival of the state, or at least they convinced enough members of it that they were.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yeah.  If you want justice, as you seem to be implying, you aren't going to get it from the state.

       Any notion of valuing American lives was dismissed during the Revolutionary war, confirmed with the Civil war, then just repeated with all the other wars.. It's also dismissed via the pharmaceutical, agricultural, chemical and media industries, further insulted by our exposure to sprayed toxins, vaccines, heavy metals and radiation through various means.

       Just because we're not being bombed like Aleppo doesn't mean they hate us any less.
