        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve noticed in science and the media there is this new push for the use of psychedelics like shrooms and LSD.  I see they have studies which show the positive effects LSD has on people with depression.  I just saw the latest episode of Broad City on Comedy Central where the two main characters trip on shrooms the whole episode.  It had me thinking of the past CIA use of LSD in mind control.  They would have you believe that they had no success in this arena but there are people who say this is another lie.  What if the people who still are PRODUCING the LSD are STILL the government?  Not that farfetched is it?  What if they refined their formula to make it better this time.  To make these people susceptible to suggestions in media or their environment.  Or that the drugs open their minds in ways that people never wanted or expected?  It&#39;s just a thought.  Not farfetched if you realize they are complicit in the ongoing drug running into America, from heroin to meth they have a hand in getting it here to use to fund their black projects.  They have been doing this to the Iran Contra Scandal.  What do you guys think?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you ever tried LSD or shrooms? </p>

<p>It&#39;s probably the last thing TPTB want people to do. 
I&#39;ve had amazing experiences several times on psychedelics. It&#39;s an eye opener, not only while your tripping, but mostly after. It&#39;s almost as if it unlocks ideas or a new point of view in your mind. 
I&#39;m not being cynical when I say basically everything is bullshit. Once you see what is all around you, that there is much all around you, almost nothing else really matters. </p>

<p>Be warned; it could lead to depression. Once you realize your position in this existence, you could really feel hopeless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, psilocybin is amazing for depression. It’s not like they’re put into a pure white room with nothing lol they need to measure stimuli in different parts of the brain so they’ll be doing activities or meditation in calm and quiet areas.

    <div class="md"><p>I see where you&#39;re coming from. I do know that around ten years ago, there was another chemical sold as acid quite often that lasted around twice as long. Can&#39;t think of the name for sure, but I wanna say DLC? Hopefully someone can help me out there. It could definitely be a way to make more people open to something like Project Bluebeam.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it could be white hats (or lab coats) that are actually breaking through the narrative that psychedelics are inherently bad, and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve seen marijuana reform and talk of MDMA and Psilocybin having positive mental health aspects. </p>

<p>Honestly I think psychedelics have too much variation from individual to individual to be used as a control. Great post.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Erm; if the public would all start taking psychedelics there&#39;ll be only one result = peaceful protest and change. lol To suggest this is just silly.. If anything, pharma has been trying to keep it suppressed for far too long. You have been conditioned to perceive em as drugs though. You can&#39;t compare psychedelics with amphetamines and opiates. Look into what happened with the soldiers they tested LSD on; <a href="https://youtu.be/n-rWnQphPdQ">https://youtu.be/n-rWnQphPdQ</a> ...

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s why I&#39;m suggesting they changed the formulation.  The scientists are openly suggesting depressed people should be given the drug.  Bad trips can wreck havoc on a already hurt mind.  Someone already said it leaves them depressed when the realize how insignificant they are.  What if the LSD the scientists that are giving people the LSD are using a different kind than what other people have used.  They only publicise the &quot;good trips&quot;  you only hear about bad trips from people who have tried it themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s either LSD or it ain&#39;t; it&#39;s a specific molecule. There&#39;s no changing it; soon as you change the structure it&#39;s something else. There&#39;s quite a few tryptamines.. Seriously, why do you have so little faith in science? Be happy that they&#39;re testing this stuff... This can be a game changer for mental health. From experience, even a bad trip is a good trip. lol These things allow you to look at yourself and everything around you without your Ego getting involved. There&#39;s no pain, just a safe zone where you can be confronted with the truth/trauma. Allows you to process traumas; no years of therapy; no years of medications that have all kinda side effects. Leaves you feeling inspired, creative; a better understanding of language, the world, universe.. lol it changes people for the better. Expecially if it&#39;s with trained professionals that understand how these things work.. Same thing like XTC, studies show it was more effective in treating alcoholism than regular therapy. Now don&#39;t go poppin&#39; X; it can cause lesions. With excessive use ofcourse. However; years after the tests people were still sober, a single session/dose. If you drink more than 3 beers in a single night you actually damage your bones; did you know that? Too much of anything has side effects, even water overdose is possible. Anti depression meds can make you wanna kill yourself.. Doesn&#39;t mean they aren&#39;t useful tho.. Anyway..  These things ain&#39;t party drugs. They are tools. Though I agree; it&#39;s not for everyone. :) It&#39;s not without reason that in shaman cultures often the shaman would be the one taking the substance; patient takes nothing. Other patients do get a dose.. These things arent hard to assess. Much like our doctors talk with you and make a diagnoses and prescribe you whatever. They&#39;re medicine men, different culture, different medicine; but they know their stuff. Keeping in mind placebo effect, it doesnt matter who took the trip... . Some ego&#39;s wouldn&#39;t be able to handle it....  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lol so you think scientists are publishing fraudulent work? Dude, you&#39;re tripping. lol See; that&#39;s what a conditioned mind would say. Personally, i call it unwarranted paranoia brought on by the constant bombardment of information we have to endure in this day an age ;) Don&#39;t fear science; it coulda saved America.. but alas... The only reason they ever &#39;went to space&#39; was to beat the russians. No noble cause; nothing more but propaganda... America has always spend shit ton more money on it&#39;s military than it does on science/innovation; they&#39;ll only invest in science when an actual big war is happening; which is also why the economy will once more collapse and eventually people will leave America and migrate elsewhere... I don&#39;t think the depopulation of america will be through attacking it&#39;s own people and such; they are just milking the economy for all thats possible, in a few years the banks will crash once more and Americans will start migrating elsewhere. It&#39;s already got to the point I don&#39;t think anyone still wants to move there... It&#39;s not gonna get better; the american dream is dead. :/ </p>

Then when the programs were found out it was funny we were flooded with stories about how silly it was and nothing worked.  Smells fishy to me.  I’m not saying LSD ALONE is doing it.  Im saying some other formulation of it, maybe a version that causes more psychosis after some period of time.  Also that there is some other influence that fucks with these people minds.  Not just street LSD alone.  Why is no one getting that this is lab created    LSD that I’m talking about.  I’m implying this is a different version.

<p>But just like xanax or paracetamol, you won&#39;t know for sure that what you bought is what you paid for unless you test it or make it yourself.

    <div class="md"><p>As I mentioned in another reply you should be more concerned with mind control properties of scopolamine rather than LSD and mushrooms. </p>

<p>Do you really think that people have been drinking ayahuasca and taking magic mushrooms for thousands of years for the sake of mind control? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like you’ve never tried L, or any of the other substances you’ve referenced in your post. They are capable of producing powerful effects on perception and thought, but “mind control” sounds a little far-fetched, IMO. </p>

<p>I enjoy a good trip now and then, and I find these experiences to be an excellent tool to help me get to a good place cognitively. I feel these experiences have made me personally a more empathetic and a less ego-driven individual. It has also helped me recognize and let go of my insecurities to a degree. I’m not saying everyone should go out and drop acid everyday, but it is a powerful cognitive tool that can be utilized for self betterment. </p>

<p>If you’re curious how those government tests worked out, look into Robert Hunter or Ken Kesey. Both are documented participants in the CIA’s acid tests in the late 1950s. Both became strong advocates of the counter-culture of the late 1960s. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used dmt because I read it could combat depression. The information had come from several MSM reports. Idk, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised about anything.</p>

<p>I do think there is a concerted by MSM and likely the government to seduce young people into opiate use. Heroin is the real problem today and addiction and death from use is so prevalent that it has lowered the life expectency rates. I wouldn&#39;t touch the stuff rather heroin or pills but for some reason, young people (and older people) have a weirdly glamorized view of it. Use is not limited to lower social classes or any particular race. One stat I repeatedly see is how widespread use among middle to upper middle class teens. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sounds like OP needs to try LSD or shrooms to get this. Psychedelics open the mind to broader possibilities, and countless &#39;what if&#39; moments. Tptb def don&#39;t want the masses using psychedelics as they&#39;ll wake up big time. There are no bad trips... just difficult but often productive ones. Remember the hippies etc wanting to create an alternative society in the 60s? Tptb are afraid of another movement catching on like that. </p>
