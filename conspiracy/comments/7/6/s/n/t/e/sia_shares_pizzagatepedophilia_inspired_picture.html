<p>Am I the only one seeing pizza&#39;s everywhere? And isn&#39;t that triangle with other triangles inside a pedophilia symbol?</p>

<p>Here were it gets even more weird. This was the first bunch of pictures. Here&#39;s the second one:</p>

<p><a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DMMu4O6VAAAOjG4.jpg">https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DMMu4O6VAAAOjG4.jpg</a></p>

<p>The girl pictured here is Maddie Zieglar, Sia&#39;s permanent dancer(Chandelier music video e.t.c). Do you wonder how old Maddie is? 15. YES, FIFTEEN. </p>

<p>All these was to announce Sia&#39;s Christmas Album. </p>

<p>Am I the only one seeing the connection? </p>

<p>Holy fucking shit you went and did it again, now you&#39;re insinuating that because you don&#39;t see TWO sexualized dancers, that I&#39;m a bad person or that I support pedophilia.

<p>Yes you did, insinuating that I thought all triangles mean pedophile, you fucking dumbass. You just proved me right, and saying I&#39;m in the minority doesn&#39;t help you out at all. You can&#39;t say because other people disagree with me too that means I&#39;m wrong. God you&#39;re so unintelligent and you don&#39;t even know how to offer your opinion without personal attacks on people. You&#39;re a fucking troll, try to do that shit in the real world and you&#39;ll get stomped on, and you won&#39;t have a wall of the internet to provide you anonymity. Attacking people and consistently strawmanning their argument is a great way to get people to despise you and not respect your point of view.</p>

<p>I&#39;m usually pretty uptight about this stuff, but I don&#39;t think you can point at Sia as some deviant. Just doesn&#39;t fit her motif imo. </p>

<p>I&#39;m all for being vigilant on Pizzagate but we gotta be careful not to get too trigger happy as well. I&#39;m not sure what the point would be anyhow if it were symbols being hidden....</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i&#39;m just saying you realize that is standard etiquette in dance tho, right? In fact, in most dance halls you HAVE to wear leotards like that during practice and performance (which is a different issue), but I think you&#39;re maybe attributing a bit more than you mean to towards the wardrobe.</p>

<p>and again, I want to say that I do understand what you&#39;re saying too, but at some point we&#39;re also just dwelling in shame. There is nothing wrong with the human body. I think you are projecting some of that sexualization in that they are trying to be &#39;sexy&#39;, but you are interpreting it as that because its making you think that way. </p>

<p>I agree it might be some coded thing, but I don&#39;t see the connection. I think it&#39;s supposed to be artsy wrapping paper designs as if they are hand-drawn. The polka dots remind you of pepperoni because it&#39;s red (also a christmas color). I think this one is pretty innocent, and that&#39;s just my opinion. I definitely believe &#39;they&#39; put pizza imagery out there tho. If this were Katy Perry instead of Sia, i&#39;d be way deeper down the rabbit hole with you.</p>

<p>Frankly, throughout the video it seems like the child is the one abusing the adult more than the other way around. Considering the song lyrics, I think this has more to do with the song in question than pedophilia or pizzagate.</p>

<p>No, a <a href="http://www.whale.to/c/PedoSymbols.jpg">triangular spiral (probably a better name for it)</a> is the symbol you&#39;re thinking of. </p>
