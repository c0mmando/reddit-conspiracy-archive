       Singer, Sia, has posted the following picture on her twitter account:

       Am I the only one seeing pizza's everywhere? And isn't that triangle with other triangles inside a pedophilia symbol?
      </p>
      <p>
       Here were it gets even more weird. This was the first bunch of pictures. Here's the second one:

      </p>
      <p>
       The girl pictured here is Maddie Zieglar, Sia's permanent dancer(Chandelier music video e.t.c). Do you wonder how old Maddie is? 15. YES, FIFTEEN.
      </p>
      <p>
       All these was to announce Sia's Christmas Album.

       Am I the only one seeing the connection?

       'in america we have the holiday season". Most people who celebrate the holidays (christmas and thanksgiving) wrap gifts in wrapping paper. this is what you're viewing, you are retarded. If anything Sia supports pedophilia. Look at her video with Shia Labeouf

       I completely see what you're talking about. The reason I also think it's suspicious is because the triangle symbol only appears once on the entire picture. Why would it be there? It's not a part of the "pattern" of the picture. The girl is also really sexualized in the music videos she's in.

       Complete strawman of the entire Pizzagate story and the pedo symbols. Good job misrepresenting my argument! Why does the triangles pictured appear in only one part of the pattern? I'm not saying the Pizza is trying to be porn or anything, but it's odd to me that the triangles were only used once.

       I think you missed the part where I said this was "suspicious", not fucking evidence of Pizzagate. It looks like the boy love symbol to me, or a very similar interpretation of it.

       No, sorry, it isn't actually. You're still strawmanning my view. I'm suspicious of things that are out of place. The symbol looks familiar, and she is a really sexualized underage character as seen in several music videos.

       Jesus christ man you literally keep on strawmanning my points. Stop that shit, you can't assault me with 'what ifs' to make a point. I'm not saying it's pedophilia, I'm saying it's pretty damn fucking suspicious to me that they use a similar child love symbol, only once, and coincidentally the dancer is super sexualized AND underage.

       You're strawmanning my arguments by using a completely irrelevant video and dancer to misrepresent the point I'm making. That video has no relevance, and it clearly indicates you're portraying my argument as "all child dancers are sex symbols". They aren't and that's not what I'm saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Holy fucking shit you went and did it again, now you're insinuating that because you don't see TWO sexualized dancers, that I'm a bad person or that I support pedophilia. You're a fucking asshole, dude. And it's several triangles inside of one another, which is very similar to the child love symbol, you can't argue that much.

       I'm saying you're seeing shit that isn't there. You see the girl in the video portrayed as a sexual being, and you see pedo coding in wrapping paper. That's not a straw man, it's literally what you're saying.

       You don't know what a straw man is dude. Next time you debate someone please try to refrain from completely misrepresenting who you're talking to by insinuating they're a bad person, a pedophile, or saying I think all child dancers are sex symbols. Try to instead offer your point of view, and not twist my words. The symbol looks similar to ME. I really don't give a fuck what it looks like to you. Why don't you, instead of attacking me personally, offer your OPINION about the subject in a rational manner. Without strawmanning my ideas or what I'm trying to say.

       Yes you did, insinuating that I thought all triangles mean pedophile, you fucking dumbass. You just proved me right, and saying I'm in the minority doesn't help you out at all. You can't say because other people disagree with me too that means I'm wrong. God you're so unintelligent and you don't even know how to offer your opinion without personal attacks on people. You're a fucking troll, try to do that shit in the real world and you'll get stomped on, and you won't have a wall of the internet to provide you anonymity. Attacking people and consistently strawmanning their argument is a great way to get people to despise you and not respect your point of view.

       How is she sexualized in her videos? Because she's wearing a leotard and dancing?

       I'm usually pretty uptight about this stuff, but I don't think you can point at Sia as some deviant. Just doesn't fit her motif imo.

       I'm all for being vigilant on Pizzagate but we gotta be careful not to get too trigger happy as well. I'm not sure what the point would be anyhow if it were symbols being hidden....

       Yeah actually, that's exactly why I think it's sexualized. I'm not saying this is Pizzagate proof or even evidence, I just think it's odd the triangles only appear in one section, it isn't part of the pattern at all.

       She's a dancer... they often wear tight clothing, it isn't inherently sexual any more than the clothing of a gymnast or swimmer. Even if she was naked it wouldn't be sexual. Unless she's twerking while making fuck-me-eyes at the camera, you are perverting something innocent.

       i'm just saying you realize that is standard etiquette in dance tho, right? In fact, in most dance halls you HAVE to wear leotards like that during practice and performance (which is a different issue), but I think you're maybe attributing a bit more than you mean to towards the wardrobe.
      </p>
      <p>
       and again, I want to say that I do understand what you're saying too, but at some point we're also just dwelling in shame. There is nothing wrong with the human body. I think you are projecting some of that sexualization in that they are trying to be 'sexy', but you are interpreting it as that because its making you think that way.
      </p>

       <p>
        I'm not saying this is Pizzagate proof or even evidence, I just think it's odd the triangles only appear in one section, it isn't part of the pattern at all.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I agree it might be some coded thing, but I don't see the connection. I think it's supposed to be artsy wrapping paper designs as if they are hand-drawn. The polka dots remind you of pepperoni because it's red (also a christmas color). I think this one is pretty innocent, and that's just my opinion. I definitely believe 'they' put pizza imagery out there tho. If this were Katy Perry instead of Sia, i'd be way deeper down the rabbit hole with you.

       looks super odd to me. I'm not saying the leotards themselves are proof of pedophilia or some kind of sexualized behaviors, I'm saying that the actual things they do in the video look off to me.

       I just watched it and I don't quite understand what you mean... It doesn't seem to have some message rooted in pizzagate or pedophilia. Is Sia unique in her aesthetic and how she presents her art? Absolutely. But if you're saying a dance like the one in the video is not allowed, what does that say for artistic expression?

       Frankly, throughout the video it seems like the child is the one abusing the adult more than the other way around. Considering the song lyrics, I think this has more to do with the song in question than pedophilia or pizzagate.

       I'm not saying it isn't allowed, or that it's definitely connected to Pizzagate, but in my opinion the symbol is weird, and her music videos are weird. Just my opinion though.

       I think you're really grasping at nothing here, but maybe Sia will sneak in some pizzagate related lyrics in the christmas album. By maybe I mean that I want to say there is no chance it'll happen but I mean technically it could.

       Either Sia is one of the MK Ultra abusers or she's trying to normalize MK Ultra style abuse. There are better ways to raise awareness about these issues than to have an underage girl dance in videos wearing a beige leotard. She could easily hire older girls who look younger and be more creative. She's literally producing CP and getting away with it.
