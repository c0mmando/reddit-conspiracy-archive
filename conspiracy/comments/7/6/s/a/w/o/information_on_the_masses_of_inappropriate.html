       It was suggested that I post this here as a separate post instead of commenting on existing ones. Please note I put this together in a hurry and am in the process of writing something far bigger with a lot more information (and be assured I will continue to post it until something is done about it). I've edited it slightly to sort out my wording:
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out this channel called 'Investigating YouTube' - this channel goes into a bit of depth about the problem:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHBWN1CtqAgnKgN6xIJBFPg/videos">
        https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHBWN1CtqAgnKgN6xIJBFPg/videos
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's an article I found interesting which looks at the potential company (or one of) behind this:
       <a href="https://medium.com/@BryonAdams5/elsagate-the-distribution-studio-of-a-known-comedian-edb4da776c5c">
        https://medium.com/@BryonAdams5/elsagate-the-distribution-studio-of-a-known-comedian-edb4da776c5c
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Want something that's even more interesting? Do you remember the 'Leeeeroy Jenkins' video that surfaced years ago? Here's the channel that posted it (if you go to videos and sort by most popular, you can see it's still there) - it suddenly started posting similar videos:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pj007101/videos">
        https://www.youtube.com/user/pj007101/videos
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look at this video:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFPWME-Iz1Q">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFPWME-Iz1Q
       </a>
       - this guy you see at the start owns the channel and before he started doing these weird ass videos, he owns a lawn care company and he used to do vlogs. Anyway, look at the first 15 seconds or so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now look at this one:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ial9ay8e6Hw">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ial9ay8e6Hw
       </a>
       - same theme, weird ass titles and replies. What I found particularly strange is on this video, each person has bags under their eyes - they look to me as though they've been forced to do this or something else that's equally as sinister. Check out this one too:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyjGuoszto">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyjGuoszto
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out another interesting Medium post by the author linked above:
       <a href="https://medium.com/@BryonAdams5/the-disappearance-of-anne-faber-and-the-mysterious-tweet-of-9-3x09-ec7c58b163e5">

      </p>
      <p>
       Let me know if you want more. I stayed up 36 hours researching this fucked up stuff and there's definitely something bigger than just money involved. I've fallen deep into the rabbit hole and won't surface until I have enough information to write up something solid, with less speculation and more facts. Apologies for the scattered layout, I've got a few pages written up in Word and a bunch of bookmarks. Structured post to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
       NOTE: I do not want this to be forgotten. This needs to be posted every day and hit the front page - I feel as though the more parents who are aware of this, the better.

       This is one of those ones where you see the videos and wonder how they haven't been stopped yet. There's nothing to assume or read into, no leap of faith necessary to believe. The videos exist and are easy to find.
      </p>
      <p>
       I felt the same way in regards to the Alefantis instagram page, but that whole thing was railroaded by Pizzagate.  I refuse to believe it's acceptable to tape a toddler to a table with stacks of money nearby, in any context. It's wrong no matter how you justify it, especially when you refer to the child as a "chicken." There's absolutely something horrific going on there, but it's been so twisted that the current "investigation" is unrecognizable in relation to how it began. The water has become so muddy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Elsagate however, seems like something that still has the potential to be taken down.

       First off, welcome then! This place is a ton of fun, but most of the users are fake/ financially motivated/ deliberate misinformation. Hang around for some out of the box interpretations of what you see on the news. Most of the content is bogus, I tend to avoid most YouTube "researchers," but occasionally you'll find absolute gold; unique critical thinking. Don't let the garbage take away from the good ones.
      </p>
      <p>
       I digress...
      </p>
      <p>
       There were pictures of a female toddler, taped by the wrists to a table next to stacks of Euro bills. The caption was something about the "little chicken." The instagram was 59 different types of "what the fuck?!" but unfortunately the fervor of the grassroots investigation was overtaken by the hype surrounding the story, and was exceptionally vulnerable to misinformation. This led to a more fantastical depiction of a very real and very disturbing (what appears to be a human trafficking ring).
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure some users here have his instagram archived. It was truly disturbing, and I mean that in the most literal way, devoid of any hyperbole or dramaticism. Do I believe they're satanic cannibals like the hijacked investigation made them out to be? No. But I do think there is a definite connection to human trafficking.

       Seriously this! My first dive into making a conspiracy video about sandy hook I had the worse paranoia. I stayed up hours making it and had 2 Starbucks drinks. I literally thought someone was going to come and get me that night.  I deleted the video I had worked hours on and went to bed. The next morning I was pissed I had deleted the video.

       I know this sounds ridiculous but it’s honestly embarrassingly terrifying  once you realize how fragile your mind can be.

       So I’ve been watching some of these videos. I sat and watched as much as I could through 3 videos. I wouldn’t say they are wildly inappropriate, but they make me uncomfortable and it’s just weird content to begin with. I’m seeing a ton of the same type of videos and they all have a huge amount of views. Are people really watching these videos? Are kids sitting here and watching these videos? They are so boring and idk I just can’t seem to see where the “following” is coming from. Really weird stuff though

       Some of the comments on youtube itself tells me their kids/brothers/sisters watch it en then get mad faster and want to play weird games. This makes me so oncumfortabele

       Very good research! Many of us have also found the same patterns you did, good job.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your hard work, it can be really tough sifting through this stuff. I want you to know that many people appreciate you doing this. There are many lurkers, and anons that will never comment, and never login. Thank you for your work.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope it inspires more people like you to step up and do the same. Good job.

       That Anne Faber story is crazy as shit. Those YT channels are still up last I checked. They're pretty disturbing.
