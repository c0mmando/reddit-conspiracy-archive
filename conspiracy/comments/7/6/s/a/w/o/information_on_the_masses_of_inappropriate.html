        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It was suggested that I post this here as a separate post instead of commenting on existing ones. Please note I put this together in a hurry and am in the process of writing something far bigger with a lot more information (and be assured I will continue to post it until something is done about it). I&#39;ve edited it slightly to sort out my wording:</p>

<p>Check out this channel called &#39;Investigating YouTube&#39; - this channel goes into a bit of depth about the problem: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHBWN1CtqAgnKgN6xIJBFPg/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHBWN1CtqAgnKgN6xIJBFPg/videos</a></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an article I found interesting which looks at the potential company (or one of) behind this: <a href="https://medium.com/@BryonAdams5/elsagate-the-distribution-studio-of-a-known-comedian-edb4da776c5c">https://medium.com/@BryonAdams5/elsagate-the-distribution-studio-of-a-known-comedian-edb4da776c5c</a></p>

<p>Want something that&#39;s even more interesting? Do you remember the &#39;Leeeeroy Jenkins&#39; video that surfaced years ago? Here&#39;s the channel that posted it (if you go to videos and sort by most popular, you can see it&#39;s still there) - it suddenly started posting similar videos: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pj007101/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/pj007101/videos</a></p>

<p>Take a look at this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFPWME-Iz1Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFPWME-Iz1Q</a> - this guy you see at the start owns the channel and before he started doing these weird ass videos, he owns a lawn care company and he used to do vlogs. Anyway, look at the first 15 seconds or so.</p>

<p>Now look at this one: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ial9ay8e6Hw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ial9ay8e6Hw</a> - same theme, weird ass titles and replies. What I found particularly strange is on this video, each person has bags under their eyes - they look to me as though they&#39;ve been forced to do this or something else that&#39;s equally as sinister. Check out this one too: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyjGuoszto">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okyjGuoszto</a></p>

<p>Check out another interesting Medium post by the author linked above: <a href="https://medium.com/@BryonAdams5/the-disappearance-of-anne-faber-and-the-mysterious-tweet-of-9-3x09-ec7c58b163e5">https://medium.com/@BryonAdams5/the-disappearance-of-anne-faber-and-the-mysterious-tweet-of-9-3x09-ec7c58b163e5</a></p>

<p>Let me know if you want more. I stayed up 36 hours researching this fucked up stuff and there&#39;s definitely something bigger than just money involved. I&#39;ve fallen deep into the rabbit hole and won&#39;t surface until I have enough information to write up something solid, with less speculation and more facts. Apologies for the scattered layout, I&#39;ve got a few pages written up in Word and a bunch of bookmarks. Structured post to follow.</p>

<p>NOTE: I do not want this to be forgotten. This needs to be posted every day and hit the front page - I feel as though the more parents who are aware of this, the better. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is one of those ones where you see the videos and wonder how they haven&#39;t been stopped yet. There&#39;s nothing to assume or read into, no leap of faith necessary to believe. The videos exist and are easy to find. </p>

<p>I felt the same way in regards to the Alefantis instagram page, but that whole thing was railroaded by Pizzagate.  I refuse to believe it&#39;s acceptable to tape a toddler to a table with stacks of money nearby, in any context. It&#39;s wrong no matter how you justify it, especially when you refer to the child as a &quot;chicken.&quot; There&#39;s absolutely something horrific going on there, but it&#39;s been so twisted that the current &quot;investigation&quot; is unrecognizable in relation to how it began. The water has become so muddy.</p>

<p>Elsagate however, seems like something that still has the potential to be taken down. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First off, welcome then! This place is a ton of fun, but most of the users are fake/ financially motivated/ deliberate misinformation. Hang around for some out of the box interpretations of what you see on the news. Most of the content is bogus, I tend to avoid most YouTube &quot;researchers,&quot; but occasionally you&#39;ll find absolute gold; unique critical thinking. Don&#39;t let the garbage take away from the good ones.</p>

<p>I digress...</p>

<p>There were pictures of a female toddler, taped by the wrists to a table next to stacks of Euro bills. The caption was something about the &quot;little chicken.&quot; The instagram was 59 different types of &quot;what the fuck?!&quot; but unfortunately the fervor of the grassroots investigation was overtaken by the hype surrounding the story, and was exceptionally vulnerable to misinformation. This led to a more fantastical depiction of a very real and very disturbing (what appears to be a human trafficking ring). </p>

<p>I&#39;m sure some users here have his instagram archived. It was truly disturbing, and I mean that in the most literal way, devoid of any hyperbole or dramaticism. Do I believe they&#39;re satanic cannibals like the hijacked investigation made them out to be? No. But I do think there is a definite connection to human trafficking. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Seriously this! My first dive into making a conspiracy video about sandy hook I had the worse paranoia. I stayed up hours making it and had 2 Starbucks drinks. I literally thought someone was going to come and get me that night.  I deleted the video I had worked hours on and went to bed. The next morning I was pissed I had deleted the video.</p>

<p>I know this sounds ridiculous but it’s honestly embarrassingly terrifying  once you realize how fragile your mind can be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>So I’ve been watching some of these videos. I sat and watched as much as I could through 3 videos. I wouldn’t say they are wildly inappropriate, but they make me uncomfortable and it’s just weird content to begin with. I’m seeing a ton of the same type of videos and they all have a huge amount of views. Are people really watching these videos? Are kids sitting here and watching these videos? They are so boring and idk I just can’t seem to see where the “following” is coming from. Really weird stuff though</p>

<p>Thank you for your hard work, it can be really tough sifting through this stuff. I want you to know that many people appreciate you doing this. There are many lurkers, and anons that will never comment, and never login. Thank you for your work.</p>

<p>I hope it inspires more people like you to step up and do the same. Good job.</p>
