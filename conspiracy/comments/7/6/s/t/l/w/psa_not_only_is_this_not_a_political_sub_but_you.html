       Even in numbers, coming to the defense of party politics only indicates how much you still have to learn. So let's maintain a respectful environment to do so in.
      </p>
      <p>
       But, let's also be clear. You're a sucker if you think people in power who watch the world burn are decent human beings. Yes this includes the current POTUS.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was once a sucker too, likely most of us were. But then we learned. We stopped believing and started researching.
      </p>
      <p>
       So if you're here to do so, welcome! If you're here just to upvote support for powerful people, hopefully you learn something by accident!
      </p>
      <p>
       Any replies here that assume a Blue vs. Red mentality will be interpreted as public cries for further information.
      </p>
      <p>
       *As some people have noted, this is written quite smugly and I regret writing it while I was frustrated. Of course it's just my opinion. Everyone's welcome here and 'sucker' isn't meant to be an insult, but more of a self-reflection. We ALL have a lot to learn... myself especially.

       They are independent of one another. Parties attempt to encapsulate various ideologies that fall within the spectrums, but the inner workings of parties (corruption, bias, dishonesty, subversion) is merely a result of the people running them.

       Which is still polarization. We need to go with what works and change the solution with the issue itself as it changes, which would take ideas from several pools of thought. Not body slam it with one extreme version of an idea and market it as a group of people or a culture.

       This is what I cant get my head around.  Why are there groups for anything at all? shouldnt we just be discussing what the govt is responsible for and the best ways to accomplish what the govt is supposed to do? Why the fuck  everyone so concerened with labeling themselves as left or right, etc. is beyond me, especially in this sub!

       This is huge. People are scared and largely ignorant to who and what they are, and their place in the world. And most people are too weak to walk alone therefore they gravitate toward a side to give them some sort of meaning and feeling of belonging when really it's just the blind leading the blind.

       Sadly a lot of people trick themselves into believing
exactly this because idiots keep repeating
"DA LEFT" "DA RIGHT".
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe people fall for this still.
Back in the Antifa vs Neonazi psyop,
the corporate lying media kept
repeating "THE LEFT" "THE RIGHT" hive mind terms.
They want a reaction, they want divide and conquer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dems and Repubs are on a tiny part of the political spectrum.
Artificial confined area.
They're really just two flavors/points on
the NEOliberal far right part of the spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       To confuse things further,
the corporate media
keeps using the term
"far right" incorrectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       They use it to refer to authoritarians
rather than what it actually is....extreme right wing economics (NEOliberalism/deregulated free market economics).
      </p>
      <p>
       This is used to deflect from the establishment parties
which are ironically actually far right economically.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Hey we're not far right, THOSE nazi guys are far right!"
Now they're off the hook. lol :/

       Exactly my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parties attempt to encapsulate various ideologies that fall within the spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Democrats take liberal stances on social equality while also maintaining moderate views on gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that many, like OP, mistakenly assign a simple party label on people because we've been conditioned to think Liberal = democrat and Conservative = Republican. Then the whole thing gets muddy and people want to identify where you fall on the political spectrum based on single issues just as they would with political parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is fucked. I get so sick of people wanting to label others as liberal or conservative just so they can box them in and attack them if they have contradictory views. If we had multiple parties I think the health of our political awareness would drastically improve as people realize that it is ok to have different views throughout the political spectrum.

       If the ruling elite had such great foresight and control that they were able to push a man forward as a "populist" candidate then build him up then beat him down all while still allowing him to win the presidency; then were all pretty much F'ed aren't we?
      </p>
      <p>
       You apparently choose to see him as a tool put in place to divide the people, some of us choose to hold out hope that he is who we thought he was. Whether he was a tool of the elite or fighting against them wouldn't the result look pretty much the same? Exactly as it does now, with every minute of the day spent bashing him and his supporters.

       You answered your own question. People that actually look at his governance (i.e. the vast number of Goldman Sachs, globalist, corporatist banking elites being place into positions of power) and not just read Facebook understand the truth. If you think he's fighting against the elite, you've already lost.

       I agree, it seems like a dumb plan to install Trump and rally so hard against him in the msm and social media that the bias starts to redpill the general public. That's a lot of silly orchestration for a system that is already owned.

       Exactly. Not much difference between Establishment Democrats and Establishment Republicans. They agree and collude on the overwhelming majority of important issues. They use the unimportant ones to divide and perpetuate the system. Both "sides" are funded by the same people and those people get great return on their investment.

       This seems to be the biggest dividing line on Reddit. Democrats are communist nihilist libtards. Republicans are evil Christian white supremacists. Trump supporters seem to reject both parties to a fair extent. Only a handful of politicians on either side probably care about the people.

       You're right that Ron Paul isn't a NEOcon, but
he's definitely one of the most NEOliberal out there
along with the Koch bros pro-TPP shill Gary Johnson, and France's president the Rothschild banker Macron.

      <p>
       Most of the people mentioned in the graphics in my previous post are BOTH
NEOliberals and NEOconservatives but Ron Paul is just a NEOliberal.
This however doesn't make him less dangerous,
it's just another pathway to corporate rule/tyranny
which is what the NWO is about.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        NEOliberalism = economic politicies that deregulate the market at least
to an unethical extent, i.e. extreme right wing economics.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Two main flavors of NEOliberalism: authoritarian crony capitalism
and far right libertarianism. Both are terrible for the people/workers
as everyone is ripped off to serve the elites mostly consisting of corporations, elite central bankers and wallstreet.
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        NEOconservativism = authoritarian social policies and imperialist warmonger foreign policy.
Obama is a NEOcon like Bush is.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Anyway, extreme right libertarianism is as NEOliberal as you can get, basically full deregulation of the market (free market).
That means removing good regulations like
worker rights, min. wage, product quality and safety, environmental regulations, etc.
And as far as I know, Ron wants to cut social security for
younger people, get rid of social programs, privatize schools, etc.
It's just insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       I respect that Ron is anti-war but
looking at his economic policies, he's an extremist.
Obama/Clinton/Bush are all extremist NEOliberals too but
Ron goes the extra mile and goes to the edge of the spectrum,
full corporate tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, does this mean he's a shill or
he's playing 4D chess in order to raise awareness to end the FED?
Not sure, but alternatively, ending the FED could
just be something that benefits him as a wealthy person.
I've heard that nationalizing the FED is better
and using gold as the reserve currency rather than paper money.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't trust him because if he's
playing 4D chess, he's pushing the "playing" the role
very hard, to the point which makes me think he's not messing around but very serious
with his insane policies.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three ways the elites can screw us
over into a NWO:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         extreme authoritarianism (e.g. state capitalist dictatorship like the USSR, Mao, NK, China to some extent, etc.
or basically any dictatorship, for which the U.S. is close to being one, we have the NSA spying on us afterall)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         extreme NEOliberalism (extreme right libertarianism)
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         extreme authoritarian NEOliberalism (crony capitalism + warmonger stuff + state surveillance aka NEOcon stuff mixed
with NEOlib stuff)
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Being a slightly right wing libertarian is probably fine and even
anti-establishment (like centrist and center left moderate libertarians)
but the Libertarian party goes to the edge of the spectrum, full free market/full capitalism
which can quickly escalate into fascism when worker rights are thrown out the window
among other benevolant regulations.
Not all regulations are good (e.g. crony capitalism -- one rule for corps, another for small businesses)
but to remove them all is a dangerous trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       People like Ron Paul claim that the problem is ONLY the government.
This is false because who controls the government?
Corporations.
Who controls those corporations?
Elite central bankers like Rothschilds.
So reducing the government/regulations is just
removing a middle man and tightening the grip.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the market with near zero regulations
would just be a free for all,
for corporations as they dominate the market,
they have all the power, sociopaths, resources,
knowledge, etc. to wipe the floor with
workers, customers, and rival businesses like
small/medium businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things that are extreme (like extreme right libertarianism)
are so because they only benefit a few people.
Centrist is not extreme because a lot of people
benefit from the compromize
between personal freedom (socialism)
and economic freedom (capitalism).
      </p>
      <p>
       The ratio has to be sensible,
not like 90% capitalism, 10% socialism.
Currently it's very imbalanced and
NEOliberals are trying to imbalance it further.

       NEOliberal = extreme economic freedom which in turn
means extreme corporate freedom.
Like Monsanto forcing us to
accept that any ingredient in any food
could have their GMOs/pesticide stuff
without labelling them -- we lose the personal freedom
to know what's in our food
while corporations like Monsanto impose
their economic freedom to screw us over, on us forcefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of this type of stuff,
there's many criticisms against Ron Paul
from left and right wingers alike.
And Ron's son is clearly compromized by
the political zionists (not the same as Jews).
      </p>
      <p>
       According to ex-Jewish rabbi (now Christian, you can find him on YouTube)
brother Nathaneal,
the wailing wall is satanic.
Not sure what normal Jews think
of the wailing wall and all that hip thrusting
but a lot of corrupt people seem to go to that wall
which Nathaneal claims is not sacred in the slightest but actually satanic
and sexual.

       I know guilt by association is sometimes
unfair but I would think their political leanings are similar anyway
as they're father and son.

       Dunno man, he seems like a typical establishment Republican
maniac. Dems/Repubs are almost the same corrupt bullshit.
It's sad that many people believe
these Republicans when they say "I believe in Christian values!"
when hell no they don't!
Jesus would never say a poor person
is poor because they're lazy or some other NEOliberal propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus was essentially a democratic socialist.
I'm not 100% Jesus would allign himself
with the umbrella term Democratic Socialist,
but definitely he'd be in the
left libertarian region on the spectrum,
probably close to where Gandhi is (center left, moderate left libertarian).

       I like where this story is going.
Although still haven't figured the connection between
Freemasonry, Bablyon and the central bankers.
Do they just protect the wealth for royal bloodlines or something?
What's it got to do with Satan and Archons??
So many theories, so little evidence. :/

       Man, the elites are such cartoony psychopaths.
Molech is one annoying scumbag.
If they take this cultish stuff seriously,
then either there's something real about it
(demons, dimensions, archons, demi-gods or whatever)
or they're just mentally ill, lack morality + have a lot of power. :/
      </p>
      <p>
       If we ever topple the elite (peacefully preferably)
I'd want them all to be interrogated, find out what secret documents/truths
the Vatican is hiding, etc. and who the top of the pyramid is.
Central bankers or royal bloodlines...or something else.

       Agreed. Also not just the aristocrats are skewing perspectives. So many people are larping (posting as extreme antifa when they are really right wing and vice versa, replying to their own posts with insults to make the opposition look horrible, etc etc). Once you start to realize this you'll see how little the internet had helped us figure out each other's views and who is right or wrong. Really it's made it drastically worse.

       Left and right are both part of the same coin. The coin was born with the French Revolution. It created increased subversion and perversion of logos, rationality. It introduced the false God of scientism webworship today. Newton, Darwin, Freud, Nietzsche, all anti-christian anti-logos humans.

       Look at what you are. What you value. You value logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then look at the world. It has luch illogical activity. War. Deliberately poisonous foods. I'm telling you this did not come to be by pure chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       The person Jesus represents logos and logic and things you value. He is what the Jews detest and want to destroy. There are people who are good and people who are bad. Good and evil, right and wrong.

       Nope. The Dotard, who claimed to be self-funding got 269M from other donors. Then after he won his candidacy he wrote off $50 million he claimed to have "lent" his campaign. Also the RNC was behind a lot of money raised to Trump's campaign.

         The Republican National Committee has raised $60 million more than its Democratic counterpart (raised a total of $178.5M). Thus far, Trump, who touted his independence from big money during the primary season, has relied heavily on the RNC as a vehicle for larger donations.

        The Trump campaign and their Super PAC has already started to burn money for 2020.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        President Donald Trump won’t face re-election for another 3 1/2 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        No matter. A pair of super PACs have together already burned through $1 million to boost Trump’s 2020 bid, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of federal campaign spending records.
       </p>
       <p>
        So much spending, so fast, is unprecedented in US election history.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trump himself is the prime instigator of this outside money onslaught. He filed his re-election paperwork on Jan. 20 — the day of his inauguration — and has since conducted campaign rallies, raised more than $7 million in campaign cash and even aired a campaign TV ad touting his nascent presidency.
       </p>
       <p>
        With Trump’s candidacy declared, it’s easy for super PACs and certain nonprofit groups empowered by the Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission to raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to promote the president’s political prospects.
       </p>
       <p>
        But consider this: It took until midspring 2015 — about 27 months after President Barack Obama’s second inauguration — for political groups such as super PACs to collectively spend $1 million promoting or opposing the gaggle of Democrats and Republicans running to replace Obama.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following Trump’s inauguration in January, political groups crossed the same spending threshold in a mere 3 1/2 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        Driving Election 2020’s ultra-early spending are Great America PAC and Committee to Defend the President, a pair of “hybrid” super PACs that share the same treasurer, political consultant and election lawyer Dan Backer.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday, the groups officially spent $1 million during Election 2020 on a variety of pro-Trump communications and related items ranging from TV, radio and digital advertisements to robocalls and direct mail to renting the email addresses of prospective supports and donors, FEC records show.
       </p>
       <p>
        By Tuesday, that spending figure had ballooned to $1.32 million.

       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        A campaign finance watchdog said today that chief White House strategist Steve Bannon may have illegally benefited from spending by a pro-Trump super PAC while he led Trump’s presidential campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Campaign Legal Center believes Make America Number 1, a super PAC that backed Trump, may have improperly subsidized Bannon’s salary. In a letter to regulators on Wednesday, the Campaign Legal Center argued that details in Bannon’s recent financial disclosure give “reason to believe” the Trump campaign and the super PAC may have violated federal election rules.
       </p>
       <p>
        While Trump initially criticized his Republican opponents for their close ties to super PACs and disavowed outside groups that sought to support his bid, his team embraced outside help during his general election race against Hillary Clinton and pushed the boundaries of federal election rules as much as any other 2016 candidate—testing regulations meant to ensure that super PACs operate independently from campaigns.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bannon’s disclosure, filed March 31, confirmed his financial connection to Glittering Steel, a film production company that was involved with Bannon’s Clinton Cash documentary about the Clinton family, and Torchbearer, which starred Duck Dynasty’s Phil Robertson.
       </p>
       <p>
        Make America Number 1 paid the film production company nearly $1 million during the 2016 election cycle, with payments starting in July 2015 and continuing after Bannon became the Trump campaign’s CEO. The Trump campaign never paid Bannon, who previously was the executive chairman of Breitbart News, a right-wing news site.

       What are you on about? You're attacking an imaginary argument that nobody even attempted to make. The OP of the thread claimed Trump was installed via funds of the GOP and super PACs, you called it a lie, then he proved himself right, then you called it fake news.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP is under zero legal obligation to install the person who got the most votes in the primary. Yet they installed Trump as the face of their party, after they and their super PACs gave him the most money. Those are indisputable facts.

       Money doesn't buy elections. If that were the case, Hillary would have been fifty points ahead. The establishment GOP is obstructing Trump just like the democrats, and don't pretend they aren't. The left suddenly love RINOs like McCain, Ryan, Romney etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the establishment put Trump into power, you are contradicting yourself. The media is 1000% establishment. If Trump is also establishment, that means all the rage news you've been studying is you being conned. Russia stuff is fake. Hookers are fake. Rape is fake etc. If you're right about Trump, you're being played by the media. So which is it, who is conning you? Someone is.

       That has nothing to do what we discussed earlier. I showed you that Trump is indeed supported by tons of Super PACs, GOP donors and companies = establishment. He also got tons of free publicity from the media, so that helped too.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Trump has managed to be so utterly incompetent that no one from the GOP want to support his idiotic policies, thank god.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason "the left" shows more appreciation for McCain, Kasich etc is because they are more reasonable than Trump. It's not that difficult to understand in the current political climate.

      <p>
       As soon as they will get through a tax cut though they will most likely also be on board the impeach train. Or at least we can only hope for that to happen before Donaldthebitch destroys even more things.

       I'm just telling you the truth, sure the GOP was and has been cautious about Trump since the primaries, never thought he stood a chance to win etc. But most of them embraced him officially when he became a candidate and later elected.

       Is it a personal attack to call a lie a lie? The GOP never supported Trump. He is not GOP. No matter how many times you repeat it, it wont make the lie a truth.

       I would refute your points if you had any. Lies aren't points. If I were to say, "Hillary is a lizard in a flesh suit." then you could say that's a lie and I would in turn say "Refute my points!" I don't play those games. Later.

       It doesn't matter if he wasn't close to the GOP from the beginning. Their superPACs, donors etc all supported him through the election. Republicans came out in support for him and have during his 10 months in office. Some have been harsh against him publicly, some are nevertrumpers but most are supporting the Trump admin. They are all complicit in his actions so far. Stating otherwise would just be naive as fuck. No lies needed to talk about their support for him.

       Although I don't rule out the possibility at all, I disagree. And believe me I've been "redpilled" since I was 11-12 years old. Of course some issue more than others, but Donald Trump I think has the best chance of being the "good guy" more than anyone else ever. The thing is, I'm sure I'll have my definite answer by the time he's gone, if not much sooner.

       Both major parties are just two flavors of
NEOliberalism (extreme right economics).
If you zoom out of the lib vs con thing,
you can see the entire spectrum
and how artificial the constraints
of "Dems vs Repubs" really are.

       Again not talking about parties. There were communists who supported clinton, even when it wasnt in their intrests. Just saying that you can have political ideology and not believe in the current party system. Most people dont realize they are liberals in the realist sense.

       Sorry man, I wasn't criticizing your comment, I was just providing more info in addition to your comment. :)
I worded it poorly.
You're right that the partisan ideologies are not the only
ones on the spectrum.
I'd also like to add that ideologies in general
can be useful but they're still pre-packaged to some extent
so it's best to think things through in a non-ideological way.
      </p>
      <p>
       E.g. I'm a democratic socialist (center left libertarian mixed economics)
but seeing homelessness saddens me not because
"that's totally against democratic socialism" (because that would be politically religious/lack critical thinking)
but simply just because it's truly immoral and a shame to see homelessness
in a rich country. :/
      </p>
      <p>
       Also one more thing I want to clarify:
I think technically, "liberal" just means
pro-liberty/freedom and hence it's a vague term
that people shouldn't be using at all (IMHO).
Liberty/freedom for who?
There's personal freedom (socialistic left libertarian)
and there's economic freedom (right leaning).
If you go too far into the economic freedom thing,
it becomes corporate freedom (NEOliberal).
      </p>
      <p>
       So a balance is best IMO, like
center left or centrist. Protecting the workers while
also encouraging ethical small/medium businesses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't mean to ramble on,
just wanted to clarify stuff in case
you or someone else needed it.
I believe we all have very similar needs and desires
so we probably allign more closely
than we realize....just that propaganda has muddied the waters.

       Np man. Ya totally agree. I guess i meant more specifically social liberalism or classical liberalism, basicially center left. People i think will usually set aside partisan beleifs or ideology to help people in suffering. Ie. Huston flodding.

       Yeah man I agree.
Although just note that "classical liberalism" is
confusingly extreme right wing free market economics (corporations can dominate us
in a 100% free market with near zero regulations).
Fair market on the other hand is different, with only good regulations
like min. wage, worker rights, product quality/safety, environmental regulations, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hence I don't recommend people using the vague term "liberal"
as it could mean anything.
Liberty for people (balance of socialism and capitalism) or liberty for corporations (classical liberalism and NEOliberalism are both
similar and extreme capitalism).
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly the corporate media keeps
using liberal vs conservative which in reality
is just a sneaky rebranding of two flavors of NEOliberalism (extreme right economics).

       The entire institution of representative government has been broken for years. Maybe always. Anyone who wants public office is insane. There's no way to make the US better. All anyone can do as an elected official is to scratch other people's backs and pray to the Federal Reserve that they'll scratch yours back.

       Another thread, telling users what to think.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know the long timers see this bs, but just for the noobs...any threads telling you not to look at something, telling you something is bad, or these backhanded tactics that say if you have X thoughts or agree with X then you are automatically part of a bad thing....its all clear bs thought policing and propaganda.

       GTFO.  people can think for themselves.

       OP is a thought police shill.  You can support a politicians views and still be red pilled.  Ron and rand paul are all around great and i agree with their view points.  Oh, welp...i guess im not cool enough. Op is either a noob or its just some shilling flapping around.

       Try voting for a third party candidate you like. It takes a little effort, more so than staying home at least, but if you help the millions of the rest of us trying to make it happen, we might actually pull it off. Last time a third party won, we got to end slavery. Think what else we might be able to achieve.

       You think someone is a "centrist" because they reject the artificial Republican/Democrat divide? I'm a left libertarian, I'm too libertarian to like the Democratic Party and I'm too socialist to like Republican Party, does that sound very "centrist" to you? Open your mind, dude, there's a lot more to political thought than "left/right" or "Democrat/Republican".

       Don't put words in my mouth. I never said anything about Republicans or Democrats, and neither did the OP. We're talking about either side of the political spectrum. And no, that doesn't sound very Centrist to me. If you're a Left Libertarian, why would I assume that you are a Centrist? A Centrist is someone who doesn't have any convictions or any values, and so therefore isn't a Left Libertarian or a Right Libertarian, or a Progressive Statist or a Conservative Statist, they don't have any convictions and so therefore they don't have any views that one could call Left or Right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once again, this type of political theory has absolutely nothing to do with political parties like the Democrats and the Republicans. You're assuming I'm even American. If you're a Left Libertarian, you have at least some kind of conviction, some kind of positive belief, which means that you aren't a Centrist. Centrists are the ones with the most closed minds, because to retain their status as a Centrist, which they cling to, they mustn't take any side, which closes their mind to all possibilities beyond the status quo.

       The "spectrum" does not go from one side to the other side. It's multifaceted. It's not a straight line with one side on one end and another side on the other. There's not one side against another side. There are infinitely many sides, and pretending otherwise is just playing into their efforts to divide people up into controllable camps, red vs blue, Democrat vs Republican. That's what I was talking about. Most who resist the orthodoxy of the major parties are nowhere ner centrist at all. The actual "centrist" are the political establishment who work together. They're people like Clinton and McCain who undermine the desires of their constituents to collectively sell out for the corporate state. Meanwhile someone like me might be more libertarian than typical Republicans while also being more socialist than typical Democrats. Because political ideology isn't a straight line, and we shouldn't ever speak as if it is.

       You're barking up the wrong tree. I'm the guy nonstop explaining to people that the political spectrum isn't a line. Maybe, it's a plane, maybe it's a cube, maybe it's a four dimensional object we can't conceive of. So yes, I appreciate your point, but no point preaching to the choir.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now having said that, there are two main sides of the complex political spectrum that are active in this country right now, Socially Conservative Nationalism, and Socially Progressive Globalism. To point this out in no way denies that there are more facets to all this than just those two.

       So we should just give up on politics completely.  How do you suggest we defeat the establishment if we can't do it politically?

       No one said to give up on it....completely. But you do need to recognize it for what it is and be honest about it. It will not be defeated the way it is currently constituted. The cards are stacked against it. No matter how much traction or buzz a 3rd party candidate can get nationally there is a mechanism in place to not allow it. Let's say for instance that said candidate won do you honestly think that the 2 entrenched parties would let them actually change or legislate ANYTHING? It is beyond me that when you honestly look at the past 4 presidents that nothing and I mean NOTHING has significantly changed for the better. It's the status quo...time after time after time.
For real change to happen there needs to be an awakening and mental revolution of all the people in this country who aren't the 1%. Furthermore it would also require some of said 1%'ers to actually wake the fuck up and realize that their greed and thirst for money is only making things worse...but I have my doubts.

       I'd agree with the "you are not redpilled if you support either side" idea... But this sub is absolutely political. There's no way to talk about things like the MIC or government cover-ups or corporate conspiracies without being political. How would you suggest we talk about massive conspiracies like the DNC rigging their primaries last year without talking about politics? It seems like you're thinking that the major party establishments are the only political thought, that anyone being "political" is adhering to that kind of stupid partisanship. That's not accurate. All things one can do are political, either in support of a policy or opposing a policy. If you say "I like ice cream", that's political because you're saying something about a commercial product and you're exercising your free speech. If you try to remain silent on "politics" to not be "political", then that's an acceptance and endorsement of the status quo and that's political too. There's no way to not be political in a broad sense, and that gets even more impossible if you consider the fact that conspiracies we discuss frequently involve crime, politics, and government.
      </p>
      <p>
       We shouldn't shy away from politics. We should talk about political ideas freely constantly. What we need to stay away from, however, is partisanship. Blind support for the political establishment in the form of the two major parties. It's the tribalism that we need to avoid, not political speech altogether. And you talk of a "spectrum", but we all need to be mindful that the spectrum isn't from Democrat to Republican, it's anything and everything everywhere even beyond the artificial limits placed on us by the corporate media and the politicians in power. Don't let your political thought be limited by what the gatekeepers in the media say.

       I don't support either side of the political spectrum, that's why I voted for Trump. Neither the Democrats nor the GOP wanted him in office. The GOP talked of stone walling him at the Republican convention, remember? The dude is a casino builder who eats steak with ketchup. Happy I voted for him and always will be :D

       You just have to point them to the evidence.
When they see it for themselves,
their ego is less likely to get in the way
because it feels like
they came to the conclusion themselves.

       Start with 9/11 inside job -- compare
how similar a normal controlled demolition footage
is to the footage of building 7 going down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also there was a Dutch demolitions expert
who on video, was shocked that the building 7 footage
wasn't "officially" a controlled demolition
and actually said that it definitely looks like one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly I think he was murdered some years later
in a supposed "car crash"
following a later appearance on TV about 9/11.

       Which is still polarization. We need to go with what works and change the solution with the issue itself as it changes, which would take ideas from several pools of thought. Not body slam it with one extreme version of an idea and market it as a group of people or a culture.

       Exactly my point.
      </p>
      <p>
       Parties attempt to encapsulate various ideologies that fall within the spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some Democrats take liberal stances on social equality while also maintaining moderate views on gun control.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue is that many, like OP, mistakenly assign a simple party label on people because we've been conditioned to think Liberal = democrat and Conservative = Republican. Then the whole thing gets muddy and people want to identify where you fall on the political spectrum based on single issues just as they would with political parties.
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole thing is fucked. I get so sick of people wanting to label others as liberal or conservative just so they can box them in and attack them if they have contradictory views. If we had multiple parties I think the health of our political awareness would drastically improve as people realize that it is ok to have different views throughout the political spectrum.

       What are you on about? You're attacking an imaginary argument that nobody even attempted to make. The OP of the thread claimed Trump was installed via funds of the GOP and super PACs, you called it a lie, then he proved himself right, then you called it fake news.
      </p>
