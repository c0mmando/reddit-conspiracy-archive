       I'd previously posted about the Russell Welch case
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/75uue0/til_that_there_is_a_mena_anthrax_connection/">
        here
       </a>
       and in doing some further research I came across the case of
       <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/569975/posts">
        Ron Miller
       </a>
       who became ill right before he was to testify before a congressional committee about the aforementioned price fixing scandal which had ensnared Clinton's chief of staff Thomas McLarty and also involved Commerce Secretary Ron Brown who also died
       <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?182235-1/ron-browns-body">
        under very odd and suspicious circumstances as detailed in Jack Cashill's work
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       The price fixing involved overcharging for natural gas in Oklahoma to the tune of many tens of millions of dollars as detailed in
       <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2001/05/9363/">
        this WND article from 2001
       </a>
       . The Oklahoma scandal has tentacles that reach out to other Clinton scandals as well as the owners of Dynamic Energy Resources, the company that was found to be overcharging consumers for natural gas were associates of none other than John Huang
       <a href="http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/08/12/huang.sentence/">
        who later pled guilty to felony conspiracy charges
       </a>
       for his role in the Chinagate illegal fundraising which funneled millions of dollars into Clinton's 1996 campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
       Has anyone else gone down this path before? I'm looking for other connected cases especially anything involving anthrax as I've been also looking into the 2001 anthrax attacks and I'm interested in trying to document other cases involving a similar MO.
