       It's far too early to say. With the publicly available information, it seems like the president is in the clear, but it sure looks like Flynn and Manafort sold our country out. Will be interesting to see what Mueller digs up.

       It's hard to imagine that those guys were able to do that without Kushner, Junior, or even Trump himself not knowing about it. Trump literally tweeted about Hillary deleting her emails hours after the Veselnitskaya.

       Those two were about as close as possible to Trump. Trump also refuses to criticize Flynn (even after firing him) which strikes me as odd.

       For those who may have forgotten, this Russian narrative began in September 2015 when the DNC/Anderson Cooper tried to link Bernie to Russia when he was becoming a threat to Hillary. Then they tried to link Wikileaks to Russia. Then Jill Stein. Then Donald. Then Julian Assange. Then the entire election results. Then they stopped referring to the email fiasco as "leaks" and began calling them "Russian hacks" This is not a pattern of reality - it's a pattern of desperation. I've been a Democrat all my life, but this Russia crap is nonsense.

       The Congressional investigations are being controlled by Republicans so I don't really understand the argument that it's "the dems." I know that's Trump's favorite talking point, but it doesn't seem to square with the facts.

       If you still think the R or D next to the representative's name makes a difference, you still have plenty of information to discover. The 2 party system makes it easy to divide and control political influence. Those truly in power care not what puppet sits in the oval office or in Congress, since their money all comes from the same place and they all vote the same for what really matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference between the parties rests in identity politics. Those issues are completely manufactured and radicalized to either extreme.

       Maybe on some things, but there's a reason nothing has gotten done during the Trump presidency - the two sides are almost completely united in their opposition to the other side. And if Hillary did a fraction of the shit Trump did, she would be on the verge of impeachment.

       According to their theory, the Democrats are really the ones in charge, completely forgetting the fact that Republicans are in charge of the executive and legislative branches and started the Russia investigation.  The TDers also say that Democrats are the reason he can't pass legislation, which is ridiculous.

       It is strange. The Republicans could give the Democrats the middle finger at any time and their voters would back it. But to their credit they

       I completely agree but I find it funny how all their desperate attempts may have actually uncovered some shit. The meeting with Veselnitskaya was not nothing. Manafort working for Russian oligarchs is not nothing. It's going to be hard to watch the MSM sip their victory kool aid if the investigations lead to something but if they find something worth prosecuting I want Trump and is group to get prosecuted. The idea that someone can work with the Russian gov to get elected in the US is scary.

       That's an acceptable opinion among some here apparently. Go to an anti-Trump and the worst you'll see is "send him to prison" comments - but casually talking about lynching a president here is instant upvotes.

       They are positioning for the mid-terms elections and the next presidential election.   Expect the propaganda blitz to intensify in order to gauge its effectiveness in the midterms.   If it is effective, meaning, republicans loose seats, than it will be intensified until the presidential.  This is the issue that is hoped will prevent the second term.   The actual investigation will only end the presidency indirectly, by constantly being cited by opposition in order to sway voters.   The actual investigation can't fail to turn something up, simply due to the vague accusations. Collusion is not rigorously defined, and as such the impropriety is not clear.  So if a Russian business contract in some way violated procedures, lets say by not accurately reporting income,  then the investigation would have been a success.

       Absolutely not.  This conspiracy theory was crafted to protect Obama.  Obama was spying on political opponents and got caught.  The Russia conspiracy theory was crafted to cover for Obama's crimes.  Then when Trump won it just morphed into an excuse for impeachment.

       Also noone believes it.  Libtards believe it but they don't matter since they believe anything the establishment tells them.  The rest of the nation isn't buying it.  The MSM pushed way too many fake news stories about Russia.  With the vast majority of Americans not believing it they can't use this for impeachment, no matter what bullshit they come up with.

       Yes. Remember bill clinton was impeached for getting a blowjob. trump may or may not have colluded with russian, but even if he didnt  im sure there is something else there, money laundering or fraud at least.
