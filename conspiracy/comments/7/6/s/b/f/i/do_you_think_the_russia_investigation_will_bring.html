    <div class="md"><p>For those who may have forgotten, this Russian narrative began in September 2015 when the DNC/Anderson Cooper tried to link Bernie to Russia when he was becoming a threat to Hillary. Then they tried to link Wikileaks to Russia. Then Jill Stein. Then Donald. Then Julian Assange. Then the entire election results. Then they stopped referring to the email fiasco as &quot;leaks&quot; and began calling them &quot;Russian hacks&quot; This is not a pattern of reality - it&#39;s a pattern of desperation. I&#39;ve been a Democrat all my life, but this Russia crap is nonsense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree but I find it funny how all their desperate attempts may have actually uncovered some shit. The meeting with Veselnitskaya was not nothing. Manafort working for Russian oligarchs is not nothing. It&#39;s going to be hard to watch the MSM sip their victory kool aid if the investigations lead to something but if they find something worth prosecuting I want Trump and is group to get prosecuted. The idea that someone can work with the Russian gov to get elected in the US is scary.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are positioning for the mid-terms elections and the next presidential election.   Expect the propaganda blitz to intensify in order to gauge its effectiveness in the midterms.   If it is effective, meaning, republicans loose seats, than it will be intensified until the presidential.  This is the issue that is hoped will prevent the second term.   The actual investigation will only end the presidency indirectly, by constantly being cited by opposition in order to sway voters.   The actual investigation can&#39;t fail to turn something up, simply due to the vague accusations. Collusion is not rigorously defined, and as such the impropriety is not clear.  So if a Russian business contract in some way violated procedures, lets say by not accurately reporting income,  then the investigation would have been a success. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely not.  This conspiracy theory was crafted to protect Obama.  Obama was spying on political opponents and got caught.  The Russia conspiracy theory was crafted to cover for Obama&#39;s crimes.  Then when Trump won it just morphed into an excuse for impeachment.</p>

<p>Also noone believes it.  Libtards believe it but they don&#39;t matter since they believe anything the establishment tells them.  The rest of the nation isn&#39;t buying it.  The MSM pushed way too many fake news stories about Russia.  With the vast majority of Americans not believing it they can&#39;t use this for impeachment, no matter what bullshit they come up with.  </p>

<p>If the vast majority of people don&#39;t believe it, why do 40%+ already think he should be impeached? Why do you suppose Bannon gives Trump a 30% chance of finishing his first term?</p>
