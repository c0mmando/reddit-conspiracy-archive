There&#39;s no rule here to report a post for &quot;relevance,&quot; and if it weren&#39;t for so many paid detractors here, I would say that&#39;s a good thing. For now, just downvote, and stop commenting on it, FTLOG.</p>

<p>Edit: I typed a comment that better explains myself here:</p>

<p>When I looked at that vid of Ben Affleck with that Canadian newscaster in his lap and only laughed, I thought, &quot;Why is Jacob Rothschild still walking around right now, and why am I watching this?&quot; The top post on this sub has 6.5K votes and is about a failed girl band; what they experienced was terrible, but I assumed that people knew that kind of shit was the norm in the entertainment industry – especially with &quot;bands&quot; put together like that.

<p>Sure, ridiculous gossip finds it&#39;s way here, but often the most off the wall story ends up having a bit of a piece that helps put things together, and we all have different talents for sniffing out <em>that thing</em> that ends up being integral in someone else&#39;s research. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, an incredibly influential producer accused of assaulting and raping women over time, involving a massive cover-up by many people who would have to have known.... Yes, and he&#39;s probably tied to others, since he was also cozy with presidents – and he could unravel the whole thing, globally.

    <div class="md"><p>I mean, there are degrees here. Grabbing someone&#39;s boob without consent is bad behaviour, should be acknowledged, reflected upon, and improved.
