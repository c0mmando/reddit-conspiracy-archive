       Guys like Ben Affleck, Seth Rogan, etc., get a boner from their power and feeling like a women might actually perceive it as a welcome compliment to have their asses or breasts groped. This is not a conspiracy; this is frat-boy bullshit, and let TMZ cover it. There's no rule here to report a post for "relevance," and if it weren't for so many paid detractors here, I would say that's a good thing. For now, just downvote, and stop commenting on it, FTLOG.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: I typed a comment that better explains myself here:
      </p>
      <p>
       When I looked at that vid of Ben Affleck with that Canadian newscaster in his lap and only laughed, I thought, "Why is Jacob Rothschild still walking around right now, and why am I watching this?" The top post on this sub has 6.5K votes and is about a failed girl band; what they experienced was terrible, but I assumed that people knew that kind of shit was the norm in the entertainment industry – especially with "bands" put together like that. We're being fed the "little" sex scandals while infants are being raped and murdered.

       I'm with you on that. There's a culture of both sexual "misbehaving" and real sexual abuse in Hollywood (and the world), but I was just trying to differentiate, because one is a conspiracy and one is an open secret. They absolutely intersect.

       Sure, ridiculous gossip finds it's way here, but often the most off the wall story ends up having a bit of a piece that helps put things together, and we all have different talents for sniffing out
       <em>
        that thing
       </em>
       that ends up being integral in someone else's research.

       I agree with you, except it's clear that the low-level dogs are being thrown at us like steak to lions. Pizzagate got way too close; they put Harvey out there to cover all the real shit about that, and it seems to have given women in Hollywood a voice about other people who touched them wrong, which is fucking awesome and should happen, but Podesta, et. al. are still walking around with high-paying jobs.

       Let's just see what all comes of this. DC and Hollywood are wellknit. Pizzagate was always about elite pedo-blackmail and child currency. This may be just a bone that was thrown, but we're good at this.

       When I wrote "they put Harvey out there" I realized there was a hurricane that predated the producer in the news, with the same name, and it's not a common one. Now that I've typed it, I'm not thinking about it anymore and going for a long walk.

       I appreciate your rational practicality, and perhaps I'm over-reacting, but when I looked at that vid of Ben Affleck with that Canadian newscaster in his lap and only laughed, I thought, "Why is Jacob Rothschild still walking around right now, and why am I watching this?"

       Yes, an incredibly influential producer accused of assaulting and raping women over time, involving a massive cover-up by many people who would have to have known.... Yes, and he's probably tied to others, since he was also cozy with presidents – and he could unravel the whole thing, globally. I think that's one reason why he was thrown under a bus and sent on vacation. Investigation over.

       I mean, there are degrees here. Grabbing someone's boob without consent is bad behaviour, should be acknowledged, reflected upon, and improved. You can come back from that if you just acknowledge you were in the wrong and that your privileged position blinded you, and try to become a better person.

       But it's not a conspiracy, and not the purpose of this sub to enlighten mis-behaving actors. If Jacob Rothschild grabs Janet Yellen's ass at a party and demands to be fucked or he'll tank the dollar, I'd want to see that on the front page.

       I'm not really claiming that's specifically part of a conspiracy, unless the conspiracy is that stars leverage their money and power to keep themselves from facing their own bad behavior. That
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a conspiracy which involves employees, lawyers, PR flacks, studios, etc.

       I agree with you, except it's clear that the low-level dogs are being thrown at us like steak to lions. Pizzagate got way too close; they put Harvey out there to cover all the real shit about that, and it seems to have given women in Hollywood a voice about other people who touched them wrong, which is fucking awesome and should happen, but Podesta, et. al. are still walking around with high-paying jobs.

       When I wrote "they put Harvey out there" I realized there was a hurricane that predated the producer in the news, with the same name, and it's not a common one. Now that I've typed it, I'm not thinking about it anymore and going for a long walk.

       I appreciate your rational practicality, and perhaps I'm over-reacting, but when I looked at that vid of Ben Affleck with that Canadian newscaster in his lap and only laughed, I thought, "Why is Jacob Rothschild still walking around right now, and why am I watching this?" The top post on this sub has 6.5K votes and is about a failed girl band; what they experienced was terrible, but I assumed that people knew that kind of shit was the norm in the entertainment industry – especially with "bands" put together like that. We're being fed the "little" sex scandals while infants are being raped and murdered.
