        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>With the latest influx of people gravitating towards this sub and conspiracies in general, and the overarching comments from these new-to-arrive, <em>normal</em> people realising that “we’re not that crazy”, I thought I’d share my thoughts on <em>who we are</em>. </p>

<p>There are different and overlapping types of conspiracy fans. The first is the stereotypical conspiracy nut-job. This type of conspirator can’t shut up about conspiracies. He’s literally thinks everything is a conspiracy to the point where he’s convinced he has tracking devices in his teeth. The vast majority of us are not this guy although MSM would have you think that we are. Although this type of conspirator is valuable to our interests because with his obsession he’s probably the first to identify real conspiracies and bring them to our attention, we all agree, he’s probably borderline-nuts. </p>

<p>The next is the hobbyist conspirator which is where I like to position myself. I’ll indulge in every conspiracy, both possible and probably impossible. I love my conspiracies, not only on a level of seeking truth for things I think are bullshit but I also enjoy them as a fictional entertainment. Do I think 9/11 was an inside job? Absolutely. Do I think humans have ever left low-earth orbit? I’m not sure. Do I think the earth is flat? Fuck no. Yet I enjoy reading all three just the same. </p>

<p>Finally, I think there is the intelligent sceptic. This person doesn’t pursue many conspiracies but has their eyes, ears, and mind alert to the worst kinds of bullshit and when this person senses bullshit they research on it and call it out. A good example of this is the recent LV shootings. This story doesn’t add up which is why so many are onboard researching and stating their opinion. </p>

<p>So there it is. Where not all bearded crazies who live in the woods and think George Bush is a lizard. We don’t all believe all conspiracies either and you’ll usually catch us in debate if we disagree. Most of us are <em>normal</em> like you, we’re just a little more skeptical, unaccepting of bullshit, or just enjoy a bit of fiction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appreciate the post, but I&#39;m going to make a couple comments. First, the earth being spherical and not flat isn&#39;t a conspiracy. It&#39;s fucking scientifically proven. Have humans ever left low-earth orbit? Again, motherfucking proven. You don&#39;t need to reach out and try to normalize our subreddit. It&#39;s not going to change the perception of most people. We think how we think and we question what we question. If you&#39;re uncomfortable with being an outlier in thought-process, then you&#39;re in good company and should learn to accept it.. don&#39;t try to assimilate people who are naturally disinclined to your branch of thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. Currently I&#39;m somewhere between 2 and 3, but leaning heavily on 2.  I&#39;ve been hesitant of conspiracies because my mother is a full blown number one. I&#39;ve seen what obsessions and anxiety of conspiracies can do to persons life and it ain&#39;t pretty.  For that reason, I&#39;ve tried my best to steer clear of conspiracies. </p>

<p>My question to you all is, of all the conspiracies of the world. Have any been proven true?  </p>

<p>Personally I don&#39;t know.  So before I fall into this rabbit hole, have any conspiracies been proven true?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m the spiritualist conspiracist. One whose a total hippie, but they love meditating on clearing their chakras and tarot cards as they do researching pizzagate conspiracies, and conspiracies of any kind. Major terror attack? probably a false flag. Even the most controversial or underground conspiracies: all over them; AIDS, vaccines, Hollywood Illuminiti &amp; Santanic Ritual Abuse, Killing homeopathic doctors, reptilians, whites, grays, the SSP and Solar Warden (expect defintitely not flat earth, even though my brother&#39;s all about it- he&#39;s the steriotypical nut-job, but I love him, and I get him, even though I definitely don&#39;t agree with everything he thinks.) I believe being red pilled on conspiracies is the beginning of humanity&#39;s evolution of consciousness and the ascension of the soul- the greatest mystery there is- and my favorite mystery. Most people aren&#39;t on my level, but I try to always meet people where they are, if they don&#39;t get it, they just don&#39;t get it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>At least &quot;conspiracy theorists&quot; (well most) recognise that it&#39;s part of the NWO plan to be made to hate Muslim&#39;s due to staged terror attacks.
Those who make such generalisations from within their own bubble of knowledge and existence - I&#39;ll make my own generalisation: I&#39;d like to think that most theorists are pacifists.. you start to question the ways of the world, look into the nature of human consciousness, understand that hating, hurting or killing another person is just attacking yourself</p>
