        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I will update more/edit content later as I&#39;m currently traveling through Thailand and need to be out of my hotel soon.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the deal. I quit my job and have been traveling with my girlfriend for the past 2 months. We spent the beginning of October traveling up and down the rt 1 in California. On the night of October 8th We were driving from Santa Rosa to Santa Cruz. Since we were in a rental we went the long way around SF to avoid the obnoxious tolls on the rental car. This lead us down Rt 12 between about 7pm - 9 or 10pm.</p>

<p>Long story short. We saw no wild fires, but we did pass right by a building engulfed in flames apx 1 mile from rt 12. It was huge. We could smell the smoke from the road. When we were passing it the entire building was enflamed and the first responders were just then flying down the access road to the building. We almost went up to check it out, but we had a long drive ahead of us and my girlfriend said it was some sort of military base as noted on apple maps.
The next morning I was extremely curious so I googled &quot;Fire Sonoma California&quot; and sure enough there were dozens of articles about the wild fires, but nothing about a military base fire or anything of the sort. Yesterday, I looked into it again as I heard the wild fires are the biggest and deadliest in California history. They claim no one knows how the fire started. Well I do. It was that building fire I saw and it&#39;s pissing me off that no one will admit it. They know damn well how the fire started. Why are they covering it up?</p>

<p>I spent almost 2 hours looking for the exact location which I cant find, but I have the written out directions in my travel note book dated 10/8 incase we lost service/gps. I know about where we saw the burning building. I&#39;ll post a map of the path we took and the apx. location when I get more time.
So far, from my best guess and google street view, plus my gf saying it was some sort of military base, is that it was Travis Air Force Base.</p>

<p>Again I can&#39;t say for sure where the fire began. Maybe someone could help me by calling Sonoma fire department or some news reporters out there (as I&#39;m in Asia currently). All I know is that we passed and saw the start of the fire. Not only us, but all of the first responders know as well. But we&#39;re being told they have no idea where the fire started. Again, this is bull shit and I want to know what they&#39;re hiding.
Sorry for the rant, I&#39;ll clean it up a bit later.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m so glad you posted this.  I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how a fire burned uphill toward an affluent neighborhood right after it &quot;jumped&quot; over 4 lanes of interstate?  The neighborhood is up against the woods but the fire came from the freeway area.  Sprinklers were either not working or the fire was so hot it didn&#39;t make a difference.  The regional airport is also in the area and just this week a guy was arrested at a NC regional airport with explosives wanting to start a war on US soil.  It&#39;s just weird.  </p>

</blockquote>

<p>fire can easily jump over a highway, a few burning leaves tossed by the updraft of heat and boom, you have spread. </p>

<p>having done more than a few burns in the back 80 growing up in WI you have to be aware and ready for spread. So we would till up a solid 90 by 90 foot area and burn in the middle of it, with someone having an ATV and water trailer ready for spread on top of a bulldozer for controlling the pile itself. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This. That night was crazy. Tree branches were broken all over the place in the morning. I took down all of my bird feeders and had to secure everything in the yard that was blowing around.</p>

<p>There were power outages from breaking branches falling on powerlines.</p>

<p>We had good rain last year, but drought for the prior 7-8 years, so everything is still pretty dry.</p>

<p>We haven&#39;t had any major scale fires in the NorCal region of the North Bay Area and there is a ton of leaf litter, dry brush, downed branches, dead trees from disease and drought, and all sorts of stuff just waiting for a spark to go up like a torch.</p>

<p>The winds pushed the fires into the neighborhoods in a predicatable manner.</p>

<p>Tile roofed houses with stucco burned because there was leaf litter and debris in their rain gutters. There hasn&#39;t been significant rain to clear them up since last spring, and we haven&#39;t had any rain which prompts people to clean them out in the first place. This debris caught on fire due to the burning and blowing embers, igniting the gutter debris, which in turn ignited plywood roof sheeting and asphaltic felt undef the shingles. When the fire got hot enough in the closed houses, it superheated and ignited neighboring structures.</p>

<p>Nothing around Travis AFB is on fire or has been on fire. The nearest fire closure is almost 10 miles away. The closest advisory evacuation area is at the end of Air Base Parkway at I-80 which is 4-5 miles away. Most off base housing is in the neighboring towns, nowhere near Santa Rosa which is located 3 mountain ranges away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Its far as hell.  Maybe it was some kind of off base property but anyways, whatever.  I personally endured the fires along the east of 101 along the mountains and I was refuging with people who had left their homes to orange skies and a few families who had even lost theirs.  That shit threatened South Windsor all night.  I watched the hills burning down on us and somehow it didn&#39;t amount to anything.  I really suppose that the firefighters held their 12 inch cocks hard as they fought it off.  It just stopped magically right there on the hills of our valley.  We&#39;d be out fuck ton of money if it came down on us.  So that is way the fuck away from homeboy and it was coming from the other direction and absolutely the entirety of that space was not burned all of that way.  It just came from 150 the other direction and very far away.  Everyone should know that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Travis is nowhere near the 12. I notice your post didn&#39;t mention any wind activity, which was very prominent in that area around the timeframe you mention (many fires are said to have started around 10pm Saturday). Not sure if I buy your story based on that omission. If you have more details I&#39;m interested regardless. </p>

<p>It&#39;s looking like that wind (sustained gusts up to 70 MPH by 3 am, throughout Sonoma county) probably took some trees down, hitting lines or knocking down poles with transformers, which then blew on the ground. The non-urban parts of Sonoma county are not suburbs, they&#39;re an endless series of linked forests, and those winds were hurricane-grade. </p>

I can&#39;t say where it was for sure, but we passed a burning building. The flames were huge. I just find it odd that there was no mention of this building on fire at all and was definitely the night of the fire. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who saw it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Naw man I&#39;m glad you did post it, this is a catastrophic event. Just wondering if you guys noticed serious wind while driving around, enough to make driving conditions arduous. We&#39;re definitely in chicken or egg mode so far, did wind start a fire or did an extant fire get wind-propelled. Many extant fires, really (all first reported around the same time across many areas, which leads me to believe it was a wind-propelled event in all facets). I&#39;m south of the fires but that wind was like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced , hot, constant wind that sounded like a serious, roof-shaking storm in and of itself, whipping back and forth like crazy. </p>

<p>As for the building, might be helpful to know roughly when you guys got on the 12 and when you got off and where. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for the comment. I&#39;ll keep trying to figure out exactly when and where we were. I&#39;m punching myself for not taking a picture or driving up there. We were driving for about a week up and down the coast so it&#39;s hard for me to remember exactly. There was a lot of wind, but I&#39;m not sure about the night in question.</p>

<p>The thing that strikes me as odd about the whole thing is that I can&#39;t find anything about the building fire. If something like that happened in my town, it would be in the local news at least. We just passed through Sanoma about 30 mins - an hour before we saw the fire. We were heading east. The fire was on our left and the smoke was blowing towards the road... so the wind must have been blowing south?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>30min-an hour past the town of Sonoma would probably put you in Napa county on the approach to the 121 and then the 80 (ditto Sonoma county, it all blends together out there at night). Napa had (has) several fires that sparked around the time the ones in Sonoma did, so maybe you were seeing one of those early ones start up. Fits with your timeframe of going through the area around 8-10pm. With the nightmare wind as a factor it is possible this was the initial fire but that nobody noted this until it had spread all over (there&#39;s plenty of non-occupied vacation units and unused old barns in the countryside). Or it was one of many sites to catch regionally. </p>

<p>Either way, I could see that the resultant quick spread and panic would keep any press or investigators from noting this early that any one site was the first one to go up. We&#39;ll see, though, this will be investigated about as thoroughly as something of this nature can be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I grew up with a father in SC who went out every time the wind blew to fix tons of crazy shit.  If I was on the other side of town I knew that he was fixing stuff.  This wind was one of the worst that I&#39;ve ever experienced, possibly the worst.  In hindsight its not surprising to me that everything went all to fucking hell.  The humidity was 12%, crazy fucking wind and October with dried out vegetation after a crazy wet year preceded by crazy drought.  Shit went bad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was dark and the building was about a mile away. The only reason I have to believe it was a military base is that my gf said that&#39;s what it looked like on apple maps which is why we didn&#39;t go check it out. It very well could have been a winery.</p>

<p>What I do know is it was not a controlled fire and it was enormous. Biggest building fire I&#39;ve ever witnessed. And the fact that the wild fires started right after is what makes me suspicious. Even if it wasn&#39;t a military base I have to think the fire I saw was what started at least some of the wild fires. Could just be a coincedence, but I doubt it. Any reports of a winery fire that night? Isn&#39;t that still news worthy? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was riding my motorcycle home from work on 12 that night at about 10:30. The wind and debris was like nothing I&#39;ve ever experienced on a bike.  I rode through a black cloud of ash and saw the first fire at Beltane ranch. I tried to call 911 but it was busy so I knew crews were coming. I headed down the road into Kenwood and saw another inferno so stopped and took a picture at 10:41 on Adobe canyon rd just as the first crews were arriving. The wind was intense and the land too dry and I knew this was the start of something very bad. I decided I needed to get to safety as sparks were starting to come across the road. I headed into Santa Rosa and was almost taken out by branches fallen across the road. I vividly remember being at a red light at the intersection of 12 and village parkway and a transformer blew sending sparks onto the road in front of me and I looked over at the guy in the car next to me and I saw disbelief of the conditions we were witnessing. As I was heading down 12 west towards Sebastopol, I could see an orange glow over Santa Rosa and knew it was bad all over. I made it home safe and there was no danger near me. I don&#39;t know what PG&amp;e could have done but I believe it was perfect firestorm conditions, high wind and low humidity with a lot of fuel to burn from the very wet winter and spring. It only needed one spark and it got several. I&#39;m not a fire safety expert but I do know that those transformers are very capable of exploding from high winds and igniting dry brush. It doesn&#39;t seem like any conspiracy to me other than ignorant politicians not putting enough of our tax money towards decreasing the fire risks of our electrical grid. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok man but Travis is way out of 12 all of the way to 80 and then West a bit.  That general area was definitely not going crazy as fuck until much after the hills were burning East of the 101 in Santa Rosa to Calistoga.  Also there could have been many fires.  I&#39;ll testify that the winds were blowing like a son of a bitch in Windsor, just one up from Santa Rosa.  We had tree branches all over the place.</p>

<p>There were more than one fire.  You probably saw something.  Maybe something was covered up.  Honestly the entire situation is covered in a huge shroud even for shit that we saw with our own eyes.   The centralized communication was weak sauce as fuck but the ground crews were all top notch, great people.</p>
