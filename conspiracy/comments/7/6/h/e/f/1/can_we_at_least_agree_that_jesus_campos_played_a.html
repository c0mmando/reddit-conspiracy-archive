    <div class="md"><p>I posted a long theory of mine if you check my posts, but I think he was a translator, special security for &quot;vip&quot; clients the hotel managed. Hotel management knew the gun deals were going on and allowed Paddock use of service elevator and gave him private security and they took a cut of the profit. The gap between Campos being shot and the police being called is because he called the casino bigwigs first. So, I think he is a lil dirty because he probably knew he was guarding shady shit, but in the overall scheme of things, he is a bystander. </p>

<p>Agreed, what <em>I read</em> is not specifically accurate. What you said was wholly false, wrong, baseless and rude.</p>

<p>A better approach might have been - &#39;Really? I read that it was a predecessor to Lockheed Martin, do you have a source that might clear this up?&#39;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To start with yes 9/11 was horseshit clearly, but no i can&#39;t agree that Jesus Campos played a bigger part at this stage and if he did im imagining it was by way of giving him access to service elevator for a wee bribe or something but to argue Jesus Campos was part of Paddocks plot is a bit ridiculous at this stage.</p>

<p>The evidence so far is that paddock was intelligent and more than capable of planning this by himself, It&#39;s not hard to imagine that an intelligent person who is also a gambler with narcissicistic traits would realise the minute you involve another human being in your plot you open up a WHOLE lot of un-neccasary variables that needn&#39;t be there in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>would be interesting if it turned out to be a relation, which brings me to this (yes im  sure everyone has scene it, this isnt new, im just using it for reference) it seems pretty popular in las vegas according to this picture. i wonder how many people on the list are related, and who are they? or are none at all related? 17 are in LV alone. what is the chances of that?

    <div class="md"><p>I’m still waiting for an explanation on why he can’t talk to the media but the cops who were the first to enter the shooters room can go on 60 minutes. They can speak freely about what they saw and did but he can’t? Why? He’s a security guard at a casino. He’s not making that much. And there is no way his hotel would fire him for giving one or two media interviews. And if they did he could find a job easy or get a book deal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>its gross dereliction of protocol to release or leak crime scene photos to MSM .</p>

<p>ditto the crime scene cops appearing on MSM ad talking about the crime scene.</p>

<p>theres public doubt about a singe shooter or the basic facts of any crime that might ot might not have happened.</p>

<p>unprecedented and grossly unprofessional.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. Like I&#39;ve been saying from day 1 the Campos employed by CSC would not have been allowed in the hotel rooms, with a hotel key card, and hotel radio. He&#39;s also a 60yo man, not someone they&#39;re gonna bring in for casino security. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what happened in my head:
Campos was buying guns and ammo from Paddock, due to some reason Campos couldn&#39;t legally purchase them. Somehow they knew each other, not sure there. But Campos had the plan the whole time, was buying the guns from Paddock. Campos lives in a city where he can practice with them at any gun range, any day, 24 hours a day. The shooter definitely had lots of practice. Clean bullets laying on top of Paddock&#39;s blood near his head, the rifle laying over top of his leg, the timeline, the disappearance of Campos.... Campos did it after he shot Paddock in the head even a day or two earlier. Deal was done, Campos shot Paddock, Campos carried out the plan, shot himself in the leg and got the maintenance man out of there while he shot the crowd. Now he&#39;s gone, he will either end up dead or turn up and spill his guts. Only thing that will change that story is the maintenance man&#39;s timeline: When did he exit the floor, before or after the crowd shooting? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>How come Jesus Campos doesn&#39;t show up when MGM employees search their employee database? How come the Valet Chad Nishimura also does not show up and is now missing? Both of them? How come Campos disappeared last Thursday and nobody is making mention of it? </p>

I mean, they&#39;ve let him speculate about having help and whatnot.. doesn&#39;t sound like someone who&#39;s well informed. He&#39;s about as informed as any of us are, maybe even less. </p>
