       I am more interested where the line between reality and make believe was drawn. I think the answer to that is where the flat earth theory stems from.

       It's been said by FlatEarthers that Sunlight doesn't actually travel very far. That's how they explain how it can be daylight in one place and midnight in another place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why is it that if you are standing on a mountain that this mysterious effect changes.?You can see the Sunrise and sunset happen at a much further distance if your elevation is higher.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if the Sun above the flat Earth why is it that sunrise and sunset always happen at the horizon? A Sun hovering in the sky should come into view as above the horizon.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see the the Moon causes tides. How does this happen in Flat Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why wouldn't the Sun cause tides as well?

       A cloud  is hovering in the sky correct? Clouds in large numbers can cover the horizon and make a sunrise delay or anything in betwen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Horizon is a fancy way of saying how much you can see from you vantage point (eye-level): 3miles for an average height adult.
      </p>
      <p>
       Things that are above you and depart away appear to sink down as they move apart. The same, happening to things that are below you (ie. ants) and the ant would appear to rise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Its not actually the clouds or ants that are sinking or rising, only the tilt of your head tracking the moving object until it reaches that point where things above you and below you "collide" judging by human eye limitation and height limitation.

       Are you surprises also when you expect someone to come through a door, then you build a long hallway and add a second distant door - and if someone uses that door that is proof that the house doesnt exist?

       According to my previous post, the sun that is higher intersects with clouds that are lower,
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU3tk_Wlw3w">

      </p>
      <p>
       The elevation of a plane changes the angle it can cover and the distance it can see on land; obviosly there is still a horizon; a limit past which further land cannot be seen, but that limit is only extended more if the plane were to rise higher (it can't, planes have a limit of altitude based on weight and velocity).
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you arguing that horizons are caused by the terminal line of a sphere, and that is why sun is always at horizon?

       You're ignoring the part where it can be light and dark on Flat Earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Doesn't light on Flat Earth only travel a certain distance? Otherwise there cannot be a lighted place and a dark place since the Sun would always be seen by line of sight in the sky. Especially when you are on an airplane flying high about the ground.

       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunlight#Measurement">

       provides an illuminance of approximately 98 000 lux (lumens per square meter) on a perpendicular surface at sea level. The illumination of a horizontal surface will be considerably less than this if the Sun is not very high in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       A planes altitude is also no measure of how high the atmospheres go on for. 
An airplane can only go to a maximum altitude of 13km, while the limit of space is not clearly defined, but the atmosphere can go 80-100 times that distance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Exosphere: 700 to 10,000 km (440 to 6,200 miles)
Thermosphere: 80 to 700 km (50 to 440 miles)
Mesosphere: 50 to 80 km (31 to 50 miles)
Stratosphere: 12 to 50 km (7 to 31 miles)
Troposphere: 0 to 12 km (0 to 7 miles)
       </p>
       <p>
        "An atmosphere does not abruptly end at any given height, but becomes progressively thinner with altitude. Also, depending on how the various layers that make up the space around the Earth are defined (and depending on whether these layers are considered part of the actual atmosphere), the definition of the edge of space could vary considerably: If one were to consider the thermosphere and exosphere part of the atmosphere and not of space, one might have to extend the boundary to space to at least 10,000 km (6,200 mi) above sea level. The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line">
         Kármán line
        </a>
        thus is an arbitrary definition based on the following considerations:
       </p>
       <p>
        An aircraft only stays aloft if it constantly travels forward relative to the air (airspeed is not dependent on speed relative to ground), so that the wings can generate lift. The thinner the air, the faster the plane must go to generate enough lift to stay up."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So why  deal only in absolutes: sun is white, everything that comes in view with it becomes WHITE instantaneously. (ridiculous)

       The Moon doesn't cause tides. Look at an animation of the tides across a world map, you'll quickly see that the Moon or any one object causing tides is total bullshit. The tides swirl around all over the place, with some places having absolutely no sea level rises and others have several meters of sea level differences between high and low tide. Look at an animation of it.

       So water just rises and falls essentially at random on Flat Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the moon doesn't cause tides what causes tides on Flat Earth?
      </p>
      <p>
       If they are essentially random why is it that they are highly predictable?
      </p>
      <p>
       Heliocentric  Earth describes the effect quite well.

       Water is the #1 proof of a flat earth. There is nowhere on earth that large bodies of water bend around a curve, it has never once been measured. There has, however, been measurements of water being flat, as you would expect it to be, being that it is always level. They call it "sea level" for a reason.

       Look at the animation of the tides. Do you believe any of the tides in the video are inaccurate? NOAA, NASA's little brother, is hardly going to clear anything up without disinformation. Look at their explanation and then
       <em>
        again
       </em>
       look at the reality of what the tides are really doing and when.they are doing it. Whatever is causing the tides, it's not doing anything on lakes and rivers. The Moon is not affecting any of that, because the Moon does not cause the tides.

       Now your just making stuff up. Of course it's been measured. The curvature of the Earth is 8" per mile.

       Here's a sunrise from 41,000 feet. It looks the same as a sunrise at sea level. Only difference is that the horizon is much further away.

       The measurement of .666 feet per mile? That's not suspicious is it? Btw it's supposedly 8" per mile
       <em>
        squared
       </em>
       , so that at looking straight out at sea level over 3 miles of flat ground, a person's head would be
       <em>
        below your feet
       </em>
       , with the curvature drop of 6 feet. But we don't see that, do we?
      </p>
      <p>
       Rising in altitude on a sphere would mean that all the horizons 360 degree around you would drop as you rise, lowering ever further as you increase altitude, but we don't see that. Neither did the first people to go up in a balloon in the late 1700s, who were astonished to see the horizon rise and remain at eye level, the same with Auguste Piccard, first person to go to the stratosphere, and we still see this today going all the way up to 120,000 feet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Photographs of mountains 275 miles away would be impossible at a curving earth of 8 inches per mile squared. Do the math, and you'll see that the entire city of Chicago should not be seen from across Lake Michigan, but it can. The earth visibly does not curve 8 inches squared per mile, nor does it curve at all.

       If you think gravity is what they say it is (and even they can't explain what it really is, or why it does what it does, or where it's from) and if you believe it's ever been proven that large objects attract each other, other than the absurd Cavendish b.s., then you have some research to do.

       Yea, sorry, no. I have no reason to think the earth is a spinning ball. Space photos, the fakest so-called "proof" of a hypothetical spherical earth, are the easiest way to red pill people about how ridiculously bullshit NASA is, and how suspect their claim of a spherical earth is.

       You're ignoring the part where it can be light and dark on Flat Earth.

       Doesn't light on Flat Earth only travel a certain distance? Otherwise there cannot be a lighted place and a dark place since the Sun would always be seen by line of sight in the sky. Especially when you are on an airplane flying high about the ground.

       provides an illuminance of approximately 98 000 lux (lumens per square meter) on a perpendicular surface at sea level. The illumination of a horizontal surface will be considerably less than this if the Sun is not very high in the sky.
      </p>
      <p>
       A planes altitude is also no measure of how high the atmospheres go on for. 
An airplane can only go to a maximum altitude of 13km, while the limit of space is not clearly defined, but the atmosphere can go 80-100 times that distance.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Exosphere: 700 to 10,000 km (440 to 6,200 miles)
Thermosphere: 80 to 700 km (50 to 440 miles)
Mesosphere: 50 to 80 km (31 to 50 miles)
Stratosphere: 12 to 50 km (7 to 31 miles)
Troposphere: 0 to 12 km (0 to 7 miles)
       </p>
       <p>
        "An atmosphere does not abruptly end at any given height, but becomes progressively thinner with altitude. Also, depending on how the various layers that make up the space around the Earth are defined (and depending on whether these layers are considered part of the actual atmosphere), the definition of the edge of space could vary considerably: If one were to consider the thermosphere and exosphere part of the atmosphere and not of space, one might have to extend the boundary to space to at least 10,000 km (6,200 mi) above sea level. The
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line">
         Kármán line
        </a>
        thus is an arbitrary definition based on the following considerations:
       </p>
       <p>
        An aircraft only stays aloft if it constantly travels forward relative to the air (airspeed is not dependent on speed relative to ground), so that the wings can generate lift. The thinner the air, the faster the plane must go to generate enough lift to stay up."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So why  deal only in absolutes: sun is white, everything that comes in view with it becomes WHITE instantaneously. (ridiculous)
