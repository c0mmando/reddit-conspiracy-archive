       I found these structures interesting when I was poking around on google earth. They are the only other position that would provide the same kind of vantage point as the middle of the Mandalay Bay (or the top, whichever you think).
      </p>
      <p>
       My understanding is that a second shooter in one of the towers would match with health ranger's audio calculation and it would be consistent with the high number of casualties to the right of the stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a peak at the video here, and the one in the description of it. Not saying its 100%, but definately want to hear some feedback on it.

       Yea and the shooter def has a jet pack cause he leaves the tower for one shot and then comes back to stand on top of the rebar omg come on guys. Op give us the full video so we can see if there is some other light in the video causing this artifact.

       Actually, there is something to this criticism. I managed to find an image of the towers construction in google earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can post it here later for those interested. It appears that the construction was done with scaffolding on the outside, although there are doors going into the towers, it is likely that there is a way up inside of there for maintainance. It was originally for a ferris wheel, so there probably is a ladder.
      </p>
      <p>
       It would seem that the person would be semi visible in the rebar, yes. Unless extra stuff was built up there to provide cover inside the caged bit

       Probably waaay more than what you asking for, but here goes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really think it's muzzle flash from a shooter -
       <strong>
        at least not at the top of the tower.
       </strong>
       It's more likely a helicopter in the distance (It's hard to tell from that short snippet.)  Or it could be a light because it's near the airport like another poster said.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had done some research on these towers a few days ago and posted about them in another subreddit.  I'm just reposting what I posted at the other subreddit, even though some of the information is stuff y'all already know.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's
       <strong>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/6Mdq3bc">
         a screen shot
        </a>
       </strong>
       from the night of the concert a couple of minutes before the shooting started.  You can see the columns in the background.
      </p>
      <p>
       They're also depicted in
       <strong>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/x8AyiHb">
         this diagram showing the Mandalay Bay and the site of the concert.
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       I wondered what they were, so I went to Google and started looking around on Street View.
       <strong>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/mBcVy3B">
         Here's a daytime view from Google Street View
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The two cars are on S. Las Vegas Blvd. (The Strip) and that other street separating the back of the main stage and the construction site is Mandalay Bay Blvd.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/pFOS4V9">
         Here's a zoomed in view of the sign
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       So I went searching for Compass Investments Las Vegas and found out what those columns are.  There were plans back in 2011 to build an a retail/entertainment development that would have had 7 amusement park rides.  The main attraction was supposed to be a 500 foot tall Observation Wheel.  Like a Ferris Wheel but it would have had 32 enclosed gondolas each seating 24 people.  In the center of the wheel was to be the largest LED advertising screen in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/pWaE0B9">
         Here's a rendering of what it was supposed to look like
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Note the two aviation fuel tanks on the right hand side of the photo.  There were reports that those were hit by bullets, but did not go all the way through.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've read comments in other places that these columns have interior stairways, but I can't definitively prove that, but it seems logical. If the Wheel had been built it seems there would have had to be a way to get up to the middle part if the LED screen needed to be serviced or repaired.  Also, if you look at the bottom of the towers on Google earth, you can clearly see doors.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="http://archive.is/nG7JM">

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a photo when they were under construction.  You can see the doors in it, too.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>

        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       That would indicate to me that the columns are not solid all the way through.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/cSDPxQ8">
         Here's another zoomed-in cropped sharpened photo of the columns after the project was abandoned
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       What are those random black squares on the face of the columns?  To me they look like openings  (like a window but with no glass) but I can't really tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's another view from Google Earth:
      </p>

      <p>
       Here's
       <strong>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/XCWkU5V">
         a rendering showing how the columns interacted with the Wheel and the building.
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       The column on the right hand side closest to the Doritos sign looks like it has square things all up and down it but I can’t tell what they're supposed to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also - here's two videos about the SkyVue project.

      </p>
      <p>
       (Watch it in full screen.)  It shows the whole area from several different angles and you can see the Mandalay Bay, the concert grounds (which I think was a parking lot back then) and the airport.

       This one walks you through the building and you can see how the columns interacted with the retail building that was to have been the base of the wheel.  You get an idea of how big around the columns were because there are people in the fly-through video and the columns have a much bigger circumference than a person.

       I'm not saying there was or was not a shooter in those towers.  I'm just giving all the information I've been able to find out about them and I'll let you guys decide.

       No you're good, but my gut tells me that isn't a helicopter. If its not a gun then its a light of some kind, attached to the top of the tower. I would expect it to be red... and pulsing regularly. That's where I start to worry about it honestly. Either something doesn't make sense or these videos are doctored; that's always possible. Seems unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were an aircraft wouldn't there be some kind of colored light too I'd think?

       What I did was go to the video where its slowed down, and then I slowed
       <strong>
        <em>
         that
        </em>
       </strong>
       video down.  I think you're right.  I don't think it's a helicopter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's definitely not a light attached to the tower.
      </p>

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Start at the beginning.  It's the full song that was sung before the shooting started.  You can pretty much see the towers for most of the three minutes, and I never ever saw a light flashing at the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, at 2:26 a helicopter emerges on the left hand side of the screen and tracks across the sky, disappearing behind the left side of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, and then reemerging from the right side and you can see it as it passes between the Mandalay Bay and The Delano.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't see any red lights, but it's pretty far away. But it's
       <em>
        moving
       </em>
       across the sky, whereas the light at the top of the tower in the slowed down video isn't moving.  It's just flashing a couple of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the only other thing I could possibly think of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at this photo.

       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same daytime photo of the towers that are on the left hand side of the slowed down video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hit your Control Key and your "+" at the same time and keep doing that until the photo is blown up 300%.  Look at the rebar on the tower on the left.  Near the top left hand side of the rebar - what is that white-looking thing?  If it's some kind of reflective metal, maybe a passing light reflected off of it in the night time shots.  But that's all I can come up with.

       I don't know.  Very interesting topic.

       It definitely caught my eye because we haven't been provided with video evidence of the 32nd floor shots, other than broken windows. whereas there are multiple other locations with possible flashes. So we have to look at all of them, and continue looking.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I mean just look at those things... I'm not drawing any conclusions, I'm just saying at the very least they look suspicious af.

       Here's something else.  Go back up to that "first shots" video I posted.  Start at about the 3:05 mark.  Watch the left side of the left column about a fourth of the way up.  At about 3:08 you see a white flash.  But you don't hear the first shot until 4 seconds later, so that seems a little long.

       I noticed also. My working theory is that there may be more than 2, and that some may have used supressors and sub sonic rounds. This would keep the focus on the hotel.  Thats based on literally nothing, other than the fact that none of the possible muzzle flashes we've located match up perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
       So dont take me too seriously on that. But if it were my plan, I'd try to keep that position quiet. I do think we'd hear suppressed shots in videos if this were correct though. I havent found any confirmation of this yet.

       It seems none of the possible muzzle flashes match up 100% of the time. Perhaps we need to post all of the videos with proposed flashes somewhere so we can all figure out where the actual shooters are. It isnt making sense right now...

       Well here's a really good clear one I haven't seen before and it's coming from a helicopter.  It's clear, too - not at all hard to see.  (Watch it in full screen mode)

       Those aren't muzzle flashes... the lights on those helis are consistent with the flashes seen in these videos. I don't always agree with end times but his explanation in the beginning of this video is pretty clear. The heli isn't a shooter:

       No there 100% was a shooting. But paddock isn't the guy. I've seen enough on him to discount his involvment completely.
      </p>
      <p>
       First, the bar photo is very clearly not a real photo, all you have to do is blow it up on your screen and sharpen it a bit, its very poorly thrown together... some dumbass used a regular lasso tool to select around his hair and also to select Marylou. And it just looks horrible to be honest. Marys elbo also is fucked up from being poorly selected.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, there are videos out there that show the contents of a paid background check on Steven Paddock (and we really at this point need to see one on the security guard), and there was a multimillionaire steve paddock, with a pilots licence, and all the same 30 or so adresses. So the background check showed his linked-in account, and it had a different freaking guy on it. A guy that even looks like he worked in defence. You can see it in his face I swear... you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it. Look up "Will the real steve paddock please stand up" on YT. The linked in is gone but it was captured in the video...
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, I swear I can tell his brother is full of shit. Look at all the interviews with him, and tell me he's not on some shady shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, the death photo doesn't make any sense at all. That guy doesn't look like either the bar guy or the Steve Paddock in the background check.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also until now was completely convinced that there were no shots from the 32nd floor but now we're wrestling with the Navy seal guy's video... lets see whats up with that.

       There is a video that shows a muzzle flash from one of the floor 32 windows, in case you haven't seen it. There's a bunch of people taking cover behind a white truck and while some douche is looking for a gun inside of it you can clearly see a muzzle flash at what I assume is the point the shooter is going for the fuel tanks.

       Okay. That is literally the first I've seen of that. Good find. But I have to throw up some possible red flags... This appears to be a video by the ex-navy seal guy Dan Bilzerian.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that this was posted so late doesn't quite make sense, it's not the original. Need to know where's the original on that, when it was posted.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you look in the comments you'll immediately see people pointing out a huge problem with the video... He doesn't do shit. So that's a little odd...The other videos I've seen with him also stand out as being very peculiar. The one that shows his face definitely made me feel like he's full of shit somehow. Not 100% sure what's his deal but I don't trust him personally.
      </p>
      <p>
       We should be able to find another video of this for sure, and if it's the bit where he was going semi it should be fairly easy to figure out which exact shots these were. So I'm going to look into that. This is needs to be corroborated by a video not by Dan, because I'm honestly very suspicious of him.

       I agree the dude is shady and a huge douche, but he didn't even seem to notice the flash either at the time or after. It was posted to his facebook a couple days after when he got his ego hurt just to prove he "tried to get a gun" or whatever. I saw the original video on his facebook, and it was the same video, at least the muzzle flash part is, but that's not to say someone couldn't have added it, but I believe it is real. I would say you're likely to only find muzzle flash on single fire shots because those are the weapons he would be using the bipod with closer to the window. The bump fire weapons had extendo magazines that go down further than the bipod, so he'd be standing or kneeling using the broomsticks for those. Judging by how far away from the window his rifle stash and magazine stash is, he was likely standing far enough away that you're unlikely to see muzzle flash during any of the bump fire.

       Right. I hear ya, definately agree. Its most likely real. But it is the only video I have seen with that in it, and its just so clear I find it hard to believe someone would wait to post a video with that in it. His body language was all wrong IMO so I wouldnt put anything past him, but I usually dont assume videos are fake. It seems a little off thats all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lets find some confirmation here. Im working on it slowly but surely. Got alot of other pressing things going on but definately want to figure out where the shots came from for myself. There definately is other videos out there with that window if that one is real.

       That looks low compared to the pictures with the windows shot out.  You should be able to see the top of the vertical lights not too far above.
Maybe it's my eyes

       This right here is why I get so pissed off about

       that clog up the feed. This is an excellent find, posted yesterday, and I'm only just finding it now after going through and "hiding" 95% of the threads in the main feed. Thank you for sharing.

       That was the one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I slowed that one down and was able to get
       <strong>
        <a href="https://imgur.com/yae85jK">
         this screen shot
        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Look closely at that "light."  it seems to have something extending downwards from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then look at this photo of the same towers in the daytime:

        </a>
       </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the tower on the left.  There seems to be something that looks white up in the rebar on the left hand side.  It looks more boxy at the top and then gets thinner as it extends downward.  What is it?  Is it something also made of metal but with a different finish?  A more reflective finish?  If so, the "flash" we're seeing may have been from a passing light reflecting off of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just don't know.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the video you found is definitely the one posted by the OP.

       Oh yeah I see that. Good point. Hmm. I had become kind of invested in the idea of a second shooter in the SkyVue towers after reading through all of your research findings. The biggest weakness in that theory imo was the Jesus Campos story – that he heard someone in 32-135 was drilling at 9:59, then that person stopped drilling and started shooting into the hallway, then turned and started shooting out the window at 10:05. That (if true) implies some degree of spontaneity on the shooter's part... unless it's simply a massive coincidence and Campos just happened to be on that floor, outside that suite, at the very moment a multi-person shooting operation was set to begin. I don't know. But this new reflective thingy you've identified at the top of the towers is now an even bigger weakness to that theory.
