(literally have seen several people wanting to do away with the 2nd amendment due to LV....) A  lesser but still major evil would be getting this law passed under the guise of helping security and finding motives of guys like these (even if it wouldnt help in this situation) This whole situation is rotten and given the timing it seems VERY suspicious in the least...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Biggest hints paddock was setup probably is the leaked crime scene photos. Looks like a center of mass shot that killed him, autopsy said no brain damage I think. So mr gambling,traveling,millionare guy while actively gambling the days before 8 hrs at a time does the shooting in slippers, wearing zero tactical gear at all and no armor. Reports said armor was in the room. Ok so he shot down hallway then outside and then shot himself for no immediate reason and was by that time of many mins of no gunfire he still wore no gear/armor ? None of that makes sense if he was the avid gun nut he seemed to be. The 20+ rifles for one guy is a ridiculously massive red flag that something very unusual was going on. That many guns for 1 person only would have added risk to the plan. He is super genius at covering all tracks yet risks it all with all that gear in the room. I could see 3-6 weapons being around but more than that and its just a burden to move. Official story was he might have planned to escape, well escape and leave all the gear in the room? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Paddock was obviously selling weapons. This is obvious for a couple of reasons:</p>

<p>1) Doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re a gun nut, or somebody planning a mass shooting: there is no reason to have as many guns as Paddock did. You could not even use them all. There&#39;s just no reason to bring that many weapons to a hotel room.</p>

<p>2) There&#39;s no way Paddock made a living gambling against house machines. His income needs to come from elsewhere. The idea that somebody is comped for winning too much money at a casino is absurd. You are comped for losing money. They don&#39;t comp people who count cards or take advantage of video poker machines. They fucking throw them out of the casino. Paddock made his money elsewhere and pissed it away at the casino. Hence the THOUSANDS of dollars of sushi and free rooms.</p>

<p>3) A Hotel is a perfect cover for the sale of weapons. Nobody would turn their heads at many suitcases coming in. Nobody would turn their heads at a lot of suitcases coming out.</p>

<p>Paddock either sold weapons or presided over the sale of weapons. As to why he shot a bunch of people: who the hell knows. But let&#39;s not pretend that there&#39;s just this guy who went to a hotel with a LOT of weapons and made a living beating house gambling machines, and was rewarded by the hotel in the process. You&#39;d have to be retarded to believe that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It happens all the time.  The media is the propaganda arm of the establishment.  The establishment fucked up in Vegas so the media dropped the story to help cover the establishment.</p>

<p>Dylan Roof shot up a church full of black people.  That story was talked about for months.  A little while back a black man shot up a church full of white people.  The majority of Americans don&#39;t even know that happened.</p>

<p>The media has been doing this for decades now, at least.  It&#39;s not just fake news stories that shape public opinion.  The media has the power to highlight or suppress any news story they want, thus shaping public opinion.  </p>

<p>The thought of government interfering with free press should offend anyone who cares about freedom.  The simple fact of the matter is our press is not free.  It&#39;s controlled by the establishment.  Therefore something needs to be done about it.</p>

Users here tend to brake off into teams and tackle the subject they are most interested in.  We&#39;re covering more ground this way, and nobody has the right to poo-poo a subject under the guise of it being over exposed (uh-hem, Seth Rich..).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s unbelievable to me that this mass shooting is now getting buried in the headlines that are now being dominated by Hollywood sex stories.  In my mind, that cinches it for me.  </p>

<p>The real painful issue is dealing with everyone else around me that took the story, nodded their head &quot;what a shame. What a crazy man&quot; and moved on as the MSM told them to. So NOW we have a story that has changed but they moved on and almost every MSM institution has as well so like Sandy Hook, we get left with the &quot;OH YOU DOUBT THE STORY?  NICE TINFOIL HAT BRO&quot;.  It&#39;s so obvious that this story STINKS with controversy, lies and cover ups. </p>
