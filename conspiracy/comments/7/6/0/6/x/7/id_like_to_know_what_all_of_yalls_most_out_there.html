<p>For me, its probably the reincarnation trap harvesting negative energy as a resource thing. Its honestly a very hard thing to figure out because it has to do with what happens after you die haha.   </p>

<p>I suspend belief on all things I can&#39;t find concrete evidence for, but as soon as I heard this theory it resonated with me for some reason. </p>

<p>Ahh I remember the days I thought the NWO was outlandish!   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not that I&#39;m researching it, but my most out there theory is that there are competing future timelines and people come back in time to try to ensure their timeline and kill off the ancestors of their enemies. Basically the idea is that at the end of the universe only some souls can win. They use time travel to ensure that they are the winners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Black Cube UFOs</p>

<p>This event occurred in 2011 and has haunted me everyday since. I work in networking and all of ours are late. I usually get off around 2am and then I am up for a few hours before I go to bed. This evening I got off work and it was raining really bad on my way home. When I got home, by chance, the clouds broke and I stepped outside to have a quick smoke. One of my buddies called me and we were chatting about work. It was still not raining and there were low lying clouds. There are orange street lights in Allen and they were reflecting off the bottom of the clouds creating an artificial light. There was a pretty good breeze whipping around, but no rain. I was facing the west and I look to my right and I see a black cube moving out of the north and traveling south at about 60-80mph. It was moving with a corner forward. This thing was huge. I was astonished to the core of my soul. I sat speechless for a few seconds knowing that I was seeing something amazing. It was 80-100ft tall. It was a black cube in shape and looked like a rough stone surface. On the side of the cube was a border and within the border was a circular symbol, if that&#39;s what it even was. It looked like if you were to draw a circular maze. It was disturbing the air behind it and created a vaporous trail spinning behind it and then disappearing. There was absolutely no sound. None. If you know Dallas, it was traveling in the direction of southbound 75Central Expressway towards downtown. I told my buddy what I had seen and he lives a few miles south. I fumbled over my words telling him and asked him to go outside to see if he could see it. He went out to the middle of his street and looked in the direction that it was coming from. After about 5 minutes it started to rain again. He stood out in the rain for another 15 minutes but never saw it. Good friend..lol.. Anyways, no one can ever tell me that I didn&#39;t see what I saw that night. I have been ridiculed and laughed at, but I know what I saw. It is almost a relief at this point to know that they are really here. I have been a long time lurker and I had to get this off of my chest. I have been searching &quot;black cube ufo&quot; for years now, every single day. I cannot stop thinking about it. I have to see it again. Thanks for listening. edit:Allen, TX (near Dallas) edit: Sorry for the potato quality drawing. I could always take more time and sketch something more detailed, but this is the gist of it. It was below the clouds. This is a sketch as it passed directly in front of me. It looked like the entire cube was carved from a single stone. It had a border along its edges and a circular pattern in the middle. Think of a view of a circular maze from above. Also of interesting note, no lights from the craft either. I was expecting a light show, but I will settle with what I got to witness any day. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/2pgjxw/i_have_seen_a_low_flying_black_cube_ufo/</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/">https://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/5q6uwf/my_low_flying_black_cube_ufo_encounter_in/</a>

    <div class="md"><p>OP I am thinking the same! I feel that it is a choice to come to the physical realm, we litterally &quot;will&quot; ourselves here.  once born we get to experience life in the physical.  When we die we should return to where we came from but I believe people get stuck here and in the next realm (spirit) for multiple reasons.  The elite are creating a world where spirits are attatched to the physical be it gluttony, sex, money, etc. If you dont find yourself and know who you are, you cannot return to your true existance.  it has to do with conciousness itself but im not exactly sure how.  I just know this to be true and have been studying for months now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>no never heard of him.  a lot of what i talk about is just from what i feel.  I cant explain it but I just know things, at least idid when i was a kid.  i stumbled upon the occult when i was young because it was the only thing that could help explain my lucid dreaming and out of body experiences i was having at random.  I stopped that line of thinking in my life and did things how i was supposed to and just ignored that stuff.  since then i have meditated and did yoga but nothing too extensive.  then i turned 30 and for some reason i started to realize i wasnt me.  I was living for the matrix so to speak and since april of this year all i have been doing is researching how to better meditate and have OOBE so I can experiment with dmt and get closer to answers, not only for myself but for mankind.  If i could share some meaning with people i think it could spread and help undo this negative world of ours</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Our solar system formed by two systems merging, and there were two suns.</p>

<p>Saturn was one of these suns, and was referred to as &quot;the best sun&quot; in ancient texts. Possibly even &quot;God&quot;. And then it &quot;died&quot; in a nova, spawning religions and myths.</p>

<p>Earth has a lot of water; Saturn&#39;s rings are 99% frozen water.</p>

<p>Earth was a moon of Saturn.</p>

<p>The sun&#39;s gravity eventually overcame Saturn and pulled Earth into its current orbit.</p>

<p>The great deluge (flood) mentioned across various ancient texts may be related to this event.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the gist of it.</p>

<p>have you ever thought that this existence is one big echo chamber, or hall of mirrors? that during it we get exposed to our behaviours reflected back at ourselves?  that if you are in tune, you&#39;re like a part of a cymatics pattern that&#39;s found a resonant balance?  thus the negative energy harvesting thing you&#39;re talking about is just a function of the energy you put out.  you get what you give.</p>
