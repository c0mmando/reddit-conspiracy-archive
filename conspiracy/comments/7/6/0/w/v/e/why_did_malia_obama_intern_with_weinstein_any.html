       This is what shocks me.  Obama was the President when Malia Obama was an intern with Weinstein.  I believe he was the President for the 7 prior years.  Presidents receive incredible intelligence.  People around the President are always scrutinized closely by government.  If the President's daughter was seeking employment I would assume all locations, personnel, and history would be reviewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       With all of this scrutiny and intelligence how could the former POTUS not know about any of the trouble Weinstein had gotten into over the past 10 or 20 years?  If it's legendary and well known in the Hollywood establishment how does the intelligence community not know and by proxy how did President Obama not know?  Just speaking on a very human level, if I was a father and I had even a HINT that the man who ran the company was a sicko I would NEVER allow my daughter to work there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've never met Harvey Weinstein but seeing him in photos with women he looks "rapey" and creepy.  Now imagine being Clinton or Obama and spending time with him.  Clinton literally lived next door to Weinstein. Obama and Clinton aren't comparing notes on Weinstein or getting any weird vibes from him?
      </p>
      <p>
       So basically everyone in Hollywood knows about sleezy Weinstein except for the Clintons and Obamas who are two of the most influential and connected people in the world.  Obama is so unaware of it that he allows his daughter to work for Weinstein.  No intelligence ever surfaced that suggested THE PRESIDENT might not want his daughter to work for a man who settled 10 out of court cases?
      </p>
      <p>
       This stuff is evil and disgusting.  Hollywood is the epicenter.  The Clintons are tied to all of it.  Obama just had his daughter intern there.  Obama was the fuckin PRESIDENT and he didn't know from ANY intelligence that Harvey Weinstein was a scumbag?  This is all shocking news to them?
      </p>
      <p>
       What's going on here?

       Well it makes sense you consider the rumors to be true that they aren't really his kids. But I know that sounds like a stretch, but I couldn't think any other reason.

       RIGHT.  They could.  But if you make that assumption then you have to also accept that the Obamas knew about Harvey's indescretions and not only did nothing about it but also sent their daughter into the viper pit.  Why would any parent ever take that chance especially when your daughter could intern at ANY OTHER COMPANY in the entire world?

       Its more easy to think critically of it when youve known about it for years.. this is the stuff everyday joe really dont understand, and it is so so rampant. but this approch, the obama/Weinstein connection, that is so immensly damaging that it could be the turningpoint for anyone. will start to ask everyone this, so Thank you for the well put post

       I think that the president has no real power. Look at Obama's face when he took office compared to after a few years. He looks disgusted and ashamed at a very personal level. It's in his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect that he
       <em>
        had
       </em>
       to send her there as a sort of hostage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also think the only reason they haven't done the same to Trump is that the know he is insane and that he wouldn't/couldn't keep his mouth shut.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president might seem like a powerful job, but when they basically say - we'll kill your family in an accident - what is he supposed to do?

       Left out? You can honestly say you think Obama had to send his daughter off to some rape den, but you can't picture Donald Trump being at all involved in the rapiness? He is one of the rapiest looking people I can think of. His own wife looks creeped out by him. His ex-wives aren't allowed to talk about their relationship with him, and you can't, in your honest mind, involve him in some rape conspiracy?

       I don't know why Obama would let his daughter intern at that company knowing what apparently everyone 'in the know' knew... but I also wonder Weinstein is being outed on this level now? Why now? It's a wonderful thing, but this has been going on for DECADES and yet no one in Hollywood was willing to support the victims... until now.
      </p>
      <p>
       What exactly happened to get Weinstein cut out of the Hollywood club?
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe someone powerful enough finally had a reason to care about stopping this predator.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying I have any concrete reason to think Malia was victimized by Weinstein as an intern, but I do think no one had really stopped to question the sudden, dramatic social turn in Hollywood away from Weinstein. Why now??

       She worked as an intern on film and television sets for the Weinstein production company, she did not work with Harvey himself.  She is interested in film, her Dad used his connections. It's plain as day, also she had a secret service detail that tails her 24/7.
