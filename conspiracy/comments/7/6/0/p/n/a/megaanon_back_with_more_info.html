<p>As much as people believe this is a larp, their post history has information that could explain the bizarre nature of everything going in. </p>

<p>Highly interesting to take a look at</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I TOLD YOU about Kelly&#39;s missing phone on purpose...</p>

<p>I never claimed to be breaking it to you.. I was highlighting it to show you WHY the timing of weak and specific MSM coverage on it last week, would later prove important and why his phone being deemed &quot;compromised&quot; would later come in handy. </p>

<p>Kelly&#39;s team sent a memo out almost 2 months ago, stating his phone had been misplaced and asked anyone who knew the whereabouts, had seen it, or had it, to return it. By the time the memo had been distributed, it had already been &quot;missing&quot; for 3 business days. </p>

<p>Kelly&#39;s phone was never misplaced or missing. He fucking left it behind on purpose, targeting these last 8 young staffers/admins who are Obama and Priebus holdovers, Kelly had suspected were leaking, over the month since taking the position. </p>

<p>Those staffers gave the phone to those they&#39;ve been manipulated to think they really &quot;work for&quot;, and they used their shady, backdoor, illegal NSA channels to get into the phone. Knowing this would happen, Kelly and Trump falsified private communications that depicted fake tensions and increasing disagreements, that lead to the passed along leaks of MSM narratives that Kelly hates Trump, doesn&#39;t agree, tries to contain his tweets and the final nail in the coffin?! Kelly&#39;s fake resignation request. All done to officially ID the last of the Obama/Priebus comms office leakers and the MSM channels they directly and illegally fed secured leaks to. </p>

<p>Leaks can work in both parties favors though. Over the last two weeks, Kelly and team alerted 6 media outlets/publications to use caution and tread lightly about unconfirmed rumors of retirement/firings. TODAY, he PUBLICLY THANKED THOSE THEY SECRETLY ALERTED, for their discretion as related to unconfirmed WH reports.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This was also further down. </p>

<p>Now, they, the guilty, ALL KNOW WHO THEY ARE and this will close the case on any doubt the NSA abuses their power/access... even on the Presudent and his admin. </p>

<p>You will now start to see the dismantlement of the MSM as we know it, formal indictments, arrests and charges will be made against those ID&#39;ed and directly involved and you&#39;ll never have to hear about &quot;wiretappings&quot; and &quot;unmaskings&quot; again. </p>

<p>When it all comes out, Trump will stick it like a giant fuck you to all those who questioned his ability to lead by calling out Kelly&#39;s lack of comm experience as a &quot;military general&quot;, by saying things like,&quot;THIS IS EXACTLY WHY YOU HIRE A CUNNING, STRATEGIC GENERAL, AS YOUR CHIEF OF STAFF. MAGA&quot;. </p>

<p>3 disclosures - FBI, CIA and the FED. It&#39;s ironic to say it, I realize this... but buckle up y&#39;all, it really is happening. In reality, it&#39;s BEEN happening. &quot;You&#39;ll see&quot;</p>

<p>Oh and the &quot;one thing&quot; left for North Korea is cutting the Iran deal. That&#39;s what he&#39;s referring to. Iran is the last real financial leg, North Korea has to stand on. Iran funds arms they buy from NK with THE US SANCTION $$$, THE IRAN NUKE DEAL LIFTED. Iran is arming themselves by using sanction money we lifted and gave them back, to buy arms from NK. The generals have been meeting weekly in the war room after hours, for the last 6 weeks, not just the last 2 weeks as the media has reported. They don&#39;t meet about an NK threat, they meet about the threat they expect Iran will pose to our national security/our assets abroad (this is why we look like we&#39;ve been cozying up to Saudi and announced an air base in Israel 3 weeks ago).</p>
