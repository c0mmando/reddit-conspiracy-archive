        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>And regardless of guilt or innocence, poor people consistently get harsher sentences for crimes that are way less serious than those rich people are accused of, all because they couldn&#39;t afford adequate representation. </p>

<p>Public defenders are overworked, underpaid and have case loads that are in the hundreds. The majority don&#39;t have the time to negotiate with prosecutors for a good plea deal and most don&#39;t have the time to go through each clients discovery to try to find legal discrepancies that would help their client get a better deal. It&#39;s not that they&#39;re bad attorneys... they just don&#39;t have enough time or energy in their day to go above and beyond like private defense attorneys do.</p>

<p>The more money you spend, the better the outcome EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not rich people&#39;s fault our system gives them preferential treatment. If anything, I blame the government, prosecutors and public defense laws for letting it get to this point.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely... I think part of the problem though is that most people don&#39;t understand how the system actually works and they trust that our system is fair bc we&#39;ve been duped for so long. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sadly you&#39;re completely right. It&#39;s the systems fault but who do you think creates the system? It&#39;s not all rich people, but the people who make the rules are always rich. Rich straight white men make the rules. The biggest lie is that the government serves the people; in reality it serves the elite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have some sympathy for the ADA&#39;s and PD&#39;s.  X years into the job the file for 2500th guy who beat up his girlfriend in your career lands on your desk.  The police didn&#39;t frame him.  He&#39;s just an angry drunk and they have a fucked up relationship.  OK, he has one prior conviction, that means he pleads to _______, gets probation and agrees to attend anger management classes.  The ADA&#39;s real job is to explain to the judge that the situation is exactly as it appears.  And the PD&#39;s job is to convince the defendant that this is just how things work.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s a sad system, yes, but if you have an alternative plan that doesn&#39;t amount to &quot;guy doesn&#39;t get drunk and beat up his girlfriend, so this didn&#39;t come up to begin with&quot; I&#39;m all ears.  </p>
