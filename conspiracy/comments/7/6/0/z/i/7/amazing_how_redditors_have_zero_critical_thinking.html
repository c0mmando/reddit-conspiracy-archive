       They downvote any contradictory information.
      </p>
      <p>
       They villainize people so viciously like no other subject I can think of. Such anger and hate, using cuss words, all over vaccines that they likely didn't even receive themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet they know little about vaccines in general. They think it's just pure virus+sterile water or something. They can't tell you what's in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       They don't know about the MTHFR gene, the safe amount of aluminum, SV40, the aborted fetal cells that serve as vaccine growth medium, the neurological consequences of over-excitation of the immune system, the fact that you can't sue a vaccine manufacturer, what a VAERS report is, the synergistic effects of combining vaccines, what polysorbate-80 does to the blood brain barrier, none of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       All they know is the narrative they've been fed and they parrot it so well. How did it get this bad? How did tptb rile up so much vitriol in people?
      </p>
      <p>
       What we SHOULD be angry about is having to inject our kids every two months starting at birth, not knowing what's behind the needle. And to prevent illnesses like chickenpox? Polio, which went away on its own once we invented indoor plumbing? The flu? Give me a break!
      </p>
      <p>
       AMA about vaccines.

      </p>
      <p>
       You do understand that an image search of graphs means nothing without data? I'm not saying you're necessarily wrong but that's probably the worst example of "evidence" I can imagine. I love how you're being condescending too, as if you didn't just provide the most juvenile example of proof I have ever seen. I mean half of those graphs don't even have fucking axis labels...

       No, but you're here to spread information (that's what you're trying to do by linking us to information in the first place), and what you're doing right now is spreading
       <em>
        mis
       </em>
       information.  You're too thick to realize that
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       are the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you're doing right now is deflecting. You know nothing about the subject but you like to pretend that you do, so instead of trying to convince people you're right with actual information, you make vague hints about how much more you know about the subject without actually demonstrating any knowledge at all. And you have the stomach to be pretentious about it too. And your comment contained literally 0 information, most of those graphs are decades old, based on bogus science or completely untraceable, and YOU are responsible for spreading them around for gullible people to look at. Shame on you.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's more important for you to feel outraged about something than it is to actually know something about it then by all means. But don't try to stick that shit on other people.

       Show me how what I linked to is misinformation or bogus science. Those charts are based off of various countries mortality data. The charts are linked to the articles that provide that information. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to point and click the link and get the info for themselves. If anyone is spreading misinformation, it is you for calling the info I gave bogus without any proof/evidence to back up your claim.

       First of all, you gave literally zero info. Zero. You gave us a page with mixed evidence of "vaccines are bad" and "vaccines are good". You are literally not even making a statement. If you're going to expose some kind of conspiracy you are convinced exists, put some fucking work into it. No one is going to believe you when you pull middle-school shit like this.

       Second of all, I'm not going to go through a thousand google images pages just so I can find the one credible report and pick it apart just because you are too lazy to find it yourself. If you're going to debate a topic you can't just say "google it", it's lazy, it's irresponsible and it doesn't do you any favors when it comes to credibility. What you're doing right now is basically asking me to do your work for you.

       But fine, expect me to pick apart thousands of infographics without sources or axis labels based on nothing but "ur wrong google it". Pathetic.

       You haven't provided any evidence... This is why conspiracy theorists have a bad reputation. Because people like you ruin their credibility. Leave it to the pros, I'm open minded to anyone that actually puts effort into proving something. You're a bandwagoner is what you are. You have no idea how true any of this is but you want to be part of the club, hence the google link...
      </p>
      <p>
       Linking to a google page is as much evidence as writing it on a piece of paper and handing it to me. You're not taking a stance to any of the evidence because you didn't provide any.

       Ok, you obviously have an agenda to discredit anyone antivax. I've provided plenty of pages that back up what I say yet you barely provide anything except your word. If anyone gives conspiracy theorists a bad name, it is someone crying foul (you) and doing nothing to refute the claims the other person (me) makes with actual evidence. All you have done is say "not true and take my word for it". Enjoy your vaccines and paying pharmaceutical companies for a slow death.

       Yeah call me a shill, ignore everything that doesn't fit your foilhat theory. What's wrong with basing your opinion on actual evidence?  Something you wouldn't be familiar with I guess.

      <p>
       You know, just because this is r/conspiracy doesn't mean every crazy theory is true. In this forum, it's more important than ever to be sincere and critical. Show me some pub.med articles, not this middle school powerpoint presentation shit. The scientific method is about collecting data, then making a conclusion. What you're doing is making a conclusion, then looking for data to fit that. That's now how you do science, in fact it's the exact opposite of science.

       Talk about repeating yourself. Everything I have said and believe is backed by evidence which I shared. Yoi have not. I did not call you a shill but if the shoe fits...

      <p>
       Your comments about the articles I shared shows you took no time to look at them at all. There were plenty of scientific papers and studies which you completely ignored
      </p>

       Also, ridiculing "tinfoil hat theories" proves to me you don't really belong on this site as your mind is already predetermined to believe everything you've been spoonfed and taught by those that want to hold us down (i.e. big gov, the pharmaceutical companies, military industrial complex, etc.).

       This has been a complete waste of my time as you have added nothing of substance but offered plenty of insults (which normally happens when you have no legs to stand on). So good luck to you as I'm done with this conversation.

       Had to respond one last time due to your hypocritical comments. Never said you were American...looks as if you are the one making assumptions. I have read those articles so once again you are assuming something while accusing me of doing so. I'm not too proud to admit when I'm wrong but in this case I am definitely not wrong, have presented articles supporting why I am not wrong in my beliefs, and once again you are making assumptions about me.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems all you can do is make assumptions and judgements about my character since you have nothing to offer to this conversation to back up your views on vaccines. You deflect away from anything I have said that you can't refute by criticizing me. You are very much a walking, talking, breathing definition of a hypocrite.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for pub.med, if you only accept one source for information, that greatly enhances my understanding as to why you are so closed-minded.

       Helpful advice for future encounters with others on this site, if the only thing you can do is criticize and attack the messenger instead of the message, then you have already lost the debate as you show you can bring nothing of your own to the table.

       That's funny considering your original comment "attacked" the other guy as much as I'm "attacking" you, you're being condescending towards him for no reason other than to stroke your own ego.

       You haven't taken a stance towards any of the articles on the page you linked, in fact like half of them are pro-vaccination, how am I supposed to know which articles you agree with or not?

       You seem somewhat delusional. Military industrial complex is defined as a country's military establishment and those industries producing arms or other military materials, regarded as a powerful vested interest. Every country has a military, hence military industrial complex is a broad term describing countries run by the militaries.

      <p>
       None of the articles I've shared are pro-vaccine but I wouldn't expect you to know since you didn't take the time to look at or read any of them. I will however apologize as I was sharing articles with a different person and confused your conversation with his (posted under belisarius's comments). The articles and statements I made to belisarius in this comment section completely back up my views with plenty of evidence since you seem interested in what I post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how my original comment attacked anyone as I was sharing charts with articles linked to them explaining exactly how smallpox and polio declined before vaccination. If anyone did attacking in this exchange, when you look in the mirror you are looking at them.

       I live in Sweden and I can tell you, our country is in no shape or form controlled by the military. In fact, we are probably among the top 5 countries in Europe where the military have the least amount of power and influence in civilian society. Just because Americans are scared of the MIC doesn't mean other nations have to be, especially in a nation of &lt;10 million where no industry is big enough to influence public opinion directly.

        None of the articles I've shared are pro-vaccine but I wouldn't expect you to know since you didn't take the time to look at or read any of them. I will however apologize as I was sharing articles with a different person and confused your conversation with his (posted under belisarius's comments). The articles and statements I made to belisarius in this comment section completely back up my views with plenty of evidence since you seem interested in what I post.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Yes, that certainly explains the confusion here, I had real trouble figuring out what articles you were referring to (as several of the google images articles on the first page ARE pro-vaccine). The only thing you actually did comment on in our comment chain was Polio cases, and you never did link any articles on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       From your other comments, here's an excellent example of a credible source:
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609067">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23609067
       </a>
       (Lo and behold, it's actually PubMed!). The article contains a lot of reasonable assumptions aside from their attempt to link Aluminum with Autism (vaccines causes autism is based on a hoax experiment and has been debunked hundreds of times, the doctor responsible lost his license for it.). Additionally, one of their big arguments is that a health official testified in court that Aluminum is dangerous for children in 1927. That is the same year that aluminum's adjuvant effect was discovered. How could he claim to know this less than a year after the effect was discovered? And bear in mind this was 90 years ago, we know much more about the elements than we did then, hell we went to the moon and back during that time.
      </p>

       And this link?

       </a>

      <p>
       Well...... it's a wordpress article that starts with "There is absolutely undeniable scientific proof that vaccines cause autism. There is no question! Case closed! Game over!" I would take that with a grain of salt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with this one:
       <a href="https://healthwyze.org/reports/60-vaccine-secrets">
        https://healthwyze.org/reports/60-vaccine-secrets
       </a>
       It's an unprofessional no-name website. Now I'm open to the possibility that what's said here is true, but if these substances actually ARE in vaccines I'd like to see an official source on those ingredients, not some privately funded website with an unknown agenda. On top of all this, I'd really like to hear an alternate explanation as to WHY they would put "known neurotoxins" in vaccines if not for their beneficial effects? Harming people is in their best interest? Come on.
      </p>
      <p>
       But in the end you
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       to admit that linking to a* google image search* of graphs is just unbelievably insincere? I mean if someone tried to pull that on you on a topic you disagree with I guarantee you'd react the same way I did, you're just blinded by bias in this case.

       Your argument falls apart at vaccines don't cause autism. They do in fact cause it as numerous independent (not done by or funded by pharmaceutical companies) scientific studies have shown. In fact, William Thompson, the CDC whistleblower, acknowledged that the CDC had them throw out data that showed otherwise. There was an over 300% likelihood for African American children to become autistic from the MMR vaccine.

       As for the ingredients, all you have to do is look at the manufactuers ingredients to see these toxins are in them. Here is a list of each vaccine and what is in them. Pick and choose and look for youtself.

       As far as Dr. Andrew Wakefield, the evidence used to revoke his license was overturned and he is now in the process of getting reinstated. He was essentially proven right as they could not disprove his findings to keep his license revoked.

       Who knows why known harmful neurotoxins and deadly ingredients are added to vaccines. The best guesses are to dumb us down and for population control, not to mention having a weak and defenseless population constantly sick while needing healthcare and remaining dependent on the government. There is a lot of money to be made in keeping us in a perpetual cycle of sickness.

       It also very specifically depends on the person, their immune system, the type of disease immunized against, and the ongoing attention to boosters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Vaccines aren't a perfect cure, they're

       .
      </p>
      <p>
       More importantly, vaccines for children are designed to carry them through the period of their life when they're most vulnerable. It doesn't matter if you're immune, as an adult, to lethal childhood diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
       So far, none of your 'arguments' have been anything except "this isn't entirely perfect!"

       You stated being a carrier for a few weeks and then never again is a good thing, implying lifetime immunity. Vaccines cannot give lifetime immunity. However, having the measles, chickenpox. whooping cough, etc. naturally does provide lifetime immunity. That is why your point is moot as lifetime immunity naturally will always be better than limited immunity through immunization.

       You're assuming this; and depending on the vaccine, it
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       be a lifetime immunity. Some aren't. That doesn't have anything to do with their value.

       You have no idea how these vaccines work, do you? They provide exactly the same kind of immunity you get from contracting the disease. They use attenuated virus. Moreover, you
       <strong>
        don't
       </strong>
       get lifetime immunity from naturally contacting these things. You've heard of shingles, right?

       There is no such thing as "natural lifetime immunity" full stop, so your entire premise is bullshit.

No, of course it isn't. It's good enough, though, in comparison to the absolute scourge of bullshit humanity used to have to plow through.

       As for my point of "it isn't entirely perfect", when it comes to dealing with my childrens health as well as those I love, injecting them with something shown to be extremely dangerous needs to be 100% perfect and safe, which vaccines are not either.

       If you read my comment, I explained how the body responds naturally and vaccines attempt to mimc that by adding dangerous toxins into your body to get an immune response. Naturally, diseases are not injected directly into our bloodstreams. They pass through our bodys natural defenses in our nose/mucus membrane. Injecting into the blood bypasses this and creates all sorts of unnatural problems especially when mixing mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, aborted fetal tissue, etc.

        Here is the MSDS for Thiomersal (a mercury salt phased out of vaccines in 1999)

       , you will note that that the lethal dose, as listed in section 11, is 75 mg/kg.

       Flu shots. My daughter had the flu last winter. The pediatrician who always recommends the vaccines (I don't get them) even admitted the virus currently going around had mutated(what virus do, right?) and even kids that had been vaccinated are getting sick. What gives? Do Dr. Get kickbacks for vaccinations?

       None of these things. General societal vaccinations are mandatory strictly to establish herd immunity protections against pandemics and/or the immuno compromised. Even when there is a small number of adverse reactions, this is a small price to pay for protection against the much larger danger of transmissable deadly disease.

       Wrong. They don't always mutate away from the yearly vaccine group. It's a roughly 50/50 shot, but that saves tens of thousands of lives. The flue is very dangerous, and establishing even basic community protections is a boon.

       No, kickbacks are illegal. They get to bury less elderly and infant patients.

       At the end of the day, no one has every suggested that vaccines are perfectly safe. They aren't. Just as seatbelts aren't perfect in every type of crash. They're societal average safety tools and we ask everyone to bear the burden of an incredibly tiny margin of risk in order to help their fellows (and themselves).

       Ummm yes they do get paid... its called the Physicians Vaccine Incentive Program. They get $400 for every child in their clinic that is fully vaccinated by age 2. However they lose the entire bonus if they don't maintain 63%. Its a blue cross blue shield program, look it up. Its not the only one either.

       Last year's shot was about 42% effective, so moderately. About a 30% reduction in hospitalizations, enough to make it cost effective I figure. The CDC and public health agencies are certainly invested in helping push flu shots to everyone because they need vaccine manufacturers to maintain the necessary facilities to scale up vaccine production in the face of a deadlier flu epidemic. Selling a broad number of flu shots every year helps accomplish that. I actually agree with this - epidemics like the Spanish flu were horrific and we need to be prepared to respond to that kind of threat with the vaccine manufacturing ability in place. And, well, I live with members of influenza vulnerable populations. So we all get flu shots in solidarity. Even if I don't really think I need one.

       In my opinion? The dtap.

       The dtap vaccine causes you to become an asymptomatic pertussis carrier if you're exposed to the wild bacteria. That might go on for several weeks that you could be potentially spreading pertussis without knowing it.

       How long does the asymptomatic phase last? According to the CDC, about 5 days. So yes that's an important point you make, but you could be spreading it a lot longer if you're vaccinated.

       And yet if you're also vaccinated this isn't a problem.  Regardless of this argument you are making, there is no debate about the efficacy of this vaccine in terms of lives saved. It's like saying kids shouldn't eat broccoli because some insignificant number of kids get food poisoning from broccoli every year.

       It IS a problem when they tell pregnant women, and all family members of a new baby, to get the shot. Then you hold tiny baby and get your asymtomatic pertussis all over them. Then people wonder how such a tiny baby caught whooping cough. Unlike many other vaccines, the dtap does nothing for herd immunity and provides

       I just linked you the numbers, while other vaccines might be better it's far from a shit vaccine. Pregnant women absolutely should get the vaccine, as should your child starting at 2 months. Just because it doesn't reduce infectivity doesn't mean you shouldn't get the vaccine, it still saves lives, as I've already linked above. You don't have an argument except to emotion, which isn't an argument at all.

       16% rate of spontaneous abortion after the DTaP when given to pregnant women. 58% of women reported an adverse reaction. But since the makers of the study decided that it "wasn't related to the shot", they conclude that DTaP is okay during pregnancy LOL

       You don't get spontaneous abortions in the third trimester, they are premature infants in the third trimester. Spontaneous abortion is defined by fetal before 20 weeks. Please tell me again how a shot in the third trimester can cause an abortion 8 weeks in the past. Again, good try though lmao.

       Not sure if you're getting downvoted for not going into detail, but the link of the OP shows that one parent wanted the kid to be vaccinated, the other parent agreed to do so and was them court ordered.. then did not do what they legally signed and are now obligated to do, and that created the issue. The husband sued for custody based on them violating court order.
      </p>
      <p>
       That would explain why the person I'm replying to answered as he did. There's no one forcing you to vaccinate your kids, that's actually why there's an increasing risk of seeing these nearly dead diseases make a comeback. They aren't eradicated across the globe, and all it takes is a large enough resurgence because enough aren't getting vaccinated, to have the problem all over again.

       For all practical purposes they are.

       The diagnostic criteria for polio changed around the same time that the rates went down.
       <a href="http://www.vaccinationcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Rise-of-Acute-Flaccid-Paralysis-AFP-and-Fall-of-Polio.jpg">
        Check out this graph
       </a>
       that shows that as the rates of polio went down, the rates of another disease with the same symptoms went up.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a conspiracy that the polio epidemic in the US was actually DDT poisoning, but I don't have much info on that.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact is, mortality rates of polio and most diseases for that matter went down when people stopped shitting in the streets, started washing their hands, and when they implemented child labor laws. It's not surprising how many kids succumbed to minor illnesses back when they were working 14 hour days in the coal mines with poor nutrition.

       Vaccines have improved in that they supposedly have fewer antigens and they stopped using thimerosol as a preservative in most vaccines. Thimerosol is still used in the production process and present in trace amounts. But I'd say it's an improvement.

       Ahh yes, the fallacy of having 8 years of education on the topic of discussion against someone with 0. How silly of me, living in a world where people who are actual scientists are clearly no match for armchair philosophers with youtube educations about how "the polio vaccine was a hoax"
      </p>

       You might want to actually read up on the definitions of the fallacies you try to carpetbomb every discussion you take place in with.

        Appeal to Authority

        Description: Using an authority as evidence in your argument when the authority
        <strong>
         is not really an authority on the facts
        </strong>
        relevant to the argument.
       </p>
       <p>
        Exception: Appealing to authority is valid when the authority
        <strong>
         is actually a legitimate authority on the facts
        </strong>
        of the argument.

       If my argument was "Your argument against vaccines is dumb, and I know it because I'm a school principal and spend tons of time with vaccinated kids".
       <em>
        that
       </em>
       is an appeal to authority, because my the "authority" I'm claiming is not directly related to actually providing me with expertise on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       An appeal to authority is not "Your opinion on vaccines is dumb, and I know it bevause I have 8 years of education on genetic engineering and the development of vaccines that you do not". That's called "explaining why you shouldn't be ranting about something you clearly know nothing about"

       Because education isnt just being told things? Id say probably half my classes over the course of my education all had lab portions where we actually experimented and employed the knowledge being tested. I cant even cpunt the number if e.coli and fruit fly populations i've been tasked with cultivating and genetically modifying. Not to mention I went to a co-op university, which meant that I spent 18 months of my undergraduate education, along with various classmates, actually working in the industry at places like GSK, Merck, Pfizer, J&amp;J, etc. Senior year of undergraduate requires a research project involving some kind of tissue or genetic modification experiment. My masters thesis was on the prevention of Alzheimer's in fruit flies.

       I'm pretty sure at no point have I or any of my classmates seen, heard, or been involved in the development of mind control serums or making drugs that somehow make people sicker.

       Do I think these vaccines are effective? Absolutely. However I will not pretend like they cannot have a working vaccine with some "added benefits", so to speak. It speaks volumes to me that you think any of the students or the corporations would let information like that be known. Why exactly is it hard to believe that these entities do have that exact amount of control.

       The MTHFR gene: A segment of the population is homozygous for this gene. It interferes with methylation, and you're often have less glutathione, a chemical in your liver which is important for detoxing. There's only been one study that I know of, but it showed that children with this gene had an increased rate of adverse reactions after vaccination.

       The safe amount of aluminum. Aluminum is used in many vaccines to force an immune response. Only problem is aluminum is incredibly toxic to cells. Here's a toxicologist who talks about it.

       Additionally, what happens if your injected with a vaccine with an aluminum adjuvant, and also a vaccine that does not have an aluminum adjuvant? The aluminum would also work on the other vaccine that doesn't need it. This could cause all kinds of problems as well. For example here is a study that shows that getting the DTaP with the MMR is a terrible idea.

       Just to argue one thing you claimed, sv40 hasn't been allowed in any vaccine since 1961. The regulations didn't require they got rid of the contaminated vaccines, but they were all used up by 1963. It's been a relative non issue for over 50 years. Yes, it happened, and that's bad, but you're taking early years of our medical community, pre-ordered technology (for the most part). If you read at the very end in 2002 they recognized it as being very bad, but that was made through the use of technology from what it describes (versus having to test using monkey livers, which was very time consuming, and much less accurate when compared to the newer methods)

       Another example you gave was a link that shows that getting one vaccine specifically with another is dangerous. But you do realize, doctors know which vaccines can be given with which. There's many types of vaccine schedules, and any doctor that knows what they're doing knows which can be given with which.
      </p>
      <p>
       This article is 8 years old, but does a better job of explaining live vaccines, the bodies response, etc than anything you've linked to.

       The thing that people don't seem to realize when they make arguments that vaccines are bad.. is how much more prevalent the viruses they're trying to irradicate used to be. Here's a simple example
       <a href="http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/7f2446096d9ddae1d412adfcd9a3b717.jpg">
        http://cdn.zmescience.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/7f2446096d9ddae1d412adfcd9a3b717.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The highest Spike was nearly 60k cases of polio per year, and the sharp downturn soon as the vaccine was administered should be pretty easy to see. It was nearly eradicated within a few years, and is almost non-existent now. But, even if no one in our country has it, people from other countries that travel here could be carriers, and if there's enough people not vaccinated, it could become a thing again.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you can focus on the cancer, or you can focus on the 20-60k people that would have gotten polio every year, for over 50 years. Even if only 10k per year, that's a half million people with a horrible quality of life with an incurable disease.
      </p>
      <p>
       Will I possibly die from cancer from something they don't yet know about in some vaccine at the age of 70? Maybe. But each vaccine has similar figures, where over the years millions of people would be getting the disease, with how many vaccines there are, there's a huge segment of our country that would be diseased instead if there were no vaccines. Or maybe they'd be dead.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, there's a clear reason they aren't bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry for the person you responded to, perhaps they need to blow the whistle on whatever doctor/organization immunized their loved one.. but most doctors know what they're doing, and the negatives most anti vaxers try to point out are like the link I refuted.. not a current issue, just a current scare tactic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless you can prove that any contaminated vaccines were produced in recent years that is?

       I agree that the sv40 virus is likely gone now, which is why I said "used to". But did you know it infected polio vaccines in Italy up to 1999?

       No, they don't. Most doctors know very little about vaccines except that "they're safe and effective". The MMR and DTaP are still often given together at 15 months in the U.S.

       As for your polio/cancer comment, I don't like the "well cancer is bad but polio is worse" argument. But we can agree to disagree :) I just think if you're going to give a vaccine, we need to ensure it's safe. Or at least give people

       First, I'd like to give my opinion for who's responsible for shutting down discussion... Anti science Antivaxers are. Why? Because you're the first person having a discussion on their side that's not anti science, and more than barely informed. Ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason I responded to you at all is because you shared more sources to back up your words, and they weren't all trying to blame vaccines for everything the medical field can't explain.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you see, because I would say almost all Antivaxers take preposterous positions, everyone sane tends to shut down what we've decided is a useless point of view. It's not mindless acceptance, it's not seeing there may be a third party that actually wants to make a useful educated contribution to a discussion that's almost exclusively uneducated people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, look at r/insanepeoplefacebook to see what the average Antivaxers think. It's truly insane sometimes. My favorite, "my baby just died of x, but at least they didn't get that horrible vaccine that causes autism (vaccine for x)." There are people dying, and it's only going to get worse the more the argument is "vaccines are bad!" instead of a more moderate "we should do more research into making sure vaccines are safer." Which is an argument I've yet to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I don't have kids. I don't have much skin in this game, I stopped replying to anyone who's obviously uneducated on the matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'm firmly of the opinion that you're better served by educating those against vaccines, than blaming the ones who understand the benefits.. that's the only way you're going to get a more positive conversation going.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when all the Antivaxers are looking for are sources that confirm what they want to believe.. you're not going to gain much ground.
      </p>
      <p>
       Face it, you're one of the only voices of reason taking a position more on their side.. a voice drowned by uneducated people who only want to believe things that confirm their beliefs.

       The easiest way to change that would be by trying to appear as if you're on their side, drop a few bits of information that contradicts what they think, and make them a little more aware things aren't so simple.

       Let me break this down for you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The MTHFR gene produces an enzyme, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. When you have some sort of mutation, you essentially have decreased MTHFR enzyme activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       This enzyme is responsible for converting folic acid (Vit B9) &amp; dietary folate into Methylfolate -- the activated form which the body can use.
      </p>
      <p>
       Methylfolate is involved in many biochemical processes: 
- Provides the methyl group (-CH3) in cellular methylation reactions [i.e. DNA methylation]
- has a role in the break down of homocysteine
- involved in the production of neurotransmitters [Dopamine, Norepinephrine, &amp; Serotonin]
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure if you actually even read the details in the study you linked.
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2746083/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2746083/
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For both studies, the same team of trained physicians and nurses used the same forms to obtain medical history and to record local and systemic AEs after vaccination. Subjects were examined at regular intervals (days 3–5, 6–8, 9–11, 12–15, and 26–30 after vaccination). Local and systemic AEs were recorded. Subjects with an oral temperature of greater than 38.3 °C anytime during the study,
        <strong>
         generalized skin eruptions
        </strong>
        on non-contiguous areas to the site of vaccination [11], or
        <strong>
         enlarged or tender regional lymph nodes
        </strong>
        associated with vaccination were defined as those experiencing
        <em>
         systemic AEs.
        </em>
       </p>
       <p>
        [11] Talbot TR, Bredenberg HK, Smith M, LaFleur BJ, Boyd A, Edwards KM. Focal and

      <p>
       So the adverse reactions are: fever, folliculitis, and enlarged lymph nodes. You are citing the study as if these AE's are bound to kill you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now consider the risk/benefit ratio:

      <p>
       Hypothetically, would you rather deal with those bothersome "adverse reactions"

       OR not getting vaccinated against meningococcus and risk having your adrenals bleed out?  [Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome]

       How about death from an infectious agent (that a vaccine could have prevented)

       Sorry about that. I'm not sure what your child is dealing with.

       I'll be straight up with you.

       I'm in my late 20's and I'm debating on if I should ever reproduce. I know that folate deficiency during pregnancy causes neural tube defects. I know that I have a risk factor (the MTHFR A1298C mutation, folate deficiency) of having an Autistic child. My mom doesn't have ADHD, but for some reason I do. Literally found out that we got the mutation from her a year ago. I asked her if she took prenatal vitamins during pregnancy, but she didn't because she was very anti-medication.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got diagnosed with ADHD at a young age. I also got diagnosed with a learning disability (dyslexia) in elementary school. It's not as apparent anymore, it was for years though. I would like to think that I've overcome it as I've found all sorts of ways to cope and manage my life. But I understand what it's like to have a disability so don't get me wrong. I hate the fact that I have to take a damn capsule for over 10 years now. This exogenous chemical has helped me be more "normal" in life per se. I still struggle at times, but I wasn't going to let it stop me from pursuing my goals. So I can't imagine what an Autistic child deals with, or what a parent that has a child with Autism. I can understand how scary it is not knowing the direct cause of Autism.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT they can't find a link between autism and vaccines. There are cases of unvaccinated children with autism too. Of course there will be researchers wanting to find that link. Every researcher's dream is to be the one that discover slinks, associations, effective treatments etc. Biostats is a required course in med school for a reason too. All sorts of errors and biases exist in these studies (especially ones funded by big pharma), but medicine is also peer reviewed. If there was a correlation or legit studies to prove the link, it wouldn't be swept under the rug.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that a MTHFR mutation is a risk factor for miscarriages and autism (depending on variant). I'm also knowledgable on the fact that the  embryological neural tube gives rise to the CNS, and that folate deficiency during pregnancy results in neurological defects. In terms of biochemical metabolic pathways, methyfolate functions to make "SAM" which is necessary for the proper biosynthesis of the MOA neurotransmitters serotonin, epinephrine, and dopamine.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I found out that I had this mutation, I was a bit relieved. Especially once I started to read about the links to ADHD, learning disabilities etc. SO I understand your interest.

       I didn't take offense :) no worries! That's rough having the MTHFR gene and then thinking about pregnancy. Have you looked into taking methylfolate instead of folic acid?

      <p>
       Also, I'm sorry but I don't trust the mountains of research showing no autism/vaccine link, for a few reasons.

      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         They won't study completely vaccinated vs completely unvaccinated kids. They won't study for long term health consequences. The CDC admits this and gives it's BS reasons why here.

        </p>
        <ol>
         <li>
          The studies they have done are sketchy. Their "placebos" contain everything in the vaccine except the antigen. How is injecting aluminum and stuff a true placebo?
         </li>
         <li>
          Corruption. (Remember, we are in r/ conspiracy.) How can ANYTHING the CDC says be trusted, when whistleblowers have come out saying data was manipulated to prevent any inkling of vaccines causing autism? Here's a congressman on CSPAN testifying about it.

       I apologize btw. I deleted all my negative comments. I actually do take methylfolate. I try to take half a capsule, once or twice a week because the side effects are interesting [anxiety &amp; vivid dreams]. It has helped with my ADHD symptoms though.
      </p>
      <p>
       Incredible. The CDC basically deflected the question by offering a vague excuse. Honestly I rarely ever reference the CDC or provide it as a source. I was taught about the immunological mechanisms of vaccinations &amp; infectious diseases by Ph.Ds &amp; MDs that I actually respect. I can understand the concern in regards to how the vaccine is actually manufactured.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just know that most Doctor's come from a good place when they recommend vaccinations, because vaccines do save lives. And as I said earlier, it's way different when you witness ill-stricken patients and have a solid understanding of microbial pathogenesis.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I understand what you are saying. There is always bound to be corruption in an agency, field of work etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that I think about it, I'm KINDA that way with the FDA. I used to work in the pharmaceutical world &amp; recall pulling generic drugs off the shelf due to recalls. As much as I hate big pharma, I would rather pay extra for drugs that are manufactured in the states. I just wonder about how companies abroad are regulated efficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best friend (another med student) was complaining about a new generic MFR that the pharmacy filled. We never heard of the company, so we googled. It was an overseas company that the FDA had already sent warning letters to after issuing many recalls. On top of that, the MFR's lab failed inspections.
      </p>
      <p>
       We just both were speechless..just nodded our heads. She called her doctor for another RX &amp; had it filled for brand. It's definitely mind boggling...

       Thanks for the response, and question for you if you don't mind...what signs should someone look for to ask for mthfr testing? Or should everyone take methylfolate, or is normal folate okay instead of folic acid?
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally agree that doctors are doing what they think is right. I'm totally pro-doctor and I go to normal physicians, not holistic practitioners. Doctors are good people or else they wouldn't go into medicine!
      </p>
      <p>
       Like you, I'm just not trusting of the manufacturing. (The vaccine batches don't come out homogenous. For example some might only have a few nanograms of genetic material in them, some might have a thousand.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I never thought about checking into the manufacturer for prescriptions... wow. That's crazy. Thanks for the heads up!

       OH AND BTW I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE ARE GENETIC VARIANTS TO THE mthfr mutation
      </p>
      <p>
       The one that I have is the A1298C mutation. I've had some crazy health issues in my past but I'm not blaming vaccinations for it. My best friend has the MTHFR C677T mutation (WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE ONE THE "STUDY" DISCUSSES). She is petite and tall, we are in our 20's, same ethnicity (middle eastern if u wanna look up the prevalence). She has to deal with keeping her homocysteine in check -- b/c it's an independent risk factor for causing a stroke, blood clot or cardiovascular disease. She already has had an episode of a TIA IN HER 20's, that is her fuckin worry. Stop using mutations you know nothing of to justify your rhetoric. WE DON'T NEED U TO BE OUR REDDIT SPOKESPERSON. GOT IT?! We aren't over here moping around because of health issues we have overcome. Thanks.

       Whatever helps you sleep at night. I want you to know that I'm a huge critic of big pharma. I'm aware of their tactics &amp; I'm not a fan of corporate America in general.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not the only medical student that is aware btw. I'm also aware of the overprescribing of patented drugs for profit. It's definitely unethical, I don't think it will be a norm in the future. Many regulations are being placed on doctors in terms of prescribing. We are taught that we aren't allowed to accept any sort of gift (including money).
      </p>
      <p>
       At the same time you are promoting an agenda that is a bit extreme &amp; concerning to me. In the real world, I do witness various cases I've studied in pathology textbook.
      </p>
      <p>
       Besides viruses (which aren't "living organisms"), If you understand the phylogenetic tree of life, you know we aren't the only species in this ecosystem. Microbes have existed way longer than we have. They are so evolved to a point where they have the ability to rapidly mutate to adapt to new environments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evolution is all about survival, don't ever forget that. While we do have a symbiotic relationship with some microbes, we can't forget about the pathogenic ones that are able to evade our immune system (&amp;/or) invade our organ system.
      </p>
      <p>
       A small organism that can't be seen has the ability to kill our species. Doesn't that make you a bit worried? EACH opportunity they have to replicate, they can mutate. As time goes on, they have the ability to one up us and become more pathogenic.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your solution? Do we just continue to allow this to happen? There are many dangerous microbes that don't even have a vaccine. There are some that are so evolved that a vaccine can't be created in 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we find a way to protect ourselves against these "super-microbes?" I think everyone tends to focus on the vaccine aspect without focusing on the evolution &amp; pathogenesis of microbes.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is so wrong with finding a way to build up an immune response to protect us from one less pathogen?! We know smallpox has been  eradicated by vaccines. Clearly, it worked to eliminate a virus that was detrimental to our health and technically a threat to our species. So why do we believe that it can't work for other dangerous, deadly microbes?

       I am for people's right to informed consent. If I got bit by a bat, I'd totally get the rabies vaccine for example. Benefits &gt; risk. But to call
       <em>
        my
       </em>
       position extreme? When I'm questioning vaccine safety and the insanity of the infant CDC schedule, in comparison to the comments of the redditors that I linked to in the OP? I'm pretty sure
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       are the extreme ones. They're the ones calling for government mandated injections. I'm for safety and
       <strong>

       </strong>
       , and the right for parents to make choices.

       You're acting like we're against all vaccines no matter what, even in the face of a zombie apocalypse, which is a straw man argument.

       I agree with you on the government getting involved and making vaccines mandatory. Not a fan of government intervention myself. I’m not one to push a mandatory vaccination agenda, even though I believe vaccines are important. I’m into conspiracies &amp; I value free speech.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I’m saying you are being extreme bc I feel that you are missing the other side of the story, which is all the reasons why we do vaccinate.
      </p>
      <p>
       While I don’t know everything in life, If there was any sort of doubt in my mind about a vaccination conspiracy, I would be vocal about it myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it’s worrisome to me and many other medical professionals when people aren’t afraid of diphtheria, for instance. While there aren’t many cases anymore because of vaccination and herd immunity, it’s absolutely not an infection you want. You could die from airway obstruction because of cervical adenopathy or suffocation after swallowing the thick pseudomembrane in the back of your throat. Or you could have widespread inflammation of the lungs causing the loss lung function. Or even scarier is the paralysis of the diaphragm. Not sure why anyone would risk not being able to breathe on their own and having to rely on a ventilator.  Imagine having multiple of these symptoms at once. Why put you or your child in a position where death is more likely to be the outcome over recovery. If your lungs don’t function well, your heart won’t function as well either. Not to mention the risk of arrhythmia or heart block due to the diphtheria toxin invading your myocardial cells leading to myocarditis.

       On the MTHFR thing.  I have a heterozygous mutation for it.  So does my son, ~20% of the general population, 40% of Italians and Jews, and &gt; 75% of those on the autistic spectrum.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got 106F fever after the 1 year vaccinations, and was paralyzed for two days.  My son got 105F fever and had many back to back ear infections afterwards.  He stopped babbling immediately after the shots and as far as far as we could tell he went deaf until about age 3.5 and didn't start talking until after age 7.  Also severely autistic.  Of course everyone says this can't possibly be from the shots...

       I'm so with you, on everything you said. I was at CVS today, and there was a mom there giving all three of her under-five children the flu shot. Each one cried an complained when it was their turn, and I wanted to look at her and say, "Listen to the instincts of your children, before their bloodstreams are poisoned and their immune systems compromised."
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you say that to someone who went to that much trouble in dragging all of them to the pharmacy, in an effort to be the best mother possible? I also knew that if I said anything, especially in front of her kids and the pharmacist, I would have been met with a lot of resentment and probably kicked out of there.

       Yeah it's very sad. Especially since getting the flu shot makes you five times more likely to get sick with other respiratory infections. It screws up your immune system.

       We have already evolved out of many childhood, vaccine-preventable diseases being a problem. True herd immunity evolves over time. Example, the only thing keeping Polio alive is the polio vaccine; it's the leading cause. Measles, was nearly gone before the vaccine was introduced, and it spiked and remained steady since.

       If you're serious and not just being a jerk, the information is out there, from credible sources. This article uses the CDC's own info to make its case:

       If you're just looking at what's between the "
       <a href="http://www.">
        www.
       </a>
       " and the ".com" and judging from there, you won't get very far, e.g., most truth on the internet is coming from independent researchers; the AMA and CDC most commonly publish studies that are funded by the drug companies. Would you consider those to be reliable sources? Smart researchers and physicians lose their careers over this shit.

       It amazes me how strong the effect of the propaganda is on this topic.  Just how much hate and ridicule there is for anyone questioning any part of it, no matter what evidence they might present.  "Those anti-science retards!"
      </p>
      <p>
       To me, the point that easily shows the problem is that an entire class of injections is trusted absolutely just by the application of the vaccine label.  If you can't make the distinction that the effects of the contents of each specific needle matter, then how can you be approaching the topic with anything other than blind faith?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the effect of the lie that is too big.  If vaccines are actually a problem, then the world view of people that have faith in them is incorrect, so they must be safe.  Logic and rational thought are short circuited by seeing ahead to a proposed conclusion which will lead to social exclusion.  As a group, human beings really can be lead to believe anything as long as the propaganda campaign is consistent, long term and all encompassing.

       You probably believe in magic bullets the world being flat and chemtrails too. As you get older the effects of everything around you bombarding your genes cause birth defects like autism, along with people who just plain are genetically incompatible creating mutations that cause problems .
      </p>
      <p>
       The abundant over misdiagnosis of aspergers and autism to sell medication when the ADD/ADHD scam fell apart is spreading a wave of fear through the ready consumers of fake news and riling them up into eating only watermelons for a week to get healthy and jamming cartons of lemonade up their asses to cure all of their supposed ills.
      </p>
      <p>
       If your kid gets autism right around the time you are able to detect symptoms it is because you are genetically damaged/inferior not because of a vaccine. Take responsibility for your own problems stop looking for a scapegoat.

       exactly my point one guy used some cells of a virus that happened to be growing in the fetus of a child that died as a result of the rubella virus being present in the mother. WI-38. They don't use fetus anythings. Other vaccines also contain human DNA because believe it or not we need to vaccinate ourselves against viral strains that affect humans and not sheep or ducks or squirrels. So yes the host of the virus used to create the vaccine will have some type of genetic signature in the DNA of the virus due to the mechanism on how which viruses work and reproduce. OP is a methhead. Do not encourage. They don't make any vaccines with aborted fetuses ever. Never did. They took cells from one in 1961. That and one other example I forget right now. But that isn't any different than saying they scraped the new syphillis vaccine from a hobos foreskin. They aren't making them out of hobo foreskins so please don't feed the protein deficient vegan wackos.

       no they dont because the blood type of the fetus that they took the sample from wouldnt protect everyone so they took the virus from the tissues and then grew it in a sterile media and modified it so that it would die at 86 degrees instead of like 104 degrees and also fixed it so it would trigger all people immune systems to create an antibody in response.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do not use fetal/fetus tissues in current production of the vaccines ....ever....any of them. At all. No matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you are a closet christian.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is a real place for a religious objection to vaccines because the original virus used to create the vaccine did come from a fetus that did not make it to term.
      </p>
      <p>
       But that is the only reasonable objection on those grounds, in relation to fetus being in vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       They do not grow new vaccines in fetal anythings. You are misinformed or deliberately spreading false information.

       Just think of those cocunut fiber or clay balls people use to grow plants in hydroponics. Same Idea.

      <p>
       You really want to beleive that there is someone just jarring up fetus juice and using it to make vaccines.
      </p>
      <p>
       Agar (from algae meat soybean protein corn chicken eggs) and many other things are used as a sterile medium.
      </p>
      <p>
       They took blood from a fetus in 1968, that blood had a virus in it. They put that blood in a petry dish and grew it on a sterile media. They use the same rubella sample that was harvested in 1968.
      </p>
      <p>
       And they dont need fetuses to keep replenishing it. This isnt southpark this is real life. Here is a site where you can buy all sorts of media.

       None of it is made from Fetuses. Sheeps cows and pigs but not people. Using fetal tissue in that Manner in the United States would be Illegal under federal law.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't know how cultures work. Did you go to highschool?  I am making complete sense you are just either not reading what I am telling you or choosing to remain willfully ignorant in support of the false claim  you are perpetrating.

       I personally know co workers, family, friends rhat have had horrid reactions to vaccines, flu shots, etc.  Its NOT A JOKE.  The doctors will admit if you had a documented bad reaction to vaccines, they will not recommended you get anymore cuz they could kill you...as told by my friemds doc that has medical issues now after getting some vaccine!! So stupid!!

       When i see people talking shit and saying anti vaxxors are evil and need to be locked up its so odd to me!  Some folks have conditions and cant get them. Leave people alone. Geez

       Well said! And the hardcore pro-vaxxers will DENY so hard that the vaccine did it. It's always a coincidence. Reminds me of this

       I thought you were stupid. You and your kind. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a Penn and Teller BULLSHIT tv show. It was called BULLSHIT. they did an episode saying vaccines are necessary because of herd immunity. People who don't vaccinate are bullshit was the conclusion. They did a visual demonstration throwing many small balls at a glass wall, saying this is vaccine defense! And they cuss and get heated so that probably rubs off to audience as well as how they frame opponents as DANGERS TO SOCIETY because could lose herd immunity.

       Also, I'll just leave this here. Consider this: all of these studies exist even after considering all of the obstacles of which studies get funding vs which get shut down, and all the politics involved on the way to publication... and people think science can't be touched by politics and agendas. Open your eyes.

       Polio did not go away with inside plumbing. If you're suggesting that chlorine had more to do with reducing mortality of infectious disease than vaccines, well, that I would agree with. However, polio is a bad example to pick from because the Salk vaccine actually did tremendously reduce infection rates of that disease.  Might want to remove that part of your post because that casts a bad shadow on the whole thing.

       OP how much research have you done about the pros of vaccination? Are you in the medical field? Often people are mislead because they only search the cons and therefore have a false conclusion about vaccines. We've had plumbing before polio was eradicated. That is not a sound claim. Vaccines have benefits that far outweigh any cons they may have. People assume they don't need vaccines because of herd immunity (being safe from infection of a disease because others around you are vaccinated. Thus, they cannot spread the disease to you), but if enough people stop being vaccinated, then herd immunity is no longer an option.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's all fun and games to play vaccine conspiracy until you kill someone's kid because your kid got sick and theirs couldn't be vaccinated. Many children rely on herd immunity if they are immunocompromised or immunosuppressed from cancer treatments. How old are you? I would be willing to bet if you are a senior citizen who has first hand seen what polio does and how the vaccine saved people, you wouldn't be trying to poke holes in that story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately you're entitled to your own opinion, but I encourage you to look at the overwhelming evidence of vaccines being safe and helpful. You need to understand that your anti-vaccination beliefs could potentially kill someone who doesn't have the luxury of being vaccinated.

       The debate needs to be kept in the INFORMED CONSENT category.
      </p>
      <p>
       Efficacy should not be the issue. The issue should be that you are the one who controls what is put in your body and the bodies of your children, NOT THE GOVERNMENT. Vaccines are just a medicine, good or bad is for you to decide, whether you inject it into your body or your children or not is for you to decide, not the motherfucking medical establishment, not a bunch of government employees, YOU. Informed consent is already established in law (in Canada it is anyway) and mandatory vaccination violates the Nuremberg Code on a global level.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've said it before and I will say it again, Mandatory Vaccination is a violation of your right to informed consent and is illegal. That is why we have all this propaganda on the front page of reddit, imgur, and pinterest, because only through social engineering can they continue to push this bullshit "medicine" on us. It is completely 1984ish and they have recruited the masses to push their message by using social media in this manner.
      </p>
      <p>
       Read the inserts before injecting anything into yourself or your children. The manufacturer's product inserts tell you everything you need to know and all the risks that you will be taking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a list for you to check out for yourself....

       I know I’m late to the party but can you give me a hand by pointing me to some good sources about vaccines? I have a 4 month old who is supposed to get 25 vaccines by 18 months and i don’t feel comfortable with that as I don’t know much about them, but when I ask her doctor or other health professionals, they make me feel like I’m crazy or wrong for wanting information. I don’t want to ask around too much because I’m legit worried someone might call CPS just because I’m questioning it.

       Just remember they can call CPS all they want, but there's no law saying you have to vaccinate your kids. It's only to get into public school, and just states offer philosophical exceptions that you can file.

       If you're looking into which vaccines are more worth it and which aren't, here's a good podcast by a pediatrician that's unbiased in my opinion.

       If you want to learn about how vaccines harm in general, I recommend Dr. Suzanne Humphries's YouTube channel. The lectures can be kind of boring so maybe just listen in the background while you're doing chores or something.
      </p>
      <p>
       And hit me up any time you have questions! You might want to try and find a pediatrician that is cool with delayed/no vax, because the provax ones get really pushy.

       The MTHFR gene: A segment of the population is homozygous for this gene. It interferes with methylation, and you're often have less glutathione, a chemical in your liver which is important for detoxing. There's only been one study that I know of, but it showed that children with this gene had an increased rate of adverse reactions after vaccination.

       The safe amount of aluminum. Aluminum is used in many vaccines to force an immune response. Only problem is aluminum is incredibly toxic to cells. Here's a toxicologist who talks about it.

        https://youtu.be/mxne1v0ZD_0
       </a>
       Additionally, what happens if your injected with a vaccine with an aluminum adjuvant, and also a vaccine that does not have an aluminum adjuvant? The aluminum would also work on the other vaccine that doesn't need it. This could cause all kinds of problems as well. For example here is a study that shows that getting the DTaP with the MMR is a terrible idea.

       I just linked you the numbers, while other vaccines might be better it's far from a shit vaccine. Pregnant women absolutely should get the vaccine, as should your child starting at 2 months. Just because it doesn't reduce infectivity doesn't mean you shouldn't get the vaccine, it still saves lives, as I've already linked above. You don't have an argument except to emotion, which isn't an argument at all.

       Right, so why would I be spoonfed by the military industrial complex if I'm not american?

      <p>
       It was an example of a credible publisher, it doesn't necessarily have to be pub-med, but once again the subtlety slipped right past you because you were already determined to interprent my comment in your way.

      <blockquote>

        It seems all you can do is make assumptions and judgements about my character since you have nothing to offer to this conversation to back up your views on vaccines.

      <p>
       That's funny considering your original comment "attacked" the other guy as much as I'm "attacking" you, you're being condescending towards him for no reason other than to stroke your own ego. Aside from that, when did I ever attack your character other than saying you're not using critical thinking? If you want to take my attack on your argument as personal then that's not my problem.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       You haven't taken a stance towards any of the articles on the page you linked, in fact like half of them are pro-vaccination, how am I supposed to know which articles you agree with or not? Do you want me to write an essay on each article, only for you to reply with "that's not the article I meant" on every single one? You once again are unable to provide even a single select article, because you're clueless about the subject and can't tell a credible article from one written by Alex Jones.

      <p>
       How can I deflect something you've said when all you've been saying is that you've shared "articles" with me, my first argument stands 4 comments later. Show me a single credible article instead of linking me to a page listing every blogspot article in the world with the words "Polio" and "graph" in it  on the biggest search engine in the world?
