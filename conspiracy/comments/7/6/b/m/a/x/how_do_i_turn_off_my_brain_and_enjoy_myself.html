       I kicked it with a girl last night and I realized that I have nothing in common with people my age.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m 23 by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like she was cute for sure and I kept swellin’ up, but other than that it was difficult for me to relax and just enjoy myself.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is no fault of hers either, because honestly I admire her delusional state of mind and miss when I was like that. It’s an innocence of sorts and I lost mine a while ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       But for example, when she’s talking about some celebrity’s new hairstyle, I’m thinking about international Jewry.
      </p>
      <p>
       When she brings up the new iOS update, my mind is focused on mass immigration and the destabilization of once great nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       She talks about carving pumpkins this Halloween and all I can think about is the fact that our leaders are sexually deviant pedophiles and rapists who also occasionally participate in occult rituals.
      </p>
      <p>
       The worst part is there’s really no way for me to steer the conversation towards any of these topics. They’re complex and take a good amount of research to fully grasp. At best she would think I’m joking and react with laughter, or she would think I’m insane and never talk to me again.
      </p>
      <p>
       Should I try drugs? How do I get stupid and care free like normal people?

       I feel exactly the fucking same. It's not easy being out of the matrix.

      <p>
       Do you watch Gaia.com? That's actually a good way to watch TV and come to terms with it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Plus it's a good way to intro others to the red pill.

       Also. Remind yourself often that it's just a ride. Watch some Bill Hicks.

       It doesn't sound like they think they're intelligent, just that they've discovered all this stuff that is mind blowing and horrible and doesn't know how to deal with it around people who have no idea about it and think it's crazy. Not that those people are less intelligent, they just haven't seen the same stuff.

       I ignore people like him. Never once did I claim to better than these people, but it’s a fact that most people are asleep to reality and what’s really going on.

       You might not have said you’re better than anyone but if I can read it in your tone from here certainly people can face to face. Maybe try talking to people like they’re on your level. They’ll be a lot more receptive to your ideas if you just talk about them instead of treating it like you’re some gatekeeper revealing the mysteries of the universe.

       I think it is a person full of itself who thinks they are smarter, but I can see why it was posted into r/conspiracy, it is a common feeling for us having this conversations on dates where you think twice before you shattering their narrative, Lying (by not being full conspiracy all the time) is caring about the relationship more than being right.

       Xanax is safer if you want to dull yourself. Occasionally you might get some high octane sativa and be inspired to do art or something, can't have that.

       I feel ya, feel like at times I can't speak my mind or my thoughts around all these blue pillers. 
A very very close friend and I actually stopped talking for a few days over an arguement of them asking me now with trump if the election was tomorrow would I still vote for him or Hillary? 
I said without any hesitation I'd vote for him against her ALL DAY! Got hung up on and we had to take a breather from each other, now we just try to not bring up ANY POLITICS 
So far so good...

       I know it's hard. I kind of get into character, like I pretend to be somebody else who is interested in hairstyles and iOS updates. Or I try to drop little thigns here and there not to get into a big conversation, just little bits and pieces that hopefully lead the person to hopefully ask questions themselves.

       Question is: do you necessarily want a gf to discuss conspiracies with you? Is there more to YOU than conspiracies and being woke ?
      </p>
      <p>
       Either find someone that matches you or learn that despite differences, it's what people are willing to do and tolerate from each other that shows how much someone is comited to anyone, in or out of the matrix.
You don't have to not be yourself, but you shouldn't judge, avoid, deny someone who doesn't see it the same way as you or doesn't even want to. 
She could even be your soft reset at home.... Lead to try new things... Even think differently than you currently do, and find that there's a proper time and place for everything, like reddit being your home for conspiracies and your bedroom home for blasting that D inside that V and/or A.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're not sure, at least try it. 
She may be the yin to your yang, the cheese to your ham or the patsy to your flag. 
Cheers*

       The way you perceive anothers thoughts says a lot about your own state of mind. Maybe when something upsets you to such a degree you should step back and ask yourself what the real issue is instead of focusing rage and bitterness toward the words that provoked it.

         Realize that it's going to be harder for you to connect with people, but they
         <em>
          are
         </em>
         out there. You'll just need to meet tons of em and filter. Which is fun, if you think about it. Go out with intent of meeting (and probably dismissing) everyone. Now you have nothing to lose. That's the best mindset to have int he first place - social yet not giving a fuck.

         Date older women who have a bit more experience. But let me tell you what - even the most conservative, awoken women may still dig a celebrity hairstyle. Unless you find some nasty yogi who doesn't care about hair, which is unattractive.

       As my wife says, talking to me can get a bit "heavy". It's good to compartmentalize a bit and frankly, you aren't doing yourself any favors focusing on it disproportionately. We all need to unplug and reconnect with our own truths somehow...

       The only thing she's mentioned per your post that I can relate to is carving turnips for halloween. Because that's good, mindless fun. The rest would drive me batty.

       If that's the sort of company you want to keep - it will continue to be a struggle unless you dissociate from your current reality and become a mindless one.

       If it isn't, you'll need to adjust to being lonely until you meet people of higher thinking capacity. Not sure how easy that will be with 23 yr olds because most are in a know it all stage and if they're thinkers too... oh boy.

       My brother is one but he is fucking insufferable. He turns every conversation into a bull in a china shop, where his mouth is the bull and your thoughts on any subject is the china shop. He won't let anyone speak so there's no room for exchange of thoughts, only for his to saturate the air around you. It's great occasionally, but long term it's maddening and all you want to do is avoid him.

       If that's what she's into dont bother tbh.  My fiance when I met her wasn't open to or understanding of this stuff.  But she was intellectually curious and understood other systems of oppression like the industrial food system.  It's a matter of talking to people who are willing to accept new information and not overwhelming them with too much to fast.

       Man, (certain) drugs will only make it worse. The introspection and bullshit dissolving nature of Cannabis LSD and Psilocybin will only further alienate you from the masses. I'm about to be 30 and having spent the better part of my 20's raising animals and growing food for a living while also experimenting with mind expanding drugs and reading books (I now realize that nobody does this anymore) I find it hard to relate to many people my age, much less females. The only advice I can offer is taken from, in my opinion, one of the most brilliant minds to ever walk the planet Terence McKenna. I live by these quotes "Culture is not your friend" and "don't be afraid to go it alone"

       If these thoughts are impeding your ability to lead a normal life and be a functioning human being than you don’t have the emotional intelligence and/or maturity to invest so much time into these subjects.

       Why would you want to? People aren't care-free. People are quietly miserable and don't know why or what to do about it, so they develop all kinds of bad habits to cope. They don't have agency over themselves and because they don't know why(or care to know why) they will never be able to work towards real satisfaction.

       You kind of sound like a troll. If you're serious about the rabbit hole, keep digging and find other rabbits instead of messing with bimbos. If you're that bored with someone and just want to fuck get a hooker, it's about the same $ all told but way more efficient with your time.

       Mindfulness practices have helped me share space with others better. When you listen to someone trying to understand their perspective instead of just waiting for them to finish talking so you can stick your dick in their mouth, you can sometimes get them to red pill themselves.

       Just have compassion. This is why people don't listen to Conspiracy theorists, they think we're all self absorbed assholes who think we are better than everyone else because we are in the "know". And truth be told, we can be. No one wants their perfect life destroyed, and none of us asked for this mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       So IMO the best way to relate to people, is drop the conspiracy angle and just connect to them. Who cares if they like a celebrities hair cut, or the new IPhone. Talk about music, or art, or films, or books. There are a million billion other things to connect with than the trash heap we call the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry for the rant, but I'm sick of hearing conspiracy nuts complain about the "unawakened". Its not their fault, America inparticular breeds ignorance. Some people just haven't met the right person/information to see what's truly going on.

       Drugs will not help.  Everyone acts.  Nobody is who they portray themselves as.  You just have to do the same thing.  When she starts talking about asinine things like pumpkin carving really listen to her.  Keep eye contact.  Nod your head appropriately.  Ask her questions about what she's talking about.

       Find a couple close like minded friends you can talk to about things you care about.  Act normal around everyone else.
