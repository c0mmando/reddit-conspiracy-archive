       Can you please, please use your impressive skills to do an in-depth report on A) pizzagate, and B) the Las Vegas shooting?  I personally feel that if there is anyone who can do the two topics justice, it is you.

       your feeling and impression on the pizzagate scandal?  What is your impression on the Las Vegas shooting which continues to appear more and more like the latest false flag terror attack by the powers that shouldn’t be?

       If anything, I am Jain, but ultimately I can't say that I have a particular affiliation of any religious sort, to be honest.  I honor Eastern religion and Philosophy to a great extent, however.

       By the way "Hinduism", is not a religion. Neither is Buddhism or Jain. They are all eastern philosophies. I would love to hear how you pronounce "Namaste". It would be nice if you can record and upload for us to hear. Your voice will also denote your ancestry. "I shit you not".

       I don't know why you got downvoted to the extent that you did, but I am aware that neither Hinduism nor Buddhism nor Jainism is exclusively a religion in and of itself.  As far as my ancestry is concerned, there's no real need to wonder about it, as I have no problem telling you.  I am from Puerto Rico, so my cultural ancestry is varied and carries with it a bit of almost everything.  Racially I am mixed and have African, European, native, and Asian ancestry in me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Aboriginal ancestry is as a matter of fact the only ancestry I
       <em>
        don't

       have in me.

       I would wager a significant amount that you would have a significantly difficult time figuring any of what I just said above out if you heard my voice.

       Take from all this what you will.

       It's generally a not-so-subtle come on.  Sounds like she might be interested in you, to be honest.  Your "friend" might want to be more than "just friends".
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what it generally means anyway, but, of course, she might just be teasing or whatnot, so I'd personally say play it cool and, if you yourself are interested in her, find out if she really does have a serious interest in you, and go from there.

       It's a good point you bring up and very true.  This past year utter chaos has taken over and it feels like time has been sped up.  Some theorize  (me included) it is a tactic to divert attention from the bigger picture, which imo would be Trump continuing a foreign policy that hasn't wavered that much.  Just today we the US attack a couple camps in Yemen, and you hardly heard about our objective or even presence there.  It's a crazy time we're and I think asking yourself why your interested in a specific story is a great question to ask.  Thanks!

       I wouldn't say the same about pizzagate. Just look: Dutroux affair. Franklin coverup. Presido. Mcmartin. The finders. List goes on and on. And it is going on right now. They are clearly doing something incredibly fucked on a massive scale and I think it is worth actively pursuing.

       Cannot agree more w/everything you said.  It's going on and has been going on for quite some time, unfortunately - and yes, it absolutely should be pursued by as many investigators as possible.

       To answer your question: The reason we're interested in the Vegas shooting, is that we are getting a lot of staged shootings here in the U.S. as part of the agenda to disarm the public while simultaneously arming police to the teeth with military grade gear.
       <br/>
       If we can find and reveal evidence that this was a staged event, as we did with Sandy Hook, we can make it more difficult for the PTB to bring the public on board with the gun banning; not to mention opening many minds to the way things really work.

       This was going well until the remarks in this video.  Couldnt believe my ears when I heard "Im not really interested in the Vegas event" paraphrased. The biggest mass shooting in US history with clear red flags, holes in the story, increasing amount of BS coming everyday, JC doing an interview on Ellen...
The video response is highly suspect.

       There's a difference between a meta-critique and a nothingburger. At a certain point, it becomes relevant to consider to what extent such events are simply gaslighting the public.

       I got to be honest. I was kind of dissapointed by your reply. 
I understand this might be one of those events that mean nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But i think you are wrong. You mention you are working on your research for over 10 years with your website. I don't have a website, but my research goes as far as yours in my opinion.
And as soon as i saw this incident, i knew something was off, way off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Digging in deeper, and i confirmed by hunches. Along with a wholeeee lot of other people. Which stood out to me. Not all of these conspiracies gain as much traction in the msm as this one seems to do. Alot of people unaware of these "events" suddendly questioned the "official" narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       The apparant impact of the incident seems pretty significant too. Extreme security measures replacing the old security. And ofcourse the quitte implementation/and pushing out of the Liberty Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       The obvious insider trading, the put options and selling of stock into MGM seems to remind of the 9/11 scandal you exsposed trough brilliant video analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
       A whole lot of other points worth mentioning but those are pretty obvious after an hour of research into Las Vegas.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess what i would have wanted you to do, was do something similair (like your 9/11  vids). Not because you might dig up some new info. (im sure you could though) But rather, your method of explaining appeals to a broad audience. Giving a better understanding to those unclear of what happend "LEFT OF BOOM".
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, i appreciate your perspective, and i don't even disagree. It's the fog of war pulled over our eyes, maybe even much further than before.
      </p>

       Thank you.

       McGowan, who died in 2015, was perhaps best known for his book
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Weird-Scenes-Inside-Canyon-Laurel/dp/1909394122">
        Weird Scenes Inside the Canyon: Laurel Canyon, Covert Ops &amp; The Dark Heart of the Hippie Dream
       </a>
       . McGowan was a frequent guest on
       <a href="https://youtu.be/xDJn78gTB54">
        alt media podcasts
       </a>
       where he talked about his Laurel Canyon material the thesis of which, as near as I can attempt to characterize it, was that the music scene the bubbled up in Laurel Canyon in Los Angeles was influenced by American intelligence agencies and he details in his book the many connections between musicians involved in that scene and the alphabet soup agencies.
      </p>
      <p>
       McGowan also wrote the book
       <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Programmed-Kill-Politics-Serial-Murder/dp/0595326404/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8">
        Programmed to Kill: The Politics of Serial Murder
       </a>
       that was very much in the same vein as his Laurel Canyon work where he posits that many of the serial murder incidents in the era of the 1960s and after could be attributed at least in part to government programs like MKULTRA. Again McGowan did
       <a href="https://youtu.be/HPxp_Tjm13s">
        many podcasts
       </a>
       talking about the material is Programmed to Kill.
      </p>
      <p>
       McGowan was also a moon hoax researcher and his multi-part
       <a href="http://centerforaninformedamerica.com/moondoggie-1/">
        Wagging the Moondoggie
       </a>
       a version of which is online on a website his family maintains collecting McGowan's work is a deconstruction of the NASA moon program and his refutation of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoy listening to McGowan on podcasts and I think he had a good sense of humor and he was a good skeptic and researcher and is missed in the alternative media space. I didn't always come to the same conclusions as him but I respect his work and I believe he has been very influential and pieces of his legacy can be seen in current researchers like Jay Dyer.

       I do not believe that is accurate if you're referring to the actress Rose McGowan.
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_McGowan">
        Her Wikipedia
       </a>
       says her father's name was Daniel and Dave McGowan was born in 1960 and Rose was born in 1973 so pretty sure he's not her father.

       u/Murderalaska summarized Mcgowan's work fairly accurately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Judging from your previous work, Mr. Corbett, I think you'd find his book Programmed To Kill most rewarding. McGowan' theory was that many serial killers were actually criminal operatives tied into human trafficking, covert ops, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many had connections to the Phoenix Program. Many seemed to be chosen specifically for a certain psychological profile, which brings to mind your Secret Life Of Timothy Mcveigh.

       to archive McGowan's work.  There is no better resource around for critical thinking and analysis of 9/11, the Lincoln Assassination (echoing James Perloff-esque debunkery), the alleged Apollo missions to the moon (which comports well with your critical analysis in The Kubrick Question), and other government cover-ups and machinations.

       Still it is better to have some than to have none. It is also likely you will find another person who is capable of growing plants. A great upside of storing seeds is that they don't need much space. So you don't really risk anything when investing in and storing seeds.

       Seeds would also serve as a valuable currency in a collapse scenario. But if the collapse occurs at the beginning of winter, good luck not starving before harvest time.

       i disagree.  with each seed stored properly with an index card of how to properly grow and have a small easily assembled hydroponic setup, you could easily make an indoor greenhouse.  If your prepping for disaster tou should do it in such a way that anyone could look at what you have and know what your plans for saftey are and be able to execute them effeciently without much guessing.  index cards and how to notebooks will allow your loved ones to reach saftey or create a habitable environement should you be absent.

       I have a couple of aquaponics systems I've been playing with for the past year. I still think I would be fucked in a collapse scenario. Even if I had solar pumps to operate the system, it takes a lot of space to provide calorie crops. I do have a pond stocked with catfish that I could survive on for a while. After years of consideration, I think a herd of sheep or goats is the best prep plan.

       id go with legumes personally.  buy a crap load now and store properly and grow tomoatoes, peppers, cabbage, potatoes , etc you could grow most of these in large pots.  just simplify the food/watering process and tour good.  hydroponics are a bitch to set up but ince ecological balance is achieved its amazing.  My friends father grows lettuce, spinach, and other leafy green directly over top of his fish pond and cycles the water through his "garden" and back to the pond.  completely self contained and continually produces so much food he gives it away to neighbors lol but its a bitch to get to that point for the avg person. stick to potatoes and root veggies in pots

       since before it was cool to question wikileaks (before it became cool to like wikileaks again). Anyway, he doesn't pass the 9/11 litmus test, he's got a shady cult background, and even if he's pure as the driven snow an organization like wikileaks is a perfect tool for intelligence agencies to use to selectively "leak" information (like diplomatic cables and war logs) that they want to make sexy and interesting.

       This always stood out to me, but recently he tweeted that
       <a href="https://twitter.com/julianassange/status/915903148681830400?lang=en">
        Almost all "terror" plots are created by the FBI as part of its business model.
       </a>
       . Seems like he believes that a govt agency is capable setting these plots up, but does he believe they can go all the way with them? Who knows.

       Please elaborate on the "cult background" because if youre referring to "the family" i would be interested in seeing the proof you have behind the claim, as far as i know Julians only association is having blonde hair, I am from Victoria where the cult is from, Julians from Queensland, they are not even close.

       I'm sure you disappointed some people with your response, but I appreciate that you aren't pandering to the lowest common denominator, "flavor of the day" conspiracy stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's not to say that it's not important and there may not be something important here, but if the conspiracy movement put half of the energy we put into investigating these singular events into connecting historical dots, we'd probably have a much brighter signal to rally behind and fewer unverifiable theories adding to the noise.

       Good evening, James!  Your 9/11: A Conspiracy Theory video has been shown to me more times than I count by people I that I might describe as semi redpilled. (Awesome)
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I just realized youtube is only displaying 2.9 mil views.  Do you think that’s a result of youtube messing with the numbers or the fact it’s been freebooted on facespace so many times?  (Not Awesome)

       YouTube unquestionably does suppress view counts on what would otherwise be trending videos and promotes videos that fit the MSM agenda, but I don't spend my time dwelling on it. I'll continue spreading the message on their controlled platforms and raising the awareness of the alternatives that people should be using. For example:

       Seems probably across social media platforms of a requisite size there are flexible hierarchies of curated white &amp; blacklists (for both user specified tags &amp; metadata).  Whilst the platform themselves likely operate one of the levels in the hierarchy, others may exist for purposes of regulatory compliance, to prevent the cannibalization of an in-house commercial activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Process-wise, 1st time trending topics will likely generate an alert to those monitoring by geographical location, which starts an assessment process before anything appears as trend visible to end users.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are also likely checks required to ensure that a preexisting trending topic have not been co-opted to provide a means of working around a blacklist.

       Thanks for all of your great work and for participating in the AMA. As a subscriber to the Corbett Report the subject I'd love to see you tackle because of my own selfish interest is the case of Ron Brown's plane crash in 1996. Brown was in Bill Clinton's cabinet as the Commerce Secretary and was up to his next in a natural gas price-fixing scandal at the time of his death that also involved Clinton's chief of staff and other Clintonites including associates of John Huang of Chinagate fame. I think it would be a very fitting entry into your Crashes of Convenience series.
      </p>
      <p>
       Are you aware of
       <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?182235-1/ron-browns-body">
        Jack Cashill's work on Ron Brown's very fishy death
       </a>
       and is it an episode you might explore on your program? Also I checked your archives and I was surprised that you haven't had Mr. Cashill on for an interview as he has also written some great stuff about the equally suspect
       <a href="http://a.co/gi3tbrz">
        TWA 800 crash
       </a>
       . Just wanted to suggest him as a guest as well because I find Cashill and his work fascinating. Best regards good sir!

       Hey James,
      </p>
      <p>
       First of all, I'm a long term fan, I started with your podcast on "Hunting The Octopus" and I started following your ideas based solely on your podcast, not knowing anything about your background. I always enjoyed the critical way you examine topics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think there's multiple "elephants in the room" (the LV shooting, as well as all the other major happenings in the world, NK, Daphne Caruana Galizia, Liberty Act, Kirkuk battle, Clinton emails, Trump) etc etc... what do you think is the most overlooked topic in general on the internet on communities like these? What are we overlooking, and where should we focus, at least for now?

       I think the eugenics-&gt;enviro-&gt;technocracy story is the one for all the marbles. That's why I just spent the last two years crafting a two-part three-hour documentary on the subject that represents the culmination of 10 years of research. It's available 100% for free in every format imaginable. I hope people will check it out.

       Did you watch the vid he linked?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, he goes from pointing out that the technocrat society (which had some folks involved with energy companies) spearheaded an idea to run the entire economy on "energy credit" vouchers (as in...that's your sole means of currency) to concluding that "Carbon Tax" trade ideas in a system of free enterprise are the byproduct of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's these HUGE leaps of mental gymnastics that make me not able to sit through much of the "alternative" conspiracy videos. Yeah, no shit that banks and oil companies want to make money off of carbon credits which is one of the few reasons the idea gets any traction.

       I know you are partial to volunteerism, but it seems to me volunteerism doesn't account for defending oneself from well organized neighboring states. If there's one constant in human history, it's that in a power vacuum, nearby powers will fill that void immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       In my view, the foundational pillar should be about creating a culture of anti-corruption. This culture would recognize the danger of a collectivist system as a vector for corruption, but would nevertheless allow the community to make use of it in order to survive (military for defense).
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, you might counter with "in a volunteerism society, if there was a danger, people would volunteer to band together and form a military" - but if that's the response, then what's the difference between that and a statist ideology?
      </p>
      <p>
       What is your thoughts on an ideology based first and foremost on creating a culture of anti-corruption?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for all you do.

       James Corbett I am a big fan of your work. Can you please address (please link a podcast if you have covered this) how the left vs right paradigm is misleading as both are misrepresented as "democrat/liberal" vs "republican/conservative", (where I have come to see far left as authoritarian-total government control &amp; far right as anarchy-self determination). Your talks on Agorism (sp?) have been enlightening. I see that as a possible bridge between (true) free market capitalism and anarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also if you have the time to address what some users were bringing up (in the IAMA announcement thread) about potential support (by omission) of Russian political parties. I can't see it in your work as I see the US as the major world player on the scene working with most developed countries in the dark.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for your dedication to bringing independent news to those that actively seek the truth.

       Thanks for the reply, here is what was posted in the announcement thread earlier today by u/lethal_entertainment:
      </p>
      <p>
       James-
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a long time consumer of your content (like, very long). Over the years, I have come to notice a trend which I am here today to inquire about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you, or has anyone within your media/correspondence inner circle (Sibel Edmonds, James Evan Pilato, Paul Craig Roberts, etc.), to your knowledge, received tangible financial support or payment, in a lump-sum or ongoing basis, from Russian-affiliated sources or operatives?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask because I've noticed a trend, which you are better than concealing than the others, of a pro-Russia bias. For Sibel this included conspicuous avoidance of any discussion whatsoever about Russian geopolitics in
       <em>
        The Lone Gladio
       </em>
       (I believe the only line, when the agent's loyalties are being discussed was something like, 'and as for Russia, well, simply f&amp;ck Russia' - thanks, that is
       <em>
        so
       </em>
       educational). This includes omission of including Russian interests within broader issue discussion at times when Russian interest considerations should definitely be included, informing a preliminary conclusion that broadly preventing literacy of ongoing/potential Russian interests of any kind is a conscious interest of your group. 'Meet Boiling Frogs Cadre, Russian-Interest Gatekeepers', so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, as well as the aforementioned members of frequent guests/co-correspondents, have been accused by various 'independent media' entities as potentially affiliated thusly. While I will be the first to say that this should be to some extent expected, what have you to say to people like me who have noticed a consistent, ongoing pro-Russian bias (mostly via omission) within your content for many years, and for whom such accusations serve to complement conclusions we have reached independently? Is it simply coincidence that Newsbud's launch logo originally resembled the Russian flag? If so, when was the decision made to change the color/logo scheme, and who made that decision?

       Follow up question: What are your thoughts regarding the ongoing, developing indications of Russian affiliation with and monetary influence upon various 'identity politics' wedge issue groups/campaigns operating primarily within the United States. do you believe there is an ongoing, covert 'active measures' campaign by Russian interests to foster identity politic tensions between groups of U.S. citizens? Would you consider such a campaign an act of war, or merely business as usual? How do you believe patriotic Westerners who believe emergent chaos to be unacceptable should orient themselves to resist such foreign activities if they are ongoing, and how do we synthesize knowledge of these ongoing Russian efforts, if ongoing, with the fact that they seem allied with those of the Soros/neoliberal bloc sowing seeds of destabilization everywhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again, and always, regardless.

       OK, thanks for passing that along. It's particularly silly because Sibel and I specifically called out the pro-Russian nonsense in the "alternative" circles and then (predictably) got attacked for not being pro-Russian enough:

       I don't speak for Newsbud or Sibel, but the insinuation that I'm pro-Russian is simply ignorant of my reporting.

       Thanks for the response. I understand it may sting to be questioned about affiliations, but the idea that we need to consider the potential that independent sources may not be independent is anything but silly. I'm sure you understand.
      </p>
      <p>
       I particularly appreciated your first link; I apologize for missing it within yours, and Sibel's, proliferous content, and further for observing things among the narratives of those mentioned which encouraged me to, along side the conspicuous omissions of mention, to reach a hypothesis worth questioning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see in your first link that you've identified a potential question point re: PCR. I'm sure you know JEP infinitely better than myself, but his penchant for moving from anti-U.S.G. stories to throwaway jokes/fanboy news stories about Putin is a one-two punch which stands out to me, and therefore to a potentially statistically relevant constituency within the alternative media-consuming community.
      </p>
      <p>
       No further questions, thanks for your work; I hope you understand that we all understand this to be a very interesting world, as well as a complicated one. Stay safe, stay well, and good luck.

       u/lethal_entertainment, I'm glad you didn't take that in any nefarious way. It was popping up that the Corbett Report may have some Russian (also right wing) influence that I did not see, but there is so much content that I could never catch up on it all.

       Thanks you James. Having only discovered you about 2 years ago, I have a fair amount of untouched reports to get through. I had not seen any bias in your reporting, but had seen some users on reddit and youtube claims of outside influence (be it right wing or Russia etc). Those of us that know of your work truly appreciate all that you do sir.

       You admit that you're mostly known for your 9/11 material. You called your 10 year retrospective "A Decade of Dominance" and then later said that millennials "don't even care about 9/11 truth" and "no one is paying attention" on the anniversary. So if people don't care about your main topic of discussion, what exaclty are you dominating?

       What are the keys, in your opinion, for journalists to investigate and deliver authentic reporting on questionable matters, for example, like the Las Vegas shooting. The reason I ask is because I find the mainstream media unreliable in their reports on such matters, and I find the majority of "independent" reporters equally unreliable- or it seems like they are trying really hard but just don't have the skills to pull off reliable reporting.

       In addition to his role in McCarthy's Red and Lavender scares, he was an accomplished black mailer who spent a lot of time with children on his pleasure boat, and in children's hospitals.

       I wanted you opinion on gatekeepers. I thought it was very strange that none of the high profile progressive scientists endorsed Bernie Sanders. I used to look up to these people and their silence on the democratic primary election fraud disgusted me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bill Nye, Lawrence Krauss, Sam Harris, Steve Pinker, Neil Tyson, Richard Dawkins, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of these people have no problem bashing Trump, but they sure do take it easy on Clinton. Even Sam Harris' podcast episode that he dedicated to bashing Hillary was completely sugar coated.
      </p>
      <p>
       None of these people seem to believe 9/11 was an inside job. Can these people who are seemingly so intelligent be in a bubble? Or are they gatekeepers? Or are they cowards?
      </p>
      <p>
       Would love your insight on this. And I'd also love for you to appear on Sam Harris' podcast. That would be amazing.

       Is this a joke? Do you have Richard Dawkins confused with somebody else?
      </p>
      <p>
       Richard Dawkins publicly calls 9/11 the work of Muslim hijackers with boxcutters who sincerely believed in the holy religious mission of jihad:
      </p>
      <p>
       "I think the 9/11 hijackers all sincerely believed that they were doing the right and proper moral, religious thing. They were not in themselves evil. They were following their faith. And faith is pernicious because it can do that to people. It can do that to otherwise decent people."

       I think it's important to keep in mind that even big name intellectuals rely on others' opinions and "consensus" opinions for 95%+ of their thoughts on various topics. Perhaps it could be argued that highly trained, highly specialized people who are very accomplished in a certain niche are even more likely to take the "consensus" opinion of "experts" at face value, since they can appreciate how much information is required to come to an informed perspective on something.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I haven't done an in-depth analysis on any of the thinkers mentioned in order to determine to what extent they are "gatekeepers" in a witting, knowing, active sense, and to what extent they are just intellectually lazy and cowardly. Having said that, I certainly do believe there are active, witting gatekeepers out there in academia:

       since before it was cool to question wikileaks (before it became cool to like wikileaks again). Anyway, he doesn't pass the 9/11 litmus test, he's got a shady cult background, and even if he's pure as the driven snow an organization like wikileaks is a perfect tool for intelligence agencies to use to selectively "leak" information (like diplomatic cables and war logs) that they want to make sexy and interesting.

       First - the "why big oil..." Documentary was powerful and convincing material. Thank you for taking the time to put it together.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the end-game of the Oilagarchs? At the end of your documentary you suggest things like it's about power, control of gene pools, and preparing for a post-oil economy, but what is their motivation?

       Is it even remotely possible that they truly believe they have humanities best interests at heart? Or is this simply about self-preservation for them and their families?

       I appreciate the response. Well said.

      <p>
       Would you recommend any other podcasts/audio-series that use your same research-driven approach to this type of content? (As opposed to the purely speculative or "the sky is falling!" stuff that's out there).
      </p>
      <p>
       I enjoy your podcasts, videos, and feature interviews, because I have a tough time finding time to read (3 kids, work, etc.), but I've found that listening to this sort of stuff really helps ground me and keep me sane &amp; focused on the bigger picture, hence the request for more material.

       If alcohol is competitive as a fuel, why has it never successfully competed successfully with petroleum-based fuels without subsidies? The United States is not the only country that has developed automobiles. The other auto manufacturers never had Prohibition, as far as I know, and they almost all had much less oil resources than the U.S. (except the USSR). They had powerful motives to develop alcohol as a fuel, especially during wartime. But it didn't happen.

       Hey James I may have overlooked but to my knowledge it seems as though you have steered clear or atleast refrained from going deep into the UFO cover up and possible indications of ETs interacting with our planet. I can understand why you wouldnt yet as your someone who uses a lot of evidence to support your claims and when it comes to UFO ET related stuff its a crazy rabbit hole that may often lead those astray (it is why I am of the belief that authority figures in the conspiracy community need to speak up about this subject). I was just wondering if you could comment further on this or maybe link to where you have talked about this in greater detail.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Richard Dawkins is a perfect example of someone in this field whose clearly presented the evidence supporting the existance of UFOs and proposed sophisticated theories regarding ETs, breakaway civilisation ect...
       <br/>
       So James have you intentionally steered clear (for now)  ? If so why ?

       In short, I do tend to think that the pooh-poohers are wrong when they say that this is just like every other industrial advance in history. ("We'll just create new jobs and move on!") I think this time the end of human labor is a real question. What "jobs" are, and the concept of work itself, will be fundamentally different, perhaps unrecognizable, a generation or two hence.
      </p>
      <p>
       All things being equal, I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. But when a psychopathic clique obsessed with control and depopulation is directing society...well, that's definitely a bad thing.

       James,
      </p>
      <p>
       First and foremost thank you for doing this AMA.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think the future of alternative media, particularly news/podcasts featured on YouTube, will be after the YouTube AdPocalypse of earlier this year?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think Google/YouTube will continue to be difficult towards alternative news and political shows on YouTube?
      </p>
      <p>
       If so how will these shows/podcasts continue?
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think Google's motive was for the Youtube AdPocalypse?
      </p>

       There seems to be
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUYCBfmIcHM">
        no doubt of the insidious nature of tax-exempt foundations
       </a>
       . Whether they're used as a tax evasion scheme, intelligence front, to push propaganda, or to launder money, facilitate bribes and commit crimes, it's extremely rare that any tax-exempt foundation of any consequence does any good whatsoever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you support ending tax-exempt status for so-called "non-profits or charities"? Is that even a worthwhile goal?

       Thanks again.

       There are cyclical/generational factors, but I wouldn't say they are fundamentally determinant. If I had to narrow it down to the single most important historical determinant I would say it's technology. The printing press and the spinning jenny and the internet have had more impact on shaping society than any generational cycle.

       Hi, James, great to see you here; thanks for all the Great Work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part question, part request:
      </p>
      <p>
       You've previously maintained that you're not interested in exploring the actual demolition method of the WTC on 9/11, as you feel it would be used as a divisive issue to fracture the "truth" community and it doesn't much matter anyhow. (Please correct me if I've mis-represented your position.)
      </p>
      <p>
       I have to respond that if, indeed, Israel (or some other entity) detonated thermonuclear devices in NYC on 9/11, as many of us believe, that's a really big, really important "detail" with world-changing implications. For one, it puts US foreign policy into a whole new context. Is the whole United States and its nuclear infrastructure at risk? Is the country being held hostage? An exploration of the implications could be where you would really shine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or if, on the other hand, super-secret free energy vibration something-something Tesla technology was used, as Judy Wood posits, that's arguably an even bigger deal -- a public demonstration of free energy? Freedom from "fossil fuels"? Wow! (I think she's obvious disinfo, but there are many who have been sucked into the psyop.)
      </p>
      <p>
       For that matter, is 'nano-thermite' even a thing?
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems to me the very first question one will be asked after telling somebody that the official 9/11 story is bunk will be, "Oh yeah? So how did they demolish the towers then?" Surely you'll concede that a stuttering "I don't know" is not a very satisfying response.
      </p>
      <p>
       I humbly refer you to
       <a href="/r/nuclear911">
        /r/nuclear911
       </a>
       as a partial repository of articles and videos supporting the nuclear demolition hypothesis.

       Ground Zero.

      <p>
       Please reconsider. Avoiding this topic amounts to suppressing it.

       Please forgive the lack of a citation, but I stopped listening to you for awhile a few years back, because I heard you deny that ritual abuse exists. I hate the term ritual abuse because it's a misnomer and it doesn't begin to describe the crimes and their context. Do you still hold the same opinion? Are you open to considering peer reviewed, and public record evidence?

       I watched
       <em>
        Century of Enslavement: The History of the Federal Reserve
       </em>
       and you avoided the most of the myths about the Federal Reserve. But, because of that, you failed to make much of an argument about why things would be better without the Federal Reserve. After all, the century of "enslavement" was actually a century of incredible growth and widespread prosperity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Can you give an argument as to what would be different without the Federal Reserve?

       As a shorthand to explain to people the current geopolitical situation, do you think it's accurate to say that Trump represents the traditional nationalistic imperialist powers (all population but host country population are considered slave fodder) vs the globalist imperialist powers (all populations but a tiny elite are considered slave fodder)? This is not meant as a value judgement on either power base.

       Fukushima is an ongoing concern, and the fundamental problem (the cores) has not and will not be taken care of in the foreseeable future. Having said that, the situation is now such that the immediate safety concerns are the radioactive water spilling into the bay and the question of radioactive waste disposal. If and when I feel that it's unviable to continue living here, the bug out option is in place.

       asked us to post this question on his behalf:
      </p>
      <p>
       Question for James: Why does it seem like TPTB seem to be ok with letting cryptocurrency exist? I would imagine it is a big threat to their stronghold over us and they would be employing hollywood, politicians, etc to cry out against it.

       I'm with Ernest Hancock on this one. Bitcoin is going to be forked and forked and forked until what is left is fedcoin. The BIS is, after all, publishing papers on "Central Bank Cryptocurrencies":

       I'm also with Ernest Hancock and PiratesWithoutBorders.com on the fact that cryptocurrency can be (and should be) pirate money. We just have to be aware of that.

       Have you been bothered by the level of complacency in our society?

       Do you have trouble understanding how easily either side will foam at the mouth for nonsense?

       Do you think that maybe people are not as stupid as they seem, and a good portion of our country are reasonable people, but we do not realize that because only the loudest, most venomous are "promoted"?

       Do you think I have asked too many poorly formatted questions?

       I'm not James obviously. .. But I have to say that the complacency in society is shocking. In my own family even. No one cares about 9/11, that was so long ago. What they don't realize is it's aftermath effects their lives everyday. Not to mention the victim's (and their family's) lives both in the US and the Middle East. I don't understand it, it keeps me up at night.

       Yep, not only does 9/11 still heavily affect us but if people don't learn that it was a false flag, they're likely to be duped by the next false flag as well.

       Hello James, thanks for all that you do. Keep it up!

       My question is:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Have you ever heard of the Black Nobility (Roman papal bloodlines who control via the Jesuits and the Sovereign Military Order of Malta) and the Tri-Sovereign States (District of Columbia - military, City of London - banking, and the Vatican - spiritual)?
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       If so, what are your opinions on the topic/theory? Thanks!

       Equally curious as to how the Khazarian mafia relates to the Jesuits and black nobility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Great book to understand the Jesuits is Codeword Barbêlôn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Outstanding audio series on the whole picture from the beginning is Mystery Babylon by Bill Cooper. Forty hours, I'm about half way through and it is outstanding. Well worth it.

        I don't think it even mentioned the Bolshevik Revolution, wherein upwards of 60 million Russians were murdered by Jewish Bolsheviks. Rather important detail, no? No mention of Lenin or Stalin. Similarly, no mention of the Chinese "Great Leap Forward" and 70 million dead Chinese. No mention of Mao, to my recollection.

       I always suspected that the Rothschild and the Rockefeller families were the rich fall guys. You hear their names mentioned far to much for them to be THE power. One would think that the real owners of the pyramids would leave fewer fingerprints. Thank you so much for making the research quicker!

       Kind of a softball question, but since I've "taken the red pill" on global tyranny, I've been under a lot of stress. I understand this is somewhat inevitable, so long as illegitimate powers continue to be, and while I have found some hobbies to help alleviate this tension, I was wondering, what do you like to do for leisure in the sunny climes of western Japan?

       Hi James. Have you done research on the Austrian art groups  Gelitin  ( Wolfgang (Gantner, Tobias Urban, Ali Janka, Florian Reuther) and eteam (Hajoe Modregger, Franzy Lamprecht, Dan Sieple) that worked on the 91st floor of the WTC 1 prior to the demolitions.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO it's one of the more fascinating aspects of 9/11 bc their artwork seems to allude to 9/11, and make light of it. These folks haven't gotten much coverage - most prominently by Jonathan Elinoff and Rebekah Roth.
      </p>
      <p>
       Very curious what your commentary on the matter would be.

       James-
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a long time consumer of your content (like, very long). Over the years, I have come to notice a trend which I am here today to inquire about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you, or has anyone within your media/correspondence inner circle (Sibel Edmonds, James Evan Pilato, Paul Craig Roberts, etc.), to your knowledge, received tangible financial support or payment, in a lump-sum or ongoing basis, from Russian-affiliated sources or operatives?
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask because I've noticed a trend, which you are marginally better than concealing than the others, of a pro-Russia bias. For Sibel this included conspicuous avoidance of any discussion whatsoever about Russian geopolitics in The Lone Gladio (I believe the only line, when the agent's loyalties are being discussed was something like, 'and as for Russia, well, simply f&amp;ck Russia' - thanks, that is so educational). This includes omission of including Russian interests within broader issue discussion at times when Russian interest considerations should definitely be included, informing a preliminary conclusion that broadly preventing literacy of ongoing/potential Russian interests of any kind is a conscious interest of your group. 'Meet Boiling Frogs Cadre, Russian-Interest Gatekeepers', so to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, as well as the aforementioned members of frequent guests/co-correspondents, have been accused by various 'independent media' entities as potentially affiliated thusly. While I will be the first to say that this should be to some extent expected, what have you to say to people like me who have noticed a consistent bias (mostly via omission) within your content/co-content with Pilato for many years, and for whom such accusations serve to complement conclusions we have reached independently? Is it simply coincidence that Newsbud's launch logo originally resembled the Russian flag? If so, when was the decision made to change the color/logo scheme, and who made that decision?
      </p>
      <p>
       Pre-emptive follow up: What are your thoughts regarding the ongoing, developing indications of Russian affiliation with and monetary influence upon various 'identity politics' wedge issue groups/campaigns operating primarily within the United States. do you believe there is an ongoing, covert 'active measures' campaign by Russian interests to foster identity politic tensions between groups of U.S. citizens? Would you consider such a campaign an act of war, or merely business as usual? How do you believe patriotic Westerners who believe emergent chaos to be unacceptable should orient themselves to resist such foreign activities if they are ongoing, and how do we synthesize knowledge of these ongoing Russian efforts, if ongoing, with the fact that they seem allied with those of the Soros/neoliberal bloc sowing seeds of destabilization everywhere?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks again, and always, regardless.
      </p>

       ?  I find his work is on the top tier with people like you, Peter Dale Scott, Newsbud, etc. (very general list, I know lol) and I don't really see people cite his work as much as I'd hope—besides your thoughts on ISGP if you have any, do you feel there's a general lack of drive/willpower in regards to looking beyond short and easy platitudes for "truth" ("Bill Clinton is a rapist", "It's Soros all the way down", etc.)?  Its somewhat inevitable in any area of interest but it seems a bit more dangerous in this context. ps thanks for all the content over the years

       As much as I like ISGP they do not seem to care for Mr. Corbett for some trivial reasons:

       I do not agree with their opinion, though they do good work in other areas. Even if they disagree with certain things Mr. Corbett discusses, let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater ISGP.

       Hello James,
What are your thoughts on Asians being bullied into doing videos apologizing for their "white" privilege?

       Nick is half white (his Father) and half Filipino (his Mother). Twice this year he has been bullied into making these kinds of videos. The link above is to the first one. He isn't the only Asian that's been bullied like this. (He was the first one I noticed)
      </p>

       Mr. Corbett. I don't know much about you, but I do know that many Youtubers are afraid to answer the Jewish question. What is your stance in the staggering amount of people with Jewish descent in U.S. politics and media. Could the United States currently be hijacked by Israel. Your thoughts on the U.S.S. Liberty incident?

       Awesome that you are here, James. It's been a long journey.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would like to know your opinion on the most important issue of our time: UFO secrecy and National Secuirty State that has transpired because of this secrecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       It has put a group of people 100+ years ahead of the rest of the planet; building underground cities and bases, in addition to off-earth outposts. They have also commercialized this technology making money off of it, while also enslaving us through constant spying and tracking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trillions have been ciphoned away going into funding black projects and bailing out Wall Street. It is Breakaway Civilization, that have their own science and perspective of reality and the universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you take this subject seriously, as not taking it seriously is the reason why we are all in this mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cheers!

       I would like to know your opinion on the most important issue of our time: UFO secrecy and National Secuirty State that has transpired because of this secrecy.

      <p>
       It has put a group of people 100+ years ahead of the rest of the planet; building underground cities and bases, in addition to off-earth outposts. They have also commercialized this technology making money off of it, while also enslaving us through constant spying and tracking.

      <p>
       Trillions have been ciphoned away going into funding black projects and bailing out Wall Street. It is Breakaway Civilization, that have their own science and perspective of reality and the universe.

       I am really floored by your commitment and work ethic! I've been an avid listener to Corbett Report for nigh on two years—I'm presently going through How/Why Big Oil... it's stunning work.

       Question: Your early work referenced Alex Jones quite a lot. 
Do you have any thoughts on what might have happened to him over the last five years?

       Meaningless speculation. All I know is that signal used to be greater than noise. Now noise is greater than signal.

       Here's a handy thing to keep in mind: information is more important than the person delivering the information. Concentrate on information you can verify that helps you to make sense of the world.

       Hey, James. I have a million questions. But I'd rather take this time to thank you for what you do from the bottom of my heart. Ok, one question: can you please continue to make documentaries, please? Make one about the conspiracy against hemp/cannabis. And how useful it could be for upward economic upheaval.

       What do you think is going to happen in the next 10~20 years? Do you see some big changes coming in the international power structure? Or more of the same on steroids?

       I was really blown away by your 5 minute format and comedic approach in the 9/11 and JFK videos. They are short, sweet, and really entertaining. I find these two specific videos to be quite valuable when discussing these conspiracies with people that aren't very familiar. Any plans on using this comedic 5 minute format in the future?

       Excellent work! I was aware of the OKC video but I didn't know about the others. Great comedians (Bruce, Carlin, Hicks) have used comedy for decades as a vessel to guide truth through the mental filters of so many people that wouldn't otherwise be receptive to the material. I get paid in a couple days and I look forward to watching Laughing At Tyrants with a couple of buddies. Thank you again for your hard work and dedication!

       Since James appears to have left the building, let's see if I can help you out, Mark.
      </p>
      <p>
       The threat of invocation of Article 155 is motivated in  the main by economics. Catalonia is a highly industrialised part of Spain, and as such is pivotal to the Spanish economy as whole - to accede to its demand for total autonomy would be to undermine and destabilise a sizeable economy at a national level and have a sizeable impact upon a still fragile, recovering European economy. Who benefits, Mark? 7m people who get to listen to trumpets while a flag is raised while all their potential trading counterparts suffer? Then what? The inevitable imposition of tariffs, barriers to free trade. That's what Mark. And 20, 30, 40 years down the line Catalonia comes back into the fold - chastened but unbowed, for another 8 or 9 centuries, rinse and repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But you knew that, though, Mark.
      </p>
      <p>
       The central government of Spain also appears not to have forgotten the bloody battle for the Basque Country with ETA for the best part of 60 years. It's not hard to see why they're cutting off the leader's of Catalonia's movement at the pass.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sensible Scottish voters saw through the crude attempts to stoke division through the politics of identity. They wanted to sustain a stable and functioning economic framework that might encourage sustained investment and attract new business. Sorely needed as the oil market contracts, streamlines and looks to renewables as its future primary revenue stream.  Oil's importance diminishes daily.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wind, Mark. Wind is the future. Scotland is full of it. Perhaps you could set up a turbine in your gaff, Mark? Hook it up to the grid?

       James,
      </p>
      <p>
       All past attempts at new world orders have failed over time and in the modern day many are seeing the same thing happening here in the states with traditional systems of control losing their potency.
      </p>
      <p>
       My question is is there a point at which totalitarian regimes tend to either have to double down or risk losing control?
      </p>
      <p>
       Looking back at collapsed police states, what fatal flaws have they made, what should we be looking to exploit now?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if I ever come to Japan, can we bike ride some of the Western climbs together on an afternoon?
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks for all your hard work and god bless.

       Hello James! Thanks so much for doing this AMA. I am wondering, do you ever need new original music for your work? I am the frontman for the US psychedelic rock act Aura Blaze and I would be honored to contribute to your mission by submitting my music for use in your future films. You can hear some examples of my work here:
       <a href="https://aurablaze.bandcamp.com/album/aura-blaze">
        https://aurablaze.bandcamp.com/album/aura-blaze
       </a>
       (Any track you hear from this album is yours to use!)
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, I would also be totally willing to write exclusive pieces and/or scoring if you should so desire. My range of talents is quite extensive and I have produced a variety of musical genres aside from rock (cinematic/orchestral, ambient, electronic, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
       Please keep Aura Blaze in mind going forward and feel free to reach out at any time if you think working together is a possibility!

       I love your work,  have followed you for years.    Speaking truth to power is kind of strange when the agenda has already been set,  in other words,  there is proactive reporting on items you identify as relevant,  and there is reporting on current events which are somewhat or entirely manufactured for reasons you disclose.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the first category,  I am interested in your semi anarchistic views,  which I take in the most positive way,  government of,  by,  and for the people,
       <em>
        local
       </em>
       decisions,  decentralization.   Globalization seems to always turn that putrid shade of Soviet grey,  seems to kill the cooperation needed at the community level.    But to fight you have to organize,  you have to have some kind of agenda and real community.    The greatest wealth is in the civilization we share,  and the privatization implied in anarchism doesn't seem to value the commonwealth enough.   Just because it got hijacked,  just because the central/global part needs to be dismantled,   doesn't mean we don't have to work towards building a non-corrupt way of governing ourselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the second category,  that of an agenda being foisted on us,  the brilliance of the carbon debate is that it derails the activism against poisoning the environment.    As if the main issue were carbon,  and then we have to debate that.   They knew it could be endlessly debated,    that it was hugely difficult for the average person to document.    Compared to the quality of the air we beath,  the soil we grow our food in,   the water,  or the aesthetic values of living in a healthy ecosystem,  or the long run value of a varied ecosystem,  or of not losing endangered species,  or having a compromised immune system from misuse of certain complex substances in medicine and industry.    TLDR:   I wish that when the carbon dioxide claims were debunked,  I didn't get the sense that those doing the debunking were implying that radical efforts are not needed,  that the environment is not under dire threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway,  sorry about the wordiness.    As usual,  I always look forward to your skills at drilling down to the basics.

       Hi James! Huge fan! Your latest doc on How Big Oil Conquered the World is excellent! Great title, not what I was expecting, in a good way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have any advice for expectant mothers living in the US? I'm getting a fluoride filter as you recommend, but is there's anything  that conventional wisdom doesn't teach that you'd suggest?

       Hello again. Have you followed the development and YouTube explosion of
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JordanPetersonVideos">
        Jordan B. Peterson
       </a>
       at all? On the one hand, his credulous acceptance of certain historical elements seems a bit naive; on the other, his proliferous content belies a good heart, and his broader discussion of the nature of evil seems particularly relevant today.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have been doing this for a while now, and often with a more intent ear to the ground than those of us who barely find the time to consume your content, much less produce our own. I am grateful that folks like you are carrying the torch for the rest of us- Do you feel the internet media movement is gaining traction, with the emergence of such academic minds into the discourse, or is it falling behind? Are we gaining 'momentum,' or losing it, and do you feel the struggle is broadly downhill, or uphill? With no additional effort, would it amplify, or diminish?
      </p>
      <p>
       The hotbed of gender politics, when investigated, inevitably brings to surface many familiar players, but particularly
       <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2508704/NHS-Tavistock-Clinic-treating-transgender-children-therapies-prepare-sex-change.html">
        Tavistock
       </a>
       . This all seems to intersect with the broader leftist push lately; how do you see the explosion of pc culture influencing broader discussion of oligarchic interests? Is this an area of interest? What are your thoughts on the way the left is using gender politics to impinge upon free speech?

       He's probably just dishonest. For example, Jordan claims he's religious, but he's way too smart to believe in a Magic Sky Fairy. So basically he's full of shit in that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same thing with Ben Shapiro.
      </p>
      <p>
       At least Shapiro is/was just preparing for a political campaign where he'd need to pander to vast hordes of religious Americans for votes.

       What are your religious views?

      <p>
       Do you think that they used to use real bodies during the Cremation of Care? Bonacci's testimony in the Franklin Coverup said that "the men with the hood's would take care of it [the dead body of the little boy from the snuff film]" Do you think that they used his body that year for the cremation of care? Do you think that they have other equally astonishing rituals that no one knows about still?

       I have a question related to energy. Do you see the noncarbon fuel sources like solar to be the future? These seem quite positive because they can be decentralized in a way that fossil fuels can't. With some cheapening solar panels and batteries people can become energy independent (if they live in sunny climes). The same seems like it would hold for wind as well.

       1 .Do you think there is today a big background fight among different globalist agendas (like eurasia ,islam and western elites)? And If so, why and when did this start . what are their goals and methods ? What do you have to say about Alexander Dugin?

       I had to save this comment because it is so fucking perfect. I think you just summed up exactly what your ideology is known for. That’s basically the alt right’s fucking motto. You realize the government needs money to run, right?

       I don't think you know what my ideology is, since I just asked Mr Corbett a question and never made a statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       You also don't seem to understand what "taxation is theft" means which makes me just sad overall, either you agree or disagree with it.

      <p>
       If I had to give you my motto, here it is:
       <strong>
        It's not left vs. right, it's the State against you

       Occam’s razor (and similar ideas).Obviously we could live in the matrix. But everything can also be normal, and everything in between. The key is to shave things away. Is something impossible to prove either way? Then it doesn’t affect us anyway. Would it be more profitable to do things the obvious way then to spend a ton of time covering things up? Then there is probably no cover up. Would too many people be involved in the conspiracy? No way it could hold together so well. No matter how many small details you find that seem off, you aren’t really proving anything. A singular reporter making a small mistake can lead to a lot of inconsistencies later on, especially during a very emotional and newsworthy event. I don’t care if jet fuel can melt steel beams or not - you can’t brainwash a whole city into one consistent narrative, meaning there were planes, and what do you think will happen when a plane hits a building? The impact, explosions, heat, whatever causes it, the building will probably fall. You don’t need to melt the steel, just weaken it just enough that it can no longer support the weight of the building! How powerful do you think our government is that they can control every aspect of life? Does that sound realistic? You’d think with all that power they wouldn’t need profits, especially if they are “above” their own money or something. You might not like what I have to say, but it’s what most people think, which is what you wanted. I don’t want to know what technically could have happened, I want to know what almost definitely did.

       Hello James, very professional podcast and website. Well done. Additionally, seeking listener participation in open source investigation of the deep state adds a nice community feel to the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever looked into the Office of Net Assessment?? It is a pentagon think tank set up under the Nixon administration in 1973 that is responsible for military strategy 20-30 years in the future. 
The director, Andrew Marshall, was at the helm of this agency from it's inception until his retirement in 2015. Just as a mental exercise for comparison's sake, I like to think about Allen Dulles in charge of the CIA for 40 years. Andrew Marshall also worked at Rand for a period of time. Adding Rand into the mix with game theory and reverse engineering social outcomes, I presume that very few military campaigns since 1993 were unplanned (he served as director 14 years post 9/11, so was that a success??).
      </p>
      <p>
       A short perusal of Andrew Marshall's wiki page will lead to a lot of insight into his background in statistics (Monte Carlo method used in Manhattan Project can be applied towards other operations). It could be feasible to RAND style socially engineer "high incident projects," leading to desired outcomes. This IS the deep state.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you think??
      </p>

       This AMA is such a circle jerk it's laughable. Nobody bothered to ask James the hard questions: like, why he won't even consider the evidence that recent bombings and shootings were staged. Forget about Las Vegas, I'm talking about really obvious hoaxes like London, the Bataclan, and
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4bn4op/here_is_what_actual_analysis_of_brussels_bombing/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=user&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=frontpage">
        Brussels,
       </a>
       which was such an obvious hoax that it fell apart upon even the slightest inspection. On top of that,
       <a href="http://blog.banditobooks.com/an-open-letter-to-james-corbett/">
        he completely ignores
       </a>
       the clear and overwhelming evidence that the footage of planes crashing into the WTC we were shown on 9/11 was fake, perhaps because it allows him to dodge how deeply and actively the media colluded in that psyop. In other words, classic misdirection.
      </p>
      <p>
       James always talks about the importance of examining the evidence, so why does he refuse to even consider so much of it? I'll tell you why: he's a limited hangout. A very, very good one, I admit. But limited hangout nonetheless.

       G'day James: it seems to me that you have a rare and singular talent for working through the more urgent questions that face us these days in a way that make sense of the "big picture" in this complex, ever-changing and tumultuous world. Do you ever suspect that this desire to “connect the dots” and to uncover the “deeper design” behind the scenes provides one with a sense of comfort or satisfaction that obfuscates the ultimate meaninglessness of everything? Have you ever found yourself at a kind of limit or end-point, where you've exhausted the drive to make everything make sense, and accept that what there is, in the end, is an inconceivable chaos without any coherent meaning whatsoever?
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, do you ever ask yourself whether the sweeping or all-encompassing scope of your work - and you’re consistent ability to come up with a coherent evidence-based narrative that explains the underlying order of the world,  is motivated by the desire to avoid the void, to thin down, shroud or blunt or domesticate the sheer absurdity of existence, where by uncovering the deeper order of things, we conceal from view the radical contingency of a world in which there is no “deep reason” for why things are the way they are at all?

       With all the dogma associated with Climate Change - I have been extremely skeptical on the whole push for Cap and Trade, but it's hard to find anything related to the insiders and the money trail.

       Do you have any more sources or links to follow up on the whole cap-and-trade scheme?

       Equally curious as to how the Khazarian mafia relates to the Jesuits and black nobility.

       Great book to understand the Jesuits is Codeword Barbêlôn.

       Outstanding audio series on the whole picture from the beginning is Mystery Babylon by Bill Cooper. Forty hours, I'm about half way through and it is outstanding. Well worth it.
