       Most of those posts are apt for what is going on and being talked about right now. The alien ones might be a stretch, but Podesta recently mentioned them.

       Anyway, are they breaking rules? If so, report them.

       no they aren't. There isn't a single post that is so pertinent or timely that the mandatory 7 day wait should be subverted. It's retarded.

       Reddit is literally a shill command and control HQ.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shills are hooked in with Reddit employees, and they have special tools to help censor and keep your average user along a pre-determined narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, the shills use Reddit to coordinate propaganda attacks on other areas of the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       The question you should be asking yourself is not, why are mods and admins corrupt, but rather, what new alternative communication platform are you soon going to migrate to?

       You should really look for posts with truth in them (or in the comments) when there is a high "infomercial post" (a news post, missing conspiracy) volume. Traffic increases to push the actual informational posts into 'controversial'. Keep an eye on 'new' during the first hour, then see which ones stay when it hits 1h or 2h. Alot of good ones get kep,t but I've seen a few decent posts dissappear into the back pages of this sub.

       I think any censorship is bullshit.  No rules will keep bullshit from steamrolling its way into your lives.  I think everyone needs to grow up and take everything they read to task.  If you're not pragmatic in the way you approach new information you will be misled.

       With that out of the way...

       WTF are all of you doing?  You don't see the signs and warnings and yet you still play adult when you have no idea what is going on.  You are all culpable or untrustworthy.  The only reason I am still alive has nothing to do with any of you.

       I can't buy my child a new pair of socks, and you think I am doing this for what purpose? I am so angry, and would rejoice with the truth, yet you all hide behind your supposed secrets.  On top of that, every side sucks at their "jobs." I guess I could teach you for work.  But that would require you to admit a lot of things...

       New user here, I actually was going to point out that paddock wasn't wearing hearing protection (when the crime scene photos were leaked). I went ahead and tried to post a few comments about it but since I'm new to Reddit I didn't really know how to use it. I didn't know my comments and posts were being deleted until I checked my messages and notifications. I wrote orangutan a message to see if he would approve my post but he told me to message the mods through a special link.... they never responded to me or approved my posts. Just FYI.

       Reddit isn’t open source anymore. I fully believe they have implemented overrides on
       <em>
        every
       </em>
       function, making admin manipulation very easy.

       I’m a new user for the very reason of finding out what was really going on with LV. I also emailed mods to get some comments and a post approved. My post was approved (the very first post about the California fires) but comments apparently were not. Not a big deal to me because I came to get information, not spread dis-information.

       I contacted the mods for this, myself. Lost a previous account to a leak. Mentioned said account's username. They can correlate typing styles, tone, demeanor etc. and it's good enough to prevent blatant shilling.

       That said, as with any sort of subjective approval like this there are going to be some that sneak through.

       I'm going to make this guy's point for him by banning him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not really. What has happened is this user has been relentlessly stirring shit about this same subject across several accounts. I answered his questions about new users being approved, and he didn't like the answer. So he keeps using sock puppets to try to turn this into some kinda bizarre mod witch hunt. I honestly don't know why he is so obsessed with this. New users can request approval outside of the waiting period. We will review any posts/comments they have, and if it looks like they are posting in good faith, we approve them. It isn't a big deal, we want new people to find us and participate. Of course we have made mistakes and have been fooled on occasion. But I don't think any of us love the waiting period. We just find it necessary to prevent low effort trolling. This user refuses to accept this answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this is the 3rd or 4th account of his I have had to remove for ban evasion. Just so everyone knows what is going on here. He sent me a threatening PM as well, which I get threats all the time, this is not a big deal. But I mentioned he will run out of sock puppets eventually, and he replied he will never run out of them. So, we got ourselves a ridiculous game of whack a mole. I would rather be doing anything else, but here we are.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you to all the positive users who do their best around here to keep the conversation honest.
