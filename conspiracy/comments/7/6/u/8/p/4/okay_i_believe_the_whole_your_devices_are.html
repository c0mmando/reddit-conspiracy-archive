        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I didn&#39;t dismiss it when I first started hearing people talk about it but I tried it myself. I would sit and randomly talk about going on vacation to Mexico or something when I had no plans for that at all. </p>

<p>I never really got any targeted ads by doing that but now I think they are getting better at it. The reason why is all the car and car insurance ads I&#39;ve suddenly been getting. They are popping up everywhere for me non-stop.</p>

<p>Why does this matter? I can&#39;t drive. I&#39;m epilectic so there is no reason I would even type in anything about driving a car, getting insurance or even bother looking at them but there is one person who would. That is my boyfriend. Over the past two weeks he has been shopping for a new car so over the kitchen table we have spent a good amount of time talking about cars, financing, insurance prices, etc. </p>

<p>Mind you, we don&#39;t share or touch each others computers. We have a little routine where he sits on one side of the table, I sit on the other and then we talk about our days or whatever is on our minds while reading up the news. </p>

<p>I&#39;d love to hear if other people have similar odd occurrences like this happening to them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For what its worth the permissions don&#39;t really work that way. I&#39;m not saying the apps are not listening, but if you want to use text to speech, say, the app needs to access the mic. If you want facebook and snapchat to take pics in app to send off then they need access to the camera. The shit you&#39;re referring to is probably stuck in some ToS you agree to upon installation, but that&#39;s not necessarily why its asking for those permissions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yep - couple of weeks ago a friend of my from the wayback time machine messages me to share that a song we both dug from a concert 20 years ago (lead singer is no longer alive) played on his Pandora. Later another 20+ year old song by the same band played on his Sirius in his car. A couple hours later, yet another. Every time it happened he texted me a pic of his stereo. Later that day, my Pandora on my tv played the same band - this is a rock band and the song played on a station set up for classical music - totally didn&#39;t belong there.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They never send me stuff when I talk about Flat earth. I search it all the time too. But I  Did do one search for a weed-whacker a few days ago, non stop ads for lawn equipment since. If they really knew me though, they would know I don&#39;t like advertisements and pop ups, those make me not want to buy from that source. They have a long way to go to figuring me out and I&#39;m a pretty simple person. Would also mention the amount of random bot phone calls I get on my cell each day. If they knew me they would know I don&#39;t answer those calls... maybe if they are listening to this it will help them better approach me .  </p>
