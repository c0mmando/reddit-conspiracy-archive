What is the deal here? Catalonia is trying to separate from Spain because of government tyranny and corruption, and Spain has sent police in riot gear to shut down these voting booths and beat people in the streets. What sparked this and how come practically no one is talking about it? This is easy political points for any politician speaking out against this blatant dictator (king of Spain) ordering police crack downs.</p>

<p>Perhaps they don&#39;t want the world to see where people are actually winning against their government tyrannical overlords. Don&#39;t want us getting any funny ideas of freedom.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t trust the vote, and not because it being supressed (ALL my pro-independence friends went to vote, I would say the police acting like apes promoted this referendum as well), because the ones that organized the referendum and the ones that counted the votes are ALL pro-independence. And there are several pictures of people voting 2,3,4 times without any problem (<a href="https://www.facebook.com/spara2nunkat/photos/a.10151584980204728.1073741825.51727889727/10155954399479728/?type=1&amp;amp;theater">proof</a>). </p>

<p>The situation is pretty bad thought, they have split the catalan society in 2. The people in northern Catalonia are way more pro-independence than the people in the province of Barcelona (the richest one by far); a lot of important companies are leaving Catalonia and heading to Valencia or Madrid... And of course the hate from Spanish people in general towards Catalonia is increasing as well.</p>

<p>If Catalonia somehow becomes an independent state, there will be a huge exodus, a big part of the population will leave this land (including me and my family) and companies as well, Catalan economy will suffer (outside of Europe, with a huge debt (35.4 percent of its GDP), with Spain on bad terms meaning a big boycott to catalan products, exportations)... and more. This will be a f disaster.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Europe says no, which also means it will turn a blind eye to every form of violence, political or physical, that will be exerted on the Catalans by the pisshead Spanish. It also clearly stated that if Catalonia were to leave it would also mean they&#39;d be kicked out of the EU, which is absolutely incomprehensible from a moral perspective because it&#39;s utter blackmail. </p>

<p>The murderous hypocrisy through vile bureaucracy the EU embodies is unparalleled. Fomenting wars in Ukraine, the Middle East and the entire Northern African region, moralizing countries around the globe, but being guilty of the repression of dozens of nations of people within the EU borders ... </p>

<p>The fucking EU and all of the bloated fat cats feasting off of it need to be lined up against a wall. As long as that doesn&#39;t happen, nobody will know any peace. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>For some reason creating a non violent coup d etat, including kicking the oposition from the Catalonian Parliament, making your own referendum laws ignoring the procedure and minimal requirement, and shitting in the Constitution in general is illegal. Crazy I know.</p>

<p>Despite what clickbaity media tells you, though the police response was disproportionate in a few places, the number of injuries that needed hospitalization were 2-3, one had a heart attack, other was hit by a rubber ball badly. Few days ago Generalitat admitted they inflated the number of injured counting everything, so stuff like bruise in the knee because you tripped = injured.</p>

<p>No one reports it because after that isolated incident there haven&#39;t been anything else worth reporting.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>so let me get this straight .... the catalans feel too rich and don&#39;t want to share their wealth with the poor lazy spaniards, is that it? hence the independence movement?</p>

<p>and all that, after you all almost went bankrupt and germany had to bail you out? now you want to leave and have millions of people left on their own, because they&#39;re too lazy??</p>

<p>i was supporting this independence, you know, if you want it, how am i to say no? but honestly, if this is, you should be ashamed of your selves.</p>
