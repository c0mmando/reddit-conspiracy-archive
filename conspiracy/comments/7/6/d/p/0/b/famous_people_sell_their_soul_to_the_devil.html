    <div class="md"><p>Some famous people are prostituted into it by their parents, the ones that start young and grow up to become actors, singers. Selena Gomez started in Barney, moved to Disney and now she is one of the most famous people in the world. Others decide to sell it themselves, they sign their name with blood on a book, and are baptized into satanism. That is why celebrities often flash signs of the devil horns, the 666 sign and the all seeing eye. Many celebrities have admitted to it in their songs, Michael Jackson, Arianna Grande, Jay Z have all said it in their songs. Beyoncé said it during an interview, as well as Arianna Grande.  <a href="https://youtu.be/XqwIWPcbhQU">https://youtu.be/XqwIWPcbhQU</a> that video has the proof of them talking about it, watch it and tell me what you think.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He is a conjuration of the LORD of hosts.</p>

<p>One day <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Job+1&amp;amp;version=NLT">the members of the heavenly court</a> came to present themselves before the Lord, and the Accuser, Satan, came with them.  “Where have you come from?” the Lord asked Satan. Satan answered the Lord, “I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that’s going on.” Then the Lord asked Satan, “Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless—a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil.” Satan replied to the Lord, “Yes, but Job has good reason to fear God.  You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his property. You have made him prosper in everything he does. Look how rich he is! But reach out and take away everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face!” “All right, you may test him,” the Lord said to Satan. “Do whatever you want with everything he possesses, but don’t harm him physically.” So Satan left the Lord’s presence.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>“Look, I am coming soon, bringing my reward with me to repay all people according to their deeds.  I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.” Blessed are those who wash their robes. They will be permitted to enter through the gates of the city and eat the fruit from the tree of life.  Outside the city are the dogs—the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idol worshipers, and all who love to live a lie. “I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this message for the churches. I am both the source of David and the heir to his throne. <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+22&amp;amp;version=NLT">I am the bright morning star.”</a> The Spirit and the bride say, “Come.” Let anyone who hears this say, “Come.” Let anyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone who desires drink freely from the water of life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, they usually have a high need for attention and fame that apparently is so deep in them that they are willing to sell their soul and sell out their own beliefs for the will of their handlers. They become a product puppet they control to do their bidding, selling thoughts and behaviors to the masses of entertainment-obsessed  sheeple. Then we see their meltdowns or crazy behaviors that are a sign for help, or some part of their initiation into the illuminati, ala Kati Perry, Britney Spears, Kanye, Miley Cyrus, etc.  Don&#39;t know what the bleached, short hair has to do with it, but it&#39;s an interesting commonality among stars who do this stuff.</p>
