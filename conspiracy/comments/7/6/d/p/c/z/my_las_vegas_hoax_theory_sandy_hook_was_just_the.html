       It was a hoax. No one died. Police worked with crisis actors to fake death and injury and to incite panic among the real concert goers. Mandalay Bay, Jason Aldean, event security, police and hospital staff were in on it and instructed to treat it as a FEMA drill and issued a gag order. That's why they confiscated and wiped all phones and laptops of images.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were no gunshots. Just a recording played on high-powered military grade hidden speakers at different locations. No bullets will ever be recovered from the crime because no bullets were fired. Paddock's room is a staged movie set. FBI leaked the photos on purpose to throw us nosy people off.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why? 1. Gun control. 2. Liberty Act. 3. Practice for a possible real event in the future.  These hoaxes will continue until they achieve their legislative goals.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm betting 10 totally real accounts are going to tell me they really honestly know someone who died.

       Okay, but why? If you're a super secret, all powerful shadow government with infinite funding trying to take over the world, why not just actually shoot people? Your theory doesn't make sense if you think about how much easier/cheaper/safer/less likely to fail it would be just to actually carry out the attack.

       If the victims are fake, the cover-up is a lot easier (even though they're botching it in this case).  Real grieving families tend to be more troublesome to deal with.

       Would it really be easier to handle the families of the victims, then keep Mandalay Bay, Jason Aldean, event security, police and hospital staff quiet? Why would all those people participate? Why wouldn't ANY of them talk?

       There are no victims, only "victims".  Money and not wanting to be suicided can seal those lips.  Many past conspiracies involving a lot of people keeping a secret have been perpetrated.  See Sandy Hook, 9/11, JFK, MKUltra, Manhattan project.

       It's not that hard to understand.  Fake victims and their fake families are easier to keep quiet than real victims and their real families.

       Right okay, fake victims, but what about the Mandalay Bay, Jason Aldean, event security, police and hospital staff you mentioned? Why would Jason Aldean keep quiet? Would it really be easier to staff entire hospitals with fake nurses and doctors that work for you, rather than just actually shooting the people?

       Money and very serious threats.  How did they keep everyone quiet for the past conspiracies I mentioned?  You underestimate how much harder it is to control real victims and their families.  You're gonna have to kill a lot more people after the fact in a real event.

       I agree with you that the powers that be have some method of keeping people quiet, I'm just curious how they do it.

      <p>
       I often wonder about the people who rigged the world trade center with demolition explosives. How would the elites even go about recruiting people for the task? How would the elites make sure these demolition crewman remain silent? How do they find people who will cooperate?

       A mix of compartmentalization, only recruiting people who they are confident believe in their cause, recruiting people they can blackmail, 
 killing people they not sure of, very real threats that they actually go through with when necessary, and money, lots of money.

       They are called assets, they are useful tools for the elite. The pawns really vary. There are Mk ultra victims, or sleepers who are specially trained and carry out important missions then conveniently lose all memory of it. While many others, most politicians are simply blackmailed, through whatever weaknesses the agenies can exploit why things like pizzagate exist. I just wanna tell you man, I think you are wrong about vegas. Your points are unsubstantiated, you really expect ppl to believe you, for what reasons. Yes sandy hook, 911 had elements that didnt add up. This too, Im not saying its not a conspiracy, Im just saying this is quite a claim, some evidence would be nice. I can follow your reasoning somewhat but am having a hard time with it. This fake stuff seems like a psy op to me. The illuminati elites love death, they love killing, they hate us. They love confusion and tainting conspiracys. I think this is just another example of them attempting t discredit conspirascies by creating multiple narratives, to try and make us look bad. ie flat earth

       True yeah I as trying to respond to both of u at once, sry if it got mixed. It's a tough question and one of the biggest reasons ppl have trouble believing conspiracies. I think the answer is divide and conquer. They compartmentalize everything, to the point where no one can see the bigger picture. They feed their own agencies disinformation and give them different reasons for doing what they do. So even if they somehow get busted, there is no links the them. Look into the word assets, as in CIA assets. They use many ppl who would have no link back to them. A good example is Laura Silsby and the new life children's refuge they got busted trying to smuggle children out of Haiti, with small links to Hillary Clinton. I'm sure all of these ppl were assets, who knows what the agencies have on them, you'd be surprised how low they will stoop

       Im just gonna tell you I dont undrstand your reasoning at all. You think the elite is worried about a 50 bodies on their conscience. Why not just do it for real. It makes much more sense from a sacrificial standpoint which it truly appears to be. Done right in illuminati pyramid(luxor) courtyard, on the 1st of october harvest festival. I wish you were right. But all the evidence Iv seen points towards a real tragedy. Please stop muddying the waters and hurting our cause, and if your gonna post this. Provide logical reasoning and evidence

       I would say that this a continuation of Sandy Hook, not a hoax like Sandy Hook. Reason being, Sandy Hook was done so poorly, why risk that again? In Sandy Hook, no one has seen photos of the dead, there was no video, and the 'crime scene' was demolished with workers and gag orders. Not really the case here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just think Operation Northwoods, the government is okay with killing its own citizens. The FBI is literally a manufacturer of false flags.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would think this would have too many moving parts to fake. Not because of keeping people quiet, but because you would need a massive amount of coordination to make it seem realistic.

       What you're describing would require the cooperation of 100+ people. How do you think "they" would go about recruiting people to participate in the hoax? How would would they have confidence that any of these people wouldn't come forward?
