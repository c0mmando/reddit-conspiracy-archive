        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Here’s what I think. It could be as it has been explained. Campos could be camera shy or hiding something that is unrelated or the government is the conspirator. Let me challenge that with a more insidious plot. </p>

<p>What if it was all a ploy by weapon manufacturers and weapon accessory makers. Guns are like a precious commodity. Hell its even like oil, when there is speculation the prices can soar. </p>

<p>Think about it. If anti gun activists make a big enough stink, laws will be written to ban bump fire stocks and high cap magazines (for example). When a law is implemented for weapons, it always states that anything built/manufactured prior to the law is exempt and anything built after said date is a federal crime. Well then you can say a typical 30 round mag which sold for $25, now sells for $75 dollars. These bans come and go. Only thing that changes is the bank accounts of those vested in weapons and arms manufacturing. Also surplus will always be there, banning further builds is pointless. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes and no. I always look at it this way. When I served in the military I was privy to a lot of shit. And those who worked with me had the same job and the utmost morals. After leaving some joined private corporations. Anywhere from Blackwater to BP fuel. </p>

<p>Whenever we spoke or messaged it became apparent that all of their morals had gone out the window. All hail Super Corp. </p>

<p>And yes most of the time corporations are in bed with the government. Although, they are still greedy enough and underhanded enough to backstab or leave the other out in the cold. </p>

<p>Literally just my opinion from my own personal observations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is definitely risky. But here’s a thought. The same people in the government that could orchestrate something like this don’t always stay in government. They get hired on as high level execs with these very same companies that I believe could possible pull off something like this. </p>

<p>Again just my opinion, no proof that it has or will happen. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory, but the problem is that the large increase in prices you&#39;re talking about typically end up in the secondary market.  Firearms producers aren&#39;t seeing those gains - they&#39;re limited to private owners who purchased the items before the ban and held them, and gun shops who are buying off private owners to resale for even more, or are dealing in consignment.  </p>

<p>Scares, when it looked like Hillary would win for instance, benefit the producers because there&#39;s typically a run on guns and ammo and they move a ton of units. Outright bans are bad for business. Unless they&#39;re selling on the black market. In which case...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Damn good point sir. My thinking still makes me think there would be a way to profit. Possibly selling third party vendors pricey already made mags that are pre-ban from manufacturer stock pile. But offer a bulk discount to them which is still above market value but only looks good superficially.  </p>
