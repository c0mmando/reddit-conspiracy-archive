<p>The time to despair isn&#39;t now. I&#39;m not one of those &quot;we&#39;ve already won the elites are defeated&quot; people. But I am someone who sees that they are weakened- far more than they have been in several generations. Far more than we may ever see again if we don&#39;t seize <em>this</em> moment. The final changes, the final shocks they need to jolt into the system, have and will continue to weaken them.</p>

<p>In order to fully gain control, they must open a &quot;window&quot;. But this window isn&#39;t exclusively for them. This is where the danger lies. Through their hubris, through the pain and catastrophe they wreak about them, they wake people up. Slowly but surely, and at an increasing pace. People around the world are waking up. And the Elite&#39;s have been set back in some place- often by members of their own class who have a different vision for the future.</p>

<p>These are the divisions we must exploit. If the situation hasn&#39;t changed in 5 or 10 years, then perhaps I would understand hopelessness. But as it stands we are on the cusp of a time of great, <em>fundamental</em> change. And anyone can seize power during this time- the Elites, as the consolidate it, or the People, as they retake it. As another user here already said- Night is always darkest before Dawn. </p>

<p>Of course that&#39;s what they want. These are the same people that slaughter millions of innocent people for oil and kill their own people under false flags. You didn&#39;t sign up for a cake walk fighting these people.</p>
