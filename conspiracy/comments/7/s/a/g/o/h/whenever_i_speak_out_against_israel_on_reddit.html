       I wish I remembered. It had some generic name like "Combating the Foes of Israel Online". It was really fucking blatant. There were sections in it that would go something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       WHEN YOU SEE THIS:
Israel influences U.S. elections.
      </p>
      <p>
       THINK ABOUT THIS: 
Israel has always been a friend of the U.S. and while the government of Israel has no influence in U.S. elections many politicians and citizens of the United States are sympathetic to our cause for freedom and fighting the terrorists of Palestine.
      </p>
      <p>
       SAY THIS:
Israel does not influence any elections in the United States. The idea that they do is preposterous. Israel is a small country and doesn't have the power of the United States so it couldn't even be done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Israel and the United States have a long-standing friendship and for one country to interfere with the other would be an egregious violation of their trust with one another. Israel is a land surrounded by other Arab countries who would like nothing more than to see them destroyed. The U.S. recognizes this which is why the two countries have such a strong bond.
      </p>
      <p>
       AVOID THIS:
Don't give the appearance that you are a citizen of Israel even if you may live in the U.S. and are not. Write your comments so they appear that they are neutral in nature. Don't engage in name calling but try and hold the higher ground while also inserting statements about how ridiculous the idea is that Israel could influence U.S. politicians. Do not mention the ADL, AIPAC or other organizations which lobby within the U.S.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean the whole book (a PDF really) was so fucking in your face I couldn't believe they had the balls to publish it.

       I'm going to meet some friends for a much needed cocktail shortly but I promise I'll come back and try to find it. I wish I could remember what particular group put it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ran across it a couple of years ago (
       <em>
        probably in this subreddit
       </em>
       ) and sat there eating carrots or something mindlessly putting them in my mouth without even looking at the bowl because I couldn't tear my eyes away from the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I used the word blatant before but it was really that. It was so fucked up that it was like watching Inception. I was like "this can't be real... someone had to mock this up. This is like a conspiracy in a conspiracy".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'll look again later.

        Of course, you should be picketing outrageous "one state" events and
debunking books about the "Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine," but don't expect that type of activity to win
many new friends for Israel. At the most, it will limit the damage a bit. Think carefully about why you
are not convinced by the latest anti-Israel book or the university Israel Apartheid Week.
       </p>

      <p>
       It might be slightly true if universities are holding "Israel is apartheid" at weekly intervals.

       If you're talking about the post itself, that deals with issues besides Trump and Israel. It's a little disingenuous to pretend all people were downvoting because of Israel as opposed to the main part of the article/headline which was actually about the Russia investigation.

       I downvoted that thread without commenting, like I do to most of the partisan news articles here. Mainly that, and the fact that the Russian collusion is a psy-op(despite a rather large investigation outside of YouTube and Reddit) covering for trump being pro-Israel (like every other politician and media mogul) makes zero sense. Are you saying he can't be both? Saying that one cancels out the other? Wouldn't it make sense for the largely Jewish entertainment and media industry to not create a "psyop" if he's out there sucking Zionist dick?

       There was an article a few years back in the Washington Times reviewing a movie about the Rape of Nanjing. The review derided overly patriotic Chinese and cartoon cutter Japanese villains.
      </p>
      <p>
       I commented that the Rape of Nanjing was as bad, possibly worse, than the Holocaust. I questioned whether the Times would refer to a movie about the Holocaust with terms like “overly patriotic j e w s” or refer to Nazis as”cartoon cutter villains”. I said this review sounds a bit racist. My comment was deleted by the mods.

       No one is forced to upvote or downvote.   All voting is by anonymous user names.    I am just saying list those anonymous names.   No freedom lost.    Only transparency.

       It's not really that. People do it at their own will. Israel is one of the only things you can  go I to both politics and TD and they'll both downvote the shit out of you if you criticise. Years of brainwashing and propoganda have done wonders for the Jews.

       Very much. I think their entire "war" with Palestine is manufacturered and that they fund the opposition. They have already got caught doing that in Egpyt. it's lies on top of lies.

       Assuming the news is lying is probably a healthy perspective. I was happy to see that a bunch of groups boycotted the women's march in LA over Zionist Charlise? Theron's speaking arrangement. The tide is turning, positive pressure can do it.

       I daresay, most of us were the same way until we finally started to have some doubts about the completely one-sided nature of the entire narrative and finally looked into it and found more than just a few contradictory surprises that were a matter of record that narrative is used to deny and suppress.

       Why just the Pres? They could have dirt on anyone. TBH they can probably manufacture “dirt” on people. Credit issues thru fraud, fake allegations to law enforcement, we could go on and on. I imagine the Mossad as a whole don’t operate in the USA en masse.

       It really isn't. Any anti-Israel or America First sentiments usually get quickly deleted and/or banned by mods. I suspected it had been the case, but now I finally have clear evidence of their tampering thanks to ceddit.

       The real antisemitism is the dehumanization of the Palestinian people. It is sickening how mainstream and acceptable it is to now claim that "Palestinians" don't exist, don't deserve basic rights, don't deserve basic human decency and respect, don't deserve to live, don't deserve justice for the various war crimes committed against them daily, etc. Yet trying to speak out against this racist, antisemitic sentiment gets the shills calling

       I know you guys won't approve but please at least appreciate the honesty. As a Christian, I have a clear pro-Israel bias and feel more connected to that country than the one I was born and raised in. Many Christians feel the same way, so while there are definitely bots at work, there is also a cultural pressure to defend Israel, even if its as simple as downvoting you out of spite.

       It's absolutely terrible, I am in no way in favor of oppression of the Palestinians. I'd even support a two state solution to ensure it ends, though I'm sure that would only lead to instability in the future. However, there are actors in Palestine and surrounding countries that have sworn to destroy Israel. Being raised in a Christian household, I i have a certain connection to the Israeli state, and I'm sure others here may as well which would contribute to the OPs idea.

       Would you feel differently about the situation if the founders of the modern state that is tormenting your co-religionists (who have practised Christianity in the region for thousands of years) had called the country they created in 1948 something different, like "We Are All Equal Land" or "Nation of the Golden Rule"?

       With respect, the situation you deplore can only exist as long as people such as yourself feel unable to condemn it because the founders of this modern state happened to give it a name that resonates with your particular holy book.
      </p>
      <p>
       Far from inspiring practical compassion for your fellow man, it seems to me that you are crossing to the other side of the road in the name of Christ: your faith calls you to do nothing more than wring your hands (or pray, which to me is much the same thing).
      </p>
      <p>
       Or are you one of these End-Timers that is looking forward to the apocalypse? If so, do you not think that judgement on those who have killed innocents in the name of the Lord will be as terrible as the righteousness that has caused so much slaughter in the Middle East?

       I think a genuine Christian would feel particular sympathy for the Christian (Arab) population of Palestine which has brutalised by the Israelis - yet you identify with the Jewish/Zionist oppressors.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've got Stockholm Syndrome built on solid base of Christian-Zionism.

       Yes, the Bible calls me to be a Zionist. Thats a small bit of my faith, so please don't judge my religion based on one comment. And that's the thing- I do sympathize with all of those persecuted in Palestine. But neither side is innocent, there are states that have sworn to destroy Israel. You must realize, the end of the Bible describes a great war against Israel, which I'm sure contributed to the sympathy the American population has for Israel. That doesn't mean we have to tolerate the bad shit they do. But it does mean that people are naturally ready to defend Israel as the Bible tells them to do. Americas bombed the shit out of more countries than Israel ever could, but that doesn't make all Americans evil.

       Where exactly? If you are a Christian, your faith should be predicated on the New Testament - you know, the book about Jesus Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Didn't Jesus criticise the old teachings of the Jews and create a new religion - Christianity? Why then would Christians pay obeisance to the Old Testament (the Torah) which is explicitly the teachings of the Jews, those who repudiate Christ?

       All political ideologies have some no life assholes with no job getting paid by some other political zealots to spread propaganda. Even groups you'd consider good. Really every political group there is has people doing this willingly thinking they're doing God's work or something since they're too useless to get a real job and too scared to live in the real world where one political ideology gettibg implemented isn't going to make them happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       So yes, probably. You probably won't get a totally positive response unless you're in a circle jerk. It's fairly rare to find non brainwashed people who completely agree with each other on any one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       But before you start wondering about bots or paid propagandists, just remember that a lot of people are crazy obsessed with a lot of political shit that the real them doesn't even care about.

       I think most of Reddit is just hardcore liberal and likes to agree with the rest of the herd. And even the most conservative you get on this site it the Donald which is alt-light idealized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just face it, Reddit generally favors the establishment. You're never going to get any criticism of zionists. Nobody is ever going to allow the Jewish question to be discussed on this site. Even approaching the subject neutrally will be labeled hate speech unironically.

       Trump's not perfect but I'd say most people on /pol/ want him because of the wall, unfonrtunately the U.S is not ready for a politician that can shake off the Zionist yoke, and when we are, such a politician will likely be assassinated.

       Zionists just have too much control at this point, we take what we can get. There's a time and place for everything, but Trump is at least a step in the right direction, plus the border wall will buy the U.S time from spiraling into a degenerate leftist hellhole do to demographics.

       Most of us want the wall, because the wall will give U.S demographics some time, minorities tend to be easy to corrupt plus very gullible, once American white demographics collapse, that's it, there is no return, the Zionists will have won.

       We're not going to get an anti-zionist in high positions of government for a long time, if ever. The war is won by winning many pivotal smaller battles. The wall is one small battle, limiting immigration is another small battle. You can't throw those away just because you want everything all at once.

       The wall and the "war on whites" are both Zionist creations. Standing up to this cabal will require Americans of all races and religions to stabd up for what's right. Whites will be a minority by 2050? silly to focus on that.

       Minorities coming into the U.S are largely low IQ welfare dependants who will never choose to give up welfare in the name of stopping zionist wars. These people are not going to fund zionist wars when they're managing their own countries with their own money, therefor it is better for them to remain there for the sake of humanity, but as soon as they get to the U.S they get on the welfare teat and it becomes near impossible for them to shake that chain.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sorry, most minority groups with the exception of Asians (who vote solid blue anyways) are just too suggestible to the welfare demon than to stand up to Zionists, most will take the welfare and run.
      </p>
      <p>
       Choose welfare and Zionist wars, or destroy/greatly limit welfare and no more Zionist wars,

       Because the welfare state will have them perpetually vote for the Zionist liberals that hooked them on that juice. Most minority groups are especially easy to tempt, and you wonder why they want to come here? It's because their governments are corrupt and because low IQ people are suggestible to corruption. America will not make it if its IQ keeps plummeting, it will lose the ability to look out for posterity if she hasn't already lost it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Divide and conquer is destroying borders, not preserving them. Democrats will always be in favor of the welfare state, Republicans you can get them to part on that issue as they see how devastating it is on the family unit. Republicans have their neocons as well but they also have their Ron Pauls, but the issue of welfare is a massive one as these immigrants will always be easy to bribe with the promise of welfare and infinite immigration for the rest of their families back home.
      </p>
      <p>
       America will not survive if she takes in the world, that is precisely what the cult of Zion now wants to do to Europe. Borders must be enforced, and the time is running out for this.

       Alright I see your point and somewhat agree with it, but building a wall won't have any significant effect on anything. We already have drones flying our borders 24/7. And even if you fixed the democratic party voting Zionist, you've done nothing about Christian Zionism and Zionism in big business.

       Yes but it's just a step in the right direction, we're not going to get it all at once. In fact demographics already look bad (white children are already a minority in the U.S) and there is trouble looming ahead of the west because the demographics are already baked in and I don't really advocate for removing people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Limiting welfare will limit that amount of babies they can produce and cause a lot of self-deportations, so IMO, that would be a major defeat on Zionism as it would loosen their grip on the west and help white demographics a little. The wall is not going to turn the baked demographics around but it's meant to help a little.

       It's not like it was a group of highly intelligent God-fearing men that built this country from scratch. The natives didn't do it, blacks didn't do it, hispanics didn't do it, why do all these groups want to live white governments? In Europe and the U.S? It's because race, IQ, and the ability to defer gratification matters, and all of that lives within the blood of a people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Race matters, race matters so much so, that this is the entire point of destroying borders. The closer different groups come together, the more they tend to resent each other, thus we're back at discovering why borders formed in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you think racial tensions have only gotten worse? That's because the races are, in the end, different, and they prefer different things. It will end in war, just as it did in the past. You know the saying "If you want peace prepare for war", and borders are enforced by a military.

       I've noticed this as well. It's pretty obvious. It doesn't even need to be criticizing Israel as a state. Anything about Zionism gets down voted to hell also, and that's a political ideology which any self-respecting Jew would admonish, and plenty do. Nevertheless, there's definitely a lot of manipulation of pretty much every form of social media platform subverting any form of criticism of Israel or anything relating to it.

       here's a conspiracy theory for you (Disclaimer: I do not endorse this.)
      </p>
      <p>
       we live in a highly complex simulation. The most important place on a simulated planet with simulated intelligent life, would be the areas that have simulated natural selection and have changed the course of events or otherwise greatly effected the outcome of the simulation. Places where religion first spread. Places where urban societies first developed. If these places exist, if they are real then there in fact would be evidence going further back. Depending on the size and length of the simulation this could be problematic. I want you to think about the name for a second. "Is Real." Whenever you need a parabolic history lesson, we have a story for you. The first religions talked about gods and the great ether beyond, and people with unimaginable powers. People probably with GM status in the simulation. Or more importantly, a very accurate simulation of early religions which would have guided us towards the truth of this not being reality. Within this simulation Every type of civilization imagineable has a story, (but not all types exist or have existed) even ones which are impractical or counter intuitive have stories. Behavior control is very strict within the simulation, beyond that which can be found in natural environments even because there is definitely none-random moves being made about what goes where at times. What do we call these pre-major religion cities or places? The Earliest cities? Of course, we call them babylon. Because at some point all the possible stories have been said and you're just talking about one of the same old functions that makes a city unique, with a different name. So you're babbling on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is Real.
      </p>
      <p>
       You begin to question things. Anytime you bring up the city that says defiantly, this is real. This is base reality, not a simulation, down to it's very name and nature you will be attacked. It needs this to maintain a relationship with base reality. Regardless of if it is or not, this need to control goes well beyond the bounds of standard amounts of care - even for the fanatical religious or ideological. It enters the realm of certainty of action - the result is that in the world around you, due to their absolute certainty of a goal these "Game Masters" of the simulation as it were, anything that deviates from what they have set in place is negative and to be worked out. To call to question anything truly and openly, no matter how ridiculous or questionable, will cause you to be openly attacked. But how close you get to the core of the issue can be described by how fast a conversation about it moves towards entropy - because to talk about the true nature of things will always damage the simulation's agenda: which is to simulate data about an unknowing world, like the one it probably came from - or at least an uncertain world. The problem is that uncertainty may have been a result of not knowing, whereas in a simulation you can know some things for sure - to more of a degree of accuracy than would ever be possible in a naturally occuring environment. That behavior is not popping up in the places you think when I first stated it; it's not a problem when you throw stones, drive cars, write on a napkin or interact with the opposite sex, no. It's an exploit that is best seen by looking at how people interact with each other. If ever there is anything that is beyond question; you know who your masters are.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a-political regarding israel. I don't ever talk about it. But I have noticed that bringing it up is like a black hole, the gravity of which nothing escapes. Is Real.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you say this is a simulation and claim that is your real belief, although irrefutable, you will be attacked. If you claim israel is not real, you will likewise be attacked. The degree to which you state it will determine the degree of system resources they put into governing that particular behavior. If you say the Palestinians were there first, which is true, you will be attacked. If you say the jews made up their religion entirely in order to control some part of the world which is offering information against it's certainty, I would be surprised if such a post, if serious, ever made it to the internet. Again, these are not ideas I endorse they are just fun thought experiments. It's about Information control and warfare. Who has the best propaganda? If the simulation is real it's best chance of survival (continue simulating) is if we all forget that this isn't real and do what the admins say, and let nature other than that take it's course. Because it's no longer a science experiment. It was reliable enough that they propped things up on it, even things which have since fallen into each other, and now, regardless of the reality of the situation, it's the world we live in.  So stop asking. Stop searching. Stop believing otherwise. Is Real.

       Zionist have a program you can download for free that links you to social media posts where Israel is being discussed so that the shills can brigade. Its very effective sadly, unless you check their comment history any average joe will think its just another random person, not a part of a cordinated astroturfing PR team. Israeli government will actually pay students insane money to just post daily using the program that points them where to post.

       They don't. Hate is a strong word and a waste of energy. That word has caused more damage to humanity throughout history than any other. The Israeli government is likely behind all of the astroturfing, whether it's paying human beings or employing bots that look for phrases and utilize semantic analysis. They're an intelligence partner too, so...it makes logical sense that they probably get help from "US" as well in keeping their image clean online and stifling dissent.

       You can't believe that people hate violent Muslims? I still can't believe this sub takes their side. Israel's shady as fuck but I'll take them over Muslims any day.

       The Jewish Zionists are actually more reasonable than Christian Zionists who are generally way more dangerous and a pain in the ass.

       They're all pro Israel muppets though.

       Israel uses JIDF, megaphone, hasbara to quell online criticism by getting it's young supporters to play PR clean up for them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Google the hasbara handbook if you want to see what kind of debate tools they use to win arguments.

       Israeli society (one of the oldest in humanity)  was the first to minimize the impact of a pantheon of gods.
      </p>
      <p>
       By going with only one god, they minimized the negative impact of doing stupid things in the name of gods, and gained early advantages over other societies.
      </p>
      <p>
       They further codified quite a number of natural laws (science), as religious law.  This enabled them to advance in other ways.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because of this continued intense focus, they have been able to retain somewhat of an edge over other societies through much of history, even today.
      </p>
      <p>
       Early banks, for instance, were often owned by Jews, who simply lived by Torah law, and were able to stay above conflicts of their day.
