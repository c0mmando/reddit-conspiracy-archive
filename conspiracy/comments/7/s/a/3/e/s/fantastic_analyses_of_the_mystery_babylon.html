       I would like to share with you what stood out too me.
      </p>
      <p>
       First and foremost was the Luxor pyramid and obelisk and sphinx that happened to be overlooking the entire event. And based on the Babylon rising Series by William cooper
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqTmAMKvSls">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqTmAMKvSls
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This gentleman William cooper had a radio broadcast in the 90's detailing his research of Egypt, biblical history, occult societies and the history of the power houses throughout time.
      </p>
      <p>
       He talked about the American worship of Isis/Columbia many years before Isis was a thing in its current context. He also died just after his prediction of a terrorist attack in new york that would have Osama Bin Laden as the “Scapegoat”.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we’ve got a bit conspiracyish so I might have lost some people.
      </p>
      <p>
       But lets take a look on Google earth, you can join me and check it out for yourselves.
      </p>

       444.44 yards (2.22 nm)and 111.11 degrees from tip of the pyramid too center of the Harvest (my computer autocorrect too Harvey..... hmmm) festival.

       the same from the Mandalay Bay hotel too stage.

      </p>
      <p>
       and curiously enough from the Mandalay Bay hotel too the Luxor Pyramid capstone is 444.44.
      </p>
      <p>
       An equilateral triangle of 444.44 yards forms between the 3 focal points.
      </p>

        https://imgur.com/xUw8WA4
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       the angles of an equilateral triangle =60.60.60 or 666.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another thing that jumped out at me was the height of the Mandalay shooter. Being on the 32nd floor this already has connotations of the 32nd degree of freemasonry.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Luxor pyramid has the brightest light on earth, shooting up into the heavens. The metaphor of illumination and the light bringer are brought to mind.

       The date counts have some interesting discoveries. 6Y 6M 6D Is the next total USA eclipse simaler to the last one.
      </p>
      <p>
       6Y 6M 6W 6D before 10-1-17 was feb-14-11 The Day of Rage and the beginning of Arab spring.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I check to see who died and this gentleman passed on this day.

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Shearing

      </p>
      <p>
       Shearing was a member of the Bohemian Club and often performed at the annual Bohemian Grove Encampments. He composed music for two of the Grove Plays.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a coincidence lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       6M 6W 6D before 10-3-17 was Feb 14 2017. This was the day they evacuated oroville due too the Dam issue. On the day this happened I checked the date count of when oroville was founded and found that from its founding until its evacuation was 111Y 1M 11D. This is what I call a “Call back” Or a reference to previously researched dates found via Date counts.

      <p>
       Also from 6-15-96 too 10-01-17 is 7777 days which is also 1111 weeks. From the Bombings in Manchester

      </p>
      <p>
       Stephen Paddock is the name of the shooter. Stephen means
      </p>
      <p>
       “a first name from the Greek word στέφανος (stéphanos), meaning "wreath, crown" and by extension "reward, honor", from the verb στέφειν (stéphein), "to encircle, to wreathe".[2][3] In Ancient Greece, crowning wreaths (such as laurel wreaths) were given to the winners of contests. Originally, as the verb suggests, the noun had a more general meaning of any "circle"—including a circle of people, a circling wall around a city, and, in its earliest recorded use, the circle of a fight.” Paddock means An enclosure for Horses or other grazing animals like sheep or goats. Oftentimes set aside from the regular grazing area and usually a smaller enclosure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where does Marilyn Manson come in? Well I hadn't seen him in the news in Ages and I see a couple interviews of him talking about columbine, which came out on 9-23-17. Now He has a new album called heaven upside down. The first track on this album is “Revelation 12” which is the day of the Rev 12 sign.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the day before The shooting Mr Manson was crushed under a giant GUN prop on stage.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzVCaxdb6vo">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       So he comes out talking about Columbine The first big noted mass shooting in recent times. Then a couple days later is injured by a giant gun. The day after that we experience the biggest shooting in history.
      </p>
      <p>
       So lets look at the songs he just released before the shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Released Sept 11th..... hmmm
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Let's make something clear We're all recording this as it happens Those diamond-bullet storefront-blood-bank Splinters and stained glass
      </p>
      <p>
       The world was stripped of its superficial surfaces We don't intend to just eat the street The asphalt is the good meat And we will sleep on the skin of its nightmares We will sleep on the skin of its nightmares "It's time to just kill this crowd And scream as fucking loud..."
      </p>
      <p>
       We dont intend to eat the street. Its time to just kill this crowd and scream just as loud.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fire fire fire fire fire away Fire fire fire fire fire away Fire fire fire fire fire away Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire away (22 fires)
      </p>
      <p>
       I love the sound of shells hitting the ground, man I love the sound of shells hitting the ground I love it
      </p>
      <p>
       I really dont have to emphasize or doing any reaching here. This is pretty odd.
      </p>
      <p>
       The next song off his album released 11 days before 10-01-2017 which is a 111 day. Kill4ME
       <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marilynmanson/kill4me.html">
        https://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/marilynmanson/kill4me.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       From the getgo the title is apt.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your hotel hall won't be so vacant And I can tell that you ain't faking Because I take death threats Like the best of them Hotel hall......
      </p>
      <p>
       “This is a sacrifice.” Self explanatory.
      </p>
      <p>
       The North American leg of the Heaven Upside Down Tour will begin on September 29, and will incorporate dates at several music festivals, So the tour began and the gun fell upside down injuring him at the start of his tour.
      </p>
      <p>
       So on further research This album was supposed to release on Valentines day.2-14-17.... Wait a tic. We just saw this date. 6M 6W 6D before 10-01-17 was this day the same day they evacuated oroville.
      </p>
      <p>
       So since we are on the subject of lyrics. When I google Aldean the first thing that popped up was this song.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-truth-lyrics-jason-aldean.html">
        http://www.metrolyrics.com/the-truth-lyrics-jason-aldean.html
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       “Tell em all I'm out in Vegas, Blowin' every dollar I ever made, Tell em that I must be into something bad for me cause, I sure lost a lot of weight.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is that I'm asking you to lie, And we both know that it ain't right, But if you ever loved me please, Have some mercy on me,
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell 'em anything you want to Just don't tell 'em all the truth Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth I still need you.”
      </p>
      <p>
       A very odd coincidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we've already found that this day is reduced to 111. Notably when they were looking for Marilou danley the shooters wife. They used a picture with 4 ft 11 and 111 pds
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://philippinesreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Marilou-Danley.jpg">
        http://philippinesreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Marilou-Danley.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       She apparently has multiple passports and marriages. Odd.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       But about the 111
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3e/Comparison_of_pyramids.svg">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The height of the Temple is 111 meters meaning the Brilliant capstone resides there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The mandalay Bay hotel is 146 meters tall and is 43 stories tall (146/43) gives us the average meters per floor 3.4 meters x 32 floors 108.8 meters is where that estimates the height of the shooter. Which is pretty close to 111 meters
      </p>
      <p>
       This specificity in positions is not an accident. As this entire part of Vegas is owned By MGM formally Circus Circus with underground trams and tunnels connecting the areas.
      </p>
      <p>
       And is amplified by the research into distances between the Mandalay, Luxor and the stage. 444.44 yards connects these 3 points which makes that equilateral triangle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you have at least 3 accounts of a woman Telling everyone they are going to die, this woman was labeled Hispanic by this person and dark skinned by another person. She says that they escorted her out. If this is true security personnel would have something to say on the subject.
      </p>

      <p>
       And you also have this preacher dude Standing in front of the concert doing his spiel. We've seen this many times before so its not shocking, but its just an additional piece.

      <p>
       So the daily bible verse from Chabad.org is very applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 60-65 of Psalms. Psalms is a book of verses written to music. So we have the musical connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       Chapter 64 smacked me right in the face. Hard, jeez.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+64&amp;amp;version=NIV">
        https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+64&amp;amp;version=NIV
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I take in all news and data points whenever I look into things, A holistic approach is required and nothing can be cast aside as not applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was startled to read the Tom Petty had a heart attack shortly after the Vegas shooting. The media then went back and forth saying he wasn't dead and then he was again. Tom petty was one of the founders of tom petty and the Heartbreakers, and he died of a broken heart.
      </p>
      <p>
       He was 66Y 11M 11Days old on the day of his death and the Vegas attacks. This converts to 66y 345 days 34566.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how does that connect back to Vegas because a linear connection isn't as solid as a fractal or spiral.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://lasvegas.eventful.com/events/tom-petty-/E0-001-096910854-1@2016102020">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This shows that Tom Pettys last performance in Vegas Was at the LUXOR hotel On his 66th birthday Almost a year from the Harvest that would take place on 10-01-17.

       Submission Statement:
      </p>
      <p>
       I shared a documentary by William Cooper yesterday on here analyzing the esoteric symbolism found at the Luxor Hotel, next door to Mandalay Bay. u/swordofdamocles42 shared the above information in the comments. I asked him/her to make a separate post with it but they asked me to instead, saying YouTube deleted their channel after talking about this topic. I don't have any way to verify if that's true or not but it's what I was told. Anyway, the information above is good and, in my opinion, heavily insinuates a Mystery Babylon/esoteric mystery religion influence in connection to the Las Vegas shooting. Hope you check it out.

       Hello folks, this is pretty funny. This is my post.
      </p>
      <p>
       I come on reddit and search "date count" to see if other folks are lookin into similar things.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see this post and my words. but the title said by u/swordofdamacles.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am smiling because  Someone read my words, repeated them. then rinse and repeat and then i find this and it is swordofdamacles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im amused at the upvotes.

        The Las Vegas shooting happened exactly 133 days after the Ariana Grande Manchester false-flag massacre. Here are the other indications I've gathered showing it was an occult ritual sacrifice.

       Incredible researched man. Further strengthens my belief that Las Vegas was a mass ritual sacrifice. What do you think of the shooting in Florida today?
