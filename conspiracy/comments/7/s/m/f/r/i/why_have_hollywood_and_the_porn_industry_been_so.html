       One company owns most of the porn websites. They probably make videos based on what current fetish is popular. A couple of months ago it was interracial porn.

       The two brief scenes in Netflix's
       <em>
        The Man In the High Castle
       </em>
       - about an alternate reality where Japan and Germany won WWII - in which the Japanese trade minister flashes into the Capitalist Democratic reality of our actual timeline. The first one at the climax of the first season, the second in the relative earlier part of the second season. It's obviously meant to be a good, vibrant, healthy place compared to fascist paranoid timeline.

        He is only there for a few moments but the first one prominently displays a bilboard for
        <em>
         Lolita
        </em>
        by Kubrick, the second time he immediately goes to a bookstore and picks up a copy of Lolita and the camera closeups on it
       </strong>
       . In fact these scenes are so short that's really about all the attention

       i think Lolita represents that it is a decadent and relatively free place, not necessarily healthy. the same frame has a chocolate bar billboard AND a billboard of Ronald Reagan shilling cigarettes lol!

      <p>
       it may also just be a self referential joke. the tag line for Lolita is "how did they ever make a movie of Lolita". which could also be applied to a sci fi novel about the triumph of nazis and the japanese empire over the united states.

       Thank you.

      <p>
       I strive to be successful in life after growing up broke and seeing my family damn near starve, and it is very annoying when my more-than-privileged friend (who has never really struggled in his 24 years of living) just denounces me with "money is the root of all evil."
      </p>
      <p>
       No, Mother Fucker, being hungry to the point of contemplating crime is. I recall having very dark thoughts about how I could get my family a good meal back then.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm happy I didn't, but those moments in life made me believe that the stress that comes from a lack of income is absolutely the root of all evil. The desperation was disgusting and I'm so disappointed that not only I had to go through it then but so many still have to go through it.

       It's weird how much people on this sub dismiss money as the motivation for bad actors. I guess because if it's just being done for money you can't claim you and whatever group you identify with is being specifically targeted.

       Just bc they know they're "grown women" doesn't change the fact that their fetish is engaging in sexual acts with girls who aren't grown.

       And some of these "grown women" you're referring to are teens, at the ripe age of 18 so I would argue not all are technically grown, but in a legal sense they are.

       Interestingly, in much of the world (Canada, for example), a lot of ddlg porn (video and even audio recordings made by consenting adults) or art/comics like hentai as another example, can get you in a lot of trouble with the law.  I participated as a technical expert in a Canadian case where an individual had a large hentai and ddlg collection, and learnt that an adult portraying a minor is considered CP from a legal standpoint.

       I don’t know why you are being downvotes here.
Sure, maybe the collective community of “links” who are into this shit agree that they only want young girls over 18. 
But who’s to know what one thinks? 
Some of this is absolutely pedo-like and it’s fucking weird. I’d agree that it at least subtly promotes the idea.

That adult girls acting like younger girls isn’t pedophilia? I get that.

       While I agree that’s dumb, I legitimately think people are mad at
       <em>
        exactly
       </em>
       that.
I’ve heard people dislike furries for the sole reason of “Those freaks like fucking animals”.
      </p>
      <p>
       Consenting adults roleplaying as a taboo subject gives off a weird
       <em>
        vibe
       </em>
       . But that’s all it is. So it’s not inherently wrong. But I can see how some people would think so, and I do agree, that it could be considered as such.

       Don't know, don't care, not at all interested in thought policing.  If a crime is being committed, you prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.  Otherwise, in the realm of consenting adults, to each their freaky own.

       As an aside, I discovered my father's extensive porn collection as a kid - and it wasn't classy Playboys and Hustlers.  It was shit you can only buy in specialty stores.  BDSM, Barely Legal, Juggs, Anal mags, swinger mags - the whole damn shebang.  Many years later - well into adulthood - I joked about it with my mom who said he was the most conservative lover in bed and she had no idea why he bought such "out there magazines".  Point is - sometimes it doesn't mean anything, it's just weird shit people get off to in the privacy of their own mind.

       "barely legal" is one of those terms they use to promote it

       Im just bringing that up as an example. You have seen it and are aware of it. Why do you think that's there. Maybe because it has something to do with a law? Are you able to buy and watch pornography as a minor? Of course not , why do I have to explain this

       Various Laws are in place to keep adults from Showing Porn to Minors. Including siblings, Children, Underage uncles, etc.  Most deal with the punitive charges on the Adult who shows the Porn. Or makes it available.  Argue it how you will, A minor who watches porn will not get in trouble, but whoever owns the porn playing device could.

       It's only human nature. Way back when, people used to have babies as soon as they finished puberty. If the girl is fertile, why reject your instincts to mate?

       Of course pedophilia isn't being openly promoted. However, the entertainment industry has without a doubt been sexualizing younger and younger girls over the years. I saw this Miley Cyrus music video recently where she was dressed up like a baby, a fucking sexualized baby singing about whatever depraved things her writers chose for that song. It's all really disgusting when you look into it. I'd say the main motivation for this trend is money, as it's almost always money. However, given what we know about the upper echelon of the entertainment world, it's hard to shake the feeling that it's just going to get worse and worse. Today, we've got teens doing what can only be described as softcore porn under the guise of art.  They're selling sex and being showered with praise and fame and attention, while millions of young girls worldwide look to them as role models.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, while pedophilia isn't being openly promoted, sexual depravity of all sorts is definitely being sold through the "art" of younger and younger entertainers, desperate for fame.   It's not good.  When will people draw the line? What exactly are people waiting for? It's only going to worse.

       I know people might think I’m hyping Netflix, but it’s where I saw the documentary “Hot Girls Wanted” about the amateur porn industry.  It was interesting and seems to confirm some of the horrible stuff I’ve heard about the exploitation going on behind the scenes.  But, anyways, there was a part in the doc where they talked about how they’d put up modeling job offers in various other cities.  The ads were up front about it being nude modeling, or at least I think they were, and asked for interested people to send in pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was a line uttered by one of the people going over the responses, about one of the responses.  The line was something along the lines of “What about her?  She looks like she’s 12 and has DD’s”.

       Part of it is the massive amount that we have access to now. It's a running joke that we jerk off with 20 different tabs open, all running different videos. And we don't watch the same videos more than a few times. There's just way too much available and it's all so disposable.

       Not sure about blatant pedophilia, and the incest is not blood incest but related by marriage bs that is just culturally unacceptable in the west which is why people get interested in it. It is taboo.

       People already like it, and it's nothing new. Quite ironic in light of the secular lambasting of cousin marriages:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Americans’ Most Searched Porn Term is Direct Incest With Mummy
       </p>
       <p>
        Secular scholars have for years been virtue signaling their moral supremacy to the Bible’s allowance of cousin marriages and how that racist and hateful old south practiced this regularly to maintain their endogomatic racialism. Yet what do we have here? Modern Secular America’s favorite sexual fetish is guess who? Their mommy!

       It’s too destroy western culture. Porn has been used as a psyop in many wars. It’s to keep the population distract and disfunctional. Most of this porn originates overseas, it’s free right? So how do they benefit by providing free porn? The benefit is that it is a psychological attack on American culture and the sheep eat it up because it is free and Americans don’t question motives. You tube inserts this garbage in their YouTube feeds on little kids with the Elsa gate. They want a degenerate and addicted population because then the population is easy to manipulate.

       Our entire lifes as human beings become more and more diverse with every day. A lot of reason for this is the technologic advance aswell as the ending of social stigmas and taboos.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actually we become more free and indipendent with every single day. (Sure this is not a story you would tell but its mostly bc you cant relate to any time where we didnt have the opportunties of today).
      </p>
      <p>
       Just 50 years ago the average life was WAY less diverse and so on it was a lot easier to manipulate and control people. 100 year ago its was even more easier as you can see from the  2 WW where young and the stupid got tricked into fighting 2 inhumane wars over years. Nowadays everyone would just go home after a few month.
      </p>
      <p>
       500 years ago your life was even more controlled. You litteraly were born and lived your life in a cricle of 20km max. If you werent in the 1% your lifes was litteraly bound to your birthplace and your profession. Most of the time you didnt have the opportunity to do the job you want but in which you where born into. Also your entire life was SUPER dependent from your local lord.

       How? By misspelling independent?
      </p>
      <p>
       The statement you quoted is unequivocally true. As America progressed in it's history, it's citizenry has become more equal and more free over time, not less. That isn't to say that we live in a utopia or that there aren't sincere social issues to wade through as can be found within any major society, but to claim anyone is less free and has less opportunities for independence
       <em>
        now
       </em>
       than any other point in our nation's history is completely absurd. We enjoy a free and open society here in America and provide a platform for our citizens to air their frustrations and make change that simply isn't found anywhere else in the world.

       Saying that money isnt the payoff because it is free is like saying that sams club and festival are trying to controll me with free samples. In reality porn works in much the same way. Some people pay for it because they want premium content, because they don't want to wait for it to come to a free website and because if you pay for the porn you stand a better chance of watching porn that doesnt feature somebody who was exploited.
      </p>
      <p>
       The free videos lead to people buying, and then there is the ad revenue. Did you ever notice how the first time you click a video on pornhub for the day it reroutes you and opens a new window? How about those ads on the "click here to view video" screen? Did you ever notice the ads about hot singles in your area or pills to get bigger? All of those make money for the site holder based upon views and clicks. The site holder then pays a fraction of that amount per click, view to the people who upload the videos, so the site holder just has to keep the site up and its free money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sex isnt dirty, it is a natural things between people. Without sex I wouldnt exist, neither would you. People have this puritanical view about sex and porn, when in reality these are pretty normal things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you consider porn more depraved than going to a prostitute? Western culture was founded by prostitution. Men got money and went to a bar to "Get a post." The women are the ones who saved up this money and opened shops and helped the west grow.

       </li>
       <li>
        I think if sex controls you so much you have to hire a prostitute then you are not only an addict you are a predator. Instead maybe develop some social skills and build a healthy relationship that is founded on love. 
3 using a prostitute is deviancy in my opinion, our country was also built on slaves that does not make it ethical or a practice that we should continue.

       Anyway, it seems like the mission is accomplished. There's at least one person who equates hiring a prostitute with being a predator. Have you considered trying out for the Olympics? You'd surely earn gold at the long-jump because that's a massive leap you just performed.

       Resorting to demeaning comments because you can’t logically argue a point? I am here to share information not argue with someone who merely wants to justify sexual predatory behavior. Healthy sexual behavior involves mutual respect and equal footing between consenting adults do you realize that? Or do you think porn depicts healthy sexual behaviorist? 😂 
You are endorsing disfunctional and abusive sexual behavior which is why decent people will never support your ideals. How are your social skills ? Using prostitutes says a lot about your personal values and lack of emotional connection during sex. That is not ideal or healthy.

       It's your opinion that people who hire prostitutes, apparently anywhere for any reason, are equal to sexual predators. It's my opinion they aren't. I think a sexual predator is someone who goes out and forces themselves on an unwilling subject, not carrying out what amounts to a transaction with a willing party. Obviously I am not talking about victims of sexual trafficking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not everyone that turns a trick is owned by abusive pimps named Upggrayed. Ever been to Nevada? Legal brothels, where people go to work, selling their bodies in order to provide a service. How is that act substantially any different than someone who works in any skilled labor-based service? Would you call people that hire independent contractors to replace their roof immoral? Or is your moral superiority only applied to situations where sex is involved?

       Well incest is quite easy to explain. Its just a lot of people have this kink. Its a fantasy a good amount of people actually have and this is their way to please it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing wrong with "incest" porn in my opinion. The thing why many people have an incest fetish is thats easy relatable (a lot of people have siblings) and its a social taboo (even though not like pedophillia which will absolutly ruin your life no matter what).

       I am pretty sure I read somewhere that japan has a lower rate of rape than the USA and it was credited to the availability of hardcore rape porn.
      </p>
      <p>
       I feel like OP just has a normalcy bias that the incest porn and "pedophelia" just doesnt fit into.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me put it this way. I watch porn, I have for some time. I am happliy married and my sex life is great, but I am young and always want sex so I watch porn when my wife isnt up to it. I also have daughters. I love my daughters. I also have a sister whom I love a ton.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no desire to have sex with my daughters or my sister. However, I reallly enjoy the alex tanner video where she is blackmailed for stealing money. I also enjoy a few of the step daughter videos online. I am not attracted to my daughters or my sister, but I like porn on those topics. Its just like if you watch saving private ryan and you enjoy the movie but dont want to go back in time and storm the beaches of normandy.
      </p>
      <p>
       These outlets in media allow us to enjoy something vicariously, even if we don't want to do them ourselves. As the acting gets more real more people get turned off. I only use pornhub, if I venture further down the pornucopia and go to xvideos or heavy-r the acting gets too real and it freaks me out and I dont like it. Sort of like how when I watched 13 hours even though I liked the mpovie it was too real for me. I liked saving private ryan and I liked other war movies but when you get something so real and action packed like 13 hours it was just too much.
      </p>
      <p>
       Media sells what sells, that just the way it is. This however does not mean that we are more depraved.

       i'll bet it's more about social stigma of reporting it than availability of rape porn.

       Just here to respond to the note about Japan - do you think that the extreme drop in birthrates in that country could correlate with the rise of hardcore pornography?
      </p>
      <p>
       From what I've gathered, Japan is in crisis in part because many of the younger men have grown up on the idea of overtly perverse sexual behavior being the norm(lots of reasons besides internet based porn) and demand sex that more closely emulates pornography, and that this has essentially caused the female population to wall themselves off from the opposite sex, hence the birth crisis.  Meanwhile, those same men who now know their sexual desires won't be met by the women they live around, so they avoid confrontation entirely by subsisting on porn and onaholes; perhaps sex robots once they become more readily available. They turn themselves into betas because women aren't into them and it is easier to turn to technology to satisfy your urges than it is to engage the opposite sex. Women don't want betas, they want men.

       Maybe because the people who control it are mostly of the lowest life forms. Lately their more legitimate film maker colleagues, on the other side of the valley are in hot water.  So they are trying to save them by reducing the perceived evil of some of their hidden dirty secrets.

       Ok if you do not know by now let me tell you.
      </p>
      <p>
       To lessen the impact when you hear names like Spacey and Sheen in cases of rape of childeren.... your subconscious says well I saw it on x x x, must be ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more is that a lot of this in Hollywood and xxx is simulated daddy porn and role play... yes there's lots of illegal stuff too but what OP is talking about I'm assuming he's referring to the specific paid professionals to look like innocent little girls as if youth was a sex tool or something. Do not forget how the women treated Taylor lautner during the vamp movies. Children are adored everywhere by everybody, what I don't understand is where are the damned parents in all of this?
      </p>
      <p>
       2 things, abide all state and local laws (I'd say federal too but marijuana) and the other thing it's rampant everywhere so that when the even bigger names than Spacey and Sheen  (sheen will go down) even more bigger names will come up.

       because they are trying to normalize it.. make it more if a sexual preference thing not a crime.. they know the time is coming when the elites in hollywood and politics get exposed for participating in pedophilia and they want to neutralize the outrage by making it publicly accepted or at least the perception of publicly accepted via the tv /film/ news propaganda machine

       Incest is a really common fetish depending on where you're from, and what may seem as pedophilia is more targeted at teenagers who search for lookalikes of girls of their age, it's all about niche.

       Even though this is from a movie, it shows how sex and religion work together kind of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hollywood sells sex, the Evangelical religious leaders condemn sex. It's a win/win for people selling that stuff on both sides.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normal sex is healthy. Pedo shit and incest are considered taboo. It's like extremely off limits fetishism. Since porn is readily available and has been online for a long time now, the kink factor needs to increase to keep people interested. The problem with that though is that there's a ton of gross weird shit out there now.

       Porn industry collects data and wants to make a profit. If the data shows that %48.5 of searches in a region included keywords pertaining to incest they are more likely to release the content people are looking at to maximize gains. Plus look at the user age for porn and the general age the Oedipus complex is most active.
      </p>

       Does it make it right? No. But are they catering to a prominent section of users to increase fisical gains? Yes.

       This topic came up preciously and I noted my concerns there, but I've also begun to think that if you're a person who justifies trying to(or actually does) fuck their family; step or not, porn probably wasn't the thing that caused you to come to action. If porn has that sincere of an impact on your actions, you were probably fucked up to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having said that I still don't understand the appeal or why it seems to be getting pushed so hard these days. I will admit to having watched some step-siblings/parents themed videos, but I wasn't beating off to some ridiculous taboo fantasy - I beat off because an actress I found attractive was getting plowed by a male actor who wasn't their
       <em>
        actual
       </em>
       family member. So long as that basic criteria is met, I'd beat off to just about any scenario.

       the fetish isnt engaging in sexual acts with girls who arent grown though.  The fetish is engaging in sexual acts with adults who are roleplaying as if they are naive, innocent, and virgin.

       I know people might think I’m hyping Netflix, but it’s where I saw the documentary “Hot Girls Wanted” about the amateur porn industry.  It was interesting and seems to confirm some of the horrible stuff I’ve heard about the exploitation going on behind the scenes.  But, anyways, there was a part in the doc where they talked about how they’d put up modeling job offers in various other cities.  The ads were up front about it being nude modeling, or at least I think they were, and asked for interested people to send in pictures.

       There was a line uttered by one of the people going over the responses, about one of the responses.  The line was something along the lines of “What about her?  She looks like she’s 12 and has DD’s”.

       Don't know, don't care, not at all interested in thought policing.  If a crime is being committed, you prosecute to the fullest extent of the law.  Otherwise, in the realm of consenting adults, to each their freaky own.

       As an aside, I discovered my father's extensive porn collection as a kid - and it wasn't classy Playboys and Hustlers.  It was shit you can only buy in specialty stores.  BDSM, Barely Legal, Juggs, Anal mags, swinger mags - the whole damn shebang.  Many years later - well into adulthood - I joked about it with my mom who said he was the most conservative lover in bed and she had no idea why he bought such "out there magazines".  Point is - sometimes it doesn't mean anything, it's just weird shit people get off to in the privacy of their own mind.

       Im just bringing that up as an example. You have seen it and are aware of it. Why do you think that's there. Maybe because it has something to do with a law? Are you able to buy and watch pornography as a minor? Of course not , why do I have to explain this
