        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p><a href="https://nypost.com/2018/01/23/disgraced-fbi-agent-referenced-anti-trump-secret-society-in-texts/">There has been some soft coverage and such</a>, but on the whole it seems to me the media was most likely part and parcel of said &quot;insurance plan&quot;. That would explain why both the FISA memo and the agent&#39;s text messages are being downplayed.</p>

<p>Its quite a scary situation to be presented with; a media establishment teaming with the intelligence community to facilitate the continuation of the existing social, political, and cultural order in the event of a Trump win?</p>

<p>Its almost as if such a phrase was used by an agency almost 100 years ago when explaining the justification for its existence;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://fas.org/irp/crs/RL32095.pdf">From its official inception in 1908, the FBI’s mission, jurisdiction, and resources have grown substantially in parallel with the real or perceived threats to American society, culture, political institutions, and overall security.</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One might wonder if perhaps the end game of the current political climate is a shift in the locus of power from the executive to career intelligence agents. </p>

<p>Be it Trump or anyone else at the helm, these are dangerous times for this Republic. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s interesting seeing the evolving defense of Trump&#39;s administration. In the beginning, there was no contact, no collusion, and no obstruction of justice.  And now Trump&#39;s defenders tacitly admit all of that is true, but because there were these 2 biased FBI agents and a (non-confirmable) memo from Nunes, that the case must be thrown out because evidence wasn&#39;t gathered correctly (although it was gathered correctly).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are allready to much invested. Some of them changed their complete life with Trump. They cut of contact to democrats and more liberal people. They burned bridges etc. Hell some democrats are starting to move away from places with 70+% for trump.</p>

<p>They go as far as not giving their children a collage education bc &quot;evil librul universtiy brainwashing&quot;. </p>

<p>Some weeks ago I saw a smaller documentations where they visited 2-3 smaller cities in rural north virginia. All communities had like 80-90% of trump votes. </p>

<p>Around 50% of trump supporters there voted for him bc they thought he would be their personal jesus. He would be the next Reagen (if ronald was actually good doesnt play a role here). </p>

<p>Most of them still buy into it but a good amount is like &quot;what else gonna I support now? He is everything I have left&quot;.</p>

<p>And the other ones that voted for trump did it to &quot;stick it&quot; towards the &quot;establishment&quot; (even though its quite doutable if a billionair son could be called &quot;anti-establishment&quot;). For them Trump was nothing else then a big fuck you towards washington. A molotow cocktail. Most people that voted like this have nothing left anyway.
They are mostly betweem 50-70 and lived their entire life in rural WV. They are to old and to poor to move to a city. They are mostly to old to start a new career. 
What they do is more or less wait to die. </p>

<p>Not gonna say all of republican voters are like this but a very large amount of actual trump supporters is either one of these 2 groups. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And they have never presented any evidence that the &quot;biased&quot; FBI agents did anything in the investigation based on those biases.</p>

<p>This country is extremely polarized into those who hate Trump, and those that hate Obama/Clinton, with the population of those that hate Trump being larger. Some don&#39;t seem to understand this, but government employees are also people.  All of them have had political opinions, but were still able to carry out the their duties. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t good enough for his supporters, they seem to want only pro-Trump people in all branches of the government.  I mean, what would appease them?  Do they want the FBI to swear loyalty to Trump?</p>

<p>Perhaps you don&#39;t agree with reporting because you &quot;feel&quot; like there&#39;s something to the story ie you have bought into the GOP propaganda. Sites like true pundit and daily caller are writing opinion pieces with wild speculation - that seems odd. </p>

They ( MSM) will never discuss things like this openly for what they are in an unbiased manner, they have an agenda. You know that already though.

    <div class="md"><p>Ohhh is that why you linked a New York Post which linked to a Fox News article that had Trey Gowdy and another Republican claim FBI agents supposedly referenced a &#39;secret society&#39; in their text messages (which they immediately backed down on by saying, &quot;I’m not saying that actually happened, but when folks speak in those terms, they need to come forward to explain the context with which they used those terms&quot; meaning more than likely the text, if it even exists, has been taken way out of context), yet refuse to show any actual evidence such texts even existed? Isn&#39;t it kind of funny that they don&#39;t actually show the texts at all or even at least read what exactly was said? Almost sounds like....... a bullshit claim made by partisan establishment hacks to try and downplay an investigation into their president and his cabinet? </p>
