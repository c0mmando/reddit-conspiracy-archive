        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is based off his interview discussing the pentagon&#39;s ufo video and nyt&#39;s article. If you haven&#39;t seen it, you need to...
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7rYRGbsMW0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7rYRGbsMW0</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m really questioning his integrity due to the following:</p>

<p>1.) He fails to incorporate his &quot;physics&quot; background into the conversation and laughs at the notion it could be alien, or not from this planet. He continues to call it an object and never address how something like that could make those maneuvers.  </p>

<p>2.) He says &quot;just because it&#39;s a ufo doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an alien&quot;. But then doesn&#39;t address what he means. What else could it be? The fighter pilot who captured the video admitted we don&#39;t have technology any where near as advanced. </p>

<p>3.) He nervously laughs and jokes at every question and response. How could a professional scientist and astrophysicist react to a question 99% of the population care about, especially after the pentagon releases such damning footage. </p>

<p>4.) This is the biggest one in my mind: He is &quot;okay not knowing&quot; WTF! A scientist is okay not knowing something that has dire implications to his job, industry, and our civilization as we know it? Let alone the fact that it defies our knowledge of physics (his speciality). </p>

<p>5.) When asked if he believes if there is intelligent life outside earth. He completely deflects the questions and says, &quot;are there any on Earth?&quot; Then changes the topic.  </p>

<p>6.) He goes on thank the pentagon for installing a ufo research program because if they pose a threat, he &quot;wants them on top of it right away.&quot; How can he go from not wanting to know about it, to considering them a threat. There has been no evidence of a threat and he just abruptly brings that word into the conversation. </p>

<p>7.) Then Steven Colbert brings him on his show and he makes a mockery of himself: 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxc1tasmiCs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxc1tasmiCs</a></p>

<p>What do you all think? How could someone as &quot;distinguished&quot; as NDT laugh something of this magnitude off, make a mockery of each question, and then says he&#39;s fine not knowing. He claims to be a protege of Carl Segan- the man who developed the golden record to search for intelligent life. Carl wanted to know...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then it&#39;s a genuine answer, GMO science is driven and financed by those poised to make profits from it, big pockets with a long reach into politics and academics to control the public side. The very little science that suggests otherwise is attacked to the point of being retracted, and that&#39;s it. A similar schema was up in nutrition science, for decades we had very little science on the problems with carbs and overabundant science against fats, turns out the science was largely financed by agrofood to promote carb addiction versus fat satiety (note that big pharma benefits big time from the consequences but i&#39;m not sure about their involvement, would be interesting to look into), and now we&#39;re fat because &quot;there was no science to suggest otherwise&quot; heh</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When he replies, &quot;Is there any intelligent life on earth&quot; or whatever, he means very simply that we as humans have defined intelligence, so potential alien life could be smarter or dumber and they could refer to themselves as intelligent, like we do.

Anyone on earth can theorize and write books, he&#39;s just good with words and he&#39;s very likeable.

<p>No you got downvoted for sharing your irrelevant opinion that added nothing to the overall discussion minus your again, irrelevant opinion. This upset you so you called the entire sub dumb, which will only lead to you getting snowballed with downvotes. BUT if you want to blame it on people hating your &quot;different totally unique opinion&quot; that&#39;s all you. Like people get downvoted all the time for their worthless opinions, shitty jokes, or dickhead comments - don&#39;t cry because it happened to you today.</p>

<p>Not if he doesnt have an explanation. Public figures speculating is harmful as it skews opinion. On watching the interview he looked like he was trying to reduce ignorant behavior, by not speculating. I think that is the heart of his &quot;okay not knowing&quot;. I would take that to mean, the evidence is strange, but extra terrestrial aliens is a very big leap.</p>

<p>Yes. To be blunt.

    <div class="md"><p>Aliens are least likely just because of the massive scale of the universe. Unless they have figured out how to travel through things worm holes it’s unlikely we’ll ever be able to communicate let alone visit each other - and that’s if we were lucky enough to find each other amongst the billions of stars. </p>

<p>That being said, I absolutely believe in intelligent life I just don’t think we may ever meet them. </p>

And also, the history of the UFO phenomenon, with the countless incidents of the Air Force flying jets after crafts doing seemingly impossible stunts- is that it&#39;s non-human. You should really read some of the literature, especially anything by Richard Dolan or Jacque Vallee. I recommend &quot;UFO&#39;s and the National Security State&quot; by Dolan. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thanks for engaging, friend. I think I understand your question. How do I think I know that there exists something transdimensional, some intelligence out there beyond what humans are coded by? These &quot;entities&quot; could be somehow embedded in us individually, for whatever reason, and we happen to encounter them on DMT, as opposed to there being this interconnected network of intelligence, which shamans and ayahuasca advocates call &quot;Gaia,&quot; if you know that term. It&#39;s a very fair question. Two books cover this question in great depth, and I really hope I can convince you to read one of them. &quot;The Cosmic Serpent&quot; by Jeremy Narby and &quot;Supernatural&quot; by Graham Hancock. There&#39;s a free pdf of The Cosmic Serpent online, I&#39;ve never had anyone not love it. </p>

<p>If there were somehow talking jaguars and snakes embedded in our DNA, why did evolution make that happen?  Isn&#39;t that a big question. Why?  Why and how do people come away with these experiences in which they&#39;re taught these spectacular things, shown seemingly impossible visions and experienced what one of Rick Strassman&#39; s subjects described as &quot;ten thousand years of knowledge in ten minutes&quot;? Who&#39;s doing the teaching? What explains all This? Why the remarkable commonality in visions? There was a big study on ayahuasca by professor Benny Shanon in Israel which found that a lot of people get the same visions, especially jaguars, twisting snakes, and Mayan figures. Sacred geometry is also really common. People are shown things, shown what they need to see in so many cases. This speaks to higher intelligence, what Terence Mckenna famously called &quot;The intelligent other.&quot; What&#39;s the root of this intelligence?  Have you checked out and considered the shamanic explanation? You really should.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve personally been extremely lucky to have almost unlimited access to DMT for years, as well as a lot of time on my hands to explore consciousness, so I sit back, even without DMT nowadays (with weed though) and I get these extraordinary visions. It certainly feels intuitively like I&#39;m tapping into some radio-like signals. Terence Mckenna called it &quot;nature&#39;s television. &quot; Other people use the term hyperspace. You can get there even without DMT, if you know what you&#39;re doing. In The Cosmic Serpent Narby elaborates on a theory he spent a year developing, that the source of the signals, or the manifestation maybe I should say, is photons. Photons are tiny bands of light that scientists have only begun to study in the past couple decades. Anyway, it&#39;s foolish to discard shamanism without looking closely at it. Look at ancient shamanic art, and what do you see? A lot of crystal clear depictions of things that supposedly weren&#39;t discovered until modern times- like DNA. Somehow ancient psychedelic users picked up a lot of knowledge-  from Where? That&#39;s the tip of the iceberg of the story.</p>

<p>I&#39;m on mobile and on the move, but I&#39;ll send you that book and any more thoughts later. Ultimately, I think questioning the physical source of the visions is interesting but less fruitful than considering the nature of the intelligence involved in these experiences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dolan&#39;s work is extremely persuasive in terms of proving that the US government and intelligence agencies have treated the UFO phenomenon as very serious in private for decades. His work is more focused on the documentary trail and the paperwork and collating reports with citations than it is on proving some hypothesis about what the UFOs are. But he has ample evidence to show that at various times, the ET hypothesis has been seriously considered in secret while UFOs in general are publicly ridiculed. </p>

<p>So its a work of history, not science. But because of Dolan&#39;s obsession with citations, uncommon in UFO books, it probably contains relevant data a scientist could follow up on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What would be your starting hypothesis for technological craft under intelligent control doing things no human technology can achieve? There is a huge amount of evidence for this, and it is the explicit conclusion of the recent Pentagon investigation. There are really three good hypotheses: they&#39;re all bunk and not actually real reports, the unexplainable reports <em>are</em> actually human and there&#39;s some extremely exotic technology out there, or the ETH. If you&#39;re familiar with the actual reports, the idea that they&#39;re all wrong just isn&#39;t tenable -- some of the reports have a preponderance of evidence, with the best having multiple expert observers and actual physical data in terms of radar returns (or multi radar returns), photographs, video, etc. The ETH doesn&#39;t have a ton of <em>specific</em> evidence when it comes to raw UFO reports, but to be fair our best scientific theories predict the existence of ETs and their having saturated space. And the idea that there&#39;s a &quot;breakaway human civilization&quot; behind these reports is just as shocking as the ETH. The argument against the human hypothesis is that the apparent technology is so far beyond known technology its hard to reconcile. </p>

<p>The argument for the ETH as I&#39;ve said is predicated on an actual knowledge of the best reports. It&#39;s not proven, but its a very reasonable hypothesis, far more so than skeptics give it credit for because they ignore the totality of reports and focus on individual reports as they come in. </p>

Now add to that the fact that the <em>something</em> is a thing we have no evidence it even exists in the first place then you are just making it even less plausible.</p>

<p>Given that, what we can say is that it&#39;s far more <em>likely</em> to be terrestrial and <em>probably</em> not aliens but that&#39;s about it. Everything else is speculation.</p>

<p>Probably because it wasn’t against the law of physics, and rather you don’t understand physics. Most people who understand physics don’t bother discussing with conspiracy theorists because it’s as fruitless and convincing a religious person that god doesn’t exist.</p>

<p>That you conclude that they must be shills is just another argument from lack of imagination on your part. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hi.  Just thinking back.  I read a few of his books back when I was in high school.  I&#39;m much more aware of the bullshit around nowadays and come to think of it, those books were pretty baseless, and went far off into space, literally.  And into quantum &quot;mechanics&quot; ( it&#39;s really statistics.)  Statistics is for when you don&#39;t know enough about the system and start talking about probabilities of existence and location.  This is a big contradiction that became clear to me, and why Einstein really said God doesn&#39;t play dice or something of that effect.  Dice is Statistics!!  And God is an overloaded concept which to him meant The Naturally Mandated Physics (The Universe / pantheism)</p>

<p>Kaku and Neil DeGrasse Tyson rarely are not doing stunts for profit and should not be trusted.  They clearly use deceptive and evasive tactics.  OP does a great job exposing only one clown like encounter with these wanna-be scientific influencers. (Paid influencers, think about that)</p>

<p>Yes, let me disregard one of the men responsible for formulating String Theory because you say he shouldn&#39;t be trusted. Kaku is one of the most prominent theoretical physicists alive today - unless you can put forth a cogent argument as to why he shouldn&#39;t be trusted, though, I&#39;m all ears!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they aren&#39;t. They are literally a pandoras box, circumventing the natural evolution of plants by splicing in random genes from other animals and bacteria. This creates an unnatural asymmetry in the ecological environment. Just look at what happened to &quot;Round-up ready&quot; crops. It killed a ton of insects, leaving some small minority of those same insects to reproduce, producing stronger mechanisms to resist. Therefore, more numerous and stronger poisons had to be added to your food. It&#39;s like the widespread overuse of antibiotics led to the creation of Methicillin Resistent Staph, (MRSA) and Clostridium Difficile, (CDiff), two absolutely horrible diseases that run amok in every hospital in the country (Firsthand experience on this one). </p>

<p>Nature has checks and balances, evolution moves slow for a reason.  If you don&#39;t manage your land wisely, and pump it full of artificial fertilizers, you&#39;ll destroy the soil lifeweb, leading to an increased need for artificial fertilizers, (which are wholly lacking in micronutrients that displace the toxic heavy metals that accumulate in the soil). If you use GMO&#39;s, you&#39;ll be coming back to Monsanto year after year because the seeds are genetically modified to be non-viable for next years crops, and you&#39;ll have to come back to them over and over to buy whatever new brand of poison is supposed to kill the super-insects that have ravaged your crops. If you till the earth, you&#39;ll destroy the microorganisms, release your soils organic matter to the atmosphere, which will lead to further and further compaction, as well as erosion, and destruction of topsoil. As soon as you have a rain, the soil recompacts even worse than before. All of our &quot;modern&quot; agricultural practices are totally and completely fucking the planet over, and making people more and more dependent on the same institutions selling you cures to problems they created with their last batch of &quot;solutions&quot;. The whole thing is a real parallel to big pharma.  </p>

<p>They lost control of the narritive. Its out of their hands to some extent. Grasping for power, you cant put the genie back in the bottle. You make up multiple genie. Maybe the genie are aliens? Maybe whatever you think you know is a lie? Maybe we are good guys fighting bad guys ( angels / demons ) maybe not. maybe matrix. Blue avians?....</p>

<p>And I agree with you. But either way the fact of the matter is something is going on. Something that has incalculable ramifications for everyone.</p>

<p>The problem is addiction to secrecy.</p>

<p>People think they couldn&#39;t be addicted to secrecy it has to be something else. Meanwhile they sell the three most addictive drugs around the world (Heroin/Cocaine/Meth) to pay for the black projects they are addicted to being secret about.</p>

Many very serious researchers have dedicated their lives to it, and the evidence *very overwhemingly points to non-human higher intelligence.

<p>Or you could smoke DMT and learn that we&#39;re not all alone in ten minutes. But Joe Rogan hasn&#39;t quite been able to convince Tyson to do it, though he&#39;s convinced a lot of other people.</p>

<p>At this point in the information age, this material is everywhere. It&#39;s all over Youtube. You can learn, if you so choose. My good friend saw an orb last year, a huge unnatural ball of light. It changed his life, and he&#39;s spent the last year researching the subject of aliens and the UFO phenomenon. All you have to do is look, and you won&#39;t regret it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup. A normal breakthrough, at least. Not everyone gets to alien intelligence land, but an incredibly high percentage of people do- half to two thirds, according to the only two formal studies that have been done on it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t mind at all, but the thing about these deep DMT experiences is that the absolute deepest places are truly translinguistic; it&#39;s very hard to use language to encapsulate them; they&#39;re very much like an alien abduction. I&#39;ve seen a lot of animals and &quot;therianthropes,&quot; which are these half human, half animal things that are really common is shamanic art and literature. I&#39;ve seen a lot of jesters and carnival theme stuff, really wild, extremely vivid imagery- which is also super common. Those experiences were a lot of fun, but not as deep and challenging as some of the others. I&#39;ve seen what I can only describe as UFO&#39;s- literally, they looked just like modern UFO&#39;s, I&#39;m not sure what that was about. I&#39;ve seen bizarre alien landscapes that only art can capture- winding tunnels with rooms and such, but it happens to fast and is so overwhelming. It&#39;s really like an entirely different world. The big picture message that came through very clearly to me was: Life matters. Do it, take it very seriously. And we are all deeply empowered beings who could do anything, if only we learned the secrets of how.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an artist in the slightest, but I have a lot of other people&#39;s DMT art saved. Here&#39;s some:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow these are great images, thanks.</p>

<p>I have experienced DMT to a degree. Never smoked, but I get sleep paralysis a couple times a week at least, and sometimes I get what I call the &quot;DMT dump&quot;. Essentially the DMT release but I&#39;m still awake, so tripping plus the fun of body paralysis! It&#39;s not as bad as it sounds once you are used to it.</p>

<p>I have seen some of these landscapes but never to a highly detailed level (at least that I recall). I can absolutely attest to the entities though.</p>

<p>Also the astral projection, etc, though I always feel anchored. I never go flying away, which is probably me holding on somewhere.</p>

<p>Anywho thanks for the detailed reply, I try to bring this stuff up with friends but unless you have personal experience, it is very difficult to explain (as you say)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good to hear. I know there are plenty of alien-aware people on this sub, but the thread didn&#39;t reflect that when I came in. It&#39;s fine to be uneducated about a subject. I didn&#39;t look into the ufo phenomenon until my late twenties. Until then I was very much uneducated. It was my dmt experiences that got me interested in it, and I&#39;ve been fascinated ever since. It&#39;s about opening that door.</p>

If you change your perspective on gravity and instead of focusing on trying to move through it via propulsion, to moving from point to point via manipulation of spacetime itself, then FTL travel and anti-grav becomes possible.

And with the simplest argument being that there is in deed tech out capable of crazy manuvres, but its being held under wraps, as any technology deemed useful for military application for &quot;defence&quot;, or more accuratly &quot;sicret weapons tech our enemies might mot have&quot;. Meaning that the truth of such programs from domestic or foreign agents will not become public, and the tech wont become public/comertial until its deemed to be superseeded, or the enemy also has it. At which point it stops being a sicret. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>its most likely not alien though.  its most likely secret  black project tech</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2.) He says &quot;just because it&#39;s a ufo doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s an alien&quot;. But then doesn&#39;t address what he means. What else could it be? The fighter pilot who captured the video admitted we don&#39;t have technology any where near as advanced. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Normal troops won&#39;t know about the secret black project tech </p>

<blockquote>
<p>3.) He nervously laughs and jokes at every question and response. How could a professional scientist and astrophysicist react to a question 99% of the population care about, especially after the pentagon releases such damning footage. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>hes just a guy, he&#39;s not even technically qualified to be answering these questions </p>

<blockquote>
<p>4.) This is the biggest one in my mind: He is &quot;okay not knowing&quot; WTF! A scientist is okay not knowing something that has dire implications to his job, industry, and our civilization as we know it? Let alone the fact that it defies our knowledge of physics (his speciality). </p>
</blockquote>

<p>what has it changed in our lives?  the ufo doesnt effect his job or life at all.  i dont think you know what NDT actually does for work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>5.) When asked if he believes if there is intelligent life outside earth. He completely deflects the questions and says, &quot;are there any on Earth?&quot; Then changes the topic. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>he is having fun with it, hes gone on record many many times about the probability of intelligent life.  he even supports the simulation theory</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6.) He goes on thank the pentagon for installing a ufo research program because if they pose a threat, he &quot;wants them on top of it right away.&quot; How can he go from not wanting to know about it, to considering them a threat. There has been no evidence of a threat and he just abruptly brings that word into the conversation. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean wouldn&#39;t you agree though?  you can want the government to handle safety while not wanting to know about the details...again this is not his field, he doesnt need to care about this</p>

<blockquote>
<p>7.) Then Steven Colbert brings him on his show and he makes a mockery of himself: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxc1tasmiCs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxc1tasmiCs</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>ok?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you all think? How could someone as &quot;distinguished&quot; as NDT laugh something of this magnitude off, make a mockery of each question, and then says he&#39;s fine not knowing. He claims to be a protege of Carl Segan- the man who developed the golden record to search for intelligent life. Carl wanted to know...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>hes just a celeb science person, hes not distinguished in the way someone like hawking is.  his fame comes from TV work, not scientific work</p>

I think that the government already made contact with alien life and they are attempting to cover it up their hardest. Neil is more so an actor so I think (sounds far fetched) but I think he is employed by governmental powers to try and contain this information. A common theme with actors like Neil and Bill Nye is that they use ridicule and mockery to defuse any real argument of alien life or such things, mockery is only short lived though before the truth catches on.

    <div class="md"><p>I found myself having a conversation with a commercial airline pilot, who was a mutual friend. Midway through I was like, do you have any UFO stories? His eyes fucking lit up. He began to explain a time he was landing, and an egg shaped, metallic object flew past his cockpit at an amazing speed, faster than anything we have now. No wings on it at all. I was captivated. He claims he saw a windshield on it which led him to believe it was experimental. </p>

Just the one thing alone that he went around the tv talk shows talking about how asteroid mining was in any way feasible made me literally sick to my stomach.  Any of the old school sci-fi authours (who were all eminent scientists) would have beat him to fucking death with a stout club for spreading such fucking nonsense.  What the fuck is wrong with people, do they really believe that the laws of physics have changed or something?  The soyuz craft that sends astronauts to the ISS is the same bucket of bolts (to the rivet) that sent tortoises around the Moon in 1969.  Absolutely nothing has changed - nothing.  SpaceX can land all the rockets they want, the lb/thrust ratio of fuel hasn&#39;t changed one fucking bit in 60 years.  All the computers and micro-thrusters and automated systems don&#39;t change the basic rules of orbital mechanics and delta-V math.  No one is going to fly out magically to land on an asteroid and mine magic rare elements and fly back here to make money on it.  Not now, not ever.  Any &#39;scientist&#39; who doesn&#39;t laugh themselves sick at the idea is a fraud and should be publicly executed on live tv that is mandatory viewing for the public.  </p>

<p>You are literally saying &quot;it has to be an alien spacecraft, what else could it be&quot;. It could be technology from <em>Earth</em> that we don&#39;t know about. Neil was right - he doesn&#39;t know that it&#39;s from Earth any more than you know that it isn&#39;t. The difference is he&#39;s willing to admit what he doesn&#39;t know, you are making assumptions.</p>

<p>This is the biggest one in my mind: He is &quot;okay not knowing&quot; WTF! </p>

<p>Check out the scientific method. Any seasoned scientist is &quot;ok not knowing things&quot; because they <em>can&#39;t</em> know everything. Some things are too complicated for our limited brains - like what happened before the Big Bang. Just because I accept that we don&#39;t and can&#39;t know what happened before the Big Bang doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m happy being ignorant, I&#39;m just realistic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, they aren&#39;t. They are literally a pandoras box, circumventing the natural evolution of plants by splicing in random genes from other animals and bacteria. This creates an unnatural asymmetry in the ecological environment. Just look at what happened to &quot;Round-up ready&quot; crops. It killed a ton of insects, leaving some small minority of those same insects to reproduce, producing stronger mechanisms to resist. Therefore, more numerous and stronger poisons had to be added to your food. It&#39;s like the widespread overuse of antibiotics led to the creation of Methicillin Resistent Staph, (MRSA) and Clostridium Difficile, (CDiff), two absolutely horrible diseases that run amok in every hospital in the country (Firsthand experience on this one). </p>

<p>Nature has checks and balances, evolution moves slow for a reason.  If you don&#39;t manage your land wisely, and pump it full of artificial fertilizers, you&#39;ll destroy the soil lifeweb, leading to an increased need for artificial fertilizers, (which are wholly lacking in micronutrients that displace the toxic heavy metals that accumulate in the soil). If you use GMO&#39;s, you&#39;ll be coming back to Monsanto year after year because the seeds are genetically modified to be non-viable for next years crops, and you&#39;ll have to come back to them over and over to buy whatever new brand of poison is supposed to kill the super-insects that have ravaged your crops. If you till the earth, you&#39;ll destroy the microorganisms, release your soils organic matter to the atmosphere, which will lead to further and further compaction, as well as erosion, and destruction of topsoil. As soon as you have a rain, the soil recompacts even worse than before. All of our &quot;modern&quot; agricultural practices are totally and completely fucking the planet over, and making people more and more dependent on the same institutions selling you cures to problems they created with their last batch of &quot;solutions&quot;. The whole thing is a real parallel to big pharma.  </p>
