       I kept and open mind that Trump may be what he was representing in a campaign. After a year in office I am convinced that he is either part of the ruling oligarchy or powerless to stop it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you have a timeline set for your faith in him? This is geared towards supporters. Will you still be talking about backroom 4D chess when he is campaigning next?

        In Trump's own words,
       </a>
       here is what drain the swamp meant:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Re-institute a 5-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for 5 years after they leave government service.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ask(ing) Congress to institute its own 5-year ban on lobbying by former members of Congress and their staffs.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Expand the definition of lobbyist so we close all the loopholes that former government officials use by labeling themselves consultants and advisors when we all know they are lobbyists.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Issue(ing) a lifetime ban against senior executive branch officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Ask(ing) Congress to pass a campaign finance reform that prevents registered foreign lobbyists from raising money in American elections.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>

       Fair enough, he did at least start to put into place a 5 year lobbying ban, which is pretty great if enforced.
      </p>

       That doesn't change the fact that the person I was replying to was totally changing the definition of "draining the swamp".

       I still remain optimistic towards him; tensions seem to be rising, which denotes something has been going on behind the scenes. I wouldn't expect a single year to be enough time.

       Here's my philosophy:
      </p>
      <p>
       I am still hoping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of me wants to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want this country to get rid of these elitist pedophiles and these people who have noone's interest except themselves in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I can't openly support Trump anymore.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think Trump is actually already making some great changes for the country, and I'm happy he's our president, but I think he is actually causing more division and hurt than good.

       I will hold on to that little sliver of faith that he will make a change for the better until he is out of office in 2024 (I truly think 2020 might result in a civil war due to the election), but until then there's really nothing I can do.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I won't be preaching how much I believe in Trump, but I won't be fully doubting him either.

       I don't see how he'd be able to remove himself other than a fake assassination. Oh you must mean "other" pedophiles. Not his pal Epstein? Guess not.

       Don't forget, Trump has quite a few rape allegations and sexual harassment accusations against him as well, take that for what it is.

       If there was anything bad about Trump in this memo it would have already leaked, and if it hadn't already leaked the Dems would be screaming for its release.  Instead, they're fighting against its release and propagating misinfo to discredit the memo.

       The threats to nuke NK have accomplished what exactly?  We've seen a likely nuke launch possibly from NK but more likely from other actors.   Why do this?

       Police forces across the country also came out and said "Sorry Donnie, we don't endorse police brutality and will not be banging any suspect's heads into our cars or violently tossing them into paddywagons like you've suggested we do".

       These are out of context.  Its obvious, absolutely obvious, that he's just being light-hearted.  Don't pretend you don't understand Trumps sense of humor just to prove a non-existent point.  This isnt r/politics.  That won't work in this sub.

       You don't understand what the word context means. Nothing has been taken out of context if I'm literally providing a direct video quote of his words. People don't make "light hearted" comments like that without there being actual conviction and belief in them. He would
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       have said those things if he did not actually believe them, and his long track record of comments on protesters and criminal suspects prove that. This was hardly the first time he's made comments like this, "light hearted" or not. Take your head out of the sand.

       Sorry, couldn't quite hear you over your head buried 6 feet in the sand. Trump has said dozens of despicable shit promoting police brutality over his entire life, this is the same man who used his own money to print endless propaganda against 5 innocent black kids in the Central Park Five case, but sure, keep pretending the guy hasn't been a hardcore police state schill his entire fucking life.

       Sweet ad hominem bro. Trump has spent his entire life verbally sucking off the police state. The fact that you are so willfully, happily able to just plug your ears and scream "LA LA LA LA I CAN'T HEAR YOU" when time after time after time this man sticks his foot so far down his throat it comes out of his ass is truly a testament to your ability to ignore reality. Congratulations, truly.

       Pretty telling you gave up arguing any of my points multiple comments ago, because it's pretty hard to argue with actual facts backed up by video, quotes, and decades worth of stories. But sure, ol' Trump is totally a man of the people not a lifelong establishment boot-licking, police state worshipping, fuck-over-the-poor-every-chance-humanly-possible, sued multiple times for racism and sexism piece of shit. Sure. The entire planet is lying and ol' Trump is the only one telling the truth. Gotcha.

        The threats to nuke NK have accomplished what exactly? We've seen a likely nuke launch possibly from NK but more likely from other actors. Why do this? Of what benefit is it to encourage an event that would lead to a much larger scale conflict? Isn't this exactly the kind of thing we're supposed to be avoiding and not courting?

       , made famous by Nixon, where he publicly acted irrational and volatile which should and did scare the shit out of our opponents, and reportedly has had the same effect on Kim. Calling out what's being called a false alarm with no credible evidence otherwise as a nuke being fired at Hawaii because of Trump doesn't reflect reality. What you people never seem to mention is that we didn't start this with Kim, he started it thinking he'd be able to just get free shit as per usual, it just turns out we now have a president that takes his oath to protect this country and honor her treaties with allies seriously, and being threatened with nuclear weapons is actually a big deal that needs demands a response.

       What gets me though is how EVERYONE hates him - I have never witnessed so much hate directed towards one man. Hollywood, democrats, republicans, almost every news org, so many people want this man out.

       If it's all a show, they're doing a hell of a job. If it's not, maybe there is hope.

       Watched an interview between Oprah and Trump from 1988 and he shared a lot of the same views we see today.

       Right now the economy is looking up, unemployment is down, ISIS is losing, salaries are going up, etc.

       Can't say it's entirely due to Trump, but so long as things keep going the way they're going then I'm happy.

       Yes. Which is why I said all those good things weren't entirely due to Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       How long before we know if Trump's policies are having a positive or negative impact on the economy?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe in supply and demand. If the supply of skilled/unskilled labor goes down but demand stays the same (or increases) then unemployment goes down and/or pay increases to retain workers thereby increasing job security.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the number of undocumented immigrants is between 1 and 3% of the population and all of them have been working then if we enforce immigration laws and reduce the number of illegal works we'll see an increase in legal employment or pay.
      </p>
      <p>
       There could be other consequences of curbing illegal workers, but again it will take a few years to see the impact and if it's good or bad.
