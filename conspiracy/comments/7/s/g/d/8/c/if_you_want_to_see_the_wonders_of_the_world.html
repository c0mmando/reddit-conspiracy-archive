        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It seems to be that we&#39;re in a transitional state right now. Many of us may be looking for a way to overcome the force that&#39;s holding us back. I think that both forces (light/dark, yin/yang) reside within us (while simultaneously residing within themselves; yin in yang and the other way around - they are a part of each other) and this is the source of all energy/ life. It works kind of like an alternating current.</p>

<p>I used to think that there may be a way for the light to overcome the dark, but now I think that&#39;s naive (but I do believe humans can overcome desire). Life can&#39;t be without death; death is a necessary part of life - it nourishes the world with the remaining and enables more life to grow. The same can be said with all polar opposites, one side energizes the other giving it life. Balance is the name of the game, and balance is (seemingly) never lost.</p>

<p>In the grand spectrum of human thought and desire, an extreme pleasure is most likely followed by an extreme low. In a perfect and happy moment, there is a nagging feeling that this moment will not last forever and soon will sink back down. That is the yang within the yin and so on. In a terrible, tragic moment there is a comforting thought that soon it will be better (or nothing left to lose).</p>

<p>If we hope to overcome the most powerful human desires and exist in the present moment at peace, meditation is the way. Peace is neither joyful or sad, more of a neutral state. Accepting the light and dark for what they are as one. Energy, reaction and so on. I&#39;m no monk and I haven&#39;t overcome desire, but each unnecessary aspect of my life I give up (ESPECIALLY mental clutter) is like a step closer to a more peaceful state of mind. Not only that, but once you get into it you realize it&#39;s far more interesting than boring old &quot;entertainment&quot;/mental programming.</p>

<p>If we collectively reach a more &quot;neutral&quot;/ peaceful state of mind, that is what I believe will lead to a better existence for all. Getting rid of the extreme desires may end extreme greed and hatred. See it? The extreme despair we&#39;ve experienced or witnessed - that&#39;s brought us to looking for the way out and pointed us in the opposite direction; to love and healing. That&#39;s yin and yang in action, that&#39;s us; energy.</p>

<p>The transition we are possibly experiencing, you could see it as going from hatred to love, but maybe it is a transition from extreme love/hatred to a more neutral and peaceful state, perhaps collective enlightenment (I can dream too).</p>

<p>Education, culture, government, commerce, society in general and its many facets impede the human potential. We have a long way to go before everyone can intellectually and spiritually come to this conclusion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>First step would be to legalise psychedelics, they are a window into the other side of you which you didnt know existed. People don&#39;t believe in finding the path to enlightment because they are too attched to their physical being. Being socially conditioned and literally wired into perceiving reality only through the outside world, we lose our ability to fulfill our inner state. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>LSD and mushrooms are wonderful, they literally give us access to the other 80% of the brain that we never use. A few trips totally wiped out my anxiety and depression because they gave me a much greater image of self purpose. I think everyone who feels like life is meaningless needs to take a trip, not poision themselves with medication for years. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Completely agree with you. I took LSD not really knowing what it was. I was just doing a lot of drugs at the time and wanted to get high. But like you said, I experienced 12 hours of no anxiety and depression. Its seriously magic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I find the concept of trying to be &quot;neutral&quot; interesting. I&#39;ve recently begun to really understand the whole yin/yang thing and I try to fully embrace the concept, but what does that mean for absolute evil? If I initiate an action of the highest, purest &quot;good&quot;, does that open the way for a murder or bomb to go off as the world tries to balance? Maybe it&#39;s best to just sit quietly and remain centered. Or is my act of good an unconscious internal reaction to counteract a previous evil?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. I like to think of the ying and yang energy as the cycle of water. It just helps me better when I&#39;m meditating, imagining myself as a droplet of water, in a beautiful waterfall setting with a galactic sky view, sometimes I&#39;m the descending droplet, or the wave of water cresting the cliff and floating downward, at times I&#39;m also the same droplet, rising up in the air through the natural process. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>This is the conclusion I&#39;ve come to, I meditated A LOT before, at first I&#39;d dream a lot more often and gained control over my dreams, went to sleep in a dream and had an amazing dream within a dream that might&#39;ve been a recovered memory of a long time ago (it&#39;s interesting human DNA is the most powerful storage system) was able to remote view and by the end I was able to astral project. </p>

<p>I was already a targeted individual and didn&#39;t know (from at least 13 maybe my whole life, after talking to some people I think some spiritual people or people with certain energies are targeted from birth) after that they induced horrible experiences with technologies and torture me with directed energy weapons every time I meditate since. </p>

<p>I want to emphasize how fucking wrong and weird it is that I&#39;m banned from meditating and no one knows or gives a shit that specific targeted individuals are tortured/harassed globally. Lot of paranormal/entity/alien experiences are caused by technology. Instead of 20 witches in the past doing rituals and focusing to kill a target now they learned how to alter and focus energy of an intelligent brain by technology. I think our brains are tools to navigate a world created by our energy/thoughts/emotions and those worlds exist because we&#39;re intelligent, creative and able to conceive them so our will/minds manifest different dream/astral worlds because we live to experience and life tries to make the most of itself.</p>

<p>The most important thing I noticed while meditating a lot is a lot more good synchronicities were happening in my life and people I thought about, as if I was controlling my life like it&#39;s a very realistic dream. I was meditating with good intentions, imagine what all PTB&#39;s symbolism/rituals/magick crap are doing to humanity...Every thought, action spoken word should be seen as a ritual. </p>
