    <div class="md"><p>It’s not hate itself, it’s hate placed on the wrong things and the wrong people, used to dived us as to keep us weaker than TPTB. I can hate the bank teller for informing me of some bullshit fee I have to pay, or I could realize it’s the bank that is screwing me and the teller has nothing to do with it. </p>

<p>Still on the larger scale, hate divides. Love, kindness and compassion brings us together and makes the world function better for everyone. Just because we have the capacity for hate does not make it conducive to our existence. One is clearly a better experience than the other. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hate only divides if we allow it to fester. Unresolved. WE need to get to the root, of the hate. To understand its meaning. You can&#39;t just silence it to make it go away. </p>

<p>By ignoring that we have to capacity for hate. That everyone has this capacity it only allows it to further expand.</p>

<p>Yes we have hate and of course it is conductive. Because hate is to feel intense or passionate dislike for something, or someone. </p>

<p>I can hate with a passion pedophilia. I can hate with a passion that murders occur. I can hate, with abundance, and it can be constructive. But that doesn&#39;t translate that I hate murderers. That I hate, pedophiles. I hate the acts. The people I can&#39;t hate. I don&#39;t hate. </p>

<p>Love conquers hate by accepting that it is there. By embracing those with hate with open arms. Love doesn&#39;t try to silence hate, but show  hate another way.</p>

<p>So love, kindness and compassion remain, while hate is there. Hate doesn&#39;t take those things away. No it makes them all the more viable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, absolutely. But hate does not accomplish anything. Extreme hatred usually results in wasted mental energy. If we mean “hate” in the light sense of the word, that one dislikes something or someone, it’s fine. But when you have people with extreme hatred, it often clouds one’s judgement and makes seeing things from other sides, and thus seeing other opportunities to resolve problems more difficult. </p>

<p>I think the reason why OP wants to address the antisemitism and Jew hatred is because it is, in fact, misplaced. Also, it makes us look like idiots and racists which damages the whole community and our credibility. Also, it’s likely that is intentional. And because of that, it’s not unreasonable for the community to step forth, discuss and state that hatred in that form needs to be taken somewhere else. There are better places for them to direct their hatred. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I supopse I was talking out more on hate in general. Not really ascribed to what op was talking about. Sorry to any one that thought otherwise. 
It sparked me to create my own post about hate. Earlier.</p>

<p>But I also continued my thoughts here as well via replies. Sorry to take away from this post. Although I still think if people genuinely feel the way they feel they ought to speak out. Even if they are speaking from ungrounded place. </p>

<p>It allows us to identify a person who might potentially be in need of help. And even if we can&#39;t get them concede the argument it shows  that their is a counter stance against it. </p>

<p>So if you see post like that explain your reasoning.</p>

<p>Take all those post as genuine then expose the flaws in their argument. This is a better way then to cry for censoring such post.
We can not keep reinforcing the idea that we can eliminate or suppress the ideology of hate. So confront it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely agree with you. I hate hearing the bullshit against all Jews. They aren’t all conspiring against the rest of us. It’s like saying all Americans are conspiring against the rest of the world because TPTB that control our govt are doing bad things for profit and control. It’s just nonsense. The same thing has been happening to feminism for a while. There is shit being posted in the name of feminism trying to pit the genders against each other, which is truly disgusting. And the online community is falling for it. I’ve seen a few good women turn very harshly against men and vice versa, when in reality we need to be working together to make sure everyone can exist peacefully and comfortably.</p>

<p>But the Israeli government does completely deserve criticism for their oppressive measures and meddling in other governments for control. Hell, even the show Transparent (season 4), created by a Jewish person and written by Jewish persons, made it a point to raise awareness of this issue. </p>

<p>We need to be working together to thwart TPTB. Any criticism against oppressive forces needs to be stated and discussed but we can’t go down the path of blanket criticism against groups of people who aren’t actually involved. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It’s very confusing bec there seems to be a faction that is malevolent, in any group of ppl this could arise, and then there is just regular everyday Jewish ppl. You can’t blame all Jewish ppl, or even their faith, for what extremists do. Sin and evil do not play favorites. </p>

<p>The situation in Palestine is complicated, and not one-sided. It was set up poorly and allowed to devolve into resentfulness on the part of those displaced to make room for Israel and defensiveness on the part of the Jewish settlers.  Very irresponsible behavior from UN and imperialist countries.  Possibly the destabilization was part of the plan for the region. In that respect, Jews have been used as a pretext for western foothold and intentional unrest. </p>

<p>Then you have those who question there may be global group of elites seeking, umm, yeah...  world domination. Literally.  And I don’t think that membership is restricted to Jews.   </p>

<p>Genocide also knows no boundaries and happens repeatedly. Let’s not be part of the problem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a spectrum. Left wingers criticizing Israel talk about Apartheid states and how the nation itself, as an institute, is oppressing the muslim/palestinian population.</p>

<p>Right wingers criticize Israel by screeching about the &quot;n.gger loving goyims making women into feminazis so they can outbreed the white race using their arab slaves&quot;. Also, a whole lot of &quot;Hitler is amazing, I wish the holocaust happened&quot; thrown in there. Well, the near far right does at least.</p>
