<ul>
<li><p>If Smallpox returned, and we know historically vaccines eradicated Smallpox and saved millions of lives, would you take the vaccine?</p></li>
<li><p>If a job requires you to be vaccinated against Yellow Fever to travel into another country that requires that vaccine, would you quit your job?</p></li>
<li><p>If, under the belief you are one with nature, you reach for a wild bat and it bites you, would you or would you not go in for the necessary rabies vaccinations?</p></li>
<li><p>If you answered &quot;yes&quot; to any of the above questions, do you still maintain your point of view that vaccine science itself does not work and no vaccines can work in any circumstance? Or is your issue more with the additives and you believe vaccine science does work?</p></li>
<li><p>If the issue is additive-related, if trace mercury and other substances you deem toxic were guaranteed to be removed from all vaccines, would you now endorse them?</p></li>
<li><p>Scientists believe vaccines are a major reason human life expectancy doubled since the 1800s and 1900s, along with antibiotics and proper hygeine. Technically speaking, people from back then had &quot;stronger natural immune systems&quot; which is what you believe can cure any disease. if that is the case, why did people die by age 40? </p></li>

<p>In short, people should be adequately tested to ensure they&#39;re not allergic to anything that&#39;s in them instead of only discovering that when it&#39;s already too late to do anything about it and they have to apply to something like the Vaccine Injury Court that uses the public&#39;s money to compensate them because the pharmaceutical companies have been absolved from any failures, deliberate and criminal wrong doing, or out and out negligence of any kind on their own part. </p>

<p>IMHO whlie I disagree with you based on scientific data, your positoin is a lot more reasonable than the people who say all vaccines must be eradicated because vaccines themselves are a conspiracy to suppress our natural immune systems.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too, disagree with you based on scientific data, but I see nothing at all wrong with vaccination as a concept, and even got the flu shot myself, and appreciate being noticed for imbuing a more pragmatic opinion. My issue is with the number of vaccines with toxic adjuvants, and instances such as the gardasil shot leaving girls in the UK with Guillain Barre Syndrome. It&#39;s a very small percentage of recipients who display adverse effects, but that shouldn&#39;t mean it&#39;s acceptable by any means. </p>

<p>Rather than say the vaccines are completely safe and actively campaign against those who denounce some vaccines, it would go a lot further if pharmaceutical companies admitted fault and strove to eliminate the possibility for these various adverse effects. It&#39;s still an amazing feat to accomplish all they have, but the infallibility complex makes them come across like they care about profits over human lives. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t doubt big pharma is corrupt, but I can tell you my father is / was an anti-vaccination person. I would get debilitating flu every year untli I was 20. At 20, 10 years ago, I started getting flu shots. I haven&#39;t had the flu now in 10 years. So maybe big pharma is slowly poisoning me, but for someone who&#39;s being slowly poisoned I sure am healthy and glad I stopped getting horribly sick every year. </p>

<p>Nice big words you&#39;re using. Are my questions really so dangerous? The smallpox one can be &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no.&quot; But either way, you&#39;d have to think about your position very strongly, which is the intent of the question, becaues frankly I feel people like yourself in the true believer camp do not think very strongly about all elements of these positions. Rather, you are so heavily invested in a narrative (&quot;all vaccines are bad&quot;) that you haven&#39;t taken time to look into the shades of grey in between the black and the white. </p>

<p>In some ways I blame this on the anti-vaccine extremists. These are people who would answer &quot;no&quot; to my top 3 questions in this post. So if there&#39;s a measles epidemic they&#39;d say &quot;My children&#39;s natural immune systems will fight it off.&quot; And this creates huge public health concerns. As a result, officials become hell-bent on fighting those extremists, and they now lump everyone together in the same pile, and thus the ACTUAL CONCERNS related to vaccines become completely MUDDIED because the extremists now represent the final say on the entire topic. </p>

<p>Also, spare a thought for those who can&#39;t get vaccinated due to health conditions and disorders.

<p>This is why I delayed my kids schedule. Babies receive so many vaccines with a lot of aluminum over a short period and there is no documentation of toxicity levels.  They don&#39;t test babies for the required brain metabolism to support the amounts injected much less other possible disorders. It seems to me, the wrong approach is being taken in the medical industry.  1st they should do more research on toxicity levels for babies by chemicals in the vaccines then publish them.  2nd - they should do screening and testing of any metabolism or disorders to prevent vaccine injury 3rd they should educate on possible disorders and symptoms and offer schedules.  All of this would alleviate concern.  Today they start sticking needles without educating or testing.  Any questions from parents prompt responses of risk and fear for not getting the shots versus addressing legitimate concerns.  I understand the anti-vax and pro-vax stance but no mature action is being taken except name calling and more fear based tactics from both sides.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand &quot;why fix&quot; if it isn&#39;t broken.  How do you know it isn&#39;t broken?  Today they measure simple variables such as outbreaks, reported cases to sum up success.  But they miss all the data that draws the picture.</p>

<p>1st - If a vaccine victim is rewarded they cannot disclose or share their case and financial reward with anyone.  Doing so would cause them to lose their money and more legal fees. Doctors and patients don&#39;t hear about outcomes.  If it isn&#39;t broken - share the data on vaccine injuries in detail to prove it isn&#39;t broken.  If doctors and people had this view - that picture wouldn&#39;t be so pretty and request to research would be made in higher volumes.</p>

<p>2nd Vaccine attributes are omitted when researching the rise of mental disorders.   This is ridiculous in my opinion.  </p>

<p>3rd Growth of the anti-vax movement to immigration populations.  Immigrants have religious beliefs, disorders and health issues that prevents some vaccination.  Then you have illegal immigrants that we don&#39;t really know how many are here much less if they have vaccines.</p>

<p>By accurately measuring vaccines and its indirect impacts would help improve them and reduce fear.  Making conflated claims, ignoring the issues/concerns to forcing vaccines is not working.    </p>

Most of us have legitimate concerns, but don’t believe that vaccines are a complete farce.

I have a real problem with that logic too. Nothing in this world is perfectly safe. To believe that prevents progress to make things safer or improve things. </p>

<p>The extremists are more likely to be labeled as extremists. People who think Bill Gates is part of the NWO trying to depopulate the planet via vaccines, when in reality the guy&#39;s main priority that keeps him going in life is trying to help the planet as best he can.

<p>My caution around vaccines is reasonable, logical and moderate, and yet I get called a lunatic for not vaccinating myself despite doctors telling me I should not and doing so would not give my immunity due to my health issues.

    <div class="md"><p>To start, I’m completely opposed to mandatory vaccination because we currently do not have any set criteria for those who cannot and should not get vaccines due to underlying health issues. We also lack the ability to properly screen for such underlying health conditions. And it’s really fucking sick to make someone take something that hurts their health and does not protect them (because some health conditions damage a person’s ability to make antibodies). I was one of those people and it severely damaged my health (because of my underlying health condition which doctors could not figure out and kept dismissing for over 15 years, I lost the ability to speak for a week to a month after each batch of vaccines) when I was made to get vaccines according to the rules of the school I went to.</p>

<p>Outside of that, there are harmful ingredients (chemicals which aren’t good for the body, as well as cells of other animals which sometimes can lead to autoimmune problems) in the vaccines which can damage the health of even a healthy person in somewhat rare instances. I want safer vaccines. We should always be striving for safer ways. </p>

<p>I also would like a proper study of vaccines done with a true placebo group, which has yet to be done. They will test a vaccine against other vaccines but never a true placebo. They say this is because it would be inhumane to not give test subjects some vaccine (which is just illogical, because how is giving someone a tetanus vaccine in lieu of a flu vaccine or measles vaccine somehow more humane). This is alarming to me considering they will give cancer test subjects a placebo when doing cancer pharmaceutical safety tests and don’t have an issue with it being “inhumane” because it is the proper scientific method. We need the proper scientific method applied to vaccines as well. The fact they are so opposed to it makes me wonder if there is actually something they don’t want us to find out about vaccine safety or effectiveness. It just is a red flag to me which makes me a little more cautious of vaccines in general.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s list the problems with vax that are known.</p>

<p>Unpredictable combinations.  This is the essence of the design problem of vax - it produces bad combinations that are unpredictable.  Some of the combinations are not compatible with the host, and this will have the net effect of selecting for those who are compatible with it.  So we should be looking at the data and seeing which groups have adverse reactions and which do not.  Those who do not will, if there is nefarious activity, likely show lower adverse reactions across the board compared to those whom vax &quot;does not fit with&quot;.  And one can, from first principles, figure out that there&#39;s a combinatorics issues simply because vax leads to the creation of new substances in the body - and this increases the number of combinations with existing systems in a combinatorically scaling way.  If you looked at the human body as a black box machine with N systems, every single new thing/system/function that you add to the existing system will produce, at least, (N +1) new combinations.  This is an easy thought experiment to demonstrate the scaling of complexity.</p>

<p>Bad QA.  There are multiple examples of vax being adulterated with things that shouldn&#39;t even be in the vax.  Live viruses are just one thing that&#39;s been found.  So we know that the processes of vax production are susceptible to gross failure.  And we also know that these mistakes, from the known historical record,  have been discovered by outside actors.  So we know there are QA issues.</p>

<p>Additives.  Mercury/thimerosal and others.  Why?</p>

<p>Vax schedules.  We know the recommended schedules have called for a much larger number of shots than what was traditionally called for.  Why this increase when there&#39;s no evidence that it improves things, if we accept the premise that the cohorts who were taking the vax when the schedules called for less shots were still effectively immunized?  Why do it?  Why risk the side effects?</p>

<p>Herd Immunity and other fallacious arguments.  Herd immunity is a statistical derivation relating to transmissability.  It has nothing to do with vax itself but it&#39;s trotted out by &quot;hero scientists&quot; as a core reason to vaccinate.  And, in practice, the threshold for herd immunity has rarely been met.  So the arguments for it are arguments for things that have rarely ever been met in practice.  So why the argument then?  It&#39;s arguing for the benefit of something that&#39;s rarely if ever happened.</p>

<p>Selection.  If you were to not vax, the cohort would select for resistance.  By vaccinating the cohort is not selecting for resistance.  So there&#39;s a trade-off of cohort resistance for vax damaged individuals.  Is it better to select for a situation that leads to a stronger cohort and accept the &quot;natural losses&quot;, or to select for a weaker cohort and accept the &quot;damaged losses&quot;?  It&#39;s clear the former is better.</p>

<p>Authoritarianism and agendas perpetuated thru media and policy.  Speaks for itself.  Why accept the word of those whose logic and rhetoric is demonstrably wrong and who perpetuates a loss of civil liberty using this broken rhetoric?  Why accept this?   </p>

<p>I wanted to demonstrate your insanity by making an inflammatory comment and then explaining clearly I wasn&#39;t serious. That&#39;s because how you guys operate is you cherry pick information, make edits videos, and various intellectually dishonest tactics. Thanks for proving my point! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are pro vacers so concerned with anti vaxers?   What the hell do they care?   Vaccines are not ensured to be 100 percent effective.   So what harm is to them?   </p>

<p>Now if you could really irradiate a disease that would be something.</p>

<p>Anyway agree with most in the thread that they are generally effective but not as simple as what mainstream would have you believe.</p>

<p>Me personally I&#39;ll never get a flu shot.</p>

<p>Lowering infant mortality is the main cause for the rise in life expectancy. In the 1500s if you made it to 10 odds were you would make it to 60.</p>

<p>Sanitation and clean water is the best solution to a healthy population. </p>

<p>Why did Gates want to jab all of India when polio is transmitted via the oral/fecal route and not build a single well or waste facility?</p>

<p>The extra benefits of doing the later (disentry, parasites, etc) should out weigh vaccination benefits?</p>

<p>There is also a growing body of evidence leaning towards mass vaccination is weakening the human immune system.</p>

<p>But if I was heading to South American I would opt for vaccines. </p>

<p>Not many anti vaxxers deny the actual science of immunology.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too, disagree with you based on scientific data, but I see nothing at all wrong with vaccination as a concept, and even got the flu shot myself, and appreciate being noticed for imbuing a more pragmatic opinion. My issue is with the number of vaccines with toxic adjuvants, and instances such as the gardasil shot leaving girls in the UK with Guillain Barre Syndrome. It&#39;s a very small percentage of recipients who display adverse effects, but that shouldn&#39;t mean it&#39;s acceptable by any means. </p>

<p>Rather than say the vaccines are completely safe and actively campaign against those who denounce some vaccines, it would go a lot further if pharmaceutical companies admitted fault and strove to eliminate the possibility for these various adverse effects. It&#39;s still an amazing feat to accomplish all they have, but the infallibility complex makes them come across like they care about profits over human lives. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Regarding your last point, put simply, the more people who aren&#39;t vaccinated in a population means higher chance of an outbreak. Also you aren&#39;t quite safe per se if you are vaccinated, it just means your immune system is prepared for what&#39;s to come and will deal with it quickly.</p>

<p>Also, spare a thought for those who can&#39;t get vaccinated due to health conditions and disorders. They are the ones who will cop the brunt of the consequences in an outbreak whether they want to or not. They depend on those around them in the community to be vaccinated so there&#39;s less chance of themselves being put at risk.</p>
