       I’m not sure what you think impeachment will accomplish, especially if the GOP controls congress and the Supreme Court.

       Trump is purposely trying to have himself investigated and subsequently cleared so that he can destroy his opponents and win re-election like Bill Clinton did.

       Clinton was impeached during his final term and over something trivial.  Trump is more analagous to Nixon and will likely resign before Impeachment hearings begin. B

       The GOP controls all branches of power and fully supports him.

       Even if he’s a traitor the GOP is winning by forcing Dems to focus on a straw man the whole time and ignoring what the GOP is doing to advance their agenda.

       You're creating a false narrative.  Trump being connected to Russia and the DNC hack were separate but ultimately related events.  And for all the evidence of "Trump being wiretapped" how is it it that his DOJ, Congress or FBI have done nothing about it?

       Mueller already demoted Peter Strzok, the FBI, DoJ, OIG, and Congress are conducting simultaneous investigations into this while Democrats are freaking out about a reality TV star.

       Melania is not going to Davos with him. That's a pretty clear public sign that she's distancing herself and their child from him. Hillary stuck by Bill's side and used Chelsea as a pawn for public sympathy.

       I really don't care if a President is getting some strange. I care if it prevents him from being present for an official duty or if he reveals information to his sidepiece.  It's a high pressure job and just like cops and the military, people fuck to deal with stress.

       I heard it word of mouth from someone that is traveling with the President, but here is a rundown on the security threat and measures being taken:

       So an unverified, unsourced claim that you "read" somewhere which somehow counters the official narrative and protects the image of the President.

       Take it or leave it. I'm not trying to protect anyone's image in any way, only stating that I read that the First Lady canceled because of security concerns. The situation there is really dangerous.

       Somebody told you that and you choose to believe it, you didn't "read" it anywhere that can be verified or sourced.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you shared your unverifiable, unsourced claims which protect the image of the President.

      <p>
       Sorry if I'm not buying it, especially when you initially said "read somewhere" in your first post, implying that it wasn't a private message, but "somewhere".  Super shady, changing your story then conveniently not being able to share the info, pretty transparent.

       What on earth? First, how is this trying to protect anyone's image?
      </p>
      <p>
       Second, I did read it. I work closely with several people in my private life that work in higher levels of government- notably in security. Go through my history and note where I've had dinner with these people, taken our kids skiing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly, it doesn't matter if you believe me- go ahead and think she canceled because of a porn star. It makes no difference to me. I read from someone I trust that it was over security logistics.

       Even the white house stated she canceled because of scheduling and logistics. But I guess that isn't evidence as much as gossip mongering speculation that is in the MSM. Can
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       show evidence that she cancelled because of the porn star? Did she or anyone close to her say this? I would love to see your source.

       In the meantime, I'm going with my source that is actually close to the situation.

       Funny, Melania wrote me earlier in a private message that she cancelled because she didn't have the time.  So I guess I have a better source than you.

       I never said that the white house cited security, I stated that someone I am close to sent me a message citing security.

       So, since the only evidence you really have is the WH version, lets agree that it was over scheduling and logistics and that there is no evidence of it being about the gossip that the MSM is slinging. Fair?

       That's like trying to compare apples to asparagus. Clinton's impeachment was just political theater, and had absolutely shit all to do with his presidency.

       He is the guy who gave away our manufacturing to the Chinese and sold out the American middle class. NK has nuclear tech because of him. He started a military conflict to distract from his impeachment. Were you living in America when he was president?

       Clinton is murdering lying shit. Trump did more good for the us than all the presidents since Reagan combined and is undoing some of the damage Bush 1 Clinton and Bush 2 did.

       Trump hasn't accomplished anything of value to the average American. He and his cronies, well, they're going to make out like bandits as long as he can keep firing everyone that's investigating him. If Nixon were alive, he'd be having some serious deja vu.

       Bill Clinton’s entire career is more like a mob boss than a politician. Look in to CIA drug running in Mena, Arkansas during Bill Clinton’s governorship there... seriously.

       No, cuz I disagree with much of his policies. And for real, if this is the basis of your political leanings, wether or not someone passes a criminal investigation, you should read more.
