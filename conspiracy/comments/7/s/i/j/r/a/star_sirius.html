       Our sun is the junior partner to Sirius (A).  Our sun (Sol) and Sirius orbit each other.  We are currently about as far away as possible from Sirius (apogee) but basically just turned the corner to start coming closer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The star is just the star, it represents a mass of energy.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe it is important to Freemasonry as they worship/celebrate Lucifer, Lightbringer.  Sirius (A) is possibly Lightbringer, as humanity experiences many boons the closer we are to Sirius.
      </p>
      <p>
       If not, Sirius exerts a ton of influence on humans, so that may also be why they worship it.

       No, it's not true. I think he has something confused. Sirius is not actually 1 star. It's a binary system of 2 stars orbiting each other. The sun is not orbiting them in any way.

       You ever read Lost Star of Myth and Time by Walter Crutengen? Think that’s his name at least. Talks about our sun being in a binary system and Sirius is a candidate. Good book.

       The sun does not orbit Sirius in a binary system. Sirius
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a bianry system of 2 stars, Sirius A and Sirius B.

       Yea, and our sun has a Sirius B equivalent somewhere out there.  Both binary systems that... ?

       I'm not sure what the space lingo is.  Our sun and Sirius A have:
      </p>
      <p>
       an orbital relationship?
paired orbits?
random orbits that happen to transect?
a cosmic relationship independent of orbits?

       The sun and the Sirius system are not in orbit with each other at all. We are near each other and orbit the galactic center together, but we don't have very much influence on each other.

       I think it's the proximity to the galactic center that's the issue -- Sol and Sirius A orbit Sirius B as it orbits the Milky Way galaxy -- and not the proximity to Sirius (A or B), per se. (This spiral orbit takes about 26,000 years and is evidenced by the precession of the equinoxes.) Without Sirius (A and B), this spiral orbit would not exist -- nor would the Great Year.

       I think I follow.  The Golden Age of Man and all that doesn't trigger due to Sirius, per se, it triggers by being closer to the galactic core... and Sirius just happens to mirror our approach to the core.  As we get closer, Sirius gets closer, and good things happen... but Sirius is a random addition, not key component to this.  Yes?

       Maybe, maybe not.  There is Goddess worship in Masonry, and they likely want to reintroduce a matriarchy (in form more than function).
      </p>
      <p>
       Goddess worship tho is a subset of Sirius worship, or any star worship.  The Goddess worship began during the Ages of Virgo and Gemini, feminine signs. In theory, the groups that morphed into Freemasons pre-dated those eras (4-7,000 yrs ago).

       Seems like he got in trouble for shilling his own paid site and YouTube channel. He tried to post them directly and got no upvotes.

       Posting your own content is fine, posting only your own content, spamming the site with it and trying to profit off of it is I guess less fine.

       He is likely John le Bonn and he is trybig to get you the subscribe to his channel and pay him $20+/mo for his subscription only website. Arguing with him is inane because he lives goal posts, requires impossible levels of proof, ignores the other persons points and zeroes in on one tiny part of the argument. In his youthbe video comments he doesn’t argue with knowledgeable posters but feuds with those he thinks will have trouble arguing back. It’s not clear what he actually believes as his videos are opaque (although he does promise to blow your mind with the paid videos) but he has videos making fun of “conspiritards” (people on this sub) and “normies”.

       I wonder if his youtube channel got demonetized or he got delusions of grandeur, but he is relentless.
      </p>
      <p>
       He is kind of the classic stereotype:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        White dude who wears a rasta style hat
       </li>
       <li>
        Seems under-educated so attacks education
       </li>
       <li>
        Thinks he is smarter than everyone else
       </li>
       <li>
        Thinks what he does is definitive research but doesn't understand basic concepts.
       </li>
       <li>
        is a red piller likely because he can't get respect otherwise
       </li>
       <li>
        is condescending, demands impossible proof while promoting his ideas which are based on nothing
       </li>
       <li>
        thinks he should be paid for his wisdom
       </li>
       <li>
        never admits he is wrong. In one video where he argued missiles are incapable of level flight, dozens of people explained to him why he was wrong... so he made a video about how he should only post material behind a pay wall
       </li>

       Dude is a classic example of a narcissist with anti social personality disorder who is just smart enough to suspect he isn't all that smart. Add in what seems to be a rather shoddy and stunted level of education and you get and impressive asshole.  I could see him being a sovereign citizen type asshole except I think he is too big of a coward for anything like that.

       Ah, that does make some things fit into place. I often get the impression that, in some level, he doesn't really think a lot of the stuff that he spouts it true, and yet he is fully incapable of ever conceding a point, not matter how robustly it is demonstrated that he is wrong. Narcissism puts that into perfect context; a narcissist will go to any lengths in order to preserve their false front. His is entirely based upon being the smartest, best informed, most right skeptic/truth seeker.

       But the antisocial personality disorder comes into play as well... he cannot even pretend to be nice to make his point. He just cannot help but be condescending and confrontational.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best thing is, he is so narcissistic that he cannot bring himself to post other peoples content. Like say you wanted to promote something and wanted to be inconspicuous? Say you were flagged for such behavior... well you could engage in the forum and post other peoples links and work the stuff you were shilling into those posts... but he can't even bring himself to do that, he can only post his own stuff because he things his stuff is the only stuff worth anything.

       tl;dw: Sirius** is our Sun's binary star, responsible for our 26,000 year spiral orbit which drags us closer and farther from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Proximity to the galactic core controls not only our rate of physical growth (Earth, Sun, planets, moons, stars are growing) but also our spiritual growth.
      </p>
      <p>
       ** Best I can tell, it's actually a quaternary system: Sol (our Sun), Sirius A (the bright one), Sirius B (invisible, extremely massive brown dwarf that the others orbit), and Sirius C (small star with 49.9 year cycle).

       Hopi legend claims the appearance of the blue star 'Kachina' (Sirius) marks the coming of the fifth world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The epic of Gilgamesh describes Sirius descending to Gilgamesh with 'a potent essence as the Lord of Heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some theosophists believe the stars of the pleiades transmit the light of universal Logos to ursa major thence to Sirius and our Sun whence it finally reaches earth.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's also a belief that the inhabitants of Sirius were blue in color perhaps explaining the blue color of depictions of Hindu avatars. There's also a possible correlation with the term blue blood.

       No, it's not true. I think he has something confused. Sirius is not actually 1 star. It's a binary system of 2 stars orbiting each other. The sun is not orbiting them in any way.
