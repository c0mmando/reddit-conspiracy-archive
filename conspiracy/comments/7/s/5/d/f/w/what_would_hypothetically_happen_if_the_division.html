       I’m not sure it will be very hard to get people to look past the hot buttons they use to evoke emotion and keep the division. I’d hope no one would ever have to stave to death again as I think that has to be the most brutal way to go. Here’s to hope that it’s possible to get people to realize they ha e been played all along by everyone.

       People are led by example and very impressionable, if charity, empathy and caring actions were modeled by every government in the world most would follow the example. Instead the net is rife with articles about implements of war and speculation on whose can kill the most and win in war.

       Not much, people are still selfish and entitled, and we would still have religious clashes because certain groups believe they're the chosen people and they will use that as an excuse to do harm to others. TPTB are definitely not innocent, but society still needs to take responsibility for it's own actions.

       Under a homogeneous society maybe. If society is too diverse then it will never agree on anything, surely? I hope I'm wrong, but too many people hold on to ancient grudges. How would we get everybody to agree on what is the right way for us to progress as a species? Do we even need to progress? Who decides what's right and wrong when everybody unites? A united population sounds great on paper, but it would probably be chaos in theory. I guess it depends who keeps the order.

       No I am saying if we were unified then we would struggle to agree on stuff, especially abrahamic religions. Democracy generally works best with a homogeneous society.

       If you look at all the problems in the world, they mainly stem from the issue of perceived scarcity.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is seemingly not enough to go around, and people get desperate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course I'm not discounting the fact that there are those who take and take. But in a world where everything is provided for, why would there be quarrels?

        Allah has ordered us to unite.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Allah said: "Hold fast to God’s rope all together; do not split into factions."
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Allah would not order us to do something impossible.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Allah said "We do not burden any human being with more than he is well able to bear".
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Allah is Just and he does not order a person to do something impossible. If a tyrant orders a 5 year old to life a 1000 kg rock, that would be both cruel and absurd. Allah is Just and Merciful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therefore, unity is possible and achievable and it is obligatory on every Muslim to pursue it. Those who do not try to achieve unity are disobeying Allah.

       The current replies in this post are lacking in imagination, and is also grounded in negativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Much like the current state of this sub.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I'll bite briefly anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps if we could somehow end our division and unite humanity, progress in technology and spiritual advancement (some will cry that this is woo woo) will increase at an incredible rate.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the negativity left over from this division, stemming from scarcity and overall bad role models, decreases, we might see a general decrease in crime across the board. Why would people want to commit crimes if their basic needs are met? Perhaps one can argue that the nature of humanity will always cause harm to itself, but I am hopeful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spiritual advancement and a general increase in consciousness will increase as humanity will have time to take a breather from the destructive disunity that we are currently seeing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then come the aliens. Hopefully the lizard people will also show themselves.

       We would actually get to work fixing real problems and we would fix them rapidly. Like instead of one kid trying to clean up the oceans we'd have huge teams of people and we'd get that shit done within a few years.

       There would be a mysterious flu or plague wiping out most people and dividing us again. "Epidemiologists" have been psychologically preparing us for this for a while. The CDC is completely ready to start quarantining us at any moment on behalf of the rich.

       not everyone will agree on things because not everyone is the same.  it's silly to try to force agreement in these circumstances - it's a solution that doesn't fit the problem.  the solution, rather, is to allow people to select the rules they want to live under, and have people who don't have consensus on this be physically separated.  in other words, to spectrum out consensus.

       Lol I don't know why everyone is tripping and acting like we are so divided. We are so NOT divided!!! Look at all of us going to groceries stores, driving, going to parks, schools, work, etc. Just because we all don't have the same politics does not mean we are divided!! don't let them think we are divided. We are not.

       We would enter a state of utopia where we all worked forward to a brighter future. However, we might stagnate as competition decreases. Our scientific, medical, &amp; technological breakthroughs might slow do to less Competition. Steel sharpens steel, strife forces people to adapt.
