       SS: People always bring up the question of how good Germans could let the holocaust happen and actually help. They also ask the same question about how Americans sat idly by while the government killed for land and good americans actually helped. How coukd people do that? Well we are a part of that today in aiding Israel. We just sit back and watch the execution of people defending their land and the land to be strait up taken. We do nothing and actually help by electing pro Israeli presidents and congress members. This is a huge conspiracy of how a small group gwts a larger group to do evil for their benefit. We are the germans who stayed sikent and gelped. We are the Americans who gladly took the natives land and killed any that fought back. Look in the mirror, we are the same.

       I'm not complacent. I pay taxes because I don't want to be imprisoned. Do you know the definition of the word complacent? Complacent - showing smug or uncritical satisfaction with oneself or one's achievements.
Ex:"you can't afford to be complacent about security"
synonyms:   smug, self-satisfied, self-congratulatory, self-regarding, conceited;

       Sorry, you're right - I meant complicit. Thanks for pointing out my error. Otherwise, I stand behind my comment. Paying taxes is something everyone does because they don't want to be arrested - but in doing so, we're all complicient in the crimes committed in our name with that money, like it or not. And taxes for sure go to Israel.

       If you pay taxes and don't do anything to mitigate this, you're complicite. If you pay taxes and vote for pro-Israeli politicians, if you pay taxes and don't tell your elected representatives how important the Israel/Palestine issue is, if you don't join the BDS movement - then you're almost directly putting money into the Israeli's pockets, money used to buy the bombs and gasse they use to kill Palestinians. That's complicity.

       Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin: "after this, therefore because of this") is a logical fallacy that states "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X." It is often shortened simply to post hoc fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post hoc is a particularly tempting error because temporal sequence appears to suggest causality. The fallacy lies in a conclusion based solely on the order of events, rather than taking into account other factors potentially responsible for the result that might rule out the connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple example is "the rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise."

       No.  That's not the way it works.

       If one individual takes action, then that person's efforts will fail against the powers-that-be.  They get slandered in the media and as far as anyone knows, they were a crazy lone wolf type who was justifiably put down.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, if you can educate the masses and "the mob" so-to-speak, takes action against the-powers-that-be, then the action can very well succeed in changing things for the better.

       I'm a huge supporter of the Palestinians, and I agree with you. As horrific as the situation in Palestine is, it's not the same global genocide that went on against native people.

       Um, okay. I'm not arguing that a genocide is not being committed against the Palestinians (in fact, that is something I have argued several times in this sub), just that - purely by the numbers and countries involved - the genocide of native people all around the world is a larger genocide then what's happening now. Although I'd actually argue that the genocide against Palestine is
       <em>
        part of
       </em>
       this larger genocide of native people, just a few hundreds years after most Americans think these things ended.

      <p>
       The U.S total contribution in aid (allocated for defense) is $3.1 billion. Though this was recently raised to $3.8.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of that aid is spent acquiring munitions from the U.S defense industry btw.

       "The Native American population in North America in 1500 was about 2 million, and the decline to 400,000 in 1860 represents a 0.22% decline per year. I’m not saying massacres didn’t happen; but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t look like a genocide, or if it was, it would be the slowest genocide ever. In addition, we don’t know how many Native Americans managed to intermarry with Europeans. If so few as 0.22% married a European, which would be 1 in 454, that would in theory account for the entire Native American decline assuming the Native Americans were at replacement otherwise."

       Through the 18th and 19th century the distribution of world news was barely crawling let alone existing. The atrocities and the genocide committed upon the Native American largely went under the proverbial radar...There is however, NO EXCUSE for what is being allowed to happen to the Palestinians. Gaza has essentially become a Warsaw Ghetto. The Israelis have made living conditions there unbearable. There have been so many documented disgusting behaviors and random killings of children perpetrated upon the Palestinians by Israelis...the list is huge.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the Mass Media in place, the world is quite aware of what is going on in the land of Palestine. Our media is a zionist puppet. They always tell the narrative from the perspective of the poor, poor Israelis (enter crocodile tears and violin music) and the sorrows they must face living next to the "terrorist" threat.

       Exactly what I was gonna say.... the jewish state are basically being hypocrits here and repeating the same actions as the Nazi's did when they said they were gonna forcibly remove all jews from Germany and then forced them to live in ghettos before eventually taking them to the camps. Now Israel doesn't want Palestinians living on their land, pushes em out of their homes (prob breaking or stealing many of their possessions), and forcing them to live in ghetto housing or worse prison camps.
      </p>

       It is the same play... but yea, no one seems to be making a big deal about it, tho that is obviously due to MSM propaganda.

       This isn't a one-sided issue.  Palestine has hardly been passive throughout all this and, as far as I'm aware, all of Israel's actions against Palestine have been retaliatory and never preemptive without precedent.  Does Israel launch missiles from it's schoolyards or mortars from it's hospitals?  Do Israel's citizens wander over into Palestinian populations and stab random civilians?
      </p>
      <p>
       While I would agree that we should have members of our elect who possess primarily American interests, I do believe we should be inasmuch to at least help mediate a solution.  There are significant population groups of our country who have vested interests in Israel as well, and our leadership should reflect that.

        . Don’t fall for the deception. Israel is sovereign from the river to the sea, and has been for a long time. Eretz Israel! What simply needs to be done is simply grant civil/voting rights to the indigenous population, as white South Africans were persuaded to do through sanctions and divestment.
       </p>

        The two-State solution is a sham. It will never happen in any meaningful way.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-state_solution">
         The only solution is one-State.
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it is extremely antisemitic to suggest Jews would be unwilling to live in peaceful coexistence with the indigenous population of their country. Except for a very small vocal minority, most do not hold supremacist/bigotted views. I suggest you travel to Israel and realize a
        <em>
         huge
        </em>
        majority of people there are reasonable and tolerant.
       </p>
       <p>
        South African whites majoritarily said the exact same thing. Fortunately they were persuaded otherwise, through boycott, sanctions and divestment, and had to renounce their dystopia of a supremacist ethno-State. This is not a territorial issue, it is merely one of civil rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        The height of antisemitism is to conflate Judaism with the supremacist ideology of Zionism.

       Let's start right there in The Middle East where we have what the United Nations describes as the world's only Apartheid State and many millions of indigenous but stateless people living in areas embargoed and/or occupied by the Zionist Jews who run Israel.  All of these people, Jewish and non Jewish, should all have equal rights, equal protection and equal representation under the law, without exception, without qualification.  That would be a VERY good first step toward world peace.

       Oh please, the United Nations is the Mos Eisley of international politics --its a straight up hive of scum and villainy.  The U.N. passes resolutions primarily against Israel, and not at all for the reasons you're thinking.  Between 2012 and 2015, 83 out the 97 resolutions targeted Israel, specifically.  Who were making these condemnations?  Countries such as North Korea, Iran, Yemen, Venezuela...  you know, countries that are just pillars of virtue...
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully, you're starting to see the picture...
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile, the United Nations has done practically nothing about Syria and the clear human rights abuses there, but it has no problem condemning the U.S. for recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital.  So I don't think the complaints of the U.N. are at all significant.

       uses a role switch to see a different side to it.  I think most people aren't able to put themselves in the position of the Palestinians, it's something distant and not thought about, when there's people being unjustly oppressed for no other reason than trying to live in their own country.
What if Canada started to take over Michigan with financial support from the French government, how would that go down?

       Sorry to burst your bubble there guy, but most natives were killed by diseases brought over by Europeans. And who did the "native Americans" genocide to populate America? Native Americans were not some large peace loving one with nature group. They were small warlike tribes constantly at war with one another. They did horrible things to both each other and the Europeans, so you can stop pretending like they are innocent. They fought Europeans just like they fought each other, and because of their plague-reduced numbers they lost. It's a simple fact. Deal with it.

       Hamas and Hezbollah are just rich Arabs whobuse force to keep power while receiving aid from Israel to be rich so Israel has a reason to expand and attack people. In 2003 2008 2013 there were Democratic peace movements in Lebanon and Palestine, but Israel increaswd bombings and the hamas Hezbollah leaders murdered the peace leaders. You would think america and Israel would support democratic peace mocements but nope. They want that so they can poland Palestine.

       Who knows now days... But I wouldn't say that Jews ruin countries. Shitty men who use religion for gain ruin countries. People who take peace and love from religion make places nicer. The Christians Jews and Muslims in DC fuck shit up globally while the 99.99% of people else where just want peace a place to raise kids and a house and land. Its bad men.

       Same anwser I give when people use the native American rhetoric: they lost. Get over it.  Reality isn't some balanced experience where fairness rules and we all hold hands.  If you are incapable of holding onto what's yours, then you don't deserve it and eventually you will lose it. That's just how the world works, I'm sorry it's cold but if you artificially protect the weak you leave no room for the strong to grow and better the species

       Post hoc ergo propter hoc (Latin: "after this, therefore because of this") is a logical fallacy that states "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X." It is often shortened simply to post hoc fallacy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Post hoc is a particularly tempting error because temporal sequence appears to suggest causality. The fallacy lies in a conclusion based solely on the order of events, rather than taking into account other factors potentially responsible for the result that might rule out the connection.
      </p>
      <p>
       A simple example is "the rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise."
