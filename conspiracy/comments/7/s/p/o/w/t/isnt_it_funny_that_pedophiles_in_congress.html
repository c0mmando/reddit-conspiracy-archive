       SS there are 2 different justice systems in America, 1 for the peasants and 1 for the echelon. Why is sexual abuse so permanent in DC and Hollywood? Because the punishment is a joke.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: to everyone saying Weinstein epstein and government officials weren't charged with anything, you have to know that they would settle out of court and have NDA and gag orders so you would never ever ever know the magnitude of their actions. Nassar can't afford this so you see. He had a baby amount of power conoared to those yall keep defending and saying they get less time bc they only raped a few people..  Ffs your buddy would let you off easier too... I'm sure epstein and weinstein bought silence and settlement to a level nassar couldn't but I wouldnt doubt they commited just as much damage. Everyone defending people who were convicted of raping 1 child for a 5 year sentence are sick and psychos.

       Weinstein has not been convicted yet, also the women are not minors. Jeff epstien has only been convicted of soliciting sex from 1 minor. Mark Foley charged of having laised with 2 underaged boys, was not convicted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Im not defending anyone, all of these men should be in jail. My point was that the sheer volume of victims in the Olymics coachs case is why he will get such a long sentence. More than 160 girls have accused him of assaulting them, thats the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes of course theres always been two judicial systems, one for the rich and one for the poor but you’re not arguing with facts, and the elites you referenced have not been accused of anywhere near a similar amount of crimes.

       Epstein was accused of having hundreds of girls at his island, on his plane, and at his many properties around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Weinstein is accused of having minors to solicit at film festivals and elite political parties. The cannes film festival caused him of having over a 100 girls over a 12 year period. And the congressional page scandal saw some 80 boys say they were abused. Jimmy savile is accused of abusing people in the 100s. They git away with it appearing to be minor bc the system is rigged for them...

       Where are you getting your info on the Congressional page scandal? I cant find a source that cites there were that many victims.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other two people you mention, i will say again did not have 150+ women testify in court against them. That is the difference.
Im not defending them, stop accusing me of it, im just basing my argument on avaliable facts and not my emotions and word of mouth without proof.

       You keep talking about "hundreds of girls" but where are they? There aren't hundreds of victims coming forward in those situations but in the case of Larry Nassar there are literally hundreds of girls that have accused him. How do you not understand the difference?
      </p>
      <p>
       And you don't seem to get that nobody is defending them, or even really disagreeing with your premise. They're just pointing out that your example was terrible because in this case there is a clear reason why Nassar got such a harsh sentence.

       Actually Jimmy saville got away with it in the end cos he died. Sad thing is everyone was ignored until he died. Unfortunately, having worked in child protection, I know this isn’t just famous people anyway. Sexual exploitation and abuse is common amongst all classes and all walks of life...not nice I know

       The word you're missing is

        convicted

       . He's probably raped a lot of people and deserves a lot of time (life + decades) but he hasn't been convicted yet. It's not a fair comparison.

       Actually your wrong.  Nasser was convicted of molesting only a handful of girls. The rest testified only in connection with sentencing.  They could say whatever they wanted. Nothing had to be proved.  Epstein was far worse.   You miss the point that people like Epstein are not seriously prosecuted notwithstanding the extraordinary amount of victims and evidence.  To say he was never convicted is nonsensical.  He wasn’t convicted because he wasn’t prosecuted for virtually all of the allegations against him.

       Where are these hundreds of girls? Do you not see the difference between to two situations? One has 160 victims testifying. One has how many? Do you not understand how that changes things? Do you not realize that Weinstein hadn't even been convicted of anything but one count?

       Dennis Hastert was charged with a financial crime. The statute of limitations on his molestation had expired, but he received the maximum sentence based on his misconduct coming to light. So not necessarily the best example.

       Weinstein and epstein were both accused of soliciting minors in the 100s. They were trafficking minirs to other elites. Nassar was in a position of power over girls and abused the same number but never bought or sold them. Is say the severity is equal and they all deserve twice what nassar got.

       Y'all idiots really need to spend the money for a decent web admin if you're serious about tricking the kids into joining your nonsense. I could do better than that in 45 minutes and a six pack.

       Well yeah, those guys have tons of money and probably good connections. At the end of today's hearing Nassar's lawyers said "He has no money your honor.." and that changes everything in our judicial system. The difference between a life sentence and 2 years suspended for the same crime has 100% everything to do with money. Also see: OJ Simpson.

       Holy shit, dude. In no way am I "protecting" him. You made a false claim, and I refuted it. Weinstein is a piece of human garbage and I hope he's murdered in prison. But you are spreading false information and I hate when people do that so I called you out on it.

       When it's their political opponents accusations, codewords, and 4d chess moves is perfectly suitable for accusing and attaining guilt. When it's their guy in the white house who runs in the same circles they need air tight proof and sources.  Theit bias to their political team is pathetic.  They don't belong here.

       I didn't write the law.  And yes your position does matter.  The fact that it was a doctor makes the crime particularly heinous.  If a doctor says :  hey I'm going to need to stick my finger in your ass you are a lot more likely to allow them to do it than if your senator says the same.   A doctor id's a positron that requires the most trust because almost every action a doctor takes constitutes assault of not fire your consent.

       As an MSU alum, we get to pay for his damages with our basketball-only usage won't be paying for it, none of the people that received reports of his abuse and helped cover it up will be donations for "academics" more than likely going into the $10m victims fund that the school created. Not to say the victims don't deserve compensation, because these are very traumatic events, but he won't be paying for it, the well-compensated board of directors and President won't be paying for it, the athletics department that gobbles up millions of dollars for football and paying for it. We will be.

       Well considering he molested over 100 girls for
       <em>
        years
       </em>
       , I would say that someone needs to put some checks and balance into place to stop it from happening again. And let's be honest, the only way people will affect change is if you hit them where it hurts... $$$.

       I agree, the entire system failed these girls and it propagated into an exponential cycle of abuse. But it's the executives at the top and him that need to be paying for this, not the students and alumni. We played no role in this. It's like when a cop murders a citizen, and the city settles the lawsuit with the victim's family with taxpayer money.

       Yeah, we're definitely on the same page, but I don't have a good answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like when a cop gets sued and the city has to pay out the lawsuit.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the one hand my tax money shouldn't subsidize the behavior of bad cops. On the other hand, the street cop who kills an unarmed man probably won't ever be able to pay the (let's say $3 million) in restitution the victim's family is entitled to.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what now? If you force the former cop to pay, the family never sees a dime, and the city and police force don't have much of an incentive to change.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you fine the department, now the city is stuck with the bill, but given that the local government is comprised of elected officials, there's the potential for accountability, despite the fact that that doesn't seem to happen very much in practice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, there needs to be enough of a financial incentive to affect change, and in today's world that penalty needs to be quite high, otherwise some corporation will just let things happen once they realize the cost to settle a lawsuit is less than the cost to retrain their staff and change their corporate culture.

       They don't want to die. Hell, even Epstien's judge probably received a death treat, but I fear he was just another cog. Even if some only want to focus on Hollywood, or a couple of politicians, the victims are EVERYWHERE, so the fight is too.

       You may be right. I should dial that back. But “proof” is still a sketchy issue in here and pizzagate in particular, if we are talking about unproven child rape theories, is extremely popular. It’s interesting that with one public figure, it’s accepted so readily and with another, hard proof is demanded.

       Here's the thing. People have preconceived boas for or against someone. It makes them.more likely to believe something with less evidence. It's basic human nature. I'm sure there's something you believe that is a little shy on evidence most people have something like that. Cheese pizza really is a code used by pedos all over the country if not the world.  There's been court documents filed. It's literally appeared on this sub a few times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think there's a pedo ring run out of a pizza basement id think that would be in a more controlled area like podesta's weird screening room.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't really buy into it that much because to me there's not really anything more than circumstantial and it's weak. But I at least understand it.

       Yeah with other cases pedos get more years even if they are elite. Weiner had like one or 2 counts (not rape) and Hasterts rapes we're barred due to statute of limitations...

       We don't have a justice system...we have a legal system. The legal system cares not about justice, only about abiding by the laws, which may or not be just (and in most cases are not).

       The justice system protects the others and hides evidence while using nassar as a way to act like they are doing justice. Hastert was convicted on one charge while having many many more against him but were omitted for him pleading guilty to you. Fallacies

       im not disputing that others might be getting away with shit, nobody here is. What the issue is in what you put forward is that 1 was a doctor in a special position of trust (well above Weinstein in standing) abused it some 150 times, had people testify and pleaded guilty. On the other hand you have weinstein with a handful of people coming forward and him not pleading guilty as he intends to fight it in court. He'll get his time but there is a profound difference between the two as far as legal grounds are concerned. Obviously you are not in any way affiliated with the legal profession or even a very good understanding of how courts work otherwise you wouldn't be doubling down on stupid.

       only if he gets charged and convicted of enough offences. Killing 2 people might net you 1 life sentence, killing 20 people will get you 1000 years in prison. If 150 people come forward and weinstein admits guilt and doesnt get 100 years, then i'll agree. Thats how sentencing goes.

       what the fuck are you talking about, sentencing is based on circumstances, there is no black and white which is why judges have flexibility. You also need to take into account quality of evidence, cooperative defendents etc. You are implying I think a certain way because i disagree with you by posing this question rather than that I think you dont understand the legal system very well, and would like everything to be cut and dry, which it isnt.

       <em>

       in Michigan needs to go to jail for knowing about this. The president is now being asked to step down, but that's really not enough if she knew this guy was molesting girls and let it go one for years.

       Epstein trafficked minors and had sex with them. 5 years. Nassar used his position of power to prey on minors and got 175 years... Id say it's pretty equal... Now Weinstein is accused of both, using his power to prey on forks as young as 16 while also trafficking women of that age and people in this thread are defending him. Hmm...

       He cannot distinguish between the logical and his theory/bad examples. Sure rich pedos get better treatment but an open and shut case like Nassar with provable crimes and an admission suggest the OP  lacks critical thinking.

       Yup and one of the key differences is nassar had a load of cp as well that helped give the victims statements credibility and the entire prosecution, lead investigator and judge were all women. I bed the judge felt good last night when she went to sleep. She probably cried a few times for those victims but she at least knows she's served a healthy serving of justice

       It's absurd for him to have gotten the sentence he did; those 100 victims were NOT cross-examined to my knowledge, therefore to have used their mass testimonies as factors in sentencing strikes me as extremely injudicious, if not outright illegal. In Western Europe an individual of his level of bold (but not lethal) perversity would have garnered a sentence of 20 years, more than enough in my opinion, considering his present age and clearly restricted post-punishment social and professional prospects.

       I don't know if it's the same in Western Europe, but I believe judges in the US over-sentence because of parole and whatnot. Someone who gets 20 years might theoretically be out in a fraction of that time, say if it's 50%, that would be 10 years. 50% of 175 years is still longer than a lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
       I readily admit I may be completely wrong and only under this impression due to TV and movies.

       Isnt it funny how the media/elite flip flop between russia, some laws that take away citizens rights (Net nuetrality was recent, and weed), back to pedophiles and sexual harrasment, and back tonsome sensationalism. All inorder to keep the public not talking about corruption within the gov, systematic loss of freedoms and rights, how agencies and military industrial complex uses the tax dollar for perpoaes other than domestic improvement like medicare, education, infrastructure? Yeah, the real question is why so much of media is used to distract the viewer rather than inform them.

       If Nassar was rich enough, he could of paid every victim off and had them sign a NDA or have them gagged and never had to face justice. Weinstein epstein and the elite class get this privilege and never face justice so all the shills come in and point out that no legal cases are brought. Hook line and sinker of how things work.

       I was just having a similar conversation with someone about this yesterday.  It's almost like this guy is getting the hammer as some sort of absolution for the Justice system that has gone easy in those before Nassar.

       I think of the rich kid suffering from "Affluenza" who killed 5 while drunk driving.  Didn't get any jail time for KILLING 5 PEOPLE!!!

       Yeah, I don't think it's fair. Also interesting to note the difference is not just in the media, but also in sentences handed down. Women just seem to get off easier (no pun intended).

       He was most likely going to die in jail on the child porn charges 60 years or whatever is what he was serving. The rest of it seemed like he was being made an example out of. Maybe this will give victims more encouraging to speak out against even more horrible crimes, we can only hope.

       This particular statement by the Judge seems all well in good to most people, given the context of this particular case, but it seems to undermine the way our current system is working, with so many people serving jail time, doing so for victim-less crimes or one sort or another:
      </p>
      <p>
       "That’s what’s going to happen to him, because as you get stronger, as you overcome —because you will  — he gets weaker and he will wither away. Prison is no place for a human being to live.”
      </p>
      <p>
       If she does feel that way about prison, why do we allow people that are not violent, not stealing, or abusing people, placed into jail terms (sometime with ridiculously long mandatory minimum jail terms) into prison?
