    <div class="md"><p>Only in the last few weeks have eating/poisoning by laundry pods become an MSM issue. I remember the first time I heard about pod poisoning was in reference to the September 2016 DEA push to emergency schedule Kratom as a schedule 1 drug. DEA claimed a huge increase in poison-control-center calls regarding Kratom, the kratom community responded by pointing out the VASTLY larger number of poison-control-center calls for ingested laundry pods.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You may be on to something. What the hell did we call those things before? There are many other brands of these detergent pods. Now it&#39;s all Tide pod. What a clever way to associate the product with the brand name. Like Velcro, Kleenex, or Band-Aids. Welcome to the new wave of advertisements to a mentally challenged American population.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But companies donâ€™t want their brand name to become associated with a product if there are competitors in the field. There is a legal process where your competition can act to have your trademark revoked through some kind of class suit by having a judge declare it a â€˜genericised trademarkâ€™. This means that the judge decided that the product being offered is now almost always referred to by the trademark rather than the proper name for it, even if it comes from a manufacturer who does not hold the trademark.</p>

<p>Nintendo fought hard in the 90â€™s to normalise the term â€˜consoleâ€™ to describe a device that plays video game cartridges/discs on your TV screen, because everyone and their mother was calling Sega and Sonyâ€™s consoles â€˜nintendosâ€™. They were afraid of losing their trademarked company name. This is why Kleenex commercials will always be sure to refer to the product being marketed to you as â€˜Kleenex tissuesâ€™ or â€˜Kleenex brand tissuesâ€™. Same with â€˜Band-Aid brand bandagesâ€™. Itâ€™s about protecting your copyrites, your intellectual property that the whole company is based on.</p>

<p>In fact aside from the issue of trademark genericisation, the Tide Pod meme is causing problems for Tide due to rampant Pod Theft, department stores locking the pods up to avoid theft, and the health concerns about eating the pods (look how frantically Tide customer support  on Twitter is responding to any little joke about eating detergent.) I think this is basically Jenkem 2.0, but this time it spread because of the internet instead of the morning news. Itâ€™s adults not understanding young peopleâ€™s humor and young people ramping up the joke just to piss their folks off. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And yet for all the stupidity around them, they seem to be one of the better laundry cleaning products. Just toss in one or two and it seems to work better than the usual liquid or powdered stuff. (I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s more concentrated, with the self-contained aspect not allowing fumes or evaporation to happen.)</p>

<p>So it&#39;ll be quite annoying if the formula gets made weaker due to all these idiots out there.</p>
