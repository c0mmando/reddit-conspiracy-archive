    <div class="md"><p>Shit, I thought it was a documentary. /s, with a wtf added for good measure. Why cant you be happy they dropped a great episode? Unless of course you didnt see the episode, or the other episodes. If your theory is correct there wasnt an incident in the deep forest where green plasma was released from ancient trees too. Say it aint so. </p>

<p>This was a well written well thought out television show, we need more of these, not less.  If your opinion of the people in this  sub is that they are mentally bereft it is possible you were supposed to post this in a different sub, mention this to your supervisor. For the most part the users in this sub are of above average intelligence and have a bullshit meter that gets set off by far more complicated shit. </p>

<p>If you will excuse me now I will hop on the r/Lost sub to make sure the island really moved. Now Im worried</p>

    <div class="md"><p>good on you! </p>

<p>I did it more like 15 years ago. </p>

<p>people dont realize the effect of cord cutting is two fold. </p>

<p>one, TV is junk for you. people understand that. </p>

<p>what they dont realize is the second part. if you cut out TV, you are no longer just a reactive brain, focusing on whatever is in front of you. instead, you become a pro-active brain. creating your own thoughts and exploring topics that you choose, rather than ones chosen for you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I just resented paying so much money for so few channels that I actively watched. But now I&#39;ve also reaped the benefit of a lot less propaganda and hypnotism. </p>

<p>I did watch the NFL today, just for kicks, since I think the NFL is fixed. First games I watched all year. I was amazed by the number of commercials, how shitty they were, and the ads for other TV programs I never heard of, would never watch, and seemed aimed at retarded people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>last time I had TV, it was because my mom stayed with me for a few months. i got it for her, so she wouldnt be bored all day. after her visit was over, I kept it for a while just for NFL Network and watching games. yea, even that was literally retarded. </p>

<p>NFL network was only actually good for the daily NFL news show, i forget what it was called, but Rich Eisen was the host. the rest of the time it was the stupid &quot;top 10 best kicker/punter duos of ALL TIME&quot;. </p>

<p>it definitely wasnt worth it. then the cable company kept calling trying to get me to pay more for movie channels, and i had to keep explaining to them i didnt even need a remote for my tv, because it was either &quot;on&quot; NFLN or it was &quot;off&quot;. </p>

<p>for a while I looked into the digital/online options. NFL could never seem to come up with options for that which made sense. i think thats a conspiracy too. they really dont want people to just tune in online to watch the 250 pound men plow through each other like freight trains...they really want you to see the bullshit ads for &quot;american dance star&quot; or whatever where some paraplegic break dance squad does a routine that makes the audience get super emotional and cry because of their &quot;bravery&quot;, then the judges hit a button and confetti flies. </p>

<p>like seriously? i mean, no offense to paraplegic break dancers or whatever. I actually think that could be pretty cool, but if anything, i think they are exploiting their disability for clicks/views. im sure at the end of the day those disabled people would just want to be judged like anyone else. </p>

<p>fuck it all, im done with it. </p>

<p>sadly, youtube is getting to be the same way. they want to discourage actual learning from channels like codys lab and numberphile and instead create drama over logan paul and (i believe fake) dead bodies in a forest. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. But humanity is resilient. As TV was dying, YouTube and other video platforms popped up. As YouTube gets cancer, something else will appear. </p>

<p>I&#39;m less stressed out by all this than I used to be. Things are changing fast and faster all the time. Not always for the better, but the people allegedly running things don&#39;t seem to have any better handle than I do. They&#39;ve just got more money, but that might change soon too. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>you are right. if we think it about, its always been this way. </p>

<p>the original version of Christianity was probably a lot more awesome than what its become today. the &quot;church&quot; made it cancer. </p>

<p>the printing press was like the youtube of its time. anyone could print and share media. then they made that into #fakenews cancer. </p>

<p>TV used to teach moral values on family friendly sitcoms and educate as well. now its cancer. </p>

<p>youtube was awesome, as a way to share information, and people to get rewarded for doing it. now its cancer. </p>

<p>not sure what the next thing will be, but yea...whatever they turn into cancer becomes unpopular eventually. people will migrate to whatever has real news, real information, and real entertainment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. TPTB are constantly playing whack-a-mole, and there are more and more moles popping up all the time nowadays. </p>

<p>2018 is just getting started and we&#39;re seeing some of the biggest stars in Hollywood getting taken out...James Franco, for instance, couldn&#39;t even show his face at the Screen Actors Guild tonight. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the people in Chile and South America are giving the Pope a big &quot;Fuck You&quot; for all his coverups of the pedophiles down there. </p>

<p>Half the posts I saw on my Facebook feed today about the NFL games were concerns that the games were fixed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But do you really know what that reason is? </p>

<p>Deregulation.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right, I know Conspiracy Theorists think big government is bad, but guess who&#39;s worse? Business. Unregulated business will do everything for profit.</p>

<p>Own a History channel, that starts off by selling (reputation)  documentaries but discover that shows like Ancient Aliens get greater audience share...sell out and make factually inaccurate and pseudo scientific documentaries (mockumentries). Increase revenue...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Correct...up to a point. The miniseries &quot;Pride &amp; Prejudice,&quot; for example, was a blockbuster hit on A&amp;E. It&#39;s not <em>all</em> about money. Some of it is about brainwashing. </p>

<p>If History Channel created a <em>really</em> daring alternative history show, exploring facts no one else will, I bet it would do well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one thinks the X-Files is a documentary, dude. However, some of the info in the show is related to real government secrets involving UFOs. Most of the stories are totally made-up and entertaining and deal with stories from cryptozoology to cybernetics. It&#39;s a great, entertaining show that makes you think. </p>

If you condition the masses enough to certain ideas once you want to put those things into action they will be a much easier pill to swallow. It&#39;s all done to mislead.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, please...</p>

<p>please, post quality.</p>

<p>Do you have references and examples?</p>

<p>I mean, we all know this, so just making a proposition without any weight or conclusions based on them is rather lame. </p>

<p>As for weight in X-files content:</p>

<p>The spin-off predicted the 9-11 attacks.</p>

<p>The main-story is based on reality [US shadow-gov working with ET]</p>

<p>The monsters-of-the-week episodes serve as social analogy, they way all &#39;series&#39; based &#39;new-stories&#39; show every-week. Star-trek, GI Joe, Transformers, Twilight Zones, outter limits, ect.</p>

<p>These analogies act as metaphors with potential/pragmatic strategies to &#39;future&#39; problems; this is a description of knowledge, whose weight is only known and used when it must be employed. </p>

<p>There is the &#39;implants&#39;, which have the rare metal relationship, the dimensional relationship, and the surgical nature of their origins, match that of real and removed implants.</p>

<p>Is this a matter of matching fiction with reality, or is it a matter of acknowledgement of history as a history of facts?</p>

<p>If governments dont allow disclosure, do the shadow-aspects of their functioning promote such through analogy. I think that is the great conclusion. </p>
