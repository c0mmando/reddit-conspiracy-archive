<p>These are the dreams I&#39;ve had the past two nights...</p>

<p>Murderous amusement park escape, the wizard escaped??. Escaping from an island, which led to.. </p>

<p>Demon aliens taking over my family in old settings, and something about sleeping pills not helping them. </p>

<p>Then,..</p>

<p>Friendly creatures of another kind living along with people in harmony that were all turned into one kind against their will. Distinctly remember a gaggle of ducklings and it&#39;s mother and having to jump to avoid stepping on any,  running to get back to somewhere i had to go...,</p>

<p>Then i was an advisor to a king or ruler of some kind,  gave him bad news,  and he ordered me executed by the guard, i disarmed one, and fought but the sword broke( distinctly remember this and the next part), and some how got another sword that was 4 pointed in the way of a star almost, in a vertical x like, and i ran it through the king that ordered me executed,  and in that moment i felt great remorse as he died.</p>

<p>Then woke up going wtf was that about?</p>

<p>Now i don&#39;t normally dream let alone remember them. No drugs,  no drink,  no pills. No strange shows before bed. </p>

<p>Anyone else having bizarre dreams? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Keep a notepad by your bed stand and write down your dreams as soon as you wake up. This is the old school 18th/19th century method used to retain memories fresh in your mind. </p>

<p>Make it a part of your morning routine. Report neck with results. </p>

<p>To help you get started: losing teeth in dreams is super common and linked to worrying about money. </p>

<p>Involved in a car crash means you fear losing control of your life in certain aspects. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dreams are highly personalized and full of symbolism. </p>

<p>The best way to interpret these are what do these things represent to you?</p>

<p>Negative entities in the family. </p>

<p>If it looks like a duck...family of ducks you were careful not to harm. </p>

<p>Bearer of bad news....</p>

<p>Killing the messenger..</p>

<p>Sounds a lot like a stress dream reflecting discord in the family. </p>

<p>I have odd and vivid dreams a lot, but nothing recently. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Appreciate the reply, thanks</p>

<p>I thought about the symbolism but didn&#39;t think of the ducks as that but they stuck out so much,  and that makes sense. </p>

<p>The messenger and bearer of bad news as well. </p>

<p>Interesting line of thought and definitely reasonable, </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Very strange dreams here too. Last night in my dream I was having an intense conversation with someone about black and white - duality, and then I was all of the sudden sitting on a tree branch with my arms spread wide, and the branch was slowly falling to the ground. As it fell and I wasn&#39;t holding onto anything, I had the thought that non-attachment is freedom. Then, when it hit the ground I was transported to another reality and I was rolling on the floor laughing that I&#39;d figured it all out. Strange, but interesting! </p>

<p>Then suddenly after that, cut to the hero walking into a large room with a man standing with his back turned to him.</p>

<p>He turns, and it&#39;s Christopher Lee, who looked like he did in the 1980s or so, except his face was slightly elongated, like Goofy or some other cartoon dog.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m glad you could make it, Mr. _____&quot;, he said, then suddenly a huge bushy moustache appeared on his face, covering half of it, then he tore it off and threw it away in disgust.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had a relatively normal dream about driving an unknown car with my girlfriend in the snow that out of nowhere went from me driving normally to walking down a dark stone hallway lined with doors... I 
feel compelled to move forward against my will and walk a bit and turn left down one of the doors - it&#39;s another long corridor, lined with dark doorways - but at the end I can see a fiery light eminating from the last door. It looks ominous but I can&#39;t stop walking forward. I hear a male voice call from this fiery doorway and somehow, I immediately and undeniably know that this voice belongs to Satan and the shock wakes me up. Unfortunately I can&#39;t remember what, if anything, he said, I just remember hearing his voice and knowing somehow it was him.</p>
