       Sorry if this is the wrong sub,  point me to somewhere else, if need be.
      </p>
      <p>
       These are the dreams I've had the past two nights...
      </p>
      <p>
       Murderous amusement park escape, the wizard escaped??. Escaping from an island, which led to..
      </p>
      <p>
       Demon aliens taking over my family in old settings, and something about sleeping pills not helping them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then,..
      </p>
      <p>
       Friendly creatures of another kind living along with people in harmony that were all turned into one kind against their will. Distinctly remember a gaggle of ducklings and it's mother and having to jump to avoid stepping on any,  running to get back to somewhere i had to go...,
      </p>
      <p>
       Then i was an advisor to a king or ruler of some kind,  gave him bad news,  and he ordered me executed by the guard, i disarmed one, and fought but the sword broke( distinctly remember this and the next part), and some how got another sword that was 4 pointed in the way of a star almost, in a vertical x like, and i ran it through the king that ordered me executed,  and in that moment i felt great remorse as he died.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then woke up going wtf was that about?
      </p>
      <p>
       Now i don't normally dream let alone remember them. No drugs,  no drink,  no pills. No strange shows before bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyone else having bizarre dreams?

       Keep a notepad by your bed stand and write down your dreams as soon as you wake up. This is the old school 18th/19th century method used to retain memories fresh in your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make it a part of your morning routine. Report neck with results.
      </p>
      <p>
       To help you get started: losing teeth in dreams is super common and linked to worrying about money.
      </p>
      <p>
       Involved in a car crash means you fear losing control of your life in certain aspects.

       Yes teeth are money. You are worried about debt or job security . Again very very common.

       Dreams are highly personalized and full of symbolism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The best way to interpret these are what do these things represent to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Negative entities in the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it looks like a duck...family of ducks you were careful not to harm.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bearer of bad news....
      </p>
      <p>
       Killing the messenger..
      </p>
      <p>
       Sounds a lot like a stress dream reflecting discord in the family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have odd and vivid dreams a lot, but nothing recently.

       I thought about the symbolism but didn't think of the ducks as that but they stuck out so much,  and that makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       The messenger and bearer of bad news as well.

       Interesting line of thought and definitely reasonable,

       I had a dream last night I was back at HS.  The toilet was in the middle of the hall and I had to pee.  Everyone was standing around me waiting while I peed so much the toilet filled and started overflowing.  Woke up this morning thinking I should have just flushed it before it got all over the floor.

       Very strange dreams here too. Last night in my dream I was having an intense conversation with someone about black and white - duality, and then I was all of the sudden sitting on a tree branch with my arms spread wide, and the branch was slowly falling to the ground. As it fell and I wasn't holding onto anything, I had the thought that non-attachment is freedom. Then, when it hit the ground I was transported to another reality and I was rolling on the floor laughing that I'd figured it all out. Strange, but interesting!

       I had an elaborate zombie apocalypse dream, which is a genre I don't usually give a fuck about. We eventually got to a safe island to hold them off, but they started communicating telepathically, and taught me that I actually wanted to be a zombie. Being a zombie is the next stage in our evolution

       I dreamt an entire horror movie of about 90 minutes. The hero walked into the castle, then the end credits played.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then suddenly after that, cut to the hero walking into a large room with a man standing with his back turned to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       He turns, and it's Christopher Lee, who looked like he did in the 1980s or so, except his face was slightly elongated, like Goofy or some other cartoon dog.
      </p>
      <p>
       "I'm glad you could make it, Mr. _____", he said, then suddenly a huge bushy moustache appeared on his face, covering half of it, then he tore it off and threw it away in disgust.

       I had a dream last night where I flooded a large empty concrete chamber underneath a high school with water (like millions of gallons in one night) and then dyed the water red. It flooded up to the main floor. Looked like the last scene from evangelion.

       My dreams over the past 5 nights have been bizarre. I've also been able to remember them vividly, when I never used to be able to. I haven't changed anything in my daily or nightly routine so I'm a little baffled.

       I had a relatively normal dream about driving an unknown car with my girlfriend in the snow that out of nowhere went from me driving normally to walking down a dark stone hallway lined with doors... I 
feel compelled to move forward against my will and walk a bit and turn left down one of the doors - it's another long corridor, lined with dark doorways - but at the end I can see a fiery light eminating from the last door. It looks ominous but I can't stop walking forward. I hear a male voice call from this fiery doorway and somehow, I immediately and undeniably know that this voice belongs to Satan and the shock wakes me up. Unfortunately I can't remember what, if anything, he said, I just remember hearing his voice and knowing somehow it was him.

       The long corridor is familiar as well, can never get to that one door you want to get to,  but another opens. Interesting that many seem to have similar things happen.
