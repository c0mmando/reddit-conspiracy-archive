&quot;Well duh it&#39;s real, the files on MK ultra have been declassified. The public is just too stupid to dig into it.&quot;ï»¿ and when someone asked about where can he find those files everyone said to go here: <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/search/site/MKULTRA">https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/search/site/MKULTRA</a> </p>

<p>but there are like 500 pages of documents there so can anyone link me the actually relevant documents that people claim prove this conspiracy </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no smoking gun that links all of those things together and, in fact, most of them are likely not linked in any way (e.g., the freemasons and satanism). However, if you want to read about the CIA&#39;s MKUltra and other related programs, check out <em>Acid Dreams</em> by Martin Lee, <em>The Search for the &quot;Manchurian Candidate</em> by John Marks, and <em>Programmed to Kill</em> by David McGowin, for just a few good books on the subject. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But there is a connection between MK Ultra, Satanism, and the Freemasons.  </p>

<p>Freemasonry was created by the Jesuits, and mind control techniques are used to control and manipulate its members through ritual and allegory.  Freemasonry is Satanic and Luciferian, and so are the Jesuits and Vatican.   The Rosicurians, Skull and Bones, and many other organizations are also involved.  All these groups are connected in one way or another.  </p>

<p>MK Ultra spawned from Operation Paperclip.  The Nazis involved were Satanists who experimented with mind control during WW2.  They were brought to the U.S. to continue the research.  In the 1950&#39;s, they thought they could achieve the results they wanted by using some sort of drug.  They tried several, such as marijuana, LSD, and magic mushrooms.  </p>

<p>It was not until the Vietnam War and the Phoenix program that they realized that inducing a traumatic experience is necessary for mind control.  They learned how to fracture the brain by torturing people in Vietnam.  They also learned that it works much better on children, with 3 and 4 year olds being perfect.  They realized that this is a pedophiles dream.  Kids starting disappearing in the 1970&#39;s...   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, like I said, most of those things aren&#39;t clear connections IMO. For example, it&#39;s not clear at all that the Nazis involved in Paperclip were &quot;Satanists.&quot; And there&#39;s no indication that the CIA was thinking about Freemasonry when they started their mind-control programs. I&#39;m happy to change my mind about these things, but I&#39;ve seen no credible evidence to substantiate the claims you make here. </p>

<p>Finally, and tangentially, kids were &quot;disappearing&quot; before the 70s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand.  I did a lot of reading and watching videos.  At a certain point, you see patterns and connections between seemingly unrelated events and people.  I put a list of sources in a comment in this thread.  Maybe you are already aware of them.  Let me know if you do not see my list, and I will submit it directly to you.  </p>

<p>The turning point for me was when I first understood their religious beliefs.  Then everything made sense.  Before then, I thought that people like Bush, Sr. and Bush, Jr. merely pretended to be Christians so people would vote for them, but they were really not religious at all.  It turns out that they are not Christian, but they are very, very religious.  Once I understood what religion they practice, then I understood why they waged war and caused the deaths of so many.  A Christian would not do that, but a Satanist or Luciferian would.  </p>

<p>I just saw this, too.  It is an article about Mel Gibson: </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, the verifying part is very difficult.  Plus, the truth is so crazy that people have a hard time accepting it.  LOL.  I have discussed these issues with some friends that I have known a long time, and I see their responses.

<p>You seem to be more aware than most.  You are merely asking for more proof so the claims can be verified.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Basically it all comes down to the Cult of Molach. He is an ancient Cannanite God represented by a bull talked a lot about in the Bible and through history. It is believed that the cult still exists under the disguise of Kabbalah. Basically a small group of people who control the world still worship him and Practice child sacrifice and &quot;Sex Magic&quot; (Eyes Wide Shut). In Kabbalah Lucifer is the bringer of knowledge and who they worship. Also Moloch is the bull that the Hebrews were worshiping when Mosses came down off the mountain.</p>

<p>Does it produce satanic possession or something of the sort, probably not - in a probabilistic universe, by which we use observation in merit of WHAT WE KNOW and not what is assumed by faith. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The intelligence community became a new beast when it discovered psychoanalytics.</p>

<p>To create a layer of separation and compartmentalization, private entities like the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations were tasked to study trauma, mass persuasion and cult behavior in order to be able to apply them to the masses.</p>

<p>The Air Force and Tavistock did a number of studies together, including this one:</p>

<p>&quot;Some Principles of Mass Persuasion&quot; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12336576">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12336576</a></p>

<p>Over the years, their system evolved into what is known as &quot;systems psychodynamics.&quot;</p>

<p>Systems  psychodynamics  is  an  interdisciplinary  field  amalgamating  a  triad  of influencesâthe practice of psychoanalysis, the theories and methods of the field of group relations, and the task and boundary awareness of open systems perspectives.</p>

<p>The reason Satanism is tied to MK Ultra and the occult is because Tavistock studied all kinds of cult behavior, not just the polite kinds.</p>

<p>Social Dreaming is what Joseph SMith Jr used on the first Mormons. Tavistock perfected it...</p>

<p>Funny that they removed that article. Check the archives, I guess.</p>

<p>In this picture, you see what of Dr. Cameron&#39;s patients. A child.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what wikipedia has to say about him...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several of the children who Cameron experimented on were sexually abused, in at least one case by several men. One of the children was filmed numerous times performing sexual acts with high-ranking federal government officials, in a scheme set up by Cameron and other MKULTRA researchers, to blackmail the officials to ensure further funding for the experiments.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What was discovered, was that torturing children with the right tools can lead to a controlled DID (dissociative identity disorder), formerly known as multiple personality disorder. You could build spies who didn&#39;t even know they were spies, and each personality was triggered with colors.</p>

<p>This type of torture is done in the context of &quot;ritual abuse&quot; and it has three primary identifiers... electroshock, being locked in boxes (often with critters), and sexual abuse.</p>

<p>The number of children that have described this type of abuse is staggering, but the media painted the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; in such a way that nobody believes them.</p>

<p>According to a study of 2,709 members of the American Psychological Association; it was found that 30 percent had seen cases of ritual or religion- related abuse and 93% of the professionals believed that ritualized abuse occurred.</p>

<p>In 1992, a survey of the membership of the ISSTD, Nancy Perry concluded that 88% of 1185 mental health professionals reported belief in ritual abuse.</p>

<p>So, what you have is the intelligence community making cult members useful idiots for their blackmail operations, where cult members think their respective cult is in charge.</p>

<p>They are torturing children to further blackmail/bribery circles and they are creating fake cults to infiltrate other cults, along with journalists to infiltrate news organizations, along with environmentalists to steal &quot;green&quot; dollars, etc.</p>

<p>Point being, nobody should be surprised when you give the worst people billions of dollars and a mission to infiltrate every possible organization. The logical conclusion of that process is that the best, most secretive, most evil infiltrators are the ones who end up in power and stay there.</p>

<p>Much as it ever was.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t take it Personally. I get nervous about sharing too much. Metadata is a real tattle tale. MAke a bullet point list and just start cracking. Confirm and reconfirm sources and background checks on who&#39;s saying what. Best tip is don&#39;t get to infatuated with any leakers, they can be flipped and it can throw off the trail sometimes. </p>
