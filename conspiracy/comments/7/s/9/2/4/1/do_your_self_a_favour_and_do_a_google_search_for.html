       Is it possible that Jews are culturally or racially superior to all others?

       That's how people justify, say, the disproportionate representation of white people in positions of power and influence.

       I think its a combination of relatively high IQ (especially verbal IQ, which makes them persuasive) and the fact that theirs' is a racial-religion. It makes them the ultimate in-group, and they look out for each other. I have seen this referred to as "tribal nepotism."

       Meritocracy doesn't exist at this point except in theory. But it should be what all complex bureaucracies strive for- a government run on merit will be one which functions smoothly at every level. But alas- Nepotism is usually the name of the game.

       I'm sure some White people do it too. I'm Viet, and I wouldn't be surprised if I got extra consideration if I applied to a job with Viet hiring manager. That said, I think many Jewish people do it on a whole different level. I mean, its basically what one of their holy books (the Talmud) tells them to do.

       Right, the poor Jews were forced into all these high-paying and prestigious positions in finance, the media and hollywood, and the government! They are discriminated against but they are by far the most overrepresented of any race anyway.

       I can't explain anything, the entire programme seems desperately insane to me. What I'd love is for you to explain to me, how you justify it. But I understand that's not possible, not in any construction of how on earth this post came to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       My remaining hope is that I can convince you, yes you, to at least attempt to explain it to yourself. In private, say next time you go to the toilet, or for a smoke. On the bus, wherever. Just try and rationalize it all the way through, just to yourself. I want X, so I post Y. How does Y lead to X. What else could Y lead to.

       It means I'm trying to talk to the individual human whose fingers hit the keys that created the post I responded to. With the intent to strip him or her of all external obligation and bear in my direction the actual them, the individual mind that exists beyond and regardless of the convergence of mundane causes that is ultimately and ineffably responsible for the post's existence.

       Just my amateur opinion but this is probably due to the prominence of New York City, where some 18% of people are Jewish. I randomly browsed a bunch of these famous American Jews, and a great deal of them are from New York or moved there. New York is the traditional finance capital of the US, and also a powerful figure in US media. New Yorkers and thus by extension a great deal of Jews would have had access to success in ways most Americans didn't. This would then translate to seemingly high disproportionate number of powerful/famous Jews.

       We have been deceived about the nature of men, women, and love.
      </p>
      <p>
       It turns out that 'love' is an entirely different experience for men and women.
      </p>
      <p>
       Men can love women in a truly romantic sense, whereas women love men for what they can provide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to legal, social and technological changes over the past several generations, the top few per cent of men (genetics, wealth and class) are now sharing the majority of women, while most men are fighting for scraps.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why most marriages today involve cheating and/or psychological abuse, usually with the male as the victim.
      </p>
      <p>
       For these reasons and more, an increasingly number of men are opting out the socially-driven competition for female interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly the mgtow subreddit has attracted many bitter men, who cloud the good information (much of it based on empirical evidence) which young men especially need to hear.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, too, many men are claiming to have 'gone their own way' when in fact they have been sent their own way, and would instantly run back to the plantation if a alfway cute girl winked at them with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world is not at all as we have been led to believe. With knowledge comes sadness, regret, sorrow, but eventually, for those with mental fortitude, knowledge also brings tremendous power.

       This is one of the core debates (or points of contention) on the mgtow sub: are ALL women like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'NAWALT' side claim that not all women are like that, and you just have to look to find your unicorn, the woman who will not take advantage of the system which is designed to help her the moment she gets cranky with her partner.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 'AWALT' side claim that, sadly, all women are in fact like that, and it is only a matter of time until even the most amazing of women go feral.
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally do not have a dog in this fight. It seems to me as though women of geenrations gone by could in fact be good, loyal wives and mothers. The current generation coming through seem like a lost cause, however, and it is not their fault: the smartphone alone has changed things in phenomenal and disastrous ways.

       I'm glad to hear that. What we don't know is whether or not he is respected in the household, if he gets to make big decisions, if he is satisfied in the bedroom, etc. And I am not about to ask, because it is not my business.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point here is that your own testimony here is only one part of the equation, and it is only one side of the story. One trip to r/deadbedrooms reveals just how dejected and unappreciated many men feel in otherwise 'happy' marriages.

       Instead of putting the Jews in labor camps, they should have put them in accounting. 😉

       Meritocracy doesn't exist at this point except in theory. But it should be what all complex bureaucracies strive for- a government run on merit will be one which functions smoothly at every level. But alas- Nepotism is usually the name of the game.

       I'm sure some White people do it too. I'm Viet, and I wouldn't be surprised if I got extra consideration if I applied to a job with Viet hiring manager. That said, I think many Jewish people do it on a whole different level. I mean, its basically what one of their holy books (the Talmud) tells them to do.
