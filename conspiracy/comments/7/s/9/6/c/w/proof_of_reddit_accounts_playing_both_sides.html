       Accounts with decent karma and a long and innocuous post history are worth good money to marketers. Rather than buying legit accounts or spending all that effort posting mundane things to build a legend, you can use a bot to grab random comments from old threads and repost them in new ones. Over time, creates the appearence of an organic account. Also a way to 'park' accounts between campaigns.

       The possible explanations for this behavior are, in order from most likely to least likely:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         These are bots designed to rack up karma to create the appearance of legitimate accounts. They are then used for marketing purposes or possibly other kinds of astroturfing
         <em>
          after
         </em>
         they have established their fake post history.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         These accounts are run by standard trolls who just want to stir up controversy.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         These accounts are designed to spread propaganda. I put this at the bottom of the list because it wouldn't be a very good propaganda scheme. Botting exact copies is too obvious. Propaganda is spread by real humans with tool assistance and possibly AI since it is much more effective and harder to detect conclusively.

       Except 'they are used for marketing purposes or possibly other kinds of astroturfing' and 'they are designed to spread propaganda' are for all intents and purposes the same, and the second one is a flimsy nonsense whose only reason for existing is to buffer the other two in the hopes that the reader won't notice that they're the same.

       I don't think you understand my point with the first one. If these are to become propaganda accounts, then the copied comments are almost surely not the intended propaganda. What you are seeing is most likely account farming. What they do with the accounts after they have matured is a whole different question.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the second point, you are dead wrong. That is an extremely likely scenario. There are many thousands of standalone trolls out there and groups like TMoR thrive on stirring up this kind of drama.

       Yeah I jumped the gun on that one, you're right. Do forgive me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Although, well. Sort of right. You're right that spreading propaganda through botting would be dumb and obvious, I missed that, my bad. But when I say marketing and propaganda are for all intents and purposes the same, that's kind of what I mean. Because propaganda like you describe wouldn't work, they do it the same way the marketers do. The 'human with tool assistance' scenario is the same scenario from point 1. The 'tools' being the bot farming scripts and persona management software.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the standalone trolls, well maybe. I don't know, seems to me these days they're just volunteer corps/tribute acts to their professional counterparts. Nobody left just making mischief that I can see, it's all political. I imagine every group has at least a few influence leaders on some payroll or other.

       In a lot of ways, I think we agree. The only thing that I am arguing against is the naive narrative that seems to be emerging that these bot accounts are evidence of several different parts of the political landscape spreading propaganda across Reddit via bots. I'm saying that it's insane to take these posts at face value, as if the bot creators all thought they were going to pull a fast one on the internet and just lazily copy the same comments around on different accounts. That is by far the least likely scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's entirely plausible that one group is using bots to farm accounts with several different fake political viewpoints which they can then use to influence the narrative on all sides.

      <p>
       It seems like you're eliding all the different uses of the word 'bot' - automatic posting for its own sake, or to build histories for astroturf accounts, or as an informal term for human posters who are so predictable they may as well be robots - and then using the resulting confusion to try and exculpate one side, which you don't name specifically but hey no prizes for guessing.

       Several different parts of the political landscape
       <em>
        are
       </em>
       spreading propaganda across reddit, and each employ bots in the various different ways we've discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is
       <em>
        not at all
       </em>
       plausible that only one group is using bots, though groups may use them in different ways and to different extents. Social media marketing is a real practise, and bots make that practise much more effective, and there are multiple groups are involved in that practice, from the russians to the never trumpers to taco bell and netflix and everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, just sort of rambling now. Happy to keep the convo going, but tbh running a little low on faith, you've not really engaged with anything I've said so far.

       I think you have misunderstood my point again. I'm not really speaking in generalities, I'm speaking specifically about the cases that have been discussed recently on
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       . I'm saying that these individual cases don't prove much, or at least it's hard to say with certainty what they prove. There are multiple different possible motives, but people seem to jump on a bandwagon and say that there is an obvious implication. I just think that is a bit hasty.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course there is all kinds of political manipulation happening, but it's pointless to try to argue that these cases are an example of group X manipulating group Y because anyone could make these accounts. Without more information, all I can say is that it looks like account farming to me.

       You are speaking in generalities, though, that's all you're doing. That's all either of us are doing, to be fair. But I am willing at least to sketch an outline - russians, nevertrump, taco bell etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I still contend that, from a methodological perspective at least, there's no real difference between any of them. All have the same practical objective - to inject synthetic ideas into organic conversations in a way that is not easily detectable. The most effective techniques for doing that are the ones that make use of bots. So, they all use bots - or at least the ones that don't are behind the curve and will eventually catch up.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree though that people jump the gun a lot, me myself not least of all. It's not tremendously helpful. And you're right, we don't have all the information, there are a lot of known unknowns.
      </p>
      <p>
       Problem is, there is a phenomenon. A thing that is readily apparent, and needs to be explained. And maybe these half-baked theories about shills and bots are not enough to explain it; maybe we can even identify enough missing information to say with confidence that they're
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       not enough to explain it. Maybe we could prove with formal logic that these theories
       <em>
        cannot possibly
       </em>
       explain this phenomenon. The phenomenon does not go away.
