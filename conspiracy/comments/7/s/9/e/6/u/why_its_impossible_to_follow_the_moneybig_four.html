<p>This is why it&#39;s impossible to follow the money...they&#39;re all in on it.</p>

<p>Revolving door policies between the most powerful global accounting firms in the world and government regulatory agencies show that once again...they simply cannot be trusted.</p>

<p>This is a small introduction to the umbrella corporations that rule the world.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to start making a weekly post covering the heavy hitters whose job it is to make sure that we can never &quot;follow the money&quot;.</p>

<p>For those of you who are interested in this I recommend brushing up a little bit on the WPP Group. This is where I will start to lay the groundwork in an attempt to bring a little more light on the forces &quot;behind the politics&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the big take here is that KPMG is incompetent, not really super malevolent... All Big 4 pay fines due to failed audits, it&#39;s not a perfect practice. It doesn&#39;t mean that every aspect of the audit failed. The PCAOB still reviews the work performed.</p>

<p>Audits go through so many level of peer reviews it&#39;d be very difficult for a big 4 accounting firm to collude with a government agency.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely shady business practices go on, not gonna argue with you there. In terms of audits though - I personally find it hard to believe that there is collusion in audits that are hiding another Enron. Sarbanes-Oxley really beefed up audit requirements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely man. I can really only give context to the auditing world. I don&#39;t think I can really speak to anything that would interest you in regards to this sub... On the other hand, if you&#39;re interested I&#39;d recommend looking up how tax shelters still play a big role globally. I can give you a link sometime, just remind me</p>

    <div class="md"><p>After doing a little more research this morning this is actually a bigger deal than what I originally thought. Really high up people were involved (head of the audit practice of KPMG) and definitely a cause for concern in the public eye. I personally don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything like Enron going on that&#39;s being covered up but it&#39;s the job of major accounting firms to remove as much doubt as possible.</p>

<p>Not a good look for a profession where the #1 asset is public trust.</p>
