<p>Part 1 <strong>Fuck My Face</strong></p>

<p>From january 20th-21st, a petition with a measley 200,000 signatures got sporadic coverage demanding Trump release his tax returns immediately. This prompted a Kellyane Conway interview on the 22nd in which she said, in response to the petition&#39;s demand the return&#39;s be released immediately, that &quot;the word from the white house was that he wont be releasing the tax returns,&quot; Which, of course, prompted every major news outlet in the country to run a headline that day simply stating that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?num=50&amp;amp;newwindow=1&amp;amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F22%2F2017%2Ccd_max%3A1%2F22%2F2017&amp;amp;q=%22Trump%22+%22release+tax+returns+%22&amp;amp;oq=%22Trump%22+%22release+tax+returns+%22&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i5i30k1j0i7i5i30k1j0i5i30k1j0i7i5i30k1j0i5i30k1.40777.44442.0.45807.10.9.1.0.0.0.400.1886.0j2j3j1j1.7.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..2.8.1905...0i7i30k1j0i13k1j35i39k1j0i13i5i30k1j0i8i13i30k1.0.k4wk_bqRWQk">Donald Trump will not release his tax returns</a>. At the very least, this was incredibly skeet.</p>

<p>Then there was the sanctions leaks &quot;scandal&quot; with mike flynn. CNN and Washpo, amongst others, beat this story dead for nearly a week. Drawing wide speculations as to what the implications of the sanction revelations could be and what it could mean for Flynn. Why CNN felt the need to publish pieces like, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/14/opinions/did-flynn-break-law-pate-opinion/index.html">Did Michael Flynn break the law?</a> and what compelled Washpo to ask on Feb 10 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/02/10/just-how-much-trouble-is-michael-flynn-in/">Just How Much Trouble is Michael Flynn In?</a>, when both esteemed News outlets had already answered those very questions themselves three weeks earlier on January 23rd in pieces regarding these very same phone calls before the little tidbit on sanctions had been revealed through leaks. seems pretty obvious to me </p>

<p>They spent nearly a week fanning the flames of this hoopla even though Washpo penned a piece on jan 23 entitled <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-reviewed-flynns-calls-with-russian-ambassador-but-found-nothing-illicit/2017/01/23/aa83879a-e1ae-11e6-a547-5fb9411d332c_story.html">FBI reviewed Flynn’s calls with Russian ambassador but found nothing illicit</a> and CNN with a more nuanced piece on the same day, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/23/politics/flynn-russia-calls-investigation/index.html">US investigating Flynn calls with Russian diplomat</a> drawing the same conclusion, nonetheless. The FBI listened in on calls with foreign nationals, particularly Russian Foreign Nationals, with any US Diplomat on a regular basis and had already cleared Flynn of any wrongdoing in his conversation with Kisylak, meaning whatever allusion that was made to sanctions, was meaningless. Odds are, he never lied to Pence at all and that despite the innocuous nature of his conversation, the Trump Administration, knowing the media narrative would blow anything of the like way out proportion, decided to keep the info under wraps, as well they should have. Flynn was forced to resign under totally false pretenses because the MSM malicously misrepresented the nature of those leaks in relation to his calls.</p>

<p>An example of blatantly fake news published by CNN was <a href="https://theintercept.com/2017/06/27/cnn-journalists-resign-latest-example-of-media-recklessness-on-the-russia-threat/">a story about Scaramucci</a> in may with such a dubious source that their ethics department warned them not to go ahead with it. It llead to the resignation of a Pulitzer Prize winner, a finalist for the award and a senior editor there. Three of their brightest shining stars taken down in one fell swoop for publishing literal fake news.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDk9sbqy7zs&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be">Scaramucci Sidenote</a></p>

<p>The way NPR frames that CNN incident is also bullshit, imo. <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/27/534566758/cnn-resignations-a-sign-of-the-high-stakes-in-covering-trumps-administration">&quot;The high stakes,&quot;</a> give me a fucking break, they were warned not to run with it.</p>

<p>Funny how when CNN retracts a story saying the Senate was investigating Anthony Scaramucci and his ties to a Russian investment fund, offering no apology or explanation even though CNN&#39;S ethics and legal teams advised against posting the story, which led to the resignations of <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2017/06/28/cnn-slow-down-after-russia-story-resignations-retraction-alicia-shepard-column/433550001/">three &quot;highly qualified journalism veterans&quot;</a>, NPR chalks it up to <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/06/27/534566758/cnn-resignations-a-sign-of-the-high-stakes-in-covering-trumps-administration">The High Stakes In Covering Trump&#39;s Administration</a> then in the same article, instead of conducting any further investigation or offering any of their own journalistic insights regarding how all this might have happened in the first place, NPR just sucks the shit right out of CNN&#39;s dick for doing such a great job expanding their political coverage lately </p>

<p>At least they gave CNN the business after the network posted no retraction and instead just silently replaced a story ensuring readers that Comey&#39;s testimony would <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/06/08/cnn-succumbs-to-its-own-comey-hype/">refute Trump’s contention that Comey told him on three occasions that he himself wasn’t under investigation</a> with an obstruction of justice narrative and an editor&#39;s note after comey did in fact corroborate Trump&#39;s claims multiple times in that hearing.  Wait, I can&#39;t find any NPR stories on that incident. Weird.</p>

<p>Speaking of Comey&#39;s testimony, at least npr had the journalistic integrity to do a little backtracking of their own after ensuring readers it could be the  &quot;testimony of the century&quot; and didn&#39;t run with that bogus <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;amp;client=ms-android-att-us&amp;amp;source=android-browser&amp;amp;q=site%3Anpr.org+obstruction+of+justice">obstruction of justice</a> story even though Comey himself said &quot;I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December...I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign.** I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn’s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBI’s role as an independent investigative agency.&quot;
( <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anpr.org+%22I+did+not+understand+the+President+to+be+talking+about+the+broader+investigation+into+Russia+or+possible+links+to+his+campaign%22&amp;amp;ie=utf-8&amp;amp;oe=utf-8">I wonder how many times NPR included this relevant piece of context in their Obstruction of justice coverage, or just anywhere period</a> )? at least theu really made sure readers understood that trump was not under investigation after months of suggesting that he was <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Anpr.org+intitle%3Atrump%2Brussia%2Binvestigation&amp;amp;num=50&amp;amp;newwindow=1&amp;amp;client=ms-android-att-us&amp;amp;biw=1100&amp;amp;bih=1036&amp;amp;source=lnt&amp;amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A1%2F1%2F2017%2Ccd_max%3A6%2F9%2F2017&amp;amp;tbm=">under investigation</a> and didn&#39;t just bury that detail at the end of every story. More on NPR&#39;s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NPR/comments/6p67n9/z/dko3a36">stellar coverage of comey&#39;s testimony</a></p>

<p>But you know, when some local affiliate reporter gets swindled by a seedy millionaire and Fox News picks up the story, then realises they fucked up and are going to get sued but post a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2017/05/23/statement-on-coverage-seth-rich-murder-investigation.html">proper retraction</a> to the story a week later anyway, NPR decides to kick them while their down for some reason, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/09/15/551163406/fox-news-has-yet-to-explain-what-what-wrong-in-seth-rich-story">&quot;No Apolgies, No Explanation,&quot;</a> corporate conspiracy, rupert murdoch, and a bunch of shit on integrity when Fox News does it but when three journalists who are supposed to be at the top their game do it on CNN, NPR gives up when they &quot;refuse to comment&quot; and just praises the network instead. You know whats just below fact-checking errors on that scale lf journalistic integrity? Blatant partisianship. Which for years before it was trendy, NPR already had in spades.</p>

<p>Then there was the aformentioned Comey testimony. Two days before which CNN [published an article][<a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/336871-cnn-issues-correction-after-comey-statement-contradicts-reporting">http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/336871-cnn-issues-correction-after-comey-statement-contradicts-reporting</a>] assuring readers that Comey would dispute Trump&#39;s claim that Comey told him he was not being investigated, one reporter (an editor actually, iirc) reiterating the claim on tv that night</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Comey is going to dispute the president on this point if he’s asked about it by senators, and we have to assume that he will be. He will sally he never assured Donald Trump that he was not under investigation, that that would have been improper for him to do so.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, the night before the testimony even happened, Comey released a statement saying that he did assure Donald of exactly that. Reiterating multiple times during the actual hearing that Donald Trump was literally hitler. <sup><sup>jk</sup></sup> He said Trump &quot;was not and had never been under investigation by the FBI.&quot; And i don&#39;t know why the hill thinks its ok to imply that Trump still could technically be under criminal investigation just because comey didn&#39;t specifically say the words criminal investigation. Comey made.himself pretty fucking clear. And when asked directly in the hearing if Trump was under investogation, not merely a counterintelligence investigation, &quot;investigation&quot; he said the same thing.</p>

<p>Hilariously, if you look at the corrections listed on bottom of that hill article I linked to, it actually appears to have originally reported CNN&#39;s false claim itself. A perfect demonstration of another way they can get away with this shit. If The Hill reports a claim citing CNN, and CNN is later forced to post a retraction for that claim, The Hill&#39;s only responsibility, technically, is to update their article with a correction that 99% of the people who already read the false claim will never see. I don&#39;t think CNN even posted a retraction in this case though.</p>

<p>The second update on that Hill article about obstruction of justice is another example. I wrote an detailed breakdown of an NPR report on the testimony and the obstruction of justice thing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NPR/comments/6p67n9/is_it_me_or_has_npr_become_bullshit/dko3a36">here</a>. In a nutshell, how many people knew comey said trump wasn&#39;t under investigation that day compared to how many thought all of sudden that Trump obstructed justice. And how many knew Comey himself also stated that he did not think trump had obsructed justice? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December...I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynn’s departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Now, alot of people are willing to forgive these &quot;errors&quot; on account of the fact that they were, sooner or later, &quot;corrected&quot; by the offending outlets. But that argument completely fails to address the phenomenon where a false story is reported on, pushed to the front page/primetime and seen by millions who will never see the correction/retraction and the suspicion by many that this is done purposefully to push an agenda. </p>

<p>How many people reading this post still believes that at least one of those stories was true? I suspect most. </p>

<p>How many times this year has a positive Trump story made headlines and later been corrected by any of these gatekeeper news moguls? I suspect zero. coincidence?</p>

<p>Then theres the things they dont report on. Show me one NYT CNN or WashPo article reporting on william browders testimony from july in which he ties that Russian lawyer trump jr met with to the organisation that hired the spy who put together the trump dossier and reveals that she colluded with the same organisation (fusion gps) a few years ago to run a smear campaign against browder while he was lobbying Congress to pass the magnitsky act. (sidenote Hildog and the Obama administration fought tooth and nail against the Magnitsky Act before it was passed. <sup><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-magnitsky-case">1</a></sup> <sup><sup><a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/the-magnitsky-case">2</a></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/24/why-its-hard-to-take-democrats-seriously-on-russia-215415">3</a></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/07/24/why-its-hard-to-take-democrats-seriously-on-russia-215415">4</a></sup></sup></sup></sup> <sup><sup><sup><sup><sup><a href="http://foreignpolicy.com/2014/05/15/the-magnitsky-flip-flop/">5</a>.</sup></sup></sup></sup></sup> if you&#39;re not familiar with the act, it mostly concerns the imposition of sanctions on Russian oligarchs who are alleged to have committed human rights violations)</p>

<p>I clipped the part of Browder&#39;s Testimony where he summarizes the whole thing. Here&#39;s <a href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4687217/william-browder-testifies-natalia-veselnitskaya-colluded-glen-simpson-fusion-gps-engage-political">the clip</a> where he mentions Natalia. </p>

<p>The clip begins right before this quote:</p>

<p>BROWDER: ...and I have had numerous threats for my own life. It&#39;s not just death threats. It&#39;s not just violence but also what i call political violence. The political violence came in the form of a massive campaign that the russian government, via Natlia Veselnitskaya launched here in Washington. She organized a number of individuals to come to Washington and lobby. And basically tell a story, tell a false story that Sergei Magnitsky wasn&#39;t murdered, that he wasn’t the whistleblower, in order to have the Magnitsky Act repealed. She engaged x person (name idk), she engaged Glen Simpson from Fusion GPS, she engaged Chris Cooper From Potomac Strategies, she engaged Ron Dellums, she engaged a number of individuals and the purpose of the engagement was to withdraw, or, to repeal the Magnitsky Act and withdraw Sergei Magnitsky’s name from the Global Magnitsky Act. </p>

<p>If anyone knows the name he&#39;s saying that I was unable to understand there, lmk please.</p>

<p>Part 2 <strong>WashPo, CNN and the like are still trying desperately to recertify the colloquial meaning of &quot;fake news&quot; because Trump&#39;s &quot;fake news&quot; narrative is devastating to their agenda</strong></p>

<p>Trump has made countless remarks (and tweets) referencing fake news and the two narratives he avoids are the two most subject to plausible deniability. He never (or at least very rarely has) said they lied, and he never says they straight up <em>failed</em> to report on something. CNN and most other mainstream outlets for that matter, publish articles deliberately miscategorized and/or buried in the abyss of the front page, or even off the front page, they run 3 minute segments on whatever may be adverse to ther agenda in arbitrary time slots.</p>

<p>The most common theme in Trump&#39;s tweets using the term &quot;fake news&quot; is the demonstrably disproportionate amount of negative coverage of him and his administration. And just generally what he considers to be bad reporting. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>With all of its phony unnamed sources &amp; highly slanted &amp; even fraudulent reporting, #Fake News is DISTORTING DEMOCRACY in our country!</p>

<p>Wow, more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative, with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. Hence my use of Social Media, the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream ...</p>

<p>I win an election easily, a great &quot;movement&quot; is verified, and crooked opponents try to belittle our victory with FAKE NEWS. A sorry state! 4:44 AM - 11 Jan 2017. 28,076 Retweets;</p>

<p>The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister! 5:59 PM - 18 Jul 2017. 26,966 Retweets; 106,503</p>

<p>FAKE NEWS media knowingly doesn&#39;t tell the truth. A great danger to our country. The failing @nytimes has become a joke. Likewise @CNN. Sad! 7:09 PM - 24 Feb 2017. 25,774 Retweets; 105,939 Likes;</p>

<p>The Fake News Awards, those going to the most corrupt &amp; biased of the Mainstream Media, will be presented to the losers on Wednesday , January 17th, rather than this coming Monday.</p>

<p>While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network. They said technical difficulties! 4:14 AM - 12 Feb 2017.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/tcTlM-EHXt4">And yes that did happen to Bernie</a></p>

<p>The term &quot;Fake news&quot; employs plausible deniability as a catch-all to address plausible deniability. In Trump&#39;s case, like I said before, it is primarily utilized to address the histotically disproportionate amount of negative coverage him and his administration have been receiving.This is why every news station was tripping over itself at the beginning of 2017 to re-establish the colloquial meaning of the term as it became more popular.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/oct/18/deciding-whats-fake-medias-definition-fake-news-vs/">this politifact article</a> assumes to reveal that Donald Trump is out of touch with reality by breaking down which situations Trump is most likely to employ the term with out even considering the possibility that the word &quot;fake&quot; in &quot;fake news&quot; does not literally mean &quot;fake,&quot; When Donald Trump says it.</p>

<p>Going to such great pangs as the aforementioned politifact piece to say &quot;No, donald.its real,&quot; is just ridicous at this point. Clearly demonstrated by by the essencs of shit that emodies ths politifact piece. A glistening pillar of fake news, indeed.</p>

<p>Part 3 <strong>The Totalitarian Media</strong></p>

<p>This is an excerpt from an analysis on the propaganda machine of the Bolsheviks. You can read the entire piece <a href="http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/hrc/theory/mediafreedom/t.4.1%5B7%5D.html">here</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the Bolsheviks, the contradiction between political and economic rights within the media had been resolved through the nationalisation of the media. In Lenin&#39;s model of media freedom, the propertyless majority of the population abdicated their political right of media freedom to the minority of professional revolutionaries, who ran the nationalised newspapers and radio stations on their behalf. Crucially, the Bolsheviks derived their claim to absolute political power from their knowledge of the correct revolutionary ideology. Because they had been corrupted by the false ideas of the old order, the Russian workers and peasants were unable to express their long-term interests through regular elections. As a consequence, the revolutionary conspiracy had to use the nationalised media for the education of the population in the correct ideas of the new society. Therefore the majority of the population were excluded from any direct or indirect participation within the media. At the same time, media workers were also prevented from expressing their own opinions in print or over the airwaves. In order to guarantee the ideologically correct content of the media, the Bolsheviks turned all journalists, printers, broadcasters and engineers into employees of the revolutionary state. Thus, by the early-1920s, Lenin and his followers had instituted a new definition of media freedom: the one-way flow of propaganda from the ruling party to the population.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think the one way flow of propaganda in the age of the Bolsheviks, and what led to it, draws a lot of parallels to the mainstream media in the United States .i&#39;ll finish part 3 in another post later. it will focus on The telecommunications act of 1996, AM radio, and fox news</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In response to your deleted comment (I was a bit too slow to reply):</p>

<p>It probably won’t be as good as yours tbh. It’s just that every time I watch Fox I find myself incredulous at the number of literal lies they seem to proliferate.</p>

<p>I’ve done a post on it before but it wasn’t very good either. The best way to do it would be with some kind of TV capture device, which I haven’t really looked into.</p>

<p>I’d assume anyone could turn on the tv and flip back and forth between the two and see what I mean.</p>

<p>In response to this one:</p>

<p>If it was one sided, yeah probably</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Perhaps. I guess I was mostly thinking of television when I said Fox seems much worse than CNN. Their websites would probably be easier to research though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah this is hard to convey but since all televised news is shit its like, the anchors are so much worse than the writers for the most part. You know what I mean? But at the same time, I guess televised news might still have a larger impact on public opinion. Which could make it more worthwhile to analyze actually. Im not sure what the gauge is there. But the written news is still what guides the televised narratives, so its like the meat no matter what. </p>

<p>Then again, i guess it really doesn&#39;t matter where the meat is if it doesn&#39;t have the wider influence. </p>
