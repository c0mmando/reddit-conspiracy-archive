<p>From what I am told, this year happens to be one of the worst for the flu and they are pushing the flu shot real hard right now. Why does this feel like more and more of a staged event than a genuine spread of illness. How are they pulling this off every year?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That is a huge point that I want to reiterate. </p>

<p>People go to the doctor, they have a certain set of symptoms.  The doctor, based soley on those symptoms, diagnoses your condition and says, &quot;oh, you have the flu&quot;.</p>

<p>The problem is, that <strong>only a very small percentage (16%,) of doctor-diagnosed &quot;flu&quot; actually is flu</strong>.  Here&#39;s an excerpt from a Jon Rappoport article which explains this:</p>

<p>Dr. Peter Doshi, writing in the online BMJ (British Medical Journal), reveals a monstrosity.</p>

<p>As Doshi states, every year, hundreds of thousands of respiratory samples are taken from flu patients in the US and tested in labs. Here is the kicker: only a small percentage of these samples show the presence of a flu virus.</p>

<p>This means: most of the people in America who are diagnosed by doctors with the flu have no flu virus in their bodies.</p>

<p>So they don’t have the flu.</p>

<p>Therefore, even if you assume the flu vaccine is useful and safe, it couldn’t possibly prevent all those “flu cases” that aren’t flu cases.</p>

<p>The vaccine couldn’t possibly work.</p>

<p>The vaccine isn’t designed to prevent fake flu, unless pigs can fly.</p>

<p>Here’s the exact quote from Peter Doshi’s BMJ review, “Influenza: marketing vaccines by marketing disease” (BMJ 2013; 346:f3037):</p>

<p>“…even the ideal influenza vaccine, matched perfectly to circulating strains of wild influenza and capable of stopping all influenza viruses, can only deal with a small part of the ‘flu’ problem because most ‘flu’ appears to have nothing to do with influenza. <strong>Every year, hundreds of thousands of respiratory specimens are tested across the US. Of those tested, on average 16% are found to be influenza positive</strong>.</p>

<p>“…It’s no wonder so many people feel that ‘flu shots’ don’t work: for most flus, they can’t.”</p>

<p>Because most diagnosed cases of the flu aren’t the flu. </p>

<p><a href="https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2017/11/08/the-great-flu-vaccine-hoax-new-evidence/">https://jonrappoport.wordpress.com/2017/11/08/the-great-flu-vaccine-hoax-new-evidence/</a></p>

<p>TL;DR
Your doctor bases diagnoses on a set of symptoms.  In the case of influenza, a yearly average of only 16% of the patients diagnosed with the flu actually had the flu, as determined by lab testing by the CDC of hundreds of thousands of samples taken from patients diagnosed with it.  Most people that think they have the flu or are told by a doctor they have the flu don&#39;t actually have the flu.</p>

<p>1g a day and you&#39;ll be fine. When I was more disciplined at it, I was without flu for years. Even nowadays, I still rarely get some minor colds.</p>

<p>Before that I used to spend the whole winter with cold. Every single year.</p>

<p>The only time I&#39;ve got flu in the recent years, guess what, its when I took a flu shot, in the period of the h1n1 outbreak ( in 2009). Never again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been using lypo=spheric for years, and wouldn&#39;t have known when cold and flu season was except for people calling off from work and leaving me extra to do.  Fast forward to New Years, and my online order was delayed, then lost, and I ran out.  Lesson learned.  I have my first flu in years and it is a killer.  Have my C back in stock, should have just taken a different supplement but started to think it was me, not the vitamin C, that was superior.  Never again, I think vitamin C daily is worth a lifetime of flu shots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I usually get the occasional cold, runny nose, coughing, rarely does it turn into a sinus infection, I can&#39;t recall ever having the flu before this year, never had a flu shot in my life.

    <div class="md"><p>Same hear. My theory is that all of those times I <em>thought</em> I had the flu, I actually just had a bad cold. About ten years ago I got the actual flu, and I couldn&#39;t move for three days- all I could do was shiver on the couch under a blanket. My wife didn&#39;t get the flu that year- and she&#39;d gotten the shot. Now I get the flu shot every year.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some other people have made mentions of the immunological effects that the cold brings on. Great. </p>

<p>People have been getting sick from these diseases for years. Perhaps the rise of the spread of the disease is through the Anti-Vax movement. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That doesn&#39;t make sense. The flu vax is fairly recent and just now so widely administered. Wouldn&#39;t that make flu <em>less</em> frequent than before there was a common vax for it?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The flu vacc is most likely what causes new strains of flu every year, because the vaccine version of the virus can mutate into a more resistant form. This  also happens with the spread of vaccine-derived polio virus which causes more deaths than wild polio virus.</p>

<p>The world has seasons.    The germs we exported last year via tourists spent half a year infecting and mutating across another ethno/genetic area.   and came back when the flow of tourists changed with the seasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t had a flu shot in over a decade and have worked several customer service jobs in that time (i.e. I was exposed to a lot of nasty motherfuckers). The only time I&#39;ve been seriously sick in the last decade was food poisoning from Chipotle. Other than that I&#39;ve had a few illnesses where I did call off work but mostly because I was lazy, I wasn&#39;t actually debilitated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I&#39;ve had several friends get the flu from the flu shot lmao. I mean I guess that&#39;s the point, but I never had to deal with any of that shit. </p>
