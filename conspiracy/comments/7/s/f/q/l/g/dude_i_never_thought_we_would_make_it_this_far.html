       Bored at work, just thinking to myself seeing a generation after me get to go to school and learn and live is almost shocking to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I remember back in 2012-2013 I was in college telling everyone 9/11 was a false flag and that aliens were going to invade any moment. I never thought I’d have a real, human life. I thought I’d of been iced by now.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always had hope that something spiritual would happen to humanity and that we would beat the evil forces but I thought billions would die in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now over the last year I’ve realized that this is all part of a truly unfathomable divine plan; that good and evil are working together to show us, the
       <em>
        actors
       </em>
       how to make the best movie.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m in tears right now, realizing that somehow, somewhere along the way I found some hope. It’s 2018. Obama and Clinton failed. Jade Helm didn’t take our guns. War with Russia was averted. Nibiru didn’t pass. Aliens didn’t invade (jury’s still out). You get what I mean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you god.

       You know I used to think to myself, as I believe in some kind of reincarnation, that my primary goal was to escape Earth when I die. I spent years forming my death plan.

       Now, I’ve let go of that. I’ll stay here with you guys as long as it takes to free every man, woman, and child.

       It is as if, you understand that this is what you've always been here for. But first you have to find your way. To self discovery. Then you can see, that all others are just other self.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is all around, words written down. But we can only know truth when we find it in our self. When we see ourselves in others. We are able to truly be free.

       I believe you reincarnate again and again until you reach a point where you hit enlightment and are freed of your physical body, but not through death. Death simply means your consciousness will find a new body to inhabit. 
There is something monks call the 'rainbow body' where your consciousness is released and your body transcends into deep meditative state while the tissue shrinks overtime but the body is kept preserved. This is reached by thinking only pure thoughts over a long period of time (16-60yrs).

       Sayin you can see what you call a divine plan:
      </p>
      <p>
       "Now over the last year I’ve realized that this is all part of a truly unfathomable divine plan; that good and evil are working together"
      </p>
      <p>
       But the person I was responding to was feeling frustrated saying there is no point trying to tell you it's God doing all of this because everyone especially in the conspiracy world seems to want to deny God.  Even though hiding and distracting humanity from the existence of God is the ultimate conspiracy.  Lucifer being a spiritual being ruling this realm (God allows it) and deceiving humanity also explains pretty much every conspiracy that is out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the truth.  God is real.  Jesus Christ is the Word of God (who is God) that manifested in the flesh and died for us so that could have salvation through repentance and belief on his Gospel which is:
      </p>
      <p>
       1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:
      </p>
      <p>
       Jesus Christ was the Lamb of God.  His blood spiritually washes away all of your sins from your soul.  All that is needed is repentance of your current sinful rebellious state and belief in the above Gospel.  Nothing you do can save you.  No going to Church, no donating to charity, no being a good person.  Only repenting and believing in what Jesus Christ did for you will save you.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you are observing is God's divine plan being played out.  He is in control of everything, even the deception and the chief deceiver who is the Devil/Lucifer himself.  The enter point of this life in the flesh is to reconcile ourselves to God through Jesus Christ.

       Lucifer is the "god of this world" that's why the elite worship him and do blood ritual and sacrifice children for him.  They do it and receive power here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had the same reaction about Santa.  That's exactly why the Vatican adopted that pagan nonsense and mixed it with their false version of Christianity.  It sets little kids up to reject Jesus from a young age (Fool me once parents!).
      </p>
      <p>
       Research the Flat Earth (another hated conspiracy here) and fake space.  These truths can help you understand the sheer magnitude of Lucifer's deception:

       I know the earth is flat and they are faking outer space.  That is what helped me to accept there is a God.  I know you believe you have seen the globe but you have not.  It's very deep programming we have all been indoctrinated with.  Looking into this conspiracy seriously can allow you to see that God is the only logical explanation.

       Like i was programmed from birth to 12 yr old to believe the jesus story and as such i can easily understand how people believe it. But flat earth? I thought all flat earth people were just trolls. I would love to hear explanation of why u think thats possible.

       If people know they were on a flat earth with a barrier they wouldn't escape and there was no such thing as outer space they would seek God.  The reason they do it is to hide God from people so Lucifer wins and drags souls to hell.  I didn't believe in God until I figured out fake space/flat earth.

       As silly as it sounds there is a Futurama episode where "God" is basically just that. I've always felt the same way to be honest. I'm not religious in the conventional sense, but I find what you've described to be the most plausible answer. We are all just star bits after all.

       If your sources fed you all this, none of which came true ..

      <p>
       Did you re-evaluate your sources? "It's happening, soon" has been happening for a long time. Part of the conspiracy crowd lives and flogs this whole imminent catastrophe shit, which never seems to happen.

       Lucifer is the "god of this world" that's why the elite worship him and do blood ritual and sacrifice children for him.  They do it and receive power here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had the same reaction about Santa.  That's exactly why the Vatican adopted that pagan nonsense and mixed it with their false version of Christianity.  It sets little kids up to reject Jesus from a young age (Fool me once parents!).
