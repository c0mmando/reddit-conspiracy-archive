        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Understanding history and reality in the Brave New World of 2018</p>

<p>Verity is defined as the state and quality of being true, especially one of fundamental importance, a principle or belief. Before the advent of YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and the costs of publishing information declined it was easy for the “winners” of history to control the truth. As cameras and monitoring technologies became more prevalent in society the control of information and narrative has become difficult for those with historical power to control and manage.</p>

<p>They say time heals all wounds. When it comes to conspiracy theories time proves our understanding of the present moment is distorted by our historical conditioning and perception of our underlying reality. I have always followed the path of “what you see is what you get” and I would like to share what I see about the QAnon phenomena that has spread throughout the internet over the last three months.</p>

<p>Online messaging has been around for a while. Most of my generation understand yahoo and aol chat rooms. 4chan and 8chan is an online message board similar to reddit and old AOL chat rooms where people communicate anonymously. Most of the conversation isn’t suitable for the dinner table let alone a wide portion of the population.
<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/09/25/absolutely-everything-you-need-to-know-to-understand-4chan-the-internets-own-bogeyman/?utm_term=.2f745e879bbc">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2014/09/25/absolutely-everything-you-need-to-know-to-understand-4chan-the-internets-own-bogeyman/?utm_term=.2f745e879bbc</a></p>

<p>At the end of October someone or a group of someone began posting cryptic information in an organized fashion about many open conspiratorial issues as it relates to the “New World Order” “Cabal” “US Government Corruption” “International Banking” “Military Industrial Complex.” The information was open source and anyone with enough time on their hands could put the narrative together.</p>

<p>What was interesting is the Q posts inferred the United States Government fully understood this and was on a path to “clean up” the mess. Events in Saudi Arabia in November brought a significant amount of attention to the message board. Trumps deplorables and pizzagate investigators began to review the information and investigate and spread the news. By the end of November and throughout December more “truthers” and people who make money covering conspiratorial issues (InfoWars, etc.) began covering it.</p>

<p>Some of Q’s posts and various symbols started entering into the Presidents Twitter account which fueled further speculation. Independent researchers scoured pacer.gov and identified over 9,000 sealed indictments were issued between November and December and typically the number is 1,000. Donald Trump signed an executive order providing authority to seize assets of human traffickers.</p>

<p>The military met with Republican leaders at camp david the first weekend of January. The slow trickle of release of public information through the month of January 2018 has been nothing short of remarkable in favor of a reality Q describes in his cryptic posts. The news cycle is struggling to come to grips of a lost manufactured narrative as a new one has developed based on real objective information.</p>

<p>Q is likely not the United States Government. If Q is the United States Government remember it is currently controlled by Donald J Trump and one must remain skeptical of all information from all sources we read because of the underlying bias and agenda. What is great about the conspiracy phenomenon is the Government will never come out and tell us if it really is them or not.</p>

<p>I believe there are more good guys than bad guys. I believe the truth always wins and in the 21st century powerful individuals are learning the hard way they will not be able to hide the truth like they used to. One would hope the “good guys” in the United States government would aggressively try and restore a sense of rule of law at the highest levels before a complete breakdown of society into a lawless state percolates through to the masses.</p>

<p>2018 is going to be a Great Awakening for many and that is a good thing. We cannot run from the truth and we cannot hide behind conspiratorial labels any longer. As we allow people to be free of Plato’s cave humanity will achieve feats beyond our imagination. QAnon is one tool of many to free the shackles of mental bondage to a manufactured narrative to control the masses.</p>

<p>Keep your head up. Don’t believe everything you read (weather anonymous or cited) and keep an open mind as things develop. It is going to get very weird for many people and they will need support, not, told you so.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need some larp to lead our &quot;revolution&quot;. Everyone is sitting on their ass waiting for what this guy is going to say next, instead of being active in exposing the elites. That&#39;s probably one of the intentions of the Q psyop, to subdue our resistance and make us be &quot;reactive&quot; to whatever he/she says. </p>

All the intel reveals have been planned and synced for maximum citizen awakening, we are just watching the play. My thought is military (Navy) Intelligence became last/lonely untouched constitutional protector and from there formed counter moves. I read a military coup was discussed as things so bad if Trump didn&#39;t play. Us citizens kept ignorant and shielded from raw political power. </p>
