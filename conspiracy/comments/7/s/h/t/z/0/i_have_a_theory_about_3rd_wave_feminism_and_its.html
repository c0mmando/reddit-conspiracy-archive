       I wonder if the Pentagon wasn't secretly encouraging all of these cultural clashes, one as an element of the
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left%E2%80%93right_paradigm">
        left-right paradigm
       </a>
       but also in an effort to bolster the recruitment potential of women into combat roles in order to compete with the massive numbers that can be fielded by countries like China.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also deconstructs traditional values that will ultimately lead to the preeminence of the state under the guise of protection of everyone in the name of equality.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also wonder if its designed to eliminate the masculine nature of aggression... that is to say the reduction of the possibility of revolution against state control. A passive, feminised society can be more agreeable and malleable, potentially.

       I agree with a lot of that. Mostly the bit about feminizing out aggressive males, who could potentially challenge their power.

       I laid out some talking points in my description above. I'd love to hear any thoughts you might have about that points I've raised.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've been very happily married for nearly two decades - so having sex with a woman isn't really at the top of my priority list, outside of my relationship with my wife.
      </p>
      <p>
       I assume you are referencing organizations like 'Men Going Their Own Way'. I believe those organizations have real problems that need resolving, that can largely be attributed to what you've described... a deep resentment at the rejection they've faced.
      </p>
      <p>
       That has nothing to do with the talking points I've raised.

       You are on to something but I don't agree it's the pentagon. I think it's much bigger. Check out Eugenics. Agenda 21. Mkultra. The Purpose of refugees flooding Europe. Then pentagon becomes a bit player. People with Lots "big" money been puppet masters for years. You are in for a hell of re-education

       From what I have read it was for cheap labor. I have no idea if that is accurate, but it made sense. I’ll link the article if I can remember where I read that. It was an interesting overview of the geopolitical landscape of the times.

       I meant the governments letting them in, that was their motive. The article I read was specifically talking about Germany's reasons for allowing them because they needed to get cheap labor but it backfired pretty bad. As you stated, they are for the most part unemployable. Either unwilling or unable.

       Dig. It's not a good thing. Big Pharma a part. Controlling the narrative another. Eugenics another. I can see that there are very wealthy people sitting around a 007 evil collaborators table and say things like: "if we blow up the only pharmacy plant in Africa and then flood Europe with refugees the EU will have to pay us for their drugs".

       A start for you, MSM here in states said it was a baby formula factory other readind it was Aids drugs (can't find that reference any more?- Google has selective memory.) others you are on your own digging. In general a win-win for big pharma. A post on 4chan by Pharm anon(?) was eye popping.

       If you inject more and more people which can't be employed they have to be financed by the social state while decreasing the finance base. What do you think will happen? Makes them a good scapegoat too.

      <p>
       If you import people with lower IQ as part of an
       <em>
        eugenics
       </em>
       operation it lowers the population IQ of the next generation either by the "expected" mixed populations or by adding their ethnic population to the pool.

       Read the
       <em>
        whole
       </em>
       paragraph on "Views on race and religion". Here you find the eugenics program.

       This guy is the honoured

       of the EU state and they give out EU prices in his name.

       The end goal here is a population with completely destroyed ethnic/national identity and lower IQ and an overseer class running the farm/empire.
      </p>
      <p>
       About civil war. Well, if you inject a million of mostly young males with either war training or who are used to violence into a passive population of people who aren't used to violence for several generations you increase tension. The body count is continuously rising of people killed by this imported violence. When is enough enough for the local populations? This is all engineered and no accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       These people could also be used as a "civil" mercenary army by the group which wants to build their EU Empire.

       Why can't these individuals be employed? Where is the proof that the individuals coming into Europe are low IQ? Where is the proof that all the young male refugees have war training? Still not sure how new immigrants destroy national identity. I'm from the US, we have new immigrants all the time. I've never felt a threat to my national identity. Why would Europe be so much more fragile in the same regard?

       Because they lack the education and/or cultural compatibility to be employed. The unemployment of immigrants is far higher as they create sub cultures/colonies than assimilate. If you import mostly uneducated people this will lower the IQ as the ambitions/mentality is lacking to adapt and progress. These aren't highly educated Iranian families.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the whole Hollywood trope of the immigrant in the USA which put all his energy to advance in the new society against all odds and make it simply does not apply.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are enough political incorrect studies about IQ differences out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because Europe isn't the USA which has a mixed ethnical and "racial" population for centuries with no real uniform identity outside of what the TV tells them what it means to be a political correct American unless they come from a local environment with a strong identity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Europe is not the USA and I truly hope it never ever will become "it".

       Huh. Sucks you seem to be having so much trouble in middle europe. I live in western europe and in the "hood" of my city. Lots of new immigrants and POC. I, honestly, don't think ever noticed any sort of cultural strife. People just seem to be people. I think the generally welcoming attitude helps.

       Yep yep. It’s a tough pill to swallow but the truth sets you free.. it’s much easier for me to realize why we have so much suffering.. we have it because somewhere someone wants it that way. It’s that simple.

       So I am a Christian, work to help other people....more money in war, war contracts. Live in big town with big military base. Take away military $, military retirees $, G I Housing $. There would be nothing. Last year a poster "High Leval Insider" who was pointing a way out of war/misery based economy. I hope his ideas pull through. If interested search for High Level Insider and Space Elevator. Happy hunting.

       I think a lot of it is a continuation of the “race wars” that were so heavily promoted over the last several years. That wasn’t good enough, so they added in the female vs. male aspect. Further dividing us into manufactured hate groups. This is how I have always viewed the movement, as a female.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could be to bolster military numbers, but I don’t really see that panning out. Maybe it is and I just haven’t seen it because I haven’t paid attention. I can’t recall if the law was passed to add females to the draft, but I remember it was up for discussion a few years ago. I would have to research that a bit more.
      </p>

       Destroying the nuclear family is also plausible. The state would rather be the daddy taking care of every need, that way they can take even more money from your pockets. It is built in job security for big government.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I have seen just in daily life is females starting to take on more of a masculine look with fashion, hairstyles, and behaviors. And males starting to become more feminine in fashion, hairstyles, wearing makeup and overall behaviors. It strikes me as odd, but it could just be current trends that stand out to me because I am older.

       No person who can expel some whole other person from their nether regions is passive. Takes a whole lot of strength to squeeze out the next-generation.

       You are suggesting that no woman can be passive?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also - I didn't say women were passive, I described a more feminine society as being passive. By manner of being more agreeable - which women generally are.
