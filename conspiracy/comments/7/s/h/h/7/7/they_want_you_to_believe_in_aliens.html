       Not saying you shouldn't believe in them but just understand this. I have a young boy so I see what kids shows on TV display and if you guys take a look at them you will see a lot of shows features aliens and robots. It's a recurring theme in children's TV shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       My best guess is that sometime in the future they will try and pull off an alien contact situation that will be a false flag but will have a huge impact. I think the whole UFO conspiracy is a controlled conspiracy. They influence people to look into it through Hollywood movies and TV shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for all the robots I feel like that's a no brainer why they are in all kids shows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just something I think people should be aware of in case you weren't already.

       predictive programming, so when they do roll out these advance AI robots and "alien" beings (genetically modified humans), that people will accept it as the norm because they have been conditioned by said programming. You'll find all kinds of things hidden in plain sight like this because that's the easiest place to hide is out in the open and as long as you can have the population play it off as a joke or that only happens in Hollywood kind of thing, these puppet masters can trick us into believing whatever they want.

       Yea your absolutely right. This world is a nightmare because of these people. I can't believe people have let this slide decade after decade of Hollywood trickery. Just look up what Hollywood is. It's a type of wood used to make wands for black magic. Another thing that's just in plain sight.

       I'm critical and questioning of most everything, but your claim about Hollywood being used for black magic is relatively erroneous. That plant has tons of uses and has been used since oh I dunno.... fucking Christmas, druids, tea, literally tons of uses. That's about like saying cotton is used in black magic therefore cotton is evil because they use it to make robes.

       Everything you said is true yes, but I don't think they named it Hollywood because they enjoyed tea. Bohemian grove for example.

       And we have a winner, upvote for you good sir.  Fictionalizing Fact is exactly what they are doing.  Keeps it fringe.  The effort even here is astounding.  There a concerted effort to keep this topic fringe and uninteresting, even in the dark corners of the internet like here.  I wonder why that is?

       Hmmm, well i've noticed there seems to be a kind of 30-year cultural cycle, that rotates through :-
      </p>
      <p>
       Zombies---Aliens---Werewolves
      </p>
      <p>
       Each phase is 10 years and we've just recently transitioned from zombies to aliens, not literally though.
      </p>
      <p>
       This extends across cultural boundaries, which is why there is a real 80's feel right now.

       I understand your point and I am totally with you in regards to the soft disclosure that you are talking about. 
Nonetheless imho is it very important to distinguish between soft/partial disclosure (poor mislead Tom Delong, CIA &amp; Co), which will be used as a distraction from what is gathering on the horizon, and full disclosure (Wilcock, Salla, Goode &amp; Co), which could be the nail in the coffin of the global elites. Which again could be triggered by the soft disclosure. 
At least this is my position at the Moment. But in times like these, I guess, to find the truth we must feel inside and find the things which resonate the most with us. Listen to yourself more than to anyone else.
Much love to you all.

       I know reading is hard for some of you children, but I hope you grow up someday. If you ever decide to give a fuck, read some of the literature on aliens. Or stay an ignorant twat- if that's what you choose there's nothing I can do about it, is there?

       I've spent years on this subject; you won't regret spending a couple hours on it. But here's an even shorter, very recent, article by Dolan:
       <a href="https://www.richarddolanpress.com/single-post/2018/01/01/The-Pentagon-and-UFOs-Assessing-the-Revelations">

      <p>
       And here's one that people on here would like. We can't formally prove the existence of ET's, but we can make a very compelling case that the government takes the issue very seriously. This is twelve documents that prove that the U.S. government takes UFO's extremely seriously:

       Jacque Valle made an apt suggestion detailing how he believes some 'aliens', like the Grey's and reptilian are the demons of antiquity. Lots of interesting comparisons and correlations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, I do think the alien agenda is a psyop to a certain extent. However, I think TPTB want us to believe the "good aliens" are actually bad, and vise versa. It's also interesting to note that these "aliens" could very well be on earth already. There is no information that states they come from outside of our planet. Sure, there have been anomalies outside our planet, but space is large and I doubt there are just a few alien species.

       Thanks for chiming in. Yeah, the theory that Vallee subscribes to- and I know this is part of the picture because I've smoked DMT and encountered transdimensional aliens- is that, yes, it's terrestrial. "There are other tenants in the building," as Terence McKenna put it. There are so many reports of UFO's flying in and out of the ocean that a book was written about it. MUFON gets 30,000 reports a year in the U.S. alone. I live out in the mountains in Colorado, and it seems every other person here has had an alien encounter. I don't think they're flying in from Zeta Reticuli or something... maybe, maybe some have, but the overwhelming evidence indicates a transdimensional non-human intelligent presence here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the psy-ops around aliens are many, many layers deep. You might be right; well, I definitely think you're at least partly right because religious fanatics often propose that DMT beings are "fallen angels"- spawns of Satan. I can tell you the opposite is true. But since psychedelics are still extremely illegal, only a small percentage of us have had these types of alien encounters. I've had it, and the number is growing fast, fortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
       My conclusion is: humans are a proxy war. There are "good aliens," perhaps which had to do with our creation, which are doing things like creating psychedelics to help us find our way. And there are some very evil creatures- the Gnostics called them "archons"- who want us dead, because we threaten their existence. And probably a lot of other beings like the tall whites that are often reported. But the very good and the very evil ones I'm certain of.

       Great summary. 
I think the elites are in cahoots with the archons, primordial beings that existed well before earth. Colorado has a lot of natural caves, many DUMBS (deep underground military base) are located there. It wouldn't surprise me if they take advantage of that and hide there, or may well even conduct research side by side with humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your point about them being trans, or inter dimensional is spot on. They're not physical. It's a spiritual phenomenon that is contorted into being  solely a physical. I think there is also a conspiracy to keep the average person unaware of the spiritual realms, which is why psychedelics are generally illegal. It's earlier to smoke dmt, drink ayahuasca, or eat mushrooms than it is to learn now to project your consciousness in the same manner. I've never tried dmt but I can astral project, and I've met many of these entities. Not all of them are bad. Not all are good. Some don't care.

       You are *right on! Good to meet someone so smart and intuitive. That's fascinating about the astral projection. I have no such skills, but I can get to hyperspace and encounter intelligent beings through DMT, I'll tell you that- and so can almost anyone. I have hundreds of DMT/alien stories saved, by the way, which I often share on reddit. It's the alien subject that people can most easily relate to.

       You know what's up. This is the deep knowledge. Humans are in a fight for our lives. We have to get over these silly divides like race and sex and so on and recognize our common *humanity. If we do the future could be breathtaking; if we don't there won't be a future for us.

       I use to be a huge UFO guy. Still am in a way. Just because I say its controlled doesn't mean it doesn't have loose ends. If you can't see that this is a controlled conspiracy than that's fine. But the longer you keep digging into conspiracy you get a broader sense of what's really trying to be hidden, what's being blatantly put out in the open, and what's being kept on a narrow path.

       There seems to be a big difference between our opinions.  From your context, you seem to believe the narrative is controlled to make people want to believe in them, because why?  You never really mentioned that.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the narrative is controlled because it keeps these beings and their influence on this planet separate from the world hierarchy.

       They are not extraterrestrials as they would have you believe. Even some mainstream scientists describe them as not being extraterrestrial, but "inter-dimensional". They are DEMONS. Research the work of Gary Bates.

       Aliens are the globalist's last resort. With no other options, they will stage a fake alien attack using unknown bomb technology developed secretly in North Korea. They will claim the new tech I'd alien, because it's never been seen before on earth. They will destroy a major city, and use the hysteria to poop the world's resources under one banner (one world gov't control) to 'save humanity'

       Unless this has been planned for decades to very slowly indoctrinate us over generations....which is possible.  I am going to go with Aliens and Robots in Childrens shows is because they are Outsiders that can be made as outsiders.
      </p>
      <p>
       Evil Robots in children shows makes sense since you can "kill" robots in children's shows without issue.  They make great "Bad Guys"  Think back to the cartoons you watched as a kid...how many people died of violence in those shows...and how many robots were destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aliens same kind of thing.  One can make them whatever they need for the situation.  Especially today Aliens and Robots can be used without as much worry issues around Race.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robots and Aliens have been re-occuring things in Television pretty much since Television existed.  They are both classic tropes of literature.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would rather worry about aliens and robots than with what is on European TV's right now.

       I definitely see what you are saying and I agree with most of it. But these shows I'm talking about are for a very young audience and the robots and aliens portrayed are always good guys still. I'm not talking about shows for 6-12 year olds I'm talking about shows for 2-5 year olds.

       No, they want the deadly serious UFO/alien phenomenon to be trivialized, something that belongs in movies, so that we don't take a good hard look at it. If you do take a good hard look at it, you find that the evidence that there are many non-human higher intelligences among us is extremely strong. It's transdimensional, as Jacque Vallee put it. The other fantastic researcher to check out is Richard Dolan, who wrote "UFO's and the National Security State."

       I see it as Hollywood trivializing it with movies like ET (etc.); that's my perspective. With the incredible amount of UFO sightings and the common sense question of "are we alone?" always on the collective mind, this isn't a subject that the powers that be could ignore; they have to try to control it instead. Making it all a big joke is a very effective means of doing that. Plus, the bullshit artists out there muddy the waters, and busy people don't know where to look for the truth, but if you're willing to put the time in, there's a very compelling case about a whole bunch of incidents, starting with the Phoenix Lights. Richard Dolan is the number one researcher imo for distilling the juicy cases from the bullshit, and also

       The desire is to separate God from the equation. The truth, is that God/angels/ufos are not so far removed. They want it to be green men, evolution, no God, no spirit, no soul. Green men (or otherwise) flying ships have souls, and a creator. Those ships may even be non-physical, in many cases. There is a reason there are renaissance paintings with ufos. God/spirit and science are one. The picture gets bigger and bigger, but all leads to the ultimate truth being God/creation. Of course the program ancient aliens would say the texts are wrong. They aren’t. The exoteric paintings of little cherubs brainwashed us for hundreds of years. The real depiction of angels was always esoteric; yet they still depicted them in art. When you study ufos, relate the concept to spirituality and God/Entities. If you leave that out, you’re buying disinformation.

       Great summary. 
I think the elites are in cahoots with the archons, primordial beings that existed well before earth. Colorado has a lot of natural caves, many DUMBS (deep underground military base) are located there. It wouldn't surprise me if they take advantage of that and hide there, or may well even conduct research side by side with humans.

       Your point about them being trans, or inter dimensional is spot on. They're not physical. It's a spiritual phenomenon that is contorted into being  solely a physical. I think there is also a conspiracy to keep the average person unaware of the spiritual realms, which is why psychedelics are generally illegal. It's earlier to smoke dmt, drink ayahuasca, or eat mushrooms than it is to learn now to project your consciousness in the same manner. I've never tried dmt but I can astral project, and I've met many of these entities. Not all of them are bad. Not all are good. Some don't care.

       The bible says that Satan transforms himself into an angel of light and his servants are ministers of righteousness. Any experiences you have with DMT are of course going to be god like.
