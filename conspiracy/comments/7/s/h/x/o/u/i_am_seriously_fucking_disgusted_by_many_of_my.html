    <div class="md"><p>He is saying there was a movement of people critical of the horrendous Bush foreign policy. His  and the neocon criminal actions led to a new anti war movement (even though that movement was suppressed, censored, and not televised in the states). Where are these people now? The centrists and corporate whores have tried to slander and ostracize the anti war people by atracking them with their anti Russian propaganda. We need to hear from these people now and we need more to join in.  They are afraid of being labeled by the empty establishment shills.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I watched it in my circle of friends. They were fed up with the war crimes and overreach by the Bush admin, and believed Obama would be the solution. Then when I would bring up how Obama was continuing the same surveillance practices, even expanding them, they would sheepishly agree, but tell me how they couldn&#39;t criticize Obama because it would weaken his position. Fuck, the only things he really got accomplished in office were the bank bailouts and the ACA, both of which were pretty bad even from the (actual) left&#39;s perspective. </p>

<p>The same thing&#39;s happening with Trump and the conservatives to a large extent. They&#39;re excusing the same shit they&#39;d be up in arms about if Obama or Hillary were doing it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is huge problem. Nobody wants to criticize their team and it fucks over all of us. If Obama had done so many of the things Trump has done his supporters would be up in arms, calling all kinds of names but when its Trump they spin it into some ridiculous narrative. Obama supporters did the same.  People identify way too much with political parties because they are so used to being attacked. The atmosphere is toxic. I wish we were all independents and made our decisions based on policy and not emotional tribalism.</p>

<p>do not blame them.</p>

<p>In an ideal world, maybe.</p>

<p>But in reality, it happens like it did after the German people lost WW2.</p>

<p>Do you think the Soviet Army cared that the average German &quot;didn&#39;t know anything&quot; or &quot;I was just following orders?&quot;. Nope. In East Germany, thousands of German civilians were summarily executed, forced to allow themselves to be run over by tanks, sent to labor camps, etc.</p>

<p>You might technically not be responsible for what goes on in your name using your tax money, but the rest of the world will hold you responsible if/when the time comes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not sure how reading a newspaper counters being apathetic.</p>

<p>Reading a newspaper does the opposite for me, personally I spend more time reading between the lines and piecing together the motive for the spin than the article itself. How I wish for articles offer more than one side of the story, rather than sticking to the official press release (agency) explanation of an incident.</p>

<p>My apathy comes from not having the time or finances to do anything significant about it. Sure, I might send an email/letter to local representatives expressing my concerns over new legislature, but beyond that I don&#39;t have time during my week to start/attend some sort of advocacy or awareness group or attend a protest/rally for a week or more half-way across the nation (where it matters), or bare the financial burden and uncertainty of advancing a civil rights suit on unconstitutional laws.</p>

<p>I have a decent job, but I still need to work extended hours to make ends meet <em>and</em> have enough set aside for my family&#39;s future <em>and</em> to prep for unexpected costs of living. I&#39;m not eligible (nor would I apply for) low-income support of any kind, and I lack a trust fund or any substantial financial assets to back me up in the event I fail.</p>

<p>The best I can do is to provide a bare minimum resistance until SHTF. That could be tomorrow, or several decades from now, but I&#39;m not willing to bet all I have on it being tomorrow and only being able to keep up the good fight for a couple months before I&#39;m on the street.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yep. That&#39;s the apparent apathy I&#39;d present in person. It&#39;s like betting your house against <em>the house</em>. It&#39;s something you just don&#39;t do unless you&#39;re at rock-bottom or have a good reason to place your bets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not one to bring about the next revolution, but I will participate in it if it happens in my lifetime. The big question is <em>when</em>. If I were to jump the gun, nothing is gained and everyone I love suffers as a result of it.</p>

<p>If it were just my own personal sacrifice, I wouldn&#39;t have much trouble with it. In the event you think you have something going that will have substantial impact in saving/reforming the country, let me know and I&#39;ll offer up my services if it&#39;s well thought out.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in agreeance here, I tend to be wary of such definites. If such a thing were to happen, I would look for the least impactful way to deal with my situation first and foremost. That&#39;s part of my &quot;Unexpected costs of living&quot; equation.</p>

<p>Health insurance can only do so much, if I were to receive a devastating diagnosis I would look into dedicating my condition to experimental research. Yes, it is typically funded by tax dollars, but I could be a considerable asset given that I have a basic competency towards physiology and microbiology.</p>

<p>That typically is a death sentence in itself, so I tend not to entertain those ideas until it has become a reality (and it has not). Rest assured, I do have a plan for the unexpected, as well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your answer, and applaud you for actually doing something.</p>

<p>However, the paradox here is that if you understand the game that’s being played, you want to change the rules, but if you TRULY understand the game, you know you CAN’T CHANGE the rules.</p>

<p>So the real question becomes: what’s the advantages of knowing? None. And In fact, there are disadvantages to knowing, such as fear, anxiety, depression, paranoia, feelings of hopelessness, etc.</p>

<p>What are the advantages of not knowing: you get to go about your life in the matrix, raise kids, have a family and be blissfully ignorant.</p>

<p>I’m not saying one is better than the other, I’m just saying that I’m not going to look down on people who do their best to find peace and happiness somewhere in this shit life regardless of what’s going on around them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Who&#39;s moody? did you mean &#39;nobody&#39;?</p>

<p>Anyway of course it&#39;s naive. I merely pointed out that once somebody <em>know</em> then they will be much more likely to not enter the military etc. I am not saying that eventually everybody will know, also of course a lot of people don&#39;t give a shit about other people and want to join the military because they want to go kill somebody. </p>

<p>HOWEVER, I do believe those people can be either cured before they do any damage (i.e. in childhood) and or locked up. Imo psychopaths/sociopaths should be locked up (humanely though).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No no no I mean educating people to educate themselves on the local level. Learn about your local representatives and judges and all other elected officials. Our impact on the presidential election is minimal with the electoral college in place. But the elected officials start locally and work their way up. If we start paying more attention to who we’re appointing that’s effects who makes their way up the chain. 
Also, if the people realize they don’t always have to choose a Republican or Democratic nominee and vote 3rd party (Libertarian, Green, Independent or whatever) again, the peoples voice starts to get heard on the local level. </p>

<p>It all starts locally imo.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If I tell some random person about US foreign policy, how difficult or perhaps impossible it is to change legally, and how she benefit in some capacity, what is she supposed to do?  Spread the info and get ostracized?  Drop everything, go full revolution mode, and have her entire life burned away while threatening the safety of those around her?  Or just decide that shit happens and just try to control what is immediately important in her life?</p>

<p>I do feel that people should know machinations and effects of US policy.  But I do not think it is possible to put any such knowledge to real use without a complete breakdown of one&#39;s own lifestyle - a breakdown that would in most cases have to be initiated on abstract principles alone at this time.</p>

The fact that our government makes us all complicit in the torture, murder, abuse, and vile fucking treatment of other human beings by using our tax dollars to pay for it, our infrastructure to support it, and our manpower to do it...BUT...if you refuse to pay your taxes, refuse to be a part of the system as they demand, they will take all you have and throw you the fuck in jail.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m an Army veteran.  I feel disgusted for being a more involved part of the system than simple tax payer.  I just didn&#39;t realize until after I had joined.  Made it awkward when it came time to ETS and people would ask me &quot;what are you gonna do if you get out?! Do you have a job already?&quot; and I explained to them I was fucking tired of being used to hurt people who had done nothing to me or anyone else.  I was fucking tired of being used to protect corporate interests for the sake of private money and the elite.  I was tired of being a fucking slave.  I was tired of being a cog in the wheel of the greatest terrorist nation in the world who would rather invade, sanction, or support the enemies with money, training, and weapons of anyone willing to say &quot;We are going to run our country in our best interests, not yours.&quot;</p>

<p>It would be one of the only justifiable wars I can think of, taking out an authoritarian totalitarian oopressive dictatorship that if left alone will lead to a cumulative sum of death and suffering that would be more in total than if we were to just rip the bandaid off and get it all over with right now. </p>

<p>Just my take. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Genocide is never okay.</p>

<p>And if probably would be a mistake  to piss China off, not to mention Russia. </p>

<p>My former neighbors  adopted two kids from south Korea and have been there a few times.  There is no animus towards the north on the streets of South korea. They seem to think it is only a matter of time before Korea is unified. Let them figure it out.  Some people thought it made sense to invade Iraq and depose Saddam Hussein.  Invading Iraq was perhaps the biggest foreign policy blunder we have ever made. We handed the keys to the middle east to Iran. </p>

<p>We seem to make a habit of feckless foreign  entanglements.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a pacifist, but bombing people into submission on a preemptive  basis is never a good idea.  And air power alone does not result in victory. It never has. And north korea has lots of tunnels and hardened targets.</p>

<p>At taking North Korea would result in a massive artillery strike on south Korea&#39;s major population center.</p>

<p>A preemptive nuclear strike would never happen because the military will refuse to carry it out because it would be illegal.  It would also risk China deciding we need to be taught a lesson and nuke one of our cities.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, here&#39;s my perspective. </p>

<p>I am a second generation Korean American. </p>

<p>My father was orphaned by North Korean soldiers in 1953. </p>

<p>It would not be a genocide, not by any definition. </p>

<p>There are options other than nuclear war with NK. It is entirely possible to strike the nuclear sites or hit NK with a few EMPs. </p>

<p>China would not nuke the US over North Korea, that would cause automatic worldwide apocalypse. </p>

<p>You are vastly overestimating the military effectiveness of North Korea. </p>

<p>Just my view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sure, you could probably take the nukes out relatively quickly. <em>Probably,</em> meaning you still have to take the gamble that they&#39;ll be able to respond with at least a nuke or two to SK or Japan (much higher chance of success than hitting the US).</p>

<p>But you still have to deal with their massive army and artillery. Unless you can take out all of it simultaneously, they will respond and hit Seoul, killing tens of thousands if not more. Then, unless you want to just carpet bomb the whole place, you&#39;re talking about a prolonged land war that will make Iraq look like child&#39;s play. You know, the war that was supposed to take a couple of weeks. South Korea has been digging in and preparing for invasion since the end of the war. </p>

<p>Either way, you&#39;re looking at massive casualties, both for the US and any coalition soldiers and civilians of both Koreas. </p>

<p>Hardened targets can be brought back online quickly.</p>

<p>That hotheaded asshole moron Donald Trump won&#39;t  consider the presidential experience complete until he orders a nuclear strike.</p>

<p>North Korea has lots and lots of artillery aimed at greater Seoul.</p>

<p>They aren&#39;t capable of a sustained campaign but could inflict serious damage and kill lots of people in an initial bombardment.</p>

<p>I think decapitation the ruling Cadre is a viable strategy.</p>

<p>Once the leadership is out of the way, overwhelming humanitarian aid would sway the citizenry.</p>

<p>The big unknown is how rabidly anti American the people  who manage the bureaucracy are.</p>

<p>They could just be scared shit less of being executed by an anti air cannon at close range, like Kim did to his uncle for failure to applaud with sufficient enthusiasm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of complaining and yet nobody is offering any solutions.  Want to tell tbe military and government to stop its   business of war and imperialism? Good,  whats its alternative.  That what a military does.  Its made for war.  Not policing..war.  So then.  Fine you get your wish.  How mich do you want to reduce it by? 50%? 70%? Whatever.  So then what becomes of the sudden influx of people.  Where do they go? How do they get thwir education? Wjat jobs will be available to them? No answers? Ok.  Now then what happens when other powers see a sudden witgdrawl from thw U. S.  In all kjnds of volitle areas.  Areas they might have ir want to have a stake in? Hell what if theu decide they could make a move on auch reduced American military.  What do we do then? Answers? No? The truth is unless you have a large all encompassing view of everything, all you are doing is complaining. </p>

<p>And when all people do is complain, there are too many people. 
You either agree with things or not. Everyone gets pissed if they dont have things going good for them but there are people who thrive with things the way they are. 
Thats fine and dandy, but with too many people it becomes too easy to start yelling and throwing insults at people based on political beliefs,  to catagorize people because of what they do or have or believe.  Its easy because there is courage ib numbers. 
Hellaybe we need a good civil war.  Brother against brother.  Neighbor against neighbor.  Clan against clan.  And lets not forget race too.  We could just keep on killing until we cant.  How about that? Burn all them Republican Trump lovers and drown all them Democrat rats.  Sounds good doesnt it?</p>

<p>Well this was a rant and all i wanted to say was quit it with the shit talk and complaints and actually have a real world suggestion as to how to change how things are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Finally!
However forgive my own ignorance but what does TVA stand for? Also double bravo on the plug for trade schools. I am glad to finally see this as a resorting element of education.
Also, I do feel the military, not the general military as much anymore but certain branches should definitely be less active in certain places.  They have been fighting in situations that were self created by other certain groups within past administrations. I don&#39;t think there will always be an easy out there. It also can&#39;t be ignored that there ate other countries...other powers that will always be waiting for an opportunity. The world is not as large as it used to be and there are ideologies very different from ours that would happily replace ours. There are areas of the world that are hinged gateways to very volatile and hostile regimes. This is no joke. Unfortunately there are innocent people there. If I have to spell it out...communism is absolutely not compatible with us. Period. It was quite a bit less than a lifetime where this truth was tested. Don&#39;t think it won&#39;t be again. I&#39;m not saying we should be the aggressors but things will happen. Especially as resources continue to shrink. That&#39;s just truth.
It is true that the US is responsible for much of the troubled we see in the middle east, but that doesn&#39;t mean we just pack up. Hopefully the future will see things scale down much faster and in a way that brings peace. Humans are really at heart a violent species with peaceful intentions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennessee_Valley_Authority">Tennessee Valley Authority</a>. It was one of the New Deal programs put in place by FDR during the Great Depression to modernize and provide electricity to the Tennessee River Valley, which had been greatly effected by the Depression. It was a government funded infrastructure program on a pretty mass scale, one of several that were part of the New Deal.</p>

<p>As far as the military being necessary for the defense of our homeland, it&#39;s a bit moot at this point. We could cut our military to a tenth of it&#39;s current size, and no state actor would dare try to invade because we have nukes. Even if we didn&#39;t, trying to invade the US would be insanity. The real reason we have such a large military is because of force projection (and because of defense contractor lobbying). We use the military to cement our position as the de facto sole superpower, but China has been showing that soft power is actually more cost-effective to a large degree. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well said. And thank you for the clarification. Yeah the New Deal certainly changed things. It would be nice to think we could go there again but the world has changed too much.
I&#39;d also like to feel the same as far as China and Russia go, but I think only generations will solve that divide. We can think everyone is on board and work away making the money. At least, as I mentioned the resources become harder and harder to mine. The Northern reaches toward the pole is an area melting away allowing exploitation of its hidden treasures. There have be tensions there between Russia and the U.S. Easily quelled up till now... Food shortages, fuel shortages, economic disparities, mineral and solid depletion are areas we seem to be able to keep afloat of on our own soil, but they affect other less western countries more. We certainly can&#39;t help everyone. But I guess we will see how things pan out.<br/>
Of concern to me at home even more is the growing population and the rush to automation and the resultant lack of employment that will soon follow.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree. Sure it would be amazing if everyone was well educated on everything that happens within the realm of the government including military, taxes, laws, ext.  However some people work two or three jobs just to survive. Some people have mental illness, or physical illness and the wars of the elite are of the least concern to them. Some people (me) choose to use most of the valuable time they have with this one and only life doing things they enjoy and bettering theirselves. I wake up and I do yoga and meditate, enjoy a coffee on my balcony, walk my dog. Then I go to work. Then I come home and read a book spend time with my fiancé, do a puzzle, write a bit of the novel I’m working on. Make a nice dinner, and eat it and enjoy it with my fiancé. Call my parents, siblings, and grandparents at least twice a week. Find time to listen to music, take a bath, eat some chocolate. Not mention paying bills, going to the doctor, running errands, grocery shopping, going to the gym. Then and only then after all of that things that are important to me and my well being things that will matter when I’m old and don’t have many days left, memories I made and time well spent only after that will I spend my valuable time worrying about things that are out of my control. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>But we are all too busy hearing about what sensationalized thing Donald Trump&#39;s social media team, er I mean the president himself tweets in the news to hear about the really bad stuff. </p>

<p>It really blows my mind that the country is falling for this very obvious Trump red herring while some really nasty stuff is going on. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have no moral responsibility for what my government does. Is a slave morally responsibility for what his owner does? Or a child over their parents? </p>

<p>Our government is just made up of people, each with their own view of the world, their own ambitions and morals.</p>

<p>They are accountable for their own actions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well Balmorika, you must take into account the fact that everyone having your view (or a similar one) is what has allowed our government to get so off track, and stay that way. 
You have a somewhat valid arguement, except for the fact that you must consider that makes your thought process incorrect...we ARE responsible for our government, because we made it, pay it taxes all the damn time, and have given it the ability to have its own agenda. 
Just because it feels we are powerless over it at this point, or their decisions make you feel morally uncomfortable, does not mean that you are excused from America and the decisions that we make as a country. 
Thanks for your time. We are morally responsible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>1st of all, taxes are compulsory and you get locked in a cage if you don&#39;t pay, which is exactly why we aren&#39;t responsible for what our tax dollars pay for. Imagine a bully stealing your lunch money, then they buy a knife with that money and kill someone. You are not responsible for that, in fact, you&#39;re a victim. </p>

<p>Secondly, we didn&#39;t give our government free range and the ability to do whatever they want. We have a constitution designed to limit the power of government, precisely to protect the citizenry from this type of behavior. Even so, congress passes unconstitutional laws like the Patriot Act, and the NSA is violating our constitutional rights, but we&#39;re somehow responsible for that because we&#39;re happen to be born here?</p>

<p>We have a responsibility to be informed, and educated on our government, but we can&#39;t be held responsible for other peoples actions, which is the basic premise on which all this rests.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I respect your answer, and applaud you for actually doing something.</p>

<p>However, the paradox here is that if you understand the game that’s being played, you want to change the rules, but if you TRULY understand the game, you know you CAN’T CHANGE the rules.</p>

<p>So the real question becomes: what’s the advantages of knowing? None. And In fact, there are disadvantages to knowing, such as fear, anxiety, depression, paranoia, feelings of hopelessness, etc.</p>

<p>What are the advantages of not knowing: you get to go about your life in the matrix, raise kids, have a family and be blissfully ignorant.</p>

<p>I’m not saying one is better than the other, I’m just saying that I’m not going to look down on people who do their best to find peace and happiness somewhere in this shit life regardless of what’s going on around them.</p>
