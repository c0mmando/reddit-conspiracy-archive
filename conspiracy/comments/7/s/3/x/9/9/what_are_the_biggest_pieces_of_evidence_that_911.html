       9/11 is perhaps the most debated conspiracy of all time, i'm not sure i have ever seen a harder shilled topic in my life than this one, its like people's reality's will fall apart if this was proven to be true. This is also the one that personally lead me into becoming a conspiracy theorist, the common responses from uneducated masses to this theory is always "How could they keep it a secret" or "The government isn't capable of such a thing". So i was wondering what are the biggest pieces of evidence you've seen for 9/11 being an inside job? Like the biggest holes in the official government story

       No evidence that hijackers boarded those planes, lack of 757 wreckage contrasted with clearly planted evidence (bandanas, boxcutters, hijacker paper trails, etc), and impossibility of the phone calls when matched with the plane's speed and altitude at their official times.

       Tower 7. If it wasn't a controlled demolition then how did the fire even start? The fire leapt from the buildings that were allegedly hit by planes? Where is that footage? I'll believe that a plane hit the building, sure, there is video but if I am to believe that flame is hopping like that then I want to see it happen somewhere else and I want to see the video. I am not aware of the proximity to the towers and maybe it was flying debris but if I am to believe that a steel skyscraper can be taken down by just debris then what can't take them down? Apparently, explosives at the base like in 1993.

       Problem I have is that it's not evidence. It's just logic. Where's the evidence of something that someone, anyone, did something to cause it or cover it up. The smoking gun as it were.

       I just hope that things like this will open up people's eyes to the orchestrated propaganda trouble is that mainstreamers won't believe anything unless the MSM covers it. And they'll never reveal the bullshit things they say. Even after the fact.

       David Chandler is the high school physics teacher who forced NIST to revise their building 7 report. In that revision they admitted that building 7 achieved free fall acceleration for about 2.5 seconds. Chandler proves in a video that it was longer than that and NIST started their collapse clock later than they should have.

       This admittance of free fall says it all. For a steel framed high rise building to fall as if nothing was supporting it straight down is not possible unless every support column was severed simultaneously. There is only one thing that can do that and it's not office fires. This is why AE911 wants an investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Independent chemists have found evidence of a highly engineered thermitic material in dust samples. The use of this type of material would explain how steel was melting inside the rubble pile with extremely high temperatures for months after they collapsed.

       I don't like to theorize about exotic weapons or holograms and stuff like that because it is not necessary. I mention the nano thermite because I believe it is solid evidence of it's presence there. All you need to know is that all three buildings came straight down at or near free fall. That is an impossibility. When you watch the northtower collapsing video in a high resolution you can see that the amount of energy being released is far greater than you would expect from floors clanging apart. Multi ton sections are thrown upwards and outwards at 70mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just watch your way through Chandlers playlist, I also linked the paper on thermite. An interesting part of the thermite story is how ((they)) tried to say it was paint chips. The man they hired to analyze the dust and found it to be paint chips is the same guy who falsified ph levels of the dust analysis while he worked for the EPA.

      <p>
       Now that was more or less independent and not an official government body calling them paint chips, but you can see that there was an effort to confuse the red chips with paint.

       Thank you. I do not like the term truther. I can't say in words why I do not like it. It makes me feel like an outsider or part of a fringe group. Which in reality I am I guess and that reality is hard for me to deal with at times. Ignorance is bliss and there are days when I wish Smith could just put me back in the matrix.

       I personally was not into 9/11 theories until maybe 4 years ago. Watching the tower 7(a building I never even heard about) video changed everything. I can't say this is evidence but just what can change a persons perspective on 9/11. Tell them to spend an hour watching videos of all plane crashes in the history of the world. They will see thousands of pieces of airplane wreckage everywhere. Then ask them to find the same evidence for the plane crashes from news footage the day of 9/11. Tell these people to spend an hour to watch every steel skyscraper that has ever been on fire or hit by a plane in the history of the world. See if they find any that have collapsed(let alone at free fall speed and 3 in one day). Tell them to spend an hour watching controlled demotion of skyscrapers then ask if the 3 towers collapsing reminds them of anything. Tell them to read 2000's "Project for the New American Century" written by Dick Cheney, Jeb Bush and Donald Rumsfeld calling for a "new Pearl Harbor" to transform America.

       That's how I feel about it. There is just so much that doesn't add up. I remember thinking something was wrong with the story almost instantly when they said Osama bin Laden was behind it. I'm not saying he wasn't involved in some capacity but terrorists can't wait to take credit for the shit they do and before any real investigation had even started everyone was saying he did it and at the same time he denied any involvement. Of course, he could have been lying but I thought that was really weird. It was months before anyone claimed responsibility.

       For me it was the Pentagon attack, I can’t believe that a crappy pilot Muslim terrorist, whose sole purpose was to cause as much damage and destruction as possible would circle over the ridiculously huge target that is the Pentagon and then fly past circle back and dip to about street level to plow into one side, that is utter nonsense!

       Exactly.  Why not just dive right in?
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead, people may consider watching CIT's (citizeninvestigationteam.com) work on the pentagon.  They funded their own way there and did extensive interviews with thw cab driver, 2 pentagon police officers and a third one by phone who said he saw the plane flying over the building "and away".  With the rest of the testomony taken by witnesses there should be any doubt the plane never hit and instead, they had rigged the place to blow.

       1 month prior that exact side had been reinforced against "bomb blasts".

       Yeah, there’s a lot more to it, like you mentioned, the recent renovations to minimize that type of attack, the office and what they were working on that got destroyed in the “attack”.  But I figured just the fact of what that plane did, especially being right above the pentagon, if you look at an aeriel view of the pentagon, no one looking to attack it with a plane would do what that pilot did. NO ONE!

       The way the towers pulverized as they fell. They literally turned to dust from top to bottom.  But there were so many other things.... FEMA in town the night before, NORAD out of town that morning, no video evidence of a plane hitting Pentagon, a plane's capability to punch holes through the Pentagon, the Able Danger investigators who were in that section of the Pentagon,  the fact that WTC 7 fell at all, especially into it's own footprint at freefall, the rapid removal and destruction of steel beams from the crime scene, Rudy walking around outside (photo op) holding a hanky over his nose instead of being in his newly remodeled ($15mil) WTC 7 command center directing efforts,  the towers being leased 6 months prior despite needing extensive asbestos removal and internet wiring updating, Larry saying "we're going to pull it",  the firemen saying "stand back, this building is coming down",  Larry's video speaking in Israel about how new WTC plans were being drawn up in before the old one fell, the silencing of the air controllers, the military, the lady soldier at the Pentagon who walked out of her office through the hole made by the "plane" stating she smelled cordite, a bomb ingredient and that she saw zero plane parts anywhere... the list of things goes on and on.   It adds up to false flag.

       It wasn't hit by a missile.  What makes that fact in your mind?  The squiggle line in the video given to us by the perpetrators themselves?

      <p>
       Don't take the only "evidence" they give to you as fact.  If they really wanted to prove it, they wpuld release the 84 video tapes they confiscated that would confirm their lie once and for all!  Instead they hold onto them and hope the squiggly line is enough to convince you.

       Nonono. I understand it. That's not the point. I don't
       <em>
        accept
       </em>
       it without scientific evidence. Huge difference, I tell ya, huge difference. That's what
       <em>
        you
       </em>
       fail to comprehend.

       I'd
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       to see more buildings failing only partially and asymmetrically proving somehow that completeness and symmetry of collapse can be achieved without demolition charges. Bring it on! :)

       The official news and amateur videos have all been debunked as fake, like in the film "Wag the Dog". Watch "September Clues" on Youtube to see the startling evidence.

       Yeah, there’s a lot more to it, like you mentioned, the recent renovations to minimize that type of attack, the office and what they were working on that got destroyed in the “attack”.  But I figured just the fact of what that plane did, especially being right above the pentagon, if you look at an aeriel view of the pentagon, no one looking to attack it with a plane would do what that pilot did. NO ONE!
