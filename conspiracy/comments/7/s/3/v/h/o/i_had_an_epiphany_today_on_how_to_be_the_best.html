       I'm a music teacher. I tell kids "YOU ARE THE TIME KEEPER!" "YOU CONTROL THIS INSTRUMENT!", I am teaching kids the basics of how to use frequencies to change and touch the lives of others around them  by PRACTICING Arithmetic in Time and Space.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the metaphor and deeper symbolic mean in of that has been hitting me hard! We must use our bodies as INSTRUMENTS to be the KEEPERS OF OUR TIME. You must have a Vision about yourself in EVERY POSSIBLE WAY with regards to YOUR FUTURE SELF.
      </p>
      <p>
       How does every momentary thought and action affect your future? Every self-deprecating thought you have adds up throughout your life. In just living and USING the Instrument of your body, you must ask how those decisions that you make in your life affect that specific part of the body, or deal with that specific part of the body, trying to use your INCREADIBLE SELF-INTUITION and SELF-DIALECTIC to sort out how short term decisions effect long term results.
      </p>
      <p>
       So for instance, you made a new years resolution to get in shape--- but you've already failed because you must have a complete LIFESTYLE CHANGE, trying to Invision and plan what YOUR FEET are doing to be doing 1 month, 1 year, 100 years from now!! What mountain will you climb, what countries will you visit? What relationships will you be willing to travel to form?
      </p>
      <p>
       if you're a dog and you HAVE SEX with everything around you, you're going to have negative effects in the long term of your life. You must control you LOINS! Your Male and Female parts are sacred so don't give your vitality away just for the orgasm! Magic happens, Mercury happens when you appropriately use those genital technologies! Haha!
      </p>
      <p>
       Eating is a huge part of this. You could support your local sustainable food economy, uplifting farmers in your area and supporting a healthy stomach just by buying foods that are responsibly sourced. We live a poisoned food life collectively--- we need to be a type 1 civilization and figure out ways to cooperate together using project and value based Blockchain technologies (crypto currency)--- we work our asses off just to buy food that won't kill us!!!! It's insane!!! We can't even figure out how to grow food year round (WE will soon though with cooperatives and tech- HELP ME)
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a philosophical side of your gut, where you just have to have integrity, related to that steadfastness and the grounding philosophically represented by having some guts so to speak. YOU must take pride and BE YOUR OWN SAVIOR AND THRONE. Work in what you're passionate about and HAVE NO FEAR!
      </p>
      <p>
       It takes heart and compassion and love to have healthy relationships for people around you. All the momentary thoughts that you have with regards to how you feel about people around you those add up throughout your life. You get what you give with that regards, so send out love, compassion and Grace to others. HOW DO YOU SERVE OTHERS? HAVE HEART!
      </p>
      <p>
       BREATHE IN DEEPLY...consider breathing in LIFE, the chance to UPLIFT that you have which corresponds to the oxygen you just took in. Choose your words and actions CAREFULLY as you breathe in deeply and slowly... 
BREATHE OUT DEEPLY TIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT!
That breath you took in gives you an opportunity to DO SOMETHING WITH IT-- to say something uplifting to someone, to work collaboratively with a team on a project, or to just have a thought of SELF-LOVE...
      </p>
      <p>
       Your THROAT and your words are absolutely incredibly powerful to change people around you. You have this amazing technology in your throat with your voice that only you can express. You can create art with your throat and say convincing words of encouragement, that can literally change the lives of people. You can speak into your own life and change your life just by adding intentional words and speaking over yourself. Use you VOICE to share things that only you can share--- drop all the labels and supposedly subjective opinions you hold and use your INSTRUMENT to speak to the deeper, True-Self you that sits inside, witnessing your objective semi-subjective self speak words and labels over your life that act essentially like demons possessing your mind-- you should take your WORDS Seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       LOOK YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN THE EYES-- Every interaction you have you should be staring into the very soul of the person you're befriending--- witness their strengths and challenges. SEE THEIR NEEDS IN THEIR EYES!
      </p>
      <p>
       You must guard your thoughts and your mind, and not allow toxic information and toxic energy and people to come into your life and influence your mind. People want to change their lives, but they're not willing to change the thoughts that they have in their own heads. If you want to have integrity in your life you have to strategically plan what you are going to do with your life, and have a vision for your future.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally, the highest best version of yourself your true self is inside of you, waiting to be expressed--- not the you that is your name or your job or who you would describe yourself as being, but the spiritful you, the you that is connected to a higher creative power that allows you to be innovative and to change the world around you potentially. YOU ARE A SPIRIT HAVING A HUMAN EXPERIENCE, NOT A HUMAN HAVING SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES. If I'm truthful with you guys, I believe that every word we say, every thought we have uses languages that are vastly inadequate--- so we must utilize FREQUENCIES AND TIME with our body/instruments to USE your spirit APPROPRIATELY! --- These obsessions with politics and LABELS, our IDENTITIES, act like possessions over our SPIRIT! LET THE LABELS GO AND JUST DO YOU.
      </p>
      <p>
       Use that spiritual, deep true self and your ability to witness yourself through different timelines based on the moment to moment decisions you make to daily assess and SELF-DIALECT with your own vision of your future. Do this in JOY!
      </p>
      <p>
       You have all of these alternative timelines of your life that you could be taking moment-to-moment based on the decisions that you make and the thoughts that you have. So you need to decide every moment, is this decision that I'm making best for the specific area it is that I mentioned above, HOW ARE YOU USING YOUR INSTRUMENT?
      </p>
      <p>
       Philosophy is so vastly important to having a good life, and that's essentially what we're talking about here. You have to accept some qualitative value and input, not everything about your life can be this scientific formula, and in fact reductionism leads to misery on so many levels within both the individual and Society at Large. So, Use your instrument to create frequencies that RESONATE, and ENGAGE WITH YOUR OWN FUTURE!
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR:
I had a mental break on a live feed and these thoughts just poured out of my consciousness in front of a handful of my friends, but AI think this is just the beginning. DM ME IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE VIDEO. ITS ON INSTAGRAM LIVE, SO ITS GONE TOMORROW--- IM NOT AFRAID ANYMORE, LETS CONNECT.
I hope that I have given a little bit of practical direction for you guys!

       Hey, I sent you a message. Let's be friends! I also posted that video to YouTube just to save it (Instagram deletes stories after so many days)
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm just tired of being silent. As a part of this Epiphany, I just realized "you're just going to be who you are, and if people don't like it, then they never really mattered or cared for me anyway" --- so I'm just gonna talk about philosophies that help people and try to stay Apolitical with my posts. I believe real social change starts inside, philosophically with the Individual, that virility can share practices with others like lighting a candle one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would love to talk crypto currency with you! Please check out WWW.BACKFEED.CC That is a his opensource organization that has a plan to fund community projects with local crypto currency with the value based not on computer power, but logged volunteer/participant hours. So it's a VALUE BASED crypto-currency that can the bought into with Fiat for investment purposes but ultimately one would be speculating on the vitality and virility of these community-uplifting projects. So the speculation only adds to the communities ability to make more innovative projects. Please connect with me my brother or sister!

       Hey! I edited to post the YouTube link to the video. I found this app that can pull live feeds from your Instagram account, so I decided to upload it to YouTube so that I could keep it and sure to those that are interested.

       It means so much that you would just like to watch the video. Honestly, thank you so much!

       I agree with a lot but I have a sneaking suspicion this...reality is a lot more chaotic neutral than we want to believe. The EVIDENCE says it is. The worst people have it all. They have, at the very least, the most choices. Thus, they have the most freedom.

       Brilliant post, you've hit on a few really interesting points.  We have given up spiritualism for a more materialistic civilization which favours the body more than the mind. We the people need to take a step back and realise what is actually important.

       Right!!! Philosophy shouldn't guide the quantifiers that we place on everything in our life. So we've got to have a vision tied to our deep philosophies, related to our feet, our loins, our stomachs, our guts, our lungs, our heart, our throat, our minds and our spirit. This Epiphany is that we must use our bodies as INSTRUMENTS to resonate these philosophies, projecting the visions of our future-selves in our minds, stepping out IN FAITH with STRATEGY to implement REAL INDIVIDUAL CHANGE. like lighting a candle, one Individual influences another Individual, and then we get collaborative/collective change in peace and love and mutual benefit ect.

       I had to respond to this because it resonated with me so much. I would love to have a place on reddit where we can build each other up and talk of positives. I never post and always switch accounts to avoid confrontation. Some from me being negative but also other peoples negativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Right now I'm in a spot in my life of positive change. I struggle with the spiritual side of it even though I feel it but I can not define what it is.  I had a dream of being burned alive last week. It was very vivid and i woke up covered in sweat. Now I dont know if dreams have a meaning to just the dreamer or if its a human thing but I woke up tirrified and assumed it was a negative dream but according to google having this dream is a great thing, its like being reborn like a phoenix.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now I dont 100% believe that but am using it as fuel for the steps I have been taking of starting something that came to me months earlier. To actually do this project and not fall back to the program of younger me. That program is lazy and never happy and as op would explain it, a dog about sex. I am trying to write a new program for me of getting shit done, focus, and being positive to good friends and good anons online.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't have to be who we are now.  We can all change for the positive and escape this system of consuming bad food watching bad tv being nasty in real life and online.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thanks op

       I love you so much. That absolutely means the world to me. Dreams are really powerful ways that I THINK our deeper mind is communicating with us, a sort of inventory taking at a subconscious level. Sometimes symbols can speak so clearly to us, and a dream is a symbol and especially THAT kindof a dream. Well please do connect with me at some level. I need new friends that are like-minded and want to be better people.
      </p>
      <p>
       What you mentioned about negativity is HUGELY IMPORTANT. So we Infest our minds with negative media and mentally fight so hard with our EGOs to keep holding close to these LABELS we place ourselves, the cultural identities that latch onto us like people thinking of a demon latching onto a person, like these labels possess all your thoughts. I decided yesterday that I'm done worrying about that, and I'm going to JUST DO ME.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to connect with you and with others like you who want to be the best version of themselves that they can be. We should start a community of uplifting words and POSITIVE INDIVIDUAL CHANGE.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yesterday the weight of my self-policing reached a point where I got out of this VERY intense hot yoga class and just had this awaking that I need to be FEARLESS and have integrity in all of the aspects of my life that correspond to different areas of my body in both metaphor and in the physical.

       I found this app that let me save the livestream video, so I was able to upload it to YouTube. I just needed to save this experience that I had live. I've never even went live before, and just had this experience in front of people haha. It was nuts but amazing.

       What a great and positive post. Haven't been here much in the last few days, and I pull up conspiracy and find this, thank you!

       Personally, I've been struggling with truth seeking. I've been digging around trying to find fact based sources, without much introspection.  While I don't think my time looking for truth is a waste, your post does remind me that looking inward to gain positivity (and to spread that positive message) is just as important. Balance. Can't watch the video at the moment, but will try tonight. Nice message to start the week!

       Many people make this mistake, but it is especially disheartening to see a "teacher" make it.

       I hear and feel these sentiments in myself and like minded individuals around me. Its uncanny how some of these concepts/ideas have been talked about almost word for word with a friend and I. It is really awesome to see more and more of this lately. I am going to show this to my friend tomorrow. Thanks for sharing your thoughts/soul!

       Very welcome, I have things to ask about music and vibration, and some stuff I would like you to see if you havent, but I would be able to share links starting 6 hours from now, before that I can only post out of my head, ask me anything about bitcoin or cryptocurrencies anytime, and keep up the good fight

       Right!!! Philosophy shouldn't guide the quantifiers that we place on everything in our life. So we've got to have a vision tied to our deep philosophies, related to our feet, our loins, our stomachs, our guts, our lungs, our heart, our throat, our minds and our spirit. This Epiphany is that we must use our bodies as INSTRUMENTS to resonate these philosophies, projecting the visions of our future-selves in our minds, stepping out IN FAITH with STRATEGY to implement REAL INDIVIDUAL CHANGE. like lighting a candle, one Individual influences another Individual, and then we get collaborative/collective change in peace and love and mutual benefit ect.
