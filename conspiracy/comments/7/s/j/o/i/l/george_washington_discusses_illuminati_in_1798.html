    <div class="md"><p>Lutheran minister GW Snyder wrote a letter to President George Washington, warning him about the Illuminati&#39;s attempts to infiltrate Freemasonry. He included a copy of John Robinson’s &quot;Proofs of a Conspiracy against All the Religions and Governments of Europe&quot; (found in Washington&#39;s personal library at his death). </p>

<p>Washington writes back that he&#39;s aware what&#39;s up, he knows they&#39;re in the country, but the Freemasonic lodges are on alert and he doesn&#39;t think any lodges have been infiltrated but they will stay vigilante. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You need to see the deeper context. It was explained <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/25xwbn/eli5how_does_a_group_like_the_illuminati_who_were/chlwa31/">here</a> by u/FreedomIntensifies</p>

<p>Some quotes from rather heated debate:</p>

<p>&quot;George Washington was in effect the chief intelligence officer of the USA and made the following observation (you can view the original letter which contains this quote online at the website of the Library of Congress)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It was not my intention to doubt that, the Doctrines of the Illuminati, and principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more truly satisfied of this fact than I am.</p>

<p>The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of seperation). That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects; and actually had a seperation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Here we have Washington describing vast influence of the Illuminati network in the American government. But it is more than that, we also are talking about countervailing Jacobinism and an ideological war within the freemasonic lodges playing out at the highest levels.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is saying they have spread. You are confused by the unusual use of commas as their usage has changed somewhat since then.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He goes on to talk about the spread of such principles, but objecting that their spread is not directed by the order as a whole but rather individuals within it.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.4plebs.org/pol/thread/115437268/#q115452405">Breaking it down:</a></p>

<p>He calls the Illuminati &quot;diabolical&quot; and the jacobins &quot;pernicious.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, diabolical might naively be interpreted as evil but it isn&#39;t obvious that it was Washington&#39;s meaning. As a very educated man, knowing that both Jesus and the snake in the garden are identified as the morning star, we might take the hint that in this case diabolical is simply meant to convey good aims taken with extreme cleverness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the jacobins who are unquestionably birthed from the established secret societies (freemasons) are described as pernicious which can only be interpreted as bad.</p>

<p>Then Washington goes on to tell you that the the founder (himself) had the principles of the illuminati so clearly that it was &quot;too evident to be questioned.&quot;</p>

<p>And what of the separation of the people from their government?</p>

<p>Well, if you are familiar with history at all and therefore know that mankind has been governed and trodden upon by secret societies (the actual government before the revolution) then it makes sense why the founder (Washington) had in mind a separation of the people from their government. </p>

<p>Washington even tells you that the American revolution was indeed a war against the old ways of the secret societies by saying,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in this Country had, as Societies, endeavoured</p>
</blockquote>

<p>that there was division within the ranks. Pretty much the only time you have seen this on any significant scale before was when Jesus started an insurrection against freemasonry 1800 years prior.</p>

<p><strong>So you can start to see how the Illuminati (origin 1776) was a psy-op by American intelligence (the real revolutionaries) to sow discord, confusion, and division within the ranks of freemasonry and therefore make possible the success of the revolution.</strong></p>

<p>Washington was later assassinated for this, showing conclusively that he was fighting them all along and they didn&#39;t know what had hit them until it was too late.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure what the &quot;media and such&quot; have made Freemasons out to be. It mostly seems like they ignore them, or at least marginalize them, particularly considering how many lodges I see everywhere. Every town has one, best I can tell. </p>

<p>I would really, really like to believe the Freemasons are good guys, but my personal experience from the corporate world is that the larger an organization gets, the more unwieldy it is to control and the more psychopaths sneak in. Then the more psychopaths you have, the more fucked up everything gets. </p>

<p>From best I can tell, Freemasonry splinters somewhere along the way between the good guys and the bad guys, and the bad guys keep moving up and good guys don&#39;t. But that&#39;s just from some reading and what a few people have told me. </p>

<p>So here&#39;s what I&#39;d like to know:</p>

<p>a/ Is Trump a Freemason?</p>

<p>b/ Is there a Civil War going on inside Freemasonry now, like there seems to be Civil War everywhere?</p>

<p>c/ What if I look into Freemasonry, go a certain way along the Path, but then decide I don&#39;t like it? That it conflicts with my Christian faith and I want out? Can I get out? </p>

<p>d/ Have you ever seen anybody walk out during one of the initiations or ceremonies?</p>

<p>e/ What percent of any police force in any town are Freemasons?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My apologies.  I haven&#39;t been on Reddit since that day.  </p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t tell you if Trump is or not.  But based on the way he is, it is more than likely that he isn&#39;t.<br/>
Masonry is a fraternity that is religion based but don&#39;t speak on religion in the lodge.  That and politics because that&#39;s how arguments start.  But we believe in God and pray and stuff but nothing worship like.  It&#39;s really a neat thing that give you a bond alone men.  If at any point you want to stop being a mason then you can.  No harm no foul.  I know of a lot of guys who just stopped going to the lodge.<br/>
If you decide to stop mid ceremony then yes you can and will be led out of the lodge room.  They won&#39;t be mad or anything because at the end of the day, it has to be of your own free will and accord to become a mason. We would prefer to have someone stop us and say no this isn&#39;t for me than to have us do the whole initiation and go through it half ass. 
No I have never seen someone stop mid ceremony and walk out but it could happen.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s some context you&#39;re missing here.  In the 1700&#39;s, the &quot;Illuminati&quot; was a very real thing.  However, it wasn&#39;t the whole &#39;let&#39;s take over the world&#39; type of organization that people equate with the term today.</p>

<p>The Illuminati date back to the mid-1700s, founded by a Bavarian professor at the University of Ingoldstadt named Adam Weishaupt. Weishuapt was a law professor, followed by an even higher honor of Professor of Natural and Canon Law. Unfortunately, he butted heads with the Jesuit priests of the University. Weishaupt’s world-views were more cosmopolitan and liberal than the bucolic, dogmatic views of the priesthood. In response, he created the Illuminati, a secret society eponymously promoting enlightenment as well as moral progress.</p>

<p>The priesthood, waging significant political power in those days, revoked his academic credentials and had him banished from the country. He moved on to Germany where he was better received and free to form the foundation of the Illuminati and its philosophy.</p>

<p>The mission statement of Weishaupt’s Illuminati was, “by the mutual assistance of its members, to attain the highest possible degree of morality and virtue, and to lay the foundation for the reformation of the world by the association of good men to oppose the progress of moral evil.”</p>

<p>Problem was, the Illuminati of Washington&#39;s era, was militantly opposed to any and all religion, going so far as to argue that any belief in a religion automatically rendered the person morally evil.  They would go to great lengths to attempt to demean anyone, or anything, which placed religion at its forefront.  Given his own personal religious beliefs, and the fact that the US was a very religious nation...it was only natural that Washington would be concerned.</p>

<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #7</p>

<p>7/27</p>

<p>J.M.:</p>

<p>This is from a small left-wing newspaper in Chicago (The RogerSPARK Chicago, July</p>

<p>1969, Vol. 2, No. 9: &quot;Daley Linked With Illuminati,&quot; no author&#39;s name given):</p>

<p>No historian knows what happened to Adam Weishaupt after he was exiled from</p>

<p>Bavaria in 1785, and entries in &quot;Washington&#39;s&quot; diary after that date frequently refer to</p>

<p>the hemp crop at Mount Vernon.</p>

<p>The possibility that Adam Weishaupt killed George Washington and took his place,</p>

<p>serving as our first President for two terms, is now confirmed. . . . The two main colors</p>

<p>of the American flag are, excluding a small patch of blue in one corner, red and white:</p>

<p>these are also the official colors of the Hashishim. The flag and the Illuminati pyramid</p>

<p>both have thirteen horizontal divisions: thirteen is, of course, the traditional code for</p>

<p>marijuana . . . and is still used in that sense by Hell&#39;s Angels among others.</p>

<p>Now, &quot;Washington&quot; formed the Federalist party.</p>

<p>The other major party in those days, The Democratic Republicans, was formed by</p>

<p>Thomas Jefferson [and] there are grounds for accepting the testimony of the Reverend</p>

<p>Jedediah Morse of Charleston, who accused Jefferson of being an Illuminati agent.</p>

<p>Thus, even at the dawn of our government, both parties were IIluminati fronts. ...</p>

<p>This story later repeats the Teenset report that Mayor Daley used the phrase &quot;Ewige</p>

<p>Blumenkraft&quot; during his incoherent diatribe against Abe Ribicoff.</p>

<p>Pat</p>

<p>ILLUMINATI PROJECT: MEMO #8</p>

<p>7/27</p>

<p>J.M.: More on the Washington-Weishaupt theory:</p>

<p>In spite of the fact that his face appears on billions of stamps and dollar bills, and his</p>

<p>portrait hangs in every public building in the country, no one is quite sure what</p>

<p>Washington looks like. A &quot;Project 20&quot; script, &quot;Meet George Washington&quot; will be seen</p>

<p>tonight at 7:30 on Channel (fill in by local stations). The program offers contemporary</p>

<p>portraits of the first President, some of which do not even seem to be the same man.</p>

<p>This is a press release sent out by NEC on April 24, 1969. Some of the portraits can be</p>

<p>found in Encyclopedia Britannica and the resemblance to portraits of Weishaupt is</p>

<p>undeniable.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Barbara called my attention to this: the letter in Playboy asking about the</p>

<p>Illuminati was signed &quot;R.S., Kansas City, Missouri.&quot; According to the Kansas City</p>

<p>newspapers, a Robert Stanton of that city was found dead on March 17, 1969 (about a</p>

<p>week after the April Playboy appeared on the newsstands) with his throat torn as if by</p>

<p>the talons of some enormous beast. No animal was reported missing from any of the</p>

<p>local zoos.</p>
