       Let’s not forget what the BBC covered up, all those claims of the royal family being involved with these horrible things are more likely than people want to admit.. I’m not from the UK so I’m curious to anyone from there how people reacted to this? Considering BBC is all tax payer garbage.. I mean news

       started a lay religious order with his wife and others called the Guild of St Joseph and St Dominic, and began wearing a girdle of chastity under a habit. His personal diaries describe his sexual activity in great detail, including extramarital affairs, sexual abuse of his two eldest teenage daughters, incestuous relationships with his sisters, and sexual acts on his dog.[46]

       yes in fact i did have a rough childhood, but more importantly i had a rough adulthood where i needed to relocate from the united states to china 6 years ago to find an equivalent position in finance law due to the fact that out economy collapsed and no one did shit
      </p>
      <p>
       one thing i have learned working in china is to give no fucks about any human being that is not me- they don't care about me and i don't care them- they could announce that the economic growth here is literally being caused by all the moloch satan bs you guys are always complaining about and i would not care one bit- kill as many kids as they need, fuck as many kids as they want- i have a job, i need to get paid- you know what giving a fuck about any of this shit does for me? nothing
      </p>
      <p>
       Let them do anything they want to kids, i don't care- i want a trade policy and international work visa system that will benefit me
      </p>
      <p>
       weirdos fucking kids in media companies doesn't matter at all- if you don't want your kid fucked don't send them to work in media or put them in sports as a little kid- otherwise they are going to get fucked, and i don't care

       Why the chip on the shoulder? Just because you’re jaded and don’t feel love you have to try to talk shit about other people? And what a shit head you are.. kids need to be protected.. I’m sorry if you were harmed as child, I wish I could have stopped that I really do.. kids need adults to protect them, not harm them. You might not understand because you don’t have kids.. but you judging you, you should probably never have kids because you’re a shit head.

       The Palace doesn't get a say in who gets what, they're recommended by the government. In the case of JS there were repeated objections to him getting the recognition despite the money he raised for charity. How he was able to get away with what he did for so long is truly bizarre and naive. He lived around the corner from me, it was an obviously damaged and creepy man who bragged about his antics.

       That's a fair comment. Still, providing links would have been good for the likes of myself. I'm from the UK so I'm unaware of how bad the NYT is. I've previously heard they were a reliable source though.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, like the OP, I've heard the same about the BBC &amp; know that's not true. It most definitely has the governement agenda at heart.

       Tbh if you're saying someone's uneducated, you need to back it up. Your comment was no better than a shill really, although I appreciate your standpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
       Admittedly, the BBC do still do some stellar documentaries. Outwith that; it's reality TV, shill ridden or bullshit soaps.

       I stopped paying a license for it years ago.

      <p>
       If anyone doesn't know, there is a 'TV license' that is imposed for anyone who watches live broadcasts. Before the internet, almost everyone in the UK was legally bound to pay for it. I've been a member of

       It explains why the NY times has been super pedo-friendly with articles like, "pedophila: why it's a disorder" (or sickness), can't remember exactly; the rhetoric was outrageous, though.

       So yes, pedophiles are evil, active or inactive.

       The headline (if it exists) didn't ask if Pedophiles were evil, it just acknowledged that pedophilia is a sickness.

       If you set fires, the act of setting fires is 'evil' and if you're an arsonist, you're probably also sick. One does not forbade or negate the other.

       Not really. I think people who sexually assault kids are abhorrent individuals who should rot in prison. I just think that those who have these urges, can’t help that they have them and never act on them, should seek help. I didn’t think that would be such a controversial opinion.

       I used to think BBC was a trustworthy news org. I am very skeptical of them ever since. It seems a lot of smarty pants Americans think think their credibility is unmatched. Maybe they get played by the posh British voices.

       BBC are the mouthpiece of the British government (don't pay attention to their "charter", the govt controls the purse strings). They are just as biased as RT.

       If you can't see the difference between BBC and RT, based on their structure and funding alone (whether you like it or not), you're blind. I'm not defending either but RT doesn't even pretend to not be a mouthpiece of the government. That's their

       RT is probably one of the most balanced and fair news sources i have found. Even Abbey Martin ,despite leaving for reasons of bias, said that RT had a higher standard in terms of balance. Ok they are biased toward russia but someones got to be no? Might as well be state controlled. And its open, fair views and nowhere nearly as underhanded  as British brainwashing cabal

       The British voice thing definitely has a lot to do with it. But if I'm home when my parents get home from work and they're watching the news I try to get them to watch BBC world news instead of the local American news which is full of car crashes, random deaths, and other stupid shit. BBC will cover some dumb stuff too, but a lot of their stories are far more interesting than local news

       The pedophilia runs deep in most elite families, politicians and government agencies. There’s a reason why things like this are continuously swept under the rug by all major news corporations... they’re all involved. That’s why they’re slowly trying to normalize pedophilia. There’s articles written by major American publications that actual victimize the “poor” pedos.

       Yeah the Disney thing has been happening for like 60 years. Subliminal sexual references in classic movies. And of course the modern hyper sexualization of kids. Fuggin disgusting. Remember when pre teens and young teens had awkward stages? Now 12 year old girls know how to do their makeup more professional looking than my 29 year old girlfriend ha

       Here’s one written by the New stork Times. I know the bbc has published some stuff as well and recently politician from the UK was outspoken about decriminalizing it. I couldn’t find that story on my initial search but I’ll look around more and post it. Here’s an article also where Theresa May wanted to allow convicted sex offenders and pedos to be able to adopt children.

       The Telegraph article is sensationalist. The study author doesn't say "pedophiles should be allowed to adopt", they say that all sex offenders should not get a blanket ban for adoption and instead should be judged case by case.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the NYT article is actually a very important case to make. People can't try to get treated and studies can't be done on non-offenders with pedophilic urges if the individuals have no protection. No, really, pay attention to what the article is saying
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Without legal protection, a pedophile cannot risk seeking treatment or disclosing his status to anyone for support. He could lose his job, and future job prospects, if he is seen at a group-therapy session, asks for a reasonable accommodation to take medication or see a psychiatrist, or requests a limit in his interaction with children.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       If someone who thinks they're attracted to children wants to see someone for help AND says they want to limit their interactions with children, they're being responsible and that's a behavior that shouldn't be discouraged. Otherwise is to say No, they should suffer it on their own, and no, they have to sit through interactions with children that make them uncomfortable.

       It's partly due to recent cultural and social changes IMO - where people have a right to be who they want and act how they want without fear of judgement. But what the media don't understand is that with the changes and acceptance of multicultural societies and more, it still doesn't make it right to go around fucking kids. It's damaging to the physical and emotional health of children. Being gay isn't the same, and that's why we accept it. It's a good thing. Same goes with gender, it is healthy for the mind to be able to choose who they associate with and who they love and twho they are, and it does not affect the lives of others, so why not let people have that choice? We cannot simply associate child rape with these things, ans that's exactly what the media seem to be aiming for. It's sickening to be honest.

       You’re 100% right about this. The normalization of everything at a rapid pace. It is a definite disservice to people who happen to be gay etc. soon pedos and people who identify as emu’s and Sara Lee coffee cakes will be on the same protected list as those other groups.

       Here is the deal. Yes they covered up Saville....AND MANY MANY MORE. The people he was connected to are the interesting parties. Saville was an open secret, so were a few others. Problem was a few people were getting too close to the real truth. Saville and co... and that whole period of time when old, practically dying celebs got put down was for a reason.Timing of their deaths are too. Why? Its in the title of this thread...It started with Mountbatten and who knows where it ends. ...

       These fuckers have dirt on everyone. It's how it works in their sick, sordid lives. 
Jill Dando was definitely murdered because of what information she was going to reveal to the public. 
After a few months of research, I'm convinced of it. 
Britain's establishment is corrupt and they are going to be brought down soon.

       I had grown up on Saville as a child and always wanted a ‘Jim’ll Fix It’ badge along with most kids.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, I completed The Great North Run in 2006 and he was the official starter.  What you don’t realise before is just how long it takes to get through the start line due to the thousands competing, so we were basically walking right past him slowly.  He called out to us and stuff. My friends and I visibly shuddered and when we were out of hearing range remarked on how “creepy” he seemed. We all individually told our friends/families when we got home.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never suspected this, but when the news hit it always made me think, why did three young women feel visibly uncomfortable within seconds of a man, yet no-one noticed? This is when we knew, they let him away with so much, it was so palpable a feeling of unease.

       Check out a podcast called ‘Those Conspiracy Guys’. They have a sub here and did a big episode on Savile recently.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always thought Jim’ll Fix It looked like a fun show but I didn’t like Savile at all. He looked creepy AF but that’s really indicative of nothing. The rumours were always there though and no-one believed the high-ups at the BBC when they said they hadn’t heard anything about them. Not that there’s anything funny about this case but I remember an amusing letter in response to the BBC from a guy who said he’d worked as a roofer in an island north of Scotland in the 1970s and even he had heard the stories.
The conspiracy theory is that Savile was the tip of the iceberg and either people knew but couldn’t prove or knew and covered it up. He had insane connections and free run of a number of hospitals where he abused countless patients and staff. He had his own quarters and master keys at Broadmoor which is a hospital for the criminally insane. He was a truly vile human being. It is staggering that even though there were stories about his activities, he still had as much access as he did. Revelations of Savile’s exploits were what kicked off the resurgence of interest in Elm Guest House in Barnes, SW London and activities at Dolphin Square with stories of high level politicians, police, celebrities etc grouping together to prey on children.
      </p>
      <p>
       TL;DR – We all suspected he was a wrong’un but the scale and extent of it was shocking.

       I was very young when Jim’ll Fix It was on, then saw him on Louis Theroux and was like WTF? However, it was passing him in that red tracksuit on the day of the race. I was totally cringing, it was a horrible feeling, so I can’t even imagine what those women and kids were like, particularly those in the hospitals.

       The global elite are luciferians and pedophilia is one way they worship lucifer. They and their recruits are mostly perfectly possessed from a young age due to demon conjuring sex rituals and under mind control. This is a battle between humans and demons. That’s why the mainstream media we own tries to push us away from Christianity. Jesus is our only protection. I’ve concluded this after decades of being agnostic. Researching government corruption led me to this conclusion. This is a spiritual war and money is just one tool they use to control use and lead us away from salvation.

       I lean towards the idea that people try to avoid admitting that there is a spiritual world and that these elite bloodlines are out through mind control programming and demonic possession from an early age.  They avoid admitting it because they were brainwashed by the mainstream media that is controlled by the elite which poisons is against Christianity/Christ while glorifying technology and money and atheism instead. The Bible clearly tells us not to drink blood and that’s why they do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything they do is to go against what we are told to do in the Bible and to pervert Gods creations to spite Him. So I lean towards the idea that drinking blood conjure demons and demon possession can lead to supernatural abilities and that’s why there would be any seemingly positive result from drinking blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       New agers and occultists frequently think they are developing their own powers and getting stronger rather than realize that they are simply attaching demons to themselves and those demons will gradually take control of their mind and body.
      </p>
      <p>
       There’s plenty of ways to extend your life through healthy diet. You can extend it by drinking herbal tea so I assume blood can have vitamins and minerals as well that can be good for you. Spiritually it’s bad for you if the Christian God is truly the only real God and if the Bible is telling the truth. I believe it is. I thought they drank blood to conjure demons only and to get high off the adrenaline from the victims suffering but I can see how it might have nutrients. As I said, any spiritual benefit would be short lived and a trap.

       That’s a good point. The context in the Bible is about making sure that any animal you eat doesn’t still have its blood in it when it’s eaten so it’s not referring to Jesus. I’m also not sure if the Old Testament references about not drinking blood refers to Christians. I’m not an expert in the Bible. I’m a baby Christian.  Also, in Jewish circumcision, doesn’t the mohel suck the blood of a baby? Maybe it only refers to animals but drinking blood of humans in order to conjure demon power would be Divination which is forbidden anyway. They serve black pudding-which is blood- in Ireland which is a famously devout Christian country. But they are mostly catholic and I think the Catholic Church has been corrupted many centuries ago because they contradict the Bible in many practices. I assume that eating blood is allowed for Christians due to the revocation of kosher law. It comes down to intention I would think. Is it to glorify God or to defy Him? Not sure if the drinking of blood in Catholic Churches is even a Christian practice or if it’s another Catholic only occult practice.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The Bible’s first prohibition against consuming blood comes in Genesis 9:2-4, where God tells Noah, "Everything that lives and moves about will be food for you. Just as I gave you the green plants, I now give you everything. But you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it." This prohibition was most likely a ban on eating raw blood (i.e., uncooked meat). For the first time, animals were an allowable food source, and God was making sure that Noah did not eat them raw. A Jewish Targum comments on this verse: "But the flesh which is torn from a living beast at the time that its life is in it, or which is torn from a beast while it is slain, before all its breath is gone out, ye shall not eat."
       </p>
       <p>
        Later, the prohibition of Genesis 9:4 is iterated in the Law of Moses. Leviticus 17:14 gives the reason behind command: “For the life of every creature is its blood: its blood is its life.”
       </p>
       <p>
        It’s important to understand that New Testament believers in Christ have freedom from the Law, and we are to “stand firm” in that liberty (Galatians 5:1). We are not under the Law but under grace. “Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink” (Colossians 2:16). So, eating a rare steak, blood sausage, blood pancakes, blood soup, or blood tofu may not be palatable to all Christians, but it is allowable.

       Oh sure. The most popular one is that the McCann girl was "kidnapped" by the podestas, and taken to Soros for this purpose. To take it another step further, they both have similiar traits in the way of a hereditary eye condition that's rare. Meaning if true, she could be a surrogate that was paid for by soros for this purpose and her parents were just carriers.

       You're downvoted horribly, but you're not lying. The BBC is HUGE (especially if you're including the World Service) and I don't think people understand just how many people work for them. I'm sure that the high up producers and such working directly with Jimmy Saville knew, and possibly some smaller people who worked directly with him, but it's not an exaggeration to say that 99% didn't know a thing. It doesn't excuse the ones who did, nor does it excuse that the BBC in its entirety allowed a culture that let this thing fester and grow and be covered up, but at the end of the day, it was still a relatively small group.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're also right about tax funding. It's totally funded by TV licenses, their finances are very open and available for anyone to see and check.

       One of Jimmy's best friends was Esther Rantzen, who started a service called ChildLine which was a service where children could phone for help if they were being abused. But too close to home for me. I'm sure she knew exactly what was going on! But again turned a blind eye. It's disgusting!

       Saville is nothing new. The BBC covering up a paedophile's offences is as common as an acne-prone teenager covering his/her spots. It's become common knowledge in the UK for anyone who paid attention to the news in 2015.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2015, just after the "VIP paedophile ring" was exposed, I spent about a month studying it along with a few too many child abuse cases for the Early Childhood Studies course I was studying. Every waking hour, every single day. I ended up losing a lot of sleep and experiencing persecutory delusions. (I was diagnosed with bipolar and borderline personality disorder so I should have seen it coming.)
      </p>
      <p>
       The BBC, the royal family, and many, many, many officials in the government covered up Saville's case as well as their own, their colleagues', their friends', etc. People reacted in as much outrage as they could possibly react in, but ultimately we know we're "the little people" so it didn't really get far. It definitely didn't get as much attention or support as the whole Weinstein thing which pisses me off more than anything.

       Agreed. I think the time of the the bbc scandals/max clifford etc..... was interesting. There are other inquiry's going on and they were getting a bit too close to the truth. So we got fed a bunch of old dying celebrities instead of the real truth. I also think this is why Weinstein, Spacey etc.... Has happened now. Despite EVERYONE knowing it was happening. People are getting close to the big boys ...like Geffan.... so the rest are thrown to the lions.

       Sorry but I don't. I'm speaking about the general attitude among the working class in England that I have spent many a night encountering through various pubs. Most people say they recon the royals killed her. One reason people say alot is because she was with a muslim at the time.

       According to night shift nurses in the UK hospitals he volunteered as a porter, he was suspected of aimlessly wheeling corpses around on gurneys late at night and that also he was a necrophiliac. There are pictures of him presenting tv shows on google wearing a ring with a glass eye set inside it that he had actually stolen from a cadaver.

       Its him sadly. I managed to figure it out in that blind and most agree with me. Courtney Love was banging Coogan but found out he was shagging a very underage Loretta Basey. He ended up basically pushing her off to Nat Rothschild. Apparently despite what he says in the press, he was friends with Saville.

       Because here in UK they praise the Royals and believe they make the country a better place, by keeping old traditions and attracting tourists (apparently nobody would otherwise visit this shithole country)
      </p>
      <p>
       So nobody questions why Saville was knighted or why he was such good pals with king Philip. Because being a sheep is less effort than being a Sheperd.

       That sucks that they feel that way. I loved visiting London and Wales. Met a lot of interesting and friendly people at pubs watching football. Loved trying the different ciders and beers. Loved all of the architecture. Really loved the Underground and bus systems. Didn't even really care for the traditional shit. I think we walked by Buckingham Palace and saw some bobbies, but it wasn't any awe-inspiring thing that made the trip memorable.

       This is the thing, Britain can be beautiful and it has enough tradition without the Royals. Countryside, fish and chips by the sea, watching rugby and football at the pub with a pint is all part of the culture. I'm not even British and after living here 15 years I still don't understand the fascination with the queen, neither have Brits ever explained to me why they worship her or the royals. Its all propaganda taught at young age. Kids are taught to respect them, whilst not really told why. This is probably why we have many confused adults who will fight you if you dare bad-mouth the queen, but wont tell you why.

       Saville was HUGE news at the time and whenever anymore information is out about it, it's huge news again. It's no exaggeration to say that it shook British media (and possibly all of Britain) to the core. I mean, I agree with you that there's too much focus on the useless royals and people are quick to lap up such light stories, but acting as though all the details of the Saville case were not HUGE news isn't true.

       Watching that Louis Theroux documentary, where Saville refers to his bed as "The Altar" is utterly bone chilling in retrospect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then consider how connected he was to politicians, royalty, senior police, you name it, and put that in the context of the utter failure and clear derailment of all attempts to investigate allegations of a Westminster abuse ring. There is something rotten and decidedly evil at the heart of our establishment.

       I remember when it all came out in the open about Saville and I'd say (from my perspective and social circles) the general thoughts was "probably not true, why did they only accuse after he died" bla bla bla. The people who didn't think that were actually not surprised at all, in the sense everyone knew he was a total perv and an extremely creepy elite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The shocker was Ralph Harris, convicted and was released after 3 years. I think people found that really hard to believe. Because it's such a horrific crime I feel people really don't WANT to believe more than, don't believe it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It really comes down to the fact we're so conditioned to believe that pedophiles and child molesters are these fat, ugly grimey poor folk who don't have anything better to do except be criminals. When in reality rape is generally about power, and once you have enough money to give you power, you have to get your power kicks from somewhere else. And the sick fucks choose children.

       British here. It's common knowledge here in England that the Queen is in fact a Reptillian. We all knew about Jimmy Saville and co but we thought it was just harmless kiddie-fiddling, not full blown Satanic cult shit though.

       Here’s one written by the New stork Times. I know the bbc has published some stuff as well and recently politician from the UK was outspoken about decriminalizing it. I couldn’t find that story on my initial search but I’ll look around more and post it. Here’s an article also where Theresa May wanted to allow convicted sex offenders and pedos to be able to adopt children.
