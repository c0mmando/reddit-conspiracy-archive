       They've been working on a piece since last month about Trump supposedly rubs her shoulders and she rubs his feet. It's complete bullshit cooked up by people with an agenda. Doesn't even accuse them of having sex They're tying it in with Stormy Daniels and how Trump's marriage with Melania is on life support.

       I would love to see those copies.  Trump is the Teflon Don, nothing is going to ever stick when it comes to stories like these.  If the secretary comes out and says it I don't think it'll hurt him.  He's going to be here for at least the rest of the term.  He may win reelection.  I think he may be at the point where he could shoot someone in the middle of Fifth Avenue and get by with it.

       I'm not condoning any kind of non-consensual sexual activity, but I'm sure as hell glad he likes mature, ADULT woman, rather then kids.  He's never been actually accused of rape, or any kind of sexual violence towards women (that I know of) and I can only imagine what women would do to me if I was a billionaire.

      <p>
       Essentially everyone IS against him. At least in part for the very reasons you directly addressed in your comment. He's not popular and most people are mad that he's president. You can't have it both ways, trying to say he's both horrible AND yet not nearly universally hated. He IS nearly universally hated because he's horrible. Most people who voted for him don't even like him and only did so because they were trying to keep Clinton from winning.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The only time he's not being persecuted by the media is when he's being praised for doing horrible shit like illegally bombing Syria, or when they ignore him doing horrible shit like how one of his first acts as president was approving a raid in Yemen that led to the killing of an 8 year old American girl.

       If he paid a top tier porn star $130k, he got a deal. And that’s why I voted for him to make those deals with China. Obama would have paid $800k.

       Not really. Have you seen the state of the porn industry right now? The "performers" don't make any money. They beg their fans on Twitter to buy them shit from an Amazon wish list because they just got paid $500 to take it in the ass for 5 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       $10k is probably the most it would take to get any "top tier porn star", not that they exist any more... they're all nobodies these days, to do an "escort job".

       That's not all they do. Trump has been caught cheating on his wife and attempting to cheat on his wife while admitting to using your fame to sexually assault women.

       Look at the body language. That marriage is done and rumors are Donald is a cuck and Melania is off with her own men.

       Yeah it's obvious bullshit. Sucks to be Melania, but I grew up with the Trump Ivanna/Marla shit. Even if true no one thought Trump was a saint. I think it's pretty telling of WAPO's journalistic credibility. No one cares and it's an obvious hit piece. But whatever. If they wanna go down on the same ship as CNN so be it.
