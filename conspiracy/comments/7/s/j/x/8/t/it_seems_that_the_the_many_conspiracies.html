    <div class="md"><p>Joke or not, we&#39;re all here for the same reason, to ask questions to events that just do not make sense. Conspiracy theorists have a had rap for being nut-jobs, but slowly they (we) are being vindicated. Why? because these jokers (us) ask questions. And there should be nothing wrong with questioning the narrative. ever. </p>

<p>Yes, there are more theories than one can keep up with, i&#39;ll grant you that, but to that i say &quot;so what?&quot;. unsubscribe and dont pay attention to CT&#39;s. easy. unburden yourself from the stresses of asking basic questions and live your life. :)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In all honesty, and as a bernie supporter, i found comeys responses and rationale behind those answers to be beneath what his seat at the time required. He didnt do his job, in my opinion.</p>

<p>I worked in security field for a long time and if i, knowingly, mishandled too secret docs would be strung up by my big toes without hesitation. But, because of her status as a political elite, was not.</p>

<p>The law is clear on the matter, it does not give wiggle room for ignorance. She had to have signed some document somewhere stating the training on handling TS material and that she fully understands the seriousness, potential legal ramifications, punishments, etc if actions leading to the mishandling or unauthorized publication of material are. ZERO excuse. Claiming to be ignorant on the matter is still punishable. Mishandling, in my eyes, is even worse because they knowingly stopped giving a shit about their position as an official in our govt charged with protecting its citizens. She doesnt care, people! Her clearance should have revoked immediately, assets seized, accounts frozen and treated as a spy. </p>

<p>Why? Cuz thats what would have happened if she werent HRC. Fuck the law, right?</p>

<p>Mishandled is mishandled no matter how you slice it. She should have been strung up by her toes just like any other person would have been.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pretty sure there was a case man, through her actions she jeorpadized your nation&#39;s national security. There are specific emails you can look up wherein she has sent documents to one of her staff with the instructions to show it to Bill Clinton.

    <div class="md"><p>There is a big difference between &quot;believes there was a case&quot; and being scared shitless to even take the case in the first place. The law, which I&#39;ve read and studied for both school and while in the military, do not forgive or bend for carelessness or ignorance. Simple as that. ESPECIALLY when dealing with national security. You or anyone else cannot say with a straight face that if virtually anyone else did what she did they would not be prosecuted, shamed, thrown in the darkest hole the govt has to offer, tarred and feathered. </p>

<p>The point is that she&#39;s elite, sadly untouchable, but she should not be. The law should apply to every single member of this society regardless of there &quot;status&quot;, but ESPECIALLY those handling national security material. They should be held to the absolute highest standards, not enabled. This country would survive without the Clintons, i promise.</p>

<p>It was not reflecting on you.</p>

<p>I did watch part of her cackling at some group of devils last night. After a few moments, I felt myself thinking about a pair of scissors and jamming them in one ear and then the other -  so I had to turn off the screech. </p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Joke or not, we&#39;re all here for the same reason, to ask questions to events that just do not make sense. Conspiracy theorists have a had rap for being nut-jobs, but slowly they (we) are being vindicated. Why? because these jokers (us) ask questions. And there should be nothing wrong with questioning the narrative. ever. </p>

<p>Yes, there are more theories than one can keep up with, i&#39;ll grant you that, but to that i say &quot;so what?&quot;. unsubscribe and dont pay attention to CT&#39;s. easy. unburden yourself from the stresses of asking basic questions and live your life. :)</p>
