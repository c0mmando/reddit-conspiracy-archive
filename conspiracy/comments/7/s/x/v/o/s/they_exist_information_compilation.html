       That's meaningless all the time organised religion exists. It is possible to be a good person and act in a beneficial way without the need for supernatural influences or the threat of eternal torture or ecstasy.

       You are very wrong. While religion was used as control by some, does not take away the faiths true meaning outside of the church interpretations. I believe in Christ but i wont step a foot into these new age churches.

       I definitely agree that porn is a huge problem. I loved porn. But I've identified it as a problem for me. Then I started looking at it like the CIA passing out crack. I don't want to be controlled by anyone. It's going to be a huge problem I think. And it's sneaking up on all of us.

       I can't find the link but I guess top search's for porn are incest and teens. I wondering to myself if "they" are trying to make pedos. Take what I just said with salt I guess.

       What telescope do you use? I don't think the stars are what they say they are, but that doesn't make them any less beautiful when I look at them. In fact, I look up in wonder now much more than I ever did, and do so more often than anyone I know. The government didn't put them there, but their educational system sure as shit lies about them.

       I have a decades old telescope with a 200x magnification. Moon craters, stars, it's all amazing up there and I like to star gaze fairly often. I don't get this idea that people who don't think stars are suns tens of trillions of miles away don't look up at them, when in fact many who question official science narratives often look up much more than those who got their info from a government book.
      </p>
      <p>
       I tell people both the Sun and Moon turns like a wheel in the sky, close to 90 degrees from rise to set, and they're astounded because they were never taught that, and never bothered to even notice. I tell them the Sun is always in the Southern sky in the northern hemisphere, year-round even though it should be in the northern sky half the year, and they're clueless as to why. These are just a few examples. Those who believe science dogma never look up.

       Well, this is unfortunately incorrect.  In the summer months the Sun rises and sets in the northern part of the sky for many places across the Northern Hemisphere.

       Like I said, all it takes is actual observation to see that that is not true. The Sun arcs low in the southern sky in winter, and arcs high in the southern sky in summer, even though it should be completely on the other side of the sky. That's because the Earth always tilts in one direction whether it is on one side of the Sun or the other.

       The Sun rises and sets in the northern part of the sky in the Northern Hemisphere over the course of the summer months, period.  You can confirm this yourself using any starchart program as well as through observation.

       Notice the tilt of the arcs in this video at 06:27. The Earth would be tilted the same way always toward the star Polaris, but on the other side of the Sun, which means the Sun should be arcing on the other side of the sky. Notice the Sun at noon in the summer is never overhead of the man or toward the north in the video, always still in the southern sky, which is not possible in the heliocentric model.

       Not entirely sure what your point is.  Literally at the point you linked in the video, it shows the Sun's arc in the summer being in the northern part of the sky in the summer during sunrise/sunset.  The Equinox (as also shown in your example) is when the rise/set moves from the northern sky to the southern, and vice-versa ...

       Somebody facing south at noon should have the Sun at their back in the summer in the northern hemisphere. They'd have to be facing north to see it, and it should arc in the northern sky, but that's not how it is in reality. The Sun arcs toward the southern sky in the video, all throughout the year. The video is true to reality, but not the heliocentric model

       I understand, but my comments are for anyone reading this who can clearly see the problem in the commonly taught model. It's a simple concept, and anyone can see it just by looking up and observing the Sun's position in the sky, and its movement through its arc.

       Look at how the Earth is tilted as it goes around the Sun in this animation.

       There's no getting around it, no pun intended. When Earth is around the Sun in summer, it is tilting
       <em>
        down.
       </em>
       That means in the northern hemisphere, the Sun should be low in the northern sky, arcing the opposite side of the sky as it would in winter.

       There is no tilting "down", the Northern Hemisphere is tilted
       <em>
        toward
       </em>
       the sun,  which is why it
       <em>
        rises and sets in the north
       </em>
       during the summer months.

       I have a ball toy with the Earth printed on it. I tilt the Earth 24 degrees, facing the Sun. I imagine a person in America standing and looking south. Then I spin the earth on its axis and imagine what the person would see. He wouldn't see the Sun at all if he was looking south. It would be behind him all day, arcing from sunrise to sunset, in the northern sky. But that's not reality. In reality, this person
       <em>
        does
       </em>
       see the Sun when facing south, because it always arcs in the southern sky. Anyone can see this. "South facing" is a real estate term meaning favorable to sunlight, and why? Because the Sun is always in the southern sky.

       You are forgetting about perspective, the Sun is millions of kilometres away, that's why the person facing south sees the Sun.

       You are over-complicating things to due your lack of understanding of the Heliocentric model.  So far every image/video you've provided demonstrates exactly what I'm saying, but you somehow don't understand them.

       Observe for yourself at Moonrise how the Moon's features are situated. Then watch it throughout the night as it arcs in the sky. Observe how it turns like a wheel, and will be on its side about 90 or so degrees turned, by the time it sets. Anyone can do this.

       Well, this is unfortunately incorrect.  In the summer months the Sun rises and sets in the northern part of the sky for many places across the Northern Hemisphere.

       Notice the tilt of the arcs in this video at 06:27. The Earth would be tilted the same way always toward the star Polaris, but on the other side of the Sun, which means the Sun should be arcing on the other side of the sky. Notice the Sun at noon in the summer is never overhead of the man or toward the north in the video, always still in the southern sky, which is not possible in the heliocentric model.
