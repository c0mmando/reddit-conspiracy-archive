    <div class="md"><p>I have a decades old telescope with a 200x magnification. Moon craters, stars, it&#39;s all amazing up there and I like to star gaze fairly often. I don&#39;t get this idea that people who don&#39;t think stars are suns tens of trillions of miles away don&#39;t look up at them, when in fact many who question official science narratives often look up much more than those who got their info from a government book. </p>

<p>I tell people both the Sun and Moon turns like a wheel in the sky, close to 90 degrees from rise to set, and they&#39;re astounded because they were never taught that, and never bothered to even notice. I tell them the Sun is always in the Southern sky in the northern hemisphere, year-round even though it should be in the northern sky half the year, and they&#39;re clueless as to why. These are just a few examples. Those who believe science dogma never look up.</p>

<p>Well, this is unfortunately incorrect.  In the summer months the Sun rises and sets in the northern part of the sky for many places across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said, all it takes is actual observation to see that that is not true. The Sun arcs low in the southern sky in winter, and arcs high in the southern sky in summer, even though it should be completely on the other side of the sky. That&#39;s because the Earth always tilts in one direction whether it is on one side of the Sun or the other. </p>

<p>The Sun rises and sets in the northern part of the sky in the Northern Hemisphere over the course of the summer months, period.  You can confirm this yourself using any starchart program as well as through observation.</p>

The Earth would be tilted the same way always toward the star Polaris, but on the other side of the Sun, which means the Sun should be arcing on the other side of the sky.

Literally at the point you linked in the video, it shows the Sun&#39;s arc in the summer being in the northern part of the sky in the summer during sunrise/sunset.

<p>I understand, but my comments are for anyone reading this who can clearly see the problem in the commonly taught model. It&#39;s a simple concept, and anyone can see it just by looking up and observing the Sun&#39;s position in the sky, and its movement through its arc.</p>

<p>It is true to the Heliocentric model, you just don&#39;t seem to understand it correctly.  These videos should clear it up for you:</p>

<p>There&#39;s no getting around it, no pun intended. When Earth is around the Sun in summer, it is tilting <em>down.</em> That means in the northern hemisphere, the Sun should be low in the northern sky, arcing the opposite side of the sky as it would in winter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is no tilting &quot;down&quot;, the Northern Hemisphere is tilted <em>toward</em> the sun,  which is why it <em>rises and sets in the north</em> during the summer months.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have a ball toy with the Earth printed on it. I tilt the Earth 24 degrees, facing the Sun. I imagine a person in America standing and looking south. Then I spin the earth on its axis and imagine what the person would see. He wouldn&#39;t see the Sun at all if he was looking south. It would be behind him all day, arcing from sunrise to sunset, in the northern sky. But that&#39;s not reality. In reality, this person <em>does</em> see the Sun when facing south, because it always arcs in the southern sky. Anyone can see this. &quot;South facing&quot; is a real estate term meaning favorable to sunlight, and why? Because the Sun is always in the southern sky.</p>

<p>Not in the Southern Hemisphere ...</p>

<p>You are over-complicating things to due your lack of understanding of the Heliocentric model.  So far every image/video you&#39;ve provided demonstrates exactly what I&#39;m saying, but you somehow don&#39;t understand them. </p>
