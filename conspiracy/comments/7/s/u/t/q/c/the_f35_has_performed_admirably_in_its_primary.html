       These are just a few of the many problems plaguing the most expensive military project in history, yet, so many US allies are spending billions of their tax-payers' money to acquire this obvious failure.
      </p>
      <p>
       No wonder the Norwegians have not bothered to even build hangars for their new acquisition. They probably saw it as throwing good money after bad. They fulfilled their obligation to pay their "subscription" to Washington, they don't need to pretend they got quality for their money.

       As for the "enemy" in Moscow, they don't believe in interrupting an enemy when he's making a mistake.

       It can fly in the rain, the oxygen issues so far have primarily been false alarms, ejection is safe, it can fire its air-to-ground weapons, it can refuel in mid-air, only one variant needs tire changes every 10 landings, and any computer with an input is susceptible to cyber-attacks.

       Hangars are getting built right now, they just got delayed; for now they're staying in deployable shelters similar to how jets are stored in-theatre.

      <p>
       Firstly, the F-22 and F-35 operate using the same doctrine and technologies, so if you're trying to develop a new stealth fighter, you're not doing it as a response exclusively to the F-22 (or F-35).
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, the F-22 had its production cut at a limited quantity that'll only ever allow around a max of 30 F-22s to be deployed per theatre in a war against Russia or China (which would inevitably involve both; neither's going to sit idle while such the US is distracted). The F-35 fleet on the other hand will be around 15x larger in size and present a much larger strategic threat.

       An F-35 is cheaper than a new-build F-15, yet can come away undefeated 20:nil. There was even (still) unconfirmed reports out of Greece that similar ratios were achieved against France and the UK's Rafale and Typhoon fighters.

      <p>
       The F-35 currently has the best sensor technology and presents a good platform for the MIC to invest in (it's a much larger market than any other fighter going into the future).
      </p>
      <p>
       The F-35 is also getting the best missiles the west can develop for it, such as the recently announced joint program between the UK and Japan, where they're developing an AESA-equipped Meteor for their F-35s (and because the jets are largely common, any F-35 operator can use that missile).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for UCAVs; they will definitely play an increasing role, but it'll be a long time before any western nation is comfortable handing over kill authority (ie being able to make the decision to engage and kill an opponent 100% autonomously) to a drone. Until then you'll need command and control, and the best way to maintain that is to have a survivable and well networked manned aircraft in relatively close proximity; the F-35 fits that bill better than any other fighter today.

       It's what F-35s have been achieving against F-15s, F-16s, etc at events like Red Flag, Northern Edge, USN Top Gun courses, USMC WTI courses, etc.
      </p>

       Obviously those ratios shouldn't be expected against other 5th gen fighters, but they're certainly still possible given the numeric, logistical and C2, etc advantages that the US holds over other nations.

       A war with China is your best bet then; Russia's had quite a bit of trouble with their PAK-FA (it's only a couple of years younger than the F-35 and yet there are nearly 30x more F-35s flying today). At least China is having success with their J-20s.

       I was going to say wait a few more years and maybe see Raptor vs Sukhoi in some Middle Eastern conflict. But it's doubtful that will ever happen because they never made enough F22s to export.
      </p>
      <p>
       AFAIK, production has ceased too. If when Raptors are replaced by something newer, they'll probably go to ANG units before they'd get exported.

       So yes, maybe J-20 vs F-22?

       The F-22 will never be exported; even ignoring the Congress export ban it's unlikely that either anyone will want to buy them 15 years from now or that the USAF will be willing to part with them.
      </p>

       For now the USAF expects their Raptors to serve into the 2060s.

       It'd depend on the circumstances; in Vietnam, US Navy F-4 Phantoms achieved a 13:1 kill ratio against relatively similar MiG-21s, etc after Top Gun was introduced. If it had been introduced sooner that ratio could have climbed higher.

       I completely agree with the title, we have fucking UFO tech and we are supposed to believe that the F-35 is our best effort for weaponized flight tech? I feel like they think we are so blind that they've just been pulling the most obvious frauds and thefts right in front of our eyes as if no one will notice. What a joke. Also the same can be said for most of NASA, based on all of their stagecraft and coverups. Just more ways to funnel money into private contractors and entities that do nothing for the American people.

       Are Australians being misled over the real cost of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter?
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the world top independent defence experts has conduced an incredibly exhaustive examination of the real cost of the Joint Strike Fighter (F-35) to those countries that are buying it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The expert, Paris-based Giovanni de Briganti, of Defence-Aerospace, estimates that the average unit cost of Lockheed Martin JSF in the ninth low-rate initial production run is $US206.3 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Australian parliament has been told by Defence Minister Marise Payne and Defence Industry Minister Christopher Pyne that the cost of our Joint Strike Fighters will be in the vicinity of $US90 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such a huge variation means that either Giovanni de Briganti has completely got his calculations wrong when applied to Australia, or Pyne and Payne may have misled parliament.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not have the ability to decide which of the alternatives are correct but there is a good chance that the Pyne/Payne $90 million vicinity estimate leaves out essential costs.
      </p>
      <pre><code>read more
F-35 fighter deal doesn’t fly
</code></pre>
      <p>
       Giovanni de Briganti believes the aircraft’s engine is one of the costs they leave out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me explain what I think has happened.
      </p>
      <p>
       Defence officials for over a decade have been hoodwinking politicians on both sides by conveniently leaving out the massive expenditures required to get the JSF aircraft into service. At least in the past that has included leaving out the cost of the engine.
      </p>
      <p>
       De Briganti believes the low cost estimate covers only a partially-completed aircraft about to leave the factory and not one that is ready for action, which is the only true cost. Pyne and Payne may have fallen into the trap.
      </p>
      <p>
       The parliament needs to get to the bottom in the real cost of the JSF.
      </p>
      <p>
       De Briganti emphasises that his $US206.3 million cost includes “engines, fixes and upgrades” — as any proper cost calculation would include.
      </p>
      <p>
       A series of US defence officials have claimed that the cost of the JSF has been reduced thanks to the intervention of President Donald Trump. De Briganti disputes whether there has been a significant fall, so Trump may also have been hoodwinked.
The Joint Strike Fighter.
The Joint Strike Fighter.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are three different JSF aircraft, which each have slightly different cost structures.
      </p>
      <p>
       De Briganti calculates a “generic” F-35, which a notional aircraft used to compare unit costs from year to year. It is calculated on the basis of the average cost of one aircraft in each of the three versions (F-35A, F-35B and F-35C) in the same production lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       He says that a direct comparison of the aircraft costs released by the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) shows that the cost of a “generic” F-35 has actually increased by $US7.63 million over the five years, 2012 to 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to de Briganti, JPO’s figures show that, of the three variants, only the F-35A saw its cost decline — a modest $3 million over those five years. Australia is buying the F-35A so at least the claim that we have had a cost reduction may be justifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
       However de Briganti is adamant that the official Joint Strike Fighter costs produced by JPO only compare airframe costs, and for reasons it has not explained exclude engine and other costs.
      </p>
      <p>
       If de Briganti is right then clearly the Australian parliament has been quoted costs for the JSF without the engine. [...]

       Giovanni is very biased; if you actually read through the post where he shows you how he made his estimate, it's very clear that he either has no idea of what he's talking about, or just thinks his average visitor doesn't know how to read -

      <p>
       The $90m figure is the one that's apples-to-apples with figures like $77m for a Super Hornet, etc; it's the aircraft's unit recurring flyaway (URF) cost which includes the jet itself, the engine, the helmet and nothing else. It's like when you go to a car dealership and the price tag says $30,000.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ~$200m figure from Briganti is a mess of random contracts, including things like funds spent to build an F-35 factoriy in Japan, contracts for upgrading existing F-35s that have little to do with Australia, advance payments for future contracts, etc, but ~$200m is in the ballpark for a real cost called the average procurement unit cost (APUC), that includes the jet, engine, helmet, but also things like ground power units, servers for support systems, ladders, stealth measurement devices, tools, a defined amount of contractor support, the manuals and tech publications, maintenance laptops, flight simulators, initial spare parts, etc. Most modern fighters go for $150-350 million per unit. This is like looking at the price of a car + a basic workshop so that you can maintain most aspects of it + professional support for the specialised things that you don't know how to work on + training equipment + initial spare parts, etc.

       Most expensive weapon ever built limps toward finish line
      </p>
      <p>
       The primary technical issue centers on the so-called “brain” of the F-35 -- known as the Autonomic Logistic Information System, or ALIS -- which controls plane operations, maintenance, scheduling and supply chain management. It’s considered as essential to the aircraft's operation as the airframe and engine. Of the myriad concerns involving ALIS, the primary is that there is no backup for data processing – which means that a failure could in theory ground the entire 2,443-aircraft force. Other issues include a lack of testing, inability to communicate with legacy systems and cybersecurity questions
      </p>
      <p>
       “ALIS remains immature and requires labor-intensive workarounds not acceptable in combat,” Gilmore said. His testimony was the most critical of the F-35 program -- and the least optimistic about the ability to quickly fix and deliver an update for ALIS. He spoke of “significant” cyber security issues and testing that’s been “hardly sufficient.” A 2013 Pentagon study projected any delay with ALIS could hike program costs $20-$100 billion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet Gilmore also acknowledged how much – in term of manpower, money and warfighting ability – was on the line with the jet, which is intended to be used by the Air Force, Navy, Marines and several foreign nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Air Force Lt. Gen. Christopher Bogdan, the F-35’s program manager, was more bullish on the plane’s prospects. He heads a crew of 2,590 people with an annual budget – excluding the plane costs – of $70 million.
      </p>
      <p>
       The delivery of an improved ALIS is only 60 days behind, Bogdan said, and should be ready by October. Gilmore had said 2018 was a more realistic timeframe for a system to be in place.
      </p>
      <p>
       While committee chairman Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., criticized the development of the F-35 as “a scandal” with cost overruns that “have been disgraceful,” Bogdan tried to put the program in context.

      <p>
       The jets are designed to operate without ALIS if something does go wrong with it. They'd only ground the jets if there was no urgency to fly them and a fix was rapidly on the way.

       The F-35 is still horribly broken
      </p>
      <p>
       [...]  But the positive attitude conceals a fundamental problem. As it stands now, the Pentagon will be paying millions of dollars for new F-35s — and already has more than 150 aircraft sitting at bases around the country — that simply don't work right.
      </p>
      <p>
       On Feb. 1, the Pentagon's top weapon tester J. Michael Gilmore released a scathing 48-page dissection of the F-35 as part of his annual report to Congress. In his annual review, the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation raised concerns with the plane's advanced computer "brain," other key gear, the basic design, and the testing regimen.

       Gilmore said the services needed to get real about how soon pilots would be able start flying mock missions, let alone actual combat. "Essentially every aircraft bought to date requires modifications prior to use in combat," Gilmore wrote. If there are no changes to the schedule, Lockheed expects to deliver more than 500 F-35s of all types — more than a fifth of the whole fleet Washington plans to buy — to the Pentagon by 2020.
      </p>
      <p>
       Still described as "low rate," this production tally of what amount to unfinished prototypes is larger than the total aircraft of all types in 10 NATO air forces — Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovakia and Slovenia — combined, according to figures from the 2013 edition of the International Institute for Strategic Studies' authoritative The Military Balance.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, the Pentagon watchdog said operational testing wasn't likely to kick off until May 2018 at the very earliest — nearly 10 months after the current estimated start date. Test pilots likely will not finish up a full series of experiments to see how well the plane can destroy targets in the air and on the ground — called Weapon Delivery Accuracy events, or WDAs — for another three years given existing trends.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The DOT&amp;E report is factually accurate," Bogdan wrote in his statement, which was an official response to the report. "[But] it does not fully address program efforts to resolve known technical challenges and schedule risks."
      </p>
      <p>
       Still, according to Gilmore, both the Pentagon and Congress should ask themselves whether it's wise to commit to block-buying F-35s if they're far from combat-ready.
      </p>
      <p>
       The significance of Gilmore's report cannot be overstated. "This document is probably the most extraordinary review of any weapon that's come out of the DOT&amp;E office," said Pierre Sprey, a former aeronautical engineer who helped design the F-16 Fighting Falcon and A-10 Warthog.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sprey was speaking to a handful of journalists at a meeting with the Project on Government Oversight, a Washington, D.C. think tank. The panel of speakers also included former DOT&amp;E director Thomas Christie, military reform advocate Winslow Wheeler, and POGO defense wonks Dan Grazier and Mandy Smithberger.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gilmore's report did include many points F-35 critics will be familiar with already. However, the document adds additional — and more importantly official — details to the various complaints.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Those are leaks," Sprey said of important revelations about the JSF — such as losing a mock dogfight to an older F-16 — that War Is Boring and others have uncovered over the plane's three decades of development. "This is a government document that says it. That's a big difference."
      </p>
      <p>
       "And it took a huge amount of guts to do it," Sprey added. Throughout their presentation, both Sprey and Christie said they were impressed that the DOT&amp;E report had "escaped" the Pentagon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Gilmore's first target was the F-35's computer and its complex software. All told, the aircraft relies on more than 20 million lines of code to "fuze" information from the JSF's radar, infrared cameras, jamming gear, and even other planes and ground stations to help it hunt down and hide from opponents, as well as break through enemy lines to blow up targets on the ground. Combined with a special, classified stealth coating, Lockheed claims the aircraft will be "virtually invisible."
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the computer doesn't work, the F-35's greatest advertised advantages over existing rivals and future threats would suddenly become moot.
      </p>
      <p>
       After two false starts, the Pentagon finally began working on the F-35's so-called Block 3i software in March 2015. Block 3i essentially involved moving old Block 2B code into an upgraded box.
      </p>
      <p>
       Despite assurances that this would be a smooth transition, the software did not work with the new hardware. After the transition, the Pentagon suddenly found more than 350 new "test points" that would have to be examined to make sure everything worked. The Block 3i test plan already called for more than 500 test points.
      </p>
      <p>
       After just two months of tests, engineers released eight software patches. Pilots completed test flights with the new code eight months behind schedule. But the software's sixth and current revision — two additional versions of the fifth upgrade didn't get new numbers — still has trouble keeping the radar steady, according to Gilmore.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of this work was based on earlier code that was full of "deficiencies" and had "limited combat capability."
      </p>
      <p>
       The Pentagon claims the up-coming Block 3F version will be representative of the final product, currently dubbed Block 4. But Gilmore and the program's officials disagree on when engineers will fix the bugs in that software. By the end of 2015, the program had successfully run just over a quarter of the more than 5,000 expected tests on this latest variation.
      </p>
      <p>
       "They have no idea what they're going to have to do" to get the aircraft to their final configuration, Christie said. "Every time we run a test, we find something new and as time goes on we're finding more problems."
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a serious problem — and here's why. [...]

       So I live in the vicinity of the home of the F35 (Luke AFB). The F16 training and flights still out number the 35 at a ratio of 5-1. It's cool to see the 35's fly but even the training flights are lacking.
