I mean, they would prefer it if people focused on religious nonsense etc rather than what the both of us are talking about because as you say, we do have control over that.  Or at least could do.

    <div class="md"><p>where to even begin... they worship an androgynous god called the baphoment. they believe that by being androgynous themselves they become immortal. given that they also do ritualistic sacrifices. not only that but they also believe in numerology and communicate through the use of symbols. symbols are plastered everywhere. symbols rule the world. they have numerous hand gestures that they use. for example the a-okay sign aka the 666 hand gesture. symbols are subliminally delivered to us through any and all forms if media. simply look up videos exposing satanic symbolism in music videos. </p>

<p>but what personally did it for me was when i learned about the transagenda they are shifting us toward. most if not all a list celebrities are the opposite gender than they appear. when i learned this i couldn&#39;t grasp why on earth they would keep that a secret and deceive that masses like that especially when they are so pro lgbt --- yet they themselves are transgendered but happen to not mention it. this blew my mind. but it started to make sense... when you study anatomy and what makes a male and female based on bone structure then it all becomes clear. take angelina jolie for example. she has extremely broad shoulders wider than the hips a very square jaw deep set eyes a prominent yet shaved down brow ridge and high and wide cheek bones. she supposedly got her uterous removed... however she. ever had one in the first place and is a spokesperson for it and is convincing women to do the same (depopulation much?). when i started to dig and go down the rabbit hole thats when it all became clear to me. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i couldn&#39;t explain that as i have never personally experienced that before or believe that is what happens because you call it science. but i can say that if the earth was supposedly a globe traveling and revolving thousands of miles per hour around the sun that happens to be &quot;millions&quot; of miles away then why is it that we can sometimes see clouds behind the sun? if we haven&#39;t been to the moon and the nasa crooks themselves can admit to never traveling past low earth orbit and curating images with photoshop of the globe earth  model ...then idk how one could still believe we live on a spherical rock rapidly spinning and revolving around a ball of fire all based on cgi models. but surely you must have another reason as to why you believe in the globe, right? </p>
