       I think most of it stems from greed, stupidity, and public apathy. And those are all three very real problems that action can be taken against.

       Maybe someday we can get to the bottom of some satanic shit behind whatever but we gotta actually start doing shit now. Small bites.

       Nothing specific other than bringing to attention conspiracies closer to the actual definition of conspiracy, which is having a very real, tangible affect on the world.

       no that's fair. that's your opinion. you totally have the right to do you but i definitely believe that by spreading awareness and exposing their satanic ways it will become easier to wake people up. music alone is an easy way to put spells on the masses, brainwash and control them... when you realize how blatantly satanic the lyrics and music videos are then it becomes a great staring point for those who are asleep. just my opinion though!

       Exactly this.  It's all the usual stuff.  Sex, cash, delicious food,  fantastic holidays, lovely big houses and power which itself enables them to get the other aforementioned.  Plus a load of them are legit psychos which is how they got there in the first place and they just delight in crushing other people.  Just look at Clinton talking about Gaddafis murder for starters.  She doesn't even hide it.  That's how safe she feels in the position she's in.  Which is appropriate.  They're getting away with it. So far.

       Because they want you to take your eye of the ball and focus on stuff like that instead?  Also there's a chance that like the whole 'flat Earth' crap it helps to make the sub look silly.

       I will say though I think “focusing on other stuff instead” is actually good for most people because that “other stuff” (non satanic more realistic definition of conspiracies) is shit that we have actual control over.

       No, I meant the same as you lol. I mean, they would prefer it if people focused on religious nonsense etc rather than what the both of us are talking about because as you say, we do have control over that.  Or at least could do.  The corrupt have been exposed and fallen in various places in history. We have to at least try.  At the moment the real problem seems to be that people have become polarised over bullshit. There's no solidarity.  'Divide and rule' is working out great.

       i couldn't explain that as i have never personally experienced that before or believe that is what happens because you call it science. but i can say that if the earth was supposedly a globe traveling and revolving thousands of miles per hour around the sun that happens to be "millions" of miles away then why is it that we can sometimes see clouds behind the sun? if we haven't been to the moon and the nasa crooks themselves can admit to never traveling past low earth orbit and curating images with photoshop of the globe earth  model ...then idk how one could still believe we live on a spherical rock rapidly spinning and revolving around a ball of fire all based on cgi models. but surely you must have another reason as to why you believe in the globe, right?

       Are Christians incapable of being bad?

       absolutely not. every single person falls short. we are all fully flawed and are completely capable of making wrong choices. just because i say i am christian doesn't necessarily mean i am.
      </p>
      <p>
       calling oneself a christian or going to church doesn't make them any more christian (or a better person) than standing in a garage and calling oneself a car.

       where to even begin... they worship an androgynous god called the baphoment. they believe that by being androgynous themselves they become immortal. given that they also do ritualistic sacrifices. not only that but they also believe in numerology and communicate through the use of symbols. symbols are plastered everywhere. symbols rule the world. they have numerous hand gestures that they use. for example the a-okay sign aka the 666 hand gesture. symbols are subliminally delivered to us through any and all forms if media. simply look up videos exposing satanic symbolism in music videos.

       but what personally did it for me was when i learned about the transagenda they are shifting us toward. most if not all a list celebrities are the opposite gender than they appear. when i learned this i couldn't grasp why on earth they would keep that a secret and deceive that masses like that especially when they are so pro lgbt --- yet they themselves are transgendered but happen to not mention it. this blew my mind. but it started to make sense... when you study anatomy and what makes a male and female based on bone structure then it all becomes clear. take angelina jolie for example. she has extremely broad shoulders wider than the hips a very square jaw deep set eyes a prominent yet shaved down brow ridge and high and wide cheek bones. she supposedly got her uterous removed... however she. ever had one in the first place and is a spokesperson for it and is convincing women to do the same (depopulation much?). when i started to dig and go down the rabbit hole thats when it all became clear to me.

       that's right. they do have an inverted way about them. however i can happily say i don't call this place paradise. i truly believe this is hell on earth (when i comes to people of course because nature is absolutely beautiful.)

       no that's fair. that's your opinion. you totally have the right to do you but i definitely believe that by spreading awareness and exposing their satanic ways it will become easier to wake people up. music alone is an easy way to put spells on the masses, brainwash and control them... when you realize how blatantly satanic the lyrics and music videos are then it becomes a great staring point for those who are asleep. just my opinion though!

       i couldn't explain that as i have never personally experienced that before or believe that is what happens because you call it science. but i can say that if the earth was supposedly a globe traveling and revolving thousands of miles per hour around the sun that happens to be "millions" of miles away then why is it that we can sometimes see clouds behind the sun? if we haven't been to the moon and the nasa crooks themselves can admit to never traveling past low earth orbit and curating images with photoshop of the globe earth  model ...then idk how one could still believe we live on a spherical rock rapidly spinning and revolving around a ball of fire all based on cgi models. but surely you must have another reason as to why you believe in the globe, right?
