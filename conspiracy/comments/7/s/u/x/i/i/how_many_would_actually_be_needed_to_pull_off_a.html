       I've been a supporter of the demolition hypothesis with regard to 9/11 for about seven years now and I don't shy from the subject, but the main argument I come up against is that it would have required too many people to pull it off effectively and keep it a secret for it to be considered as a possible cause of those collapses. So how many would actually have had to have been actively involved, and of those involved how many would have had to have been knowingly involved on a criminal level?

       Or they wonder why they were given an unusual order but understand asking too many questions could result in a poor performance review, failure to be promoted, even a loss of career.  Most people might be suspicious but ever open their mouth.  Susan Ladauder? spoke up and ended up in prison and almost declared insane.

       Susan wrote a book, Extreme Prejudice, she was the first person imprisoned under the Patriot Act for claiming she told WH officals she overheard reports of an impending attack while working as a CIA asset.  They were about to dose her into stupidity except some lawyer heard about her and stopped the proceedings to declare her insane. A nightmare for sure.  A former soldier, April Gallop worked at the Pentagon and walked out of the hole where the plane supposedly hit. She claimed to smell cordite, a bomb ingredient and claimed she saw zero plane parts, remains, anything to indicate a plane had made that hole.  She spoke up but probably wishes she never had now.

       So 9/11, an event so big it would require a massive coverup, couldn't possibly be coordinated; and a helicopter crash containing say 30 SEALs (none of whom were involved in the raid per MSM, but we'll pretend for argument's sake) couldn't be kept hidden? 35 people need to know. The President, the Secretary of the Army (maybe...) the unit leader, the 30 dead SEALs (who are experts at maintaining gov't secrecy by the way as their whole lives literally depend on it) and the pilot and co-pilot. If the pilot team are SEALs as well, then only 33 people need to know. If the President doesn't know, it makes his responses look more "real". The Sec. doesn't really
       <em>
        need
       </em>
       to know, for the same reason. Maybe for budget purposes as he'll have to justify hiring 30 more seals.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, this begs the question which is more likely? That 30 SEALs died in a helicopter crash to keep the secret of Bin Laden (while the people that actually killed OBL weren't even on the helicopter) or that the gov't said "Hey, so, we need this to happen. You guys are experts at keeping gov't secrets. Rig this helicopter, "crash" it in the middle of the desert, and either go with the "dead" lie or we'll keep you on the payroll and change your identity."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a lot easier to keep 30 government agents in line than it is to keep potentially hundreds or thousands of leaks quiet.

       Imagine 09/11 was demolition and you were to work for people who want to blow up two skyscrapers and sacrifice thousands of innocent people for their own good.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apart from the fact that you as a regular person probably would not end up in such a position as I can imagine those people are carefully hand picked, you know what will happen to you or your family if you speak out on such topics.
If you are a hired demolitions contractor(mercenary/hitman) you probably do not care at all anyways as long as you get a shitload of cash for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       To narrow it down, how many people do you really need? 
- A close circle of conspirators planning the whole thing.
- Contractors to place explosives - probably a hand full
- place those contractors in maintenance schedules or arrange a fire training or whatever and get the building evacuated so your people can work for a couple of days
- Use your connections to tell the responsible people it is just a exercise/ training whatever while your demolition guys look like average maintenance crew and plant everything
      </p>
      <p>
       Soooooo not so many people after all who really know what is happening there.

       The answer is however many it took. You don't figure out whether something was a false flag or not by asking these questions. You look at the evidence and decide if it was a false flag or organic event.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it were a false flag, and the evidence supports this, then it doesn't matter how many people were involved or how improbable it seems to anyone of us.

       This is probably the best example of compartmentalizing something this huge that we know all about today. Over 130,000 people worked on it at points and most had no idea what they were even working on. A lot had suspicions but the government still managed to pull it off.

       If TIs and mindhacking were possible, you could have innumerable "cyborgs" following orders with a memory "reboot" that fits the popular narrative. They obviously have done this for a while, prolly since Reagan was shot.

       I'm sure they have but not to the level of demolition experts. Mindless killers, yes, I think so, but not skilled technicians. What do I know though?
