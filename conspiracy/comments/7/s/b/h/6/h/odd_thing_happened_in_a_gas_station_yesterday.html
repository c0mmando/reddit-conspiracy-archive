        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I had read that the federal government shut down a couple days ago. I know that is the money of the country. </p>

<p>I saw two people who came in to get money out of the ATM and the ATM was out of order. They said that was the 5th gas station they had gone to that was emptied and had not been refilled. </p>

<p>I found it odd. Went a few miles down the highway to another city and stopped one more time for a beverage for someone in the car and came to discover that their ATM was also depleted. I highly doubt this was one of the same ones they had gone to because of how far off the highway it was and how large the cities are. </p>

<p>Has anyone else noticed anything odd regarding ATM&#39;s or currency? </p>

<p>I apologize for posting this to conspiracy as it in itself is not a conspiracy. But it felt like it could be the beginnings of something else. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Only if it ties into the banks, which it does, because the banks control the money supply. If the bank doesn&#39;t dole out physical cash an ATM cannot be refilled. That doesn&#39;t make it government related.</p>

<p>And the way Trump has been working thus far, of course the Fed being wholly independent, there shouldn&#39;t be any shortage of physical cash.</p>

<p>I see this situation as likely relatively isolated and local business or bank related, those in that ATM business, than a larger scheme to create a shortage.</p>

<p>Honestly, how many times has anyone gone into a gas station with a 3rd party ATM and it is down? Its happened to me a few times. One of the main reasons I haven&#39;t used one in several years aside from the 3rd party fee.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I get it. No worries.</p>

<p>The guys that I know that own their 3rd party ATM businesses check up and refill their own units, during off hours refill of course. 1 guy owns I think around a dozen. The other guy maybe 8. The return they see aren&#39;t huge by any means but it is a business and it is dependent on use and availability; the use of the ATM and the availability of physical cash. They don&#39;t get refilled half as much as a bank ATM.</p>

<p>My knowledge of this comes only from acquaintance and asking questions pertaining to the business as I am genuinely inquisitive. It may be different for other operators in other areas. And this was about 4 or 5 years ago. So grain of salt. But as I said I don&#39;t believe it to be widespread or purposeful on a large scale.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If that were the case we would know very quickly. It hasn&#39;t happened to my knowledge.</p>

<p>If they did do it it would be extremely negative psychologically and we would likely see riots and protests within hours across the country. It would also mean that a lot of people would be exposed to a lot of facts they aren&#39;t currently curious about as it would cause friction in their already preconceived perceptions on how society operates. This would cause even more devastation.</p>

<p>The banks wouldn&#39;t do so unless they stood to benefit from it. Keeping the public at peace serves their interest because a well fed and complacent wage slave is in their interest, while they collect interest. No worky no money. Trickle down is a fallacy. They&#39;re more like a siphon or a pump. They provide the mechanism, the system, the people are what&#39;s being pumped. It goes up, not down. The pyramid is inverted.</p>

I just don&#39;t follow the logic of it being a signal of something larger or see any connection to a gov shut down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>there are a lot of reasons to have things shut down. if employees aren&#39;t being paid then there is no one at the parks. Meaning they have a window of operation to do things outside of public view. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>True. Yet every time there is a gov shut down they shut down national parks. Maybe aliens landed in Yosemite and that is what sparked the whole daca budget debate, but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence for that. Ackam&#39;s razor would have me believe that our national parks are shut down due to lack of funding. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A lot of ATM companies (ATM Placement Services) aren&#39;t really massive operations. Sure there are those that are run by the banks but the ones you see in gas stations, bars, etc. that look generic and usually charge higher fees are usually run by some local company. They have different ways of how they operate. Some place the machines for free in high-traffic areas (<em>but take a bigger cut</em>), some sell you the machines, some basically lease it to you. They also have different ways of how the money is loaded. As a business owner you could front the money yourself if you wanted to or you have them handle it for you.</p>

<p>It&#39;s entirely plausible that an ATM placement company could have a contract with a series of gas stations in an area or even just be the top dog in whatever area you live in so they have most of the business and at the same time screw up their financials (<em>like any poorly run company</em>) and not have enough cash on hand to service all of their ATMs. </p>

<p>If there was a real run on cash I think we would be seeing this nationwide.</p>
