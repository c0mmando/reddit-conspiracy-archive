      <p>
       Last year I went to the Guidestones. It was pretty much what I expected bar a few things that I hadn't heard about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Firstly, the entire guidestones area is surrounded by holly bushes on 3 sides, I'm sure everyone is aware the symbolism there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, a stain, bowl, and glove made the whole area look like it was recently used for a ritual.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thirdly, a security van showed up, not from the same county. The security company "General Transportation Administration LTD" yielded little results when I checked last year. When we left the Stones after being there for a little under 2 hours we were followed once we got onto the interstate by a black SUV for about 45 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Finally I noticed that the building directly across the street and behind the rows of trees is pretty odd. The way the trees are arranged makes it to where the building has a perfect view of the stones, but pretty much nothing else. Check on google maps for a better view.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just posting to share and I was wondering if anyone else who has been to the stones has had a similar experience.

       The great seal with a caduceus and seal of Solomon on it are rather interesting. There is a vague company profile to be found online, looks like it's based out of Augusta. The address points to an ambulance service building, which I suppose explains the caduceus. Could be a patient transfer vehicle.

       interesting, but why are they monitoring the stones? Augusta isn't very close, and the Van arrived about 45 minutes after we did. I have the license plate if anyone is interested.

       Did they take an active interest in you while you were there? There's always the possibility they had an appointment up that way, and were hanging out at the site because they were a bit early / had nothing else to do. That said, the logo, ambiguous company name, and lack of phone number on the van all point to something being unusual about them.
      </p>
      <p>
       First thing I thought of when I saw the great seal / seal of Solomon combo was this:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The caduceus is also connected to this, when you rule out the superficial medical connotation.

       She was clearly looking at us, for more than 1 hour. The stones are not near the interstate, took about 25 minutes through country roads off the interstate to get there. Interesting logo choice.

       A real-life observer can get out and stop an act of vandalism as it happens. Cameras are useful to identify the vandals, but are not capable of intervening, so there's a very real reason why you'd want to go with in-person security.

       No, but that's moving the goalposts. I merely answered a question to why you'd want to use personnel instead of a camera. I agree that it's not an explanation for the strange chain of events OP claims to have experienced, but it was not intended as one.

       Exactly. In fact you are only pointing out the thing which is actually off about this whole thing. So why is that guy accusing you of goalpost moving...Why would a security company
       <em>
        follow
       </em>
       a common vacationer? Thats the conspiracy here.

       By "following the visitors" do you mean driving to the interstate.  Have you ever driven on state highways?  It's not unusual for the same car to be behind you for half an hour or more.

       Every time I see these stones, my first reaction is a deep disgust, followed by the urge to knock them over and grind them to dust.  I can't be the only one who reacts to them in that way.

       That's your opinion of the stones and it isn't aligned with the actual purpose of the stones. They're for WHEN (since it's inevitable) society has to rebuild after the next massive disaster.

       Because they attract people and therefore business. Even if the stones bring in 20 people a month, they're going to be spending money locally. People all over the world have heard of these and they're pretty popular/eery. I can totally see why people in the community monitor one of the most popular man-made rock formations in the country. I can also see it being a nosy old lady on break or waiting for a patient.

       Interesting thought. I don't know enough about rocks to either dispute or agree with that, but supposing, then why would the water only collect at that part of the stones surface? Even when it appears dry everywhere else.

       It's also an ancient symbol of the roman god
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_%28mythology%29">
        Saturn
       </a>
       - Who is mostly  a god of agriculture but is better associated with generation and dissolution (or death and rebirth).  He's associated with Time, especially in relation to the changing seasons.  And the first consort he was associated with was Lua, a war goddess known for receiving the blood soaked weapons of conquered enemies of war.  When you break it down, it's pretty creepy for them to have a commandment about keeping the human population low, then surrounding the stones with a symbol of Saturn.
      </p>
      <p>
       Celtic Lore associates Holly with the time running from the summer to winter solstices, representing the darker half of the year.
      </p>
      <p>
       And in Christian mythology, many believe that the Crown of Thorns placed upon Christ's head during the Crucifixion was made of Holly twigs.  So if you take this meaning, Holly was used to kill the savior of man.  There is some argument that whoever placed these stones is likely a member of a Lucifiarian cult, so placing something that harmed Jesus, who would be one of their enemies, is a pretty blatant slap in the face of anyone who knows that particular meaning of Holly - or a protective ring for anyone who thinks like them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, ringing this place with Holly, considering their likely religious bent (and anyone advocating for the genocide of 80% of man cannot be a good person, no matter how twisted their interpretation may be), isn't a symbol of love, light and joy.  It's likely targeted at some of the darker associations of the plant.

       That said, because of its spikey leaves, people tend to use it as a security fencing. Not sure if thats the case here, but it is a thing,though.

       It's basically a wannabe-Stonehenge engraved with a handful of Ten Commandments-esque guidelines (hence the 'guide' in 'Guidestones'). It was erected in 1980 by a dude who took every possible measure to keep his identity secret, and to this day we do not know who or what was responsible or even their motive. Because of this shadiness and the fact that the engraved ideals are an almost perfect match to those of the NWO, some have theorised that the Guidestones are some kind of sanctuary or temple the elites use for their occult rituals.

       We do know the company that was contracted for the job--the Elberton Granite Finishing Company--but there are almost no records of the actual customer. He called himself Robert C. Clark, even though that person does not appear to exist, and refused to disclose where he got the funding for the massive project in any more detail than referring to a vague society of 'Americans who seek the Age of Reason'. Tellingly, law enforcement saw no problem in a non-existent person spending a small fortune on a bunch of granite blocks in the middle of nowhere and did not intervene.

       It could, which is why I am not as convinced the Guidestones are a monument to the NWO as some others here are. However, that explanation becomes a bit problematic when we take all the shady surveillance into account.

       Elberton has never released exact figures, but an exec did go on record saying he thought Robert C. Christian 'a nut' and gave a quote several times higher than anything the company had ever done before to shut him up. Christian apparently accepted the ridiculous number without even

       You dont need to be rich in that area to build something like this.

       The region used to be a major league producer of granite. Lots of old quarries full of old equipment. Because of this, it wouldnt cost as much as you would think to make something like the gudestones.

       Interestingly, the guidestones were unveiled on March 22. Quite a few important things have occurred on that date, especially in later years.

       Not to mention that the number 322 (3/22) pops up not just in the Skull &amp; Bones logo, but also conspicuously in movies and tv shows. (For reference, have a look at the first few minutes of the first episode of "The Good Place".)

       It calls for the human population to be reduced to 500 million in order to make room for nature. Whomever made the stones thinks 7.1 billion humans needed to be culled.
      </p>
      <p>
       The last time the Earth had a population of 500 million was 2000 years ago during Roman times. Civilization was limited to the Mediterranean, Fertile crescent, India, and China. Northern Europe was a vast untamed wilderness, as was most of Africa, Central Asia, and both North and South America.

       but what's the alternative? and nobody said anything about culling. You made that up. theres a couple non-violent ways of going about this. forcibly sterilize the population withbill and melinda gates vaccines, fluoride in the water.. Or you could launch 7.1 billion out into space and let them colonize the stars

If the 1% redistributed all their wealth and suddenly everybody could afford 20 acres and steak everyday how the does that fix the problem?

       Fair enough, but wealth and resources are inherently linked. Typically those with the greatest wealth also have the greatest access to resources, well beyond what would be ever needed for their comfortable survival.
      </p>
      <p>
       Further to that, the paradigm that has created the ultra-rich class is one based on needless consumption, inefficient resource use, and the active suppression of abundant alternative fuel and energy sources (or the development of them). To encourage responsible resource use, longevity in product life, renewable energy, and local / low resource economies would undermine the very paradigm that created their obscene wealth to begin with.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Prove it. I do NOT believe in finite resources. It is a lie. One of the biggest conspiracies is that of artificial scarcity. Take a look at this picture:
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Hw4xDtd.jpg">
        https://i.imgur.com/Hw4xDtd.jpg
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Those are not sand bags. What you are seeing is millions and millions of tonns of grain that was purposely destroyed so that paradigm of artificial scarcity could be maintained. Every bag represents a life ruined. Every bag represents a malnourished child that had to go to bed hungry. This is a real life holocaust.
      </p>
      <p>
       I ask why are people not allowed to eat the grain that is rotting in the above picture? It is because scarcity is an artificial construct created by man's greed and the greed of the oligarchy that runs this planet. Poverty is something that is engineered by the powers that be so that they may control us as slaves. He who controls the food controls the people. Starvation is engineered by the powerful in the same way Stalin engineered the Holodomor genocide in soviet times. Starvation poverty is manufactured in modern times via a system of debt, wage slavery, and central banks creating money out of thin air. This money is then funneled into the pockets of the oligarchy who use it to buy up and hoard the world's resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       A similar artificial scarcity exists in housing where we have more empty houses then there are homeless people. Why aren't the needy given use of the empty homes? Why is the government taking housing projects built for the poor and tearing them down? These are perfectly good buildings. It is because we living in an evil greedy society than values
       <strong>
        things
       </strong>
       more than it values people.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a distribution problem not an overcrowding problem.
      </p>
      <p>
       A couple hundred years ago the De-Beers corporation figured out how to take an stone abundant in nature and make it more valuable by cornering the market and restricting the supply. We call these common stones "diamonds" but the truth is they are nearly worthless. It is a big scam. If the true supply of diamonds was sold on the open market the price would collapse. Diamonds would be so cheep you would be able to buy the handful and nobody would really care about them. The constraint that keeps prices high is purely artificial and also opens a paradox.
      </p>
      <p>
       The metaphysical nature of money is that it does not value abundant things at all but instead
       <strong>
        perversely incentivizes scarcity and destruction
       </strong>
       . Money is not a creative force, it is a destructive force. For example take what happened in Flint Michigan. In a monetized society a river of clean water has no value. However, if that river becomes polluted and destroyed then it can be monetized as something of value because clean water is now scarce. People will pay good money for clean water and it can be sold by the bottle. People will NOT pay if it is free and abundant but they will pay after it becomes scarce and is no longer available. The water bottling companies are making a killing in Flint selling to a captive audience. Do you understand what is going on here?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the paradox of abundance. If you destroy things then they become more valuable. That is a paradox. Destruction creates value in our world because of the inherent way money works. Money does not value abundant things but instead seeks to destroy what is abundant and make it scarce so it becomes valuable through scarcity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is another example. Would you buy air from a corporation if they sold it in a can? Most people would say no, that is a joke. Air is free and abundant. What if the air was polluted and you couldn't breath it anymore for free without harming your health. Then people would surely pay for it. Think it couldn't happen. It is not a joke. Breathing, something we take for granted is a luxury people pay for in heavily polluted China. Polluted New York and LA also have oxygen bars.

        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1xhppHAI7C8
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the reason FREE energy technology is suppressed by the powers that be because there is no price point on the supply and demand curve to sell limitless free energy. Energy must always be kept artificialy scarce for it to have value.
      </p>
      <p>
       When free energy is taken into account the sky is the limit is far as population goes. The Earth could have 50 billion people on it if we wanted to though I am not sure we would actually want that world. However, 10 billion is not an unreasonable number. There is absolutely no reason to cull the 7.6 billion down to to 500m. Criminals like Bill Gates should be put on trial for crimes against humanity for pushing vaccine frauds on people. The whole oligarchy should be jailed for plotting mass murder.

       regarding free energy..most countries won't even allow their citizens guns.  Do you think they're going to let you have more energy than a nuclear bomb? even a nuclear bomb is finite, what do you think you could do with infinite, free energy? What's preventing you from short circuiting the earth with your ZPU and blowing it up/or melting it?

       An individual device would melt or explode long before it reached nuclear bomb levels. The free energy is unlimited in length of time it can be used in that it never depletes and can be used to power a home or a car forever.

       "Let’s run through some numbers of food production and consumption. The world produces about 2.5 billion tons of cereals at present. A person needs a little more than 500 grams a day in grain-based diets, or 200 kilograms per year, which would be equivalent to one ton of cereals for a family of five. If we consider that the family would become richer and shift its consumption patterns to include more milk, meat, and eggs, it would need more cereals because animals would need to be partly fed with cereals. If we consider a grain-based diet with an already-moderate consumption of protein, current world cereals production could feed more than 10 billion people if distributed well."

       You don't believe in finite resources? Maybe go take a look at the Brazilian rainforests and how much they cut down each year. Or how the oceans are over exploited and depleting at an alarming rate.

       Now I'm not saying we should be killing people off, nor is 500,000,000 a reasonable number, but we need to dramatically slow our birth rate.

       That’s the answer, overpopulation is a threat to the planet and to humankind we are killing ourselves, the big problem is in our hands, don’t we see the pollution in our environment reflected in our health ? We  need a balance for or own survival, humankind isn’t helping at all. Harmony and balance.

       Maybe you should read them again. Yes, they were erected by TPTB. However, they are not an abomination. They are actual advice on how to beat them. Part of what they share is truth, because it is required as part of their contract in the lucifer experiment.

       Everyone gets hung up on the first like, population of 500m. This is advice, not a depopulation agenda. TPTB don't care how many slaves they have. Do you really think TPTB who are purposely keeping us sick through garbage food, pollution, pesticides, plastics, and heavy metals want us to breed for fitness and diversity?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you really think the TPTB who are focused on keeping us divided (Right vs Left, USA vs Russia, Christian vs Muslim, Men vs Women) want to see people united by language?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the TPTB who control humanity through war actually want to see people tempering their passion, faith, and tradition with logic and reason?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think they actually want to end war and set up world courts?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think they would like to end petty laws and useless officials?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think they want to give people personal rights?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think TPTB that rape and murder children want to prize truth love and beauty? To seek harmony with the infinite creator?
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think the TPTB that are destroying the planet want to protect nature?

       Georgia native here. Did a paper on the Guidestones while in college. My breakdown was that they were very creepy and I got slammed by my professor for even suggesting something like that. She was the one who organized a class field trip to see them.

       Probably because it reminds some of totalitarian style movies where everyone is basically a zombie. Stuff like this is used in repetition to keep people on the same wavelength and not question anything outside of these words. Almost like a brainwashing technique over time.

       I have replied a few times and have seen this pattern before. You get no serious response to any question and no feed back from any answer.

       Pointless. People like this are dismissive and a waste of time.

       The way I approach it is that I'm not even interacting with him. His mind is closed, he's just running through his set of responses and games. For all intents, he's not really there. So, instead of speaking to him, I try to gear my responses more to anyone else who might read the exchange. To use it as a lesson on how to spot and call out logical fallacies.

       Plus, I just really enjoy debate. Even if it is with the slimey, exploitative personification of the Dunning Kruger effect. :)

       I got a three day ban for calling someone an idiot on here... a regular user who has several subs he mods on.

       I think people like this troll to get victims mad enough to lash out then report and get them banned. Like a soft form of SWATting someone.

       Celtic Druids used the holly branches as magic wands used during mesmerizing rituals and ceremonies.  I do not know why they chose the holly tree.  Modern-day druids who mesmerize the people adopted the same symbology as they're ancient predecessors... hence the name Hollywood.

       I saw a documentary not too long ago where an investigator found out who RC Christian was. He interviewed the man who was in charge of the stone masonry company at the time the job was commissioned and persuaded him to reveal the hand written letters he had exchanged with this “RC Christian” guy. I just don’t remember what it’s called.

       It's definitely weird. But I can agree with "Leave room for nature", something humanity is severely failing at right now with overfishing, pollution, and deforestation. And most of that is in fact due to overpopulation and over consumption.

       I'm not convinced they are running security, to be honest. Maybe she really is taking a lunch break in between patient runs for some private elderly shuttle service. Looking at the lady in the photo it doesn't look like she'd be a big deterrent to anyone looking to cause trouble at the site.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand, the web site doesn't look to be fully functioning nor updated since 2014. The address they list doesn't seem to match up to any company there, but I'm not in DC to confirm that. There's a telephone number listed but I'm not too keen on giving them a ring either.

       Not trying to 'convince' you that she was security. The chain of events that led to her arrival pretty much told me that she was. There are at least 8 cameras there surrounding the stones, and the homeowner next door came out to stare at us a few times.

       The interstate is 45 mins from the guidestones. How do I know this? I live 5 minutes away, if I hit the one stop light in this town between me and it, then maybe it's 8 mins away. Security vans won't come, but the sheriff will. Surprise you're on camera as soon as you park. There's alot of vandalism, mostly because of exaggerations like this. Those "stains" are from a type of acid someone threw onto this stupid thing. This isn't impressive when you compare it to what else elberton does. We're currently constructing the Chuck Barry's tomb in Saint Louis. I used to work for the man building it.

       Celtic Druids used the holly branches as magic wands used during mesmerizing rituals and ceremonies.  I do not know why they chose the holly tree.  Modern-day druids who mesmerize the people adopted the same symbology as they're ancient predecessors... hence the name Hollywood.
