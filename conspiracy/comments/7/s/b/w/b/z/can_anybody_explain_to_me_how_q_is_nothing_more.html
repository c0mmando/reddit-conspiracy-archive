<p>As soon as he said, **&quot;TRUST SESSIONS!&quot;, I started to think this guy seems like he&#39;s being used by intelligence agencies to wrangle in more support for the puppet in chief among the conspiracy communities online.</p>

<p>They will continue to try and &quot;suck&quot; us into the political paradigm, particularly the conservative side, with psy ops and gatekeepers like Alex jones giving good PR for the current administration.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t jump head first into this shit, approach it with a grain of salt and ask yourself, &quot;if this is a psyop, what is it trying to get me to do? How is it affecting my core values as a conspiracy theorist? Is it reinforcing my non partisan, non political  stance, or incrementally getting my hopes up that the POTUS is a &quot;good guy&quot;?  </p>

<p>If he can get you to believe the bad guys are going down , and it&#39;s always &quot;just around the corner&quot;, then you stop actually being active in exposing the elites and awakening the masses yourself. The purpose of this psy op is not only Instill a trust for government within you, but get you to sit on your ass and hope it gets handled by outside forces. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a fake revolution. And I think they are doing this to divide the conspiracy culture/truth movement. We need to come to our senses here and not get caught Into bullshit traps like this. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve seen so many different theories on who or what Q actually is, I can barely keep the straight anymore between some people thinking it’s some advanced AI to it actually being the President. (I recall some screengrab of a tweet/similar from Trump where part of the message or something spelled: “DOITQ” (Do-It-Q) iirc. 
I can certainly see where there’s reason to believe it’s a psy-op/disinformation campaign, although regardless of what everyone’s own opinion may be, I think most can agree it’s quite entertaining. If it ends up being one big troll, I’d say it’s definitely in the top few. 
It’s possible it already exists and I just haven’t looked enough, but it would be interesting if someone compiled Q posts/predictions with coinciding real world events that were descriptive or accurate enough that one could conclude its more likely than not whatever Q post came before whatever event was accurate to the point theres more info leaning towards Q being right than being easily dismissed as (how another person put it) political horoscope, or very general, broad predictions vague enough that events that occur more often than not could be used as an argument that it was indeed predicted but otherwise unremarkable when considering the odds of “predicting” things eventually by shotgunning so many broad predictions. 
Instead of the partisan angles, for a change I’ll try to suggest another possible explanation (however unlikely or unrealistic it may be). 
With all the fringe science the CIA has experimented with such as MKUltra, Monarch, they’ve seemed to be pretty interested in mind control and the mind in general. Could it be possible the Q posts were engineered in order to study/assess some type of hive mind effect utilizing the large pool of internet users all discussing, arguing, and thinking over Q?
Or is it also possible that while Q itself may not be AI, by structuring the posts the way they do continually saying deep state operatives will be exposed &amp; taken down, by identifying people who are interested in the like and would like to see the shadow government dismantled, by identifying people sympathetic to that goal, they’re feeding massive amounts of data to an AI built to sniff out “thought crime” by analyzing and finding patterns in the data. 
All very far-fetched I know, just throwing something different in the mix for a change. 
The more time goes on and how far technology keeps advancing, I’m wondering more and more if Terminator could be mistaken as a documentary at some point in the future. 
Obviously not everything, but the core idea of a military AI built to autonomously control defense capabilities going rogue after becoming self aware or similar, seems a lot more likely to me than a lot of other theories people believe. Just my $0.02</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Q once literally said “POTUS is our savior”.</p>

<p>I’ve asked the same question you are asking here, for proof that Q is actually an insider. The best I found was a reference to the NY subway bombing a day before it happened. Feel free to check that post out for more info.</p>

<p>Personally I’m not convinced, but I will say it’s strange how religiously some people seem to deny Q presumably solely because he is obvious propaganda. I say it’s strange because, if Q really were pro-administration propaganda, it’s not unreasonable to think someone in the administration might be feeding him info to put in his posts.</p>

<p>Even if that is the case, I would assume he’s more of a pawn than an insider. All it would take is an email to the chanfag (did I get that right?) running the tripcode.</p>

<p>It’s strange, because there seems to be a disconnect on both sides such that it is very rare to find someone objective about Q. Mostly conservatives revere him as a prophet even though he’s never really said anything we didn’t already know from the news, while mostly liberals decry him as a LARP in spite of the fact that they also accuse him of being propaganda.</p>

<p>It’s really odd, and it kinda makes me think the true purpose of Q might be to sow division. People just can’t seem to stop frothing at the mouth long enough to even consider the other side’s point of view. Frustrating, to say the least.</p>
