       My Grandmother raised enough money to pay for her college education and become a teacher by raising chickens and selling chickens and eggs to her local community.

       That is simply not possible now.

       Those of middle class caste cannot afford to aquire the education (indoctrination)"required" to be accepted in the professional community without taking out loans of immense proportion.

       The new generation is paying big money to be indoctrinated into a failing system fueled by disinformation and "intelligence agencies" run amok.

       Failure depends on perspective. From the view of the "Deep State", the system is an over whelming success. They (unnamed, uber wealthy, and politically cunning, people that keep out of the public eye - hence "Deep State") are giddy with the success of the system. It is you and I who suffer.

       i dont think many people with higher level education believe their government tells them the truth and nothing less, but rather they understand that and live with it.

       Liberalism is like a cult, they think they are the "righteous" one and will operate on that mentality. That's how "The end justifies the means" was born. And also that's why they're such major hypocrite.

       Universities will fall to history. Think about it, the
       <strong>
        only
       </strong>
       reason a person would go to one in the past was to acquire a specific knowledge set that couldn't be acquired elsewhere. The internet has made that obsolete, now the vast majority of knowledge is available instantly and for free in your own home. Of course there is more to it than that, but I firmly believe we have reached peak university attendance. Soon people will smarten up and do their learning on the internet for far cheaper and benefit from a far broader point of view than your tenured uni teacher.

       The only issue with that is, you rely upon somebody else, your lecturer to interpret that news for you and therefore then pass that information on to you. But what if, your lecturer cannot differentiate between real and fake news. The truth is, academic minds tend to be less skeptical of news they read from 'trusted' sources and therefore have a fairly linear mindset on the subjects they teach. However, the truth is, all news is fake news in a way as all news will put their own twist on the information they get in order to tell it to you in a certain way, the way they see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The internet is the largest known library in human history, a lecturer is one man who has received preconceived conceptions from their upbringing and academic education that might not necessarily be true.

       You dont rely on the professor, the professor provides you tools with how you make conclusions based on available information. Academics teach through tested methods that are continually revised and updated based on results and data interpretation.

       All news is fake news? So then you dont trust everything you read online and yet you want to steer people to become solely dependent for their information from the internet?

       That is simply not true, academics do not continually revise and update their perspectives based on new information. If new information is learnt that completely contradicts the entire view on that subject of your professor, they will not change their entire belief system because that evidence contradicts it, rather, they will dismiss the new evidence. You can see this for example in the academic study of history. Learning history in an academic setting is almost all completely wrong and false because we have come to develop a broad consensus across academia on the progression of human history and it's 'evolution'. However, there is so much information and evidence that completely contradicts what we believe, that is completely dismissed, unspoken and not taught at all in the education system. So, if you are not receiving all of the information, how can you come to an accurate conclusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       On your second point, yes, because there is no place with as much counter information to every story you read like the internet. The internet allows you to read information, and then read the alternative to that information, and amongst all alternatives, you can use your own mind to make a rational distinction between all of the counter information you have recieved to make a fairly accurate assessment and lead to what is most likely the truth.

       Because it is not, if you want an example, contemplate Egyptian history, when you are taught that in the education system, which I have been, you are not taught of any of the major facts of history that would completely revolutionise the way we view the Egyptians, it is not mentioned, you may even say censored in order to perpetuate the view that we hold. You would never be taught in history that when talking of the Egyptian Pyramids that twice the perimeter of the bottom of the granite coffer of the Great Pyramid of Giza, times 10
       <sup>
        8
       </sup>
       is the sun’s mean radius.

       A trait of humans is, we do not like accepting when we are wrong, you can take examples of the past throughout history where new things are learnt by revolutionaries, those people are thought of as 'crazy' or 'idiots' by the system, when Darwin put to the world his theory of evolution, the religious world of the time called him mad.

       i'd love to see a source on the pyramid thing, as to who measured it to the billionth of an inch. or why you decide to multiply by 10
       <sup>

       or why the perimeter matters to radius. if we're doing perimeter should it correlate to circumference?

       youre measuring random items, multiplying that number by and random number, and then saying that it matches another random measurement. there is no logic there at all.

       And your questions on the pyramid and your skepticism on the measurements is understandable, because as said, none of it is taught throughout the education system. And, unfortunately because from what I can understand there is an alternative consensus to history, this information is willingly ignored. 
There is no greater comfort, than your beliefs unchallenged, and any challenge that starts to make you realise you were wrong is worrying to most people, as the saying states, ignorance is bliss.
Unfortunately, as I see a veil of censorship, unbeknownst to the masses, I can give you hundreds, if not thousands of sources, although because they are not through state organisations like, the BBC you are unlikely to believe them. Nevertheless, I will provide you with a source you can refer to, Erich Von Daniken, although, please when looking up the source, do not take your information from things written about him, listen to him speak and then make your mind up. He has extensively studied ancient history, it is his entire career, how can there be more of an expert in a field than a man who has devoted his entire life to the study of the ancients.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I would like to say in reference to your second statement. It is, seemingly random, the perimeter, as you have asked, has no relevance to the radius whatsoever. But that is not the point. The point is that the perimeter, when applied with minimal mathematics, exacts to the closest estimates to the suns radius, from a structure built thousands of years ago, there is no way to explain that down to co-incidence, or because there is no 'reference from perimeter to radius, so of course the evidence can be completely discarded'. What are the odds, of such an exact measurement completely correlating with the suns mean radius when multiplied 10

       Ancient-Code.com - The source for the measurement that I quoted to you. The site is controversial and I myself know that it is not always entirely factual, it is first filtered through the perceptions of the author, as all news is.
But don't let that throw you off guard, the source can be found on thousands of sites.

       Why would you need a source? It's quite obvious, when you see people who are academic, they usually have a certain perspective. There is no source needed, all you need is eyes and a brain to see.

       Perhaps, but every belief held by everyone is first filtered through preconceived perceptions before being held as a belief, as are all of yours. 
However, this point I am making is not down to bias, as I have made conscious efforts to understand the other perspective, although you may say that in itself was futile because I fundamentally disagree with it.
However, think for a second.
      </p>
      <p>
       Academics know everything they know, and understand about the entire planet, life and their area of expertise from things that they have been taught by somebody else, their previous teachers, and their previous teachers also had preconcieved perceptions of what was real from their previous teachers, and the hamster wheel continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why most academics, in relation to things with a general academic consensus such as history all seem to agree. Because they have the same perceptions from what they were all taught. If you wanted to hear an alternative perspective, you would either have to ask the minority of the academics who are casted away as 'crazies', mind you, wasn't Darwin when he put to the world his theory of evolution? Or, you may have to ask someone who is an expert in their field with no academic history. This is not 'making shit up', this is a genuine observation, one I am sure, if you think about it for a second, you may conclude the same.

       Being able to tell the difference between real and "fake" news (propaganda), and being able to interpret data and facts comes from the ability to think critically and paying attention to the world around you (educating yourself in history helps as well). You don't need to go to a university for that, just a library and the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sadly, a lot of people simply aren't interested in learning about how they are being controlled. So much information is out there for you to educate yourself, there's really no excuse for allowing yourself to be manipulated.

       It's so much more than just cost too. AI is going to revolutionize basically everything in the next few decades. An AI teacher is going to be able to
       <strong>

       </strong>
       combine the very best elements of the very best teachers, they are going to know basically everything, they will be able to competently handle basically any question you throw at them and they'll be available for one on one guidance at anytime of any day.

       Then add VR/AR for hands-on experience....Why in the world would anyone attend an old style university as anything more than a niche experience when there's an AI teacher available?

       It's not just about learning, but being
       <em>
        certified as having learned
       </em>
       by colleagues. I can imagine online universities that function just as virtualized versions of real ones, with networks of colleagues which certify aptitude based on the completion of a carefully curated curriculum, but I will never ever consider hiring an aerospace engineer based on his claim that he read all the relevant wikipedia articles.

       Yes I'm talking about online universities or any accredited (or non accredited) method of learning. What else would I reasonably be claiming?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm talking about them because they are and will be vastly different from today's college experience. A large portion of a college campus is devoted to extra curricular experiences; clubs, sports, sororities, these are all methods of creating a group identity. This is what was meant when OP spoke of indoctrination, a lecture is only a small part of it. The larger part is the immersion into social groupthink. Currently, if a person wants to learn to be an engineer, they are going to be indoctrinated into the social standards that are pushed on their chosen campus. Virtual learning will a. be devoted to learning the chosen field (with no reason it can't be accredited), and b. will benefit from a larger network of contributions then the handful of staff members teaching your topic at a university.
      </p>

       This is just how

       In fact, all it means is that the person will be indoctrinated by the social norms of the internet instead of those of IRL interactions. I don't know if that's an improvement, the social norms of the internet are fucking awful.

      <p>
       Much like AI, "decentralization" isn't a magic bullet that makes things better. A centralized curriculum, for instance, is essential to making the process
       <em>
        of
       </em>
       accreditation
       <em>
        reliable

       I'm not quite sure what stance you are taking. Are you arguing that universities will remain more or less in their current form in perpetuity?
      </p>
      <p>
       In your first paragraph you note how social norms work in the real world, then suggest an online learner would live in their basement? How does that square to you? The point is that people learn to socialize in their community; that's family, friends, people who live nearby or have similar interests.
       <em>
        Not
       </em>
       by the institution that is teaching them to be an aerospace engineer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next you imply that there would be no
       <em>
        curation
       </em>
       in online learning? Frankly, I don't see how it wouldn't ultimately be better. Instead of the small collection of people who were the best available at a university, you would
       <em>
        crowd-source
       </em>
       the best of the best. The curriculum would be better, the teaching methods would be better, the credentials would then be
       <em>
        more
       </em>
       meaningful.

      <p>
       You said this last time and I find it absurd given the things I'm presenting. I've not indicated in anyway that credentials wouldn't still exist. In fact they would be
       <em>
        better
       </em>
       because everyone having gone to the same school (decentralized online education) that is superior to any current school means
       <em>
        improved
       </em>
       standardization of said creds.

       Don't underestimate AI. Ray Kurzweil said AI will basically be at human level of intelligence in about 10 years. In 25 years, it will basically surpass all of humanity put together. We are currently at a point where you can sometimes talk to a computer and not even realize it's a computer. Think about the implications of that. In the future computers will literally have superhuman competence. They will be
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       better educators than any human alive today. They will
       <em>
        unbiasedly
       </em>
       know the best way to respond to any given problem a student runs into. They will literally
       <em>

       </em>
       the best methods to teach a subject from all of humanity. No human teacher can compare to that.

       Maybe you misinterpreted what I meant by decentralization in relation to accreditation. To illustrate my point, look at bitcoin, it is decentralized in it's operations and no one party has control, but there is still an agreed upon value of each coin. In the future a stable decentralized education system will define someones credentials far better than the fallibility of today's teachers.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's just no comparison. The education system of the future will be so far ahead of today's standards it will make us look like we're in the dark ages. The  university campus in it's current form will be obsolete.

       Having the money to start a rocket company is not the same as trying to get a job there. Musk can’t do anything technical related to his company and I highly doubt he is hiring someone to touch them that has “I googled it” instead of an actual degree

       There's loads of important info in every field that isn't available for free or cheap online. Technically advanced and current information is usually confined to academic publications. Without university resources most could never access this info. More knowledge than you can imagine is locked behind immense paywalls and seldom shared with the laity.

       Umm actually I do, quit being a crazy conspiracy nut. Just because you can't understand what is being written doesn't mean it isn't important to a particular field of research. That's kind of the whole idea of academic journals- present you findings with peer review- if it isn't good it shows researchers don't do this or this didn't work, if it is good then it can't be used to further research.
      </p>

       Pickup a current respected academic journal and you'll see what I mean. It's not like they're hiding some great secret it's just that the results of recent studies and any recent papers are published in these journals and not available without subscription.

       Not that it's relevant to my comment. People seem to conflate internet education with unaccredited education, but that's only an issue of ignorance.  The reality is you can already get a degree online, and that's something that will be common in the future after VR becomes prevalent.

       This applies to a degree, if and only if what we are informed about our capabilities to assimilate information is ONLY what we can gather with our primary sense organs and not somehow innately or in some other version of information extraction from the environment. Example: what I knew when I was of college age, has not necessarily been supported by what what I know in my later years yet what I know in my later years could not ever have been taught to me in any curriculum. I don't mean experience either. I guess I just mean certain truths.

       I don't have data to back this claim but it seems to me a liberal arts education was once more oriented towards creating critical thinkers. Teaching people to think critically is challenging and time consuming. In a word it's expensive. 
The social/cultural revolution of the 1960s seems in part to be a result of young people receiving educations on federal funding and then using that education against the federal government. The rapid deterioration of education followed and now financial institutions make fortunes off the bloated corpse.

       This is kind of my point. There's a whole generation of people out there who haven't set foot on a college campus in years who now believe, for whatever reason, that colleges have been turned into "indoctrination camps."

I didn't list my reasons for reaching my conclusion, but that doesn't mean I don't have them. Can I not say what I please. I don't mislead or pretend authority. I said I have no research to support my claim. Can I not make a claim? Downvote or argue against my notion. Don't give me shit about semantics.

       A college degree used to be something you didn’t need to be successful in the US. Going to college was prestigious and by the 80s nearly every kid who graduated either went to trade school, into the service, or college.
      </p>
      <p>
       The 90s went by and the university system went commercial with the complete backing of the government. Pell grants for needy kids vanished and were replaced with guaranteed, long-term loans. The guaranteed income allowed universities to hike tuition and with that came the need for more consumers, er, students, and everyone - qualified or not - was accepted.
      </p>
      <p>
       Universities expanded their curricula so it weakened the value of the degree. Enter grad school, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s a business, a bubble, and if it ever bursts it doesn’t matter because, well, the government can just make taxpayers foot the bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Education isn’t any worse than it was 50 years ago - there are just more useless degrees.

       I guess I'd want to know how you reached that conclusion? Did people really get a better degree 50 years ago?
       <br/>
       I see it as the way that we've changed education. As our knowledge has increased and the field of knowledge has become so broad, we have an increased need for specialization. So where we once had a biology degree, there are now degrees in botany, zoology, etc. Engineering became computer engineering, mechanical, electrical, etc. My grandpa worked at NASA with a degree in "engineering" (there were no subcategories) while my boyfriend is going for aerospace. Part of this means that some of the specialization gets pushed into a more advanced degree. It used to be that you could get by with a masters in psychology. But we've progressed so much that a doctorate is pretty much required at this point.

       Its not simple nostalgia.
      </p>
      <p>
       In case you havent noticed, history is full of these things called dark ages and renaissances.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a civilization declines from its peak into a dark age, it looks like this.
      </p>
      <p>
       So get the fuck off my lawn with that "it was always this shitty". Enlightenment ages were not the same as the dark ages.

       Hate to break it to you but the intelligence agencies have been manipulating and recruiting from the University system for at least as long as the intelligence agencies have existed. That’s neither a recent phenomenon nor a kultrul murksist plot.

       The open mindedness toward race and gender issues that universities tend to reinforce is actually close-mindedness to these people.

       When white people come back to their small towns from university and say "hey, let's be nice to our black neighbors," the townies get angry and accuse the university of indoctrinating the student.

       the arts associated degrees such as gender studies and womens studies are based on leftist ideology 
this is what i meant
liberal arts degree is not a useful degree in australia, for example, if you do a liberal arts (major in psychology), you can not be a practicing pscyhologist unless its a science degree major

       Either you don't know what you're talking about, or a liberal arts degree in Australia is very different.  Although, I don't know why someone with a gender studies degree wouldn't be able to think critically.  I know "gender studies" is the ultimate boogieman liberal bullshit degree to right wingers, and I would definitely never go in to it, but it is probably worth studying how gender effects the world.

       <p>
        I don't have data to back this claim but it seems to me a liberal arts education was once more oriented towards creating critical thinkers.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Universities are more geared toward critical thinking than they ever have been. Gender studies is great example of this, since it revolves around critically examining gender itself. Or, consider the proliferation of Marxists in history and philosophy departments who've been thinking critically about bourgeois liberal democratic society for generations, and hated for it the entire time. Yet the very people who claim to want more "critical thinking" seem absolutely terrified of this stuff. They say it's "attacking basics of Western culture" as though that would be a reason to
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       thinking critically about something.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's really at play here is that certain people hear an opinion they don't share, and say to themselves, "Well I disagree, and
       <em>
        I'm
       </em>
       a critical thinker, and so anyone who disagrees with me must not be thinking critically."

       I agree, however I think most with a liberal arts degree today are less familiar with the schools of criticism you're talking about. Educations content hasn't gone down hill but it's rigor has.

       I think that's partly true, but it's mainly the difference between undergrad and graduate education. It's hard to learn the critical, modern schools without first learning the prior schools they're criticizing. Most intro courses are going to cover the uncontroversial, "settled-ish" parts of their disciplines, and even people who major might go all four years without touching anything radical and contemporary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps what's really going downhill is high school education.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think another big part is that people are going to school with getting a
       <em>
        job
       </em>
       in mind,
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       critically engaging stuff except insofar as it pads their resume to do so. As a result, colleges respond to this demand with more practical and less critical curricula.

       I think it's intended to continue to mostly churn out workers for global capitalism mostly. Critical thought is thoroughly quarantined in a handful of liberal arts departments that are routinely mocked by the mainstream press for being "hippie dippie" or unpractical, with repeated calls to destroy their funding. Critical studies and their funding are assaulted for "undermining Western values" or "spreading immorality" or other such excuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think most pernicious and dangerous is the notion that college should be attended with job prospects in mind, that it should be a purely practical affair. Of course, this is not wholly a choice, as capitalism itself basically forces people to make their own education contingent on financial concerns.

       Uh it's not a secret that the Frankfurt School devoted much of their efforts to figuring out Nazism as a sociological and philosophical phenomenon, and became pretty much international experts on the matter.

       Universities are less oriented around critical think than they have every been. The only areas in which "critical thinking" appears to occur is in science and technology research. The humanities died when they abandoned the canon.
      </p>
      <p>
       The concepts of race, sexuality, gender, ethnocentrism, nationalism and presumptions of objectivity have largely been invented. They have been analyzed without the aid of statistics techniques (statistics - the most successful academic venture in the 20th century). Only a cursory examination of race would tell you that "whiteness" largely does not exist. The only legitimate category of race is "blackness" and even then, this is mostly as a political category (in that, being black predicts what your voting behavior is very, very well, where as being "white" does not). The concept of "blackness" as a cultural category is dominated entirely by individuals who think and act politically. Any critical examination of "blackness" would result in fairly discouraging realizations: that cultural "blackness" is highly violent, sexist, dangerous and an overall drain on society. Instead, the critical thinkers pre-empt these conclusions by pointing to unfair treatment of blacks, which is extremely true, but has no practical value, and has almost entirely a pragmatic, political value (not insulting your "allies", or not talking about uncomfortable truths).
      </p>
      <p>
       As for "presumptions of objectivity" nobody in the humanities has said anything that transcends Kant 's critique of pure reason on the subject. Derrida's entire method is in fact Kant's qualms with objectivity turned into a parlor trick (find a text, remove the context, demonstrate the inability of meaning to exist without a context). Presumptions of objectivity and critiques of them are more for the philosopher. The humanities have become merely philosophy without any rigor, and with even less humility. I refer to the modern humanities as "dickless philosophy" for this reason. Unfortunately, they have also, in the process, destroyed everything that made the humanities beautiful and human in the process. Which is why the humanities have been dead since the 1960s.

       volume decreases price. the more flu shots the lower price per shot. The more books you have to print, the more kids you have to process, the lower it costs to enroll them.

       loans give an incentive to push the price higher which creates a false market in that is different from one that tries to push the price down. dumping money and grants into an industry that gets more if they simply create a bloated system jacks up the price.

       Economies of scale reduce cost of creation. This has nothing to do with cost of acquisition unless there are competitors. For instance, it costs Apple 50 dollars to make an iPhone which sells for 300 dollars, and it costs Papa John's Pizza 1 dollar to create a large cheese Pizza which sells for 14 dollars. Demands influences what it costs

       it generally does if there is a free market pushing the costs down. very cheap phones and pizzas can be found, the price of a smart phone has dropped drastically since 2008 and is far more capable. In a subsidized market with forces encouraging the price to rise, even with economies of scale the prices (and costs) will rise. These tuitions are public schools, not private companies. the costs are real, they just created them to spend the money and grow the monster.

       Universities were meant instill liberal (open) ideals about things that could be and not to blindly follow the establishment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now you're expected to follow the mainstream ideas that campuses present, and you can't question them because you'll be labeled as intolerant.  You can now have "wrong" opinions.  I attended a liberal arts college, a lot of hate gets thrown at groups with dissenting opinions.  I was called a Neo-Nazi by a professor because I submitted articles to our conservative paper on campus.

       You can hear similar stories across campuses in the US.  What point are you trying to make.

       I'm suggesting my points of view aren't considered as valid on campuses, and your response is to tell me my viewpoint on the matter is wrong.

       No.  When I went to college, we WERE allowed to freely discuss ideas.  Now, if you discuss unpopular ideas or indicate that your are one of "those" people, you will be visited by the bias response team, sanctioned by the university, and potentially expelled.

       I am thoroughly convinced the growth in higher ed institutions is a direct result of banks trying to create a new bubble. More people than ever are enrolling in higher ed. Many who could not have afforded school in the past are now able to due to lottery funded state scholarships. These scholarships often make all the difference in affordable tuition. However tuition rates have been skyrocketing, so more and more loan debt has to be piled on to the relatively easily attainable state scholarship. 
Meanwhile the schools, focused on the bottom line like any business, put pressure on instructors to give passing grades so they can keep getting money from people who would never have been candidates for higher ed in the past.
The uni administrators make money off pushing more people through school and thereby make higher ed degrees necessary for many careers. Meanwhile banks fill the gap between the amount of money middle/low income people have and the price of the education with worse and worse loans. 
I really think the growth of higher ed institutions and their tuition rates is all about siphoning more money from the lower classes to the higher classes of bankers and investors. I don't doubt that those with power to do so take advantage of the opportunity to further indoctrinate, but as with most things the money is primary. Occam's razor. The siphoning of more money is the immediate effect and obvious motive. 
Likewise I think the process is mirrored between the banks and the automotive industry.

       Feds insure loans.  Banks or other private entities make loads backed by feds.  Feds also directly make loans.  Congress makes law that you can't have school loans discharged with bankruptcy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2005, Congress passed the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005, which made it so that no student loan — federal or private — could be discharged in bankruptcy unless the borrower can prove repaying the loan would cause "undue hardship," a condition that is incredibly difficult to demonstrate unless the person has a severe disability.  This was an increase over a 1984 law that forbid discharging of federal loans only, but allowed private loans to be discharged.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, knowing loans are easier to get, insured, and harder to discharge, colleges raise tuition several times over the inflation rate for the past 20 years.  And there you go.  School loan bubble.

       Vice Chancellors of universities in Australia are paid like CEOs of big corporations, because that is effectively what they are: chiefs of big business. I would imagine it is the same throughout the western world.

       Have you ever read Brave New World Revisited? He wrote it in 1958 and i would say its even more important yhan BNW itself. You can read the whole thing online free. It should be required reading in school but it might cause a revolt of the robots.

       I think it's more just economics. Universities are constantly looking for ways to increase revenue. Governments are doing the same. I view increase in tuition as a way to indirectly fund universities without having to socialize higher education. In other words, no bill making higher education a part of a person's natural rights would pass, due to the expense. So they use dumb 18 year olds as a vehicle to transfer money from the government to universities. Universities get their money, governments get indentured servants.

       This is 100% true about for profit "universities". But let me tell you professors at public colleges get sick enjoyment out of failing students who don't put in the work. If one student fails out, there's thousands of students who applied and weren't even accepted into the school who they can replace them with.

       Indeed, but there are positions which a Degree is not required, but the market requires it. And come on, women studies and other BS degrees are not required by the market in any ways.

       You need a BS or BS to get into grad school and to publish and do research. You never needed a degree to mine for coal, but you need more education nowadays for technology. People pushing this anti-university mind set are scary as fuck. They are literally pushing anti-learning. Yes, I agree some schools like George Mason University are mostly funded by the koch brothers but other schools are funded by big donors or the students themselves.

       Yeah, of course, cause being against having thousands of "universities" where people enter already with a mindset of "Partying hard" and enjoying the fraternity/dorm life is absurd. This is probably what education really means right? Pushing any idiot who can get a loan inside a building so he can memorize half a dozen of superficial shit that he doesn't fully understand for what is meant. Higher education shouldn't be by all means a right or privilege, but instead something that people with a higher capacity earn, so they can retribute it creating/doing something for society. Degrees nowadays have become participation medals, everybody must have 'em, and here the women studies comes, some people inside universities are so fucking stupid that you have to create some useless and totally flexible shit for them to "study", cause if you try to push some math down their throats they won't even be able to pass some ridiculous test.

       Which is ridiculous, someone with a Women studies degree its not more able or capable to do a research than someone who just got out of HS(which is the old University). It does make sense to require someone to have a degree to make a research about medicine or something like that, but those are the useful degrees(which have been being jeopardized too).

       Read "Subprime goes to college" from Michael burry, its the transcription of a speech he gave once, if im not wrong. This guy predicted the 2008 housing market bubble and profited over it, he even has a movie, called "The big short". This article talks about this, and he says that another 2008 economic collapse will happen again.

       I'll add that the academy which is separate from but linked to the university is the source of indoctrination in education. If education migrates into the tech realm more and more the academy will become just as dominate there. The academy primarily perpetuates dogma. It doesn't serve. If it were diversified and decentralized perhaps it would better serve humanity.

       Wrong. The academy is a more nebulous institution with its roots in universities. These roots can however be picked up and moved from one university to another. The university is the playing field and the academy is it's players and their culture.

       Gender studies is a useless degree for getting a job, but that doesn't mean it's useless to study gender as far as extending human knowledge.  What role gender has played in shaping human history and how it's shaping culture at the moment are things worth knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can't believe I have defended gender studies twice today but I just think it's weird that this particular specialized little field has been singled out as proof that colleges aren't benefiting society.  It's like people have decided that knowledge for it's own sake is pointless or stupid.

       I guess that's my point.  Does everything need a practical application to be useful?  There's a whole lot of human knowledge we wouldn't have if everyone was just worried about the practical application of everything.

       damn if thats bad, then its only a matter of time before the rot will creep in and the country as a whole will be doomed. Going to uni and dropping out then starting your own company has led to some of the greatest things that the world has seen. Now people are like i cannot afford to drop out!

       University teachings now-a-days are hardly informed by Marxism.  You think they're teaching Marxism via Calculus?  Or Marxism via English Composition?  Or is just the classes that are literally about Marxism that very few people take?   You don't have a strong understanding of what you're talking about and the "permanent thought control and class warfare", what do you even mean by that?  What you said was completely incoherent.

       Once again, you are off the deep end here.  Permanent thought control is what?  Are people literally permanently having their thought controlled, or their ideas are being informed by Marxism without them knowing it through the shady guise of "higher education" and that is "permanent thought control"?  I assume that at some point someone will press a button and the proletariat will rise up, then?  We don't even have strong unions in this country anymore, what are you talking about?

       It may come to that. It wouldn't be the first idea censored. How are you on teaching children that sex with adults is okay? That's an idea. That should be censored, right?

       Seeing as how marxism teaches people to never question the party line, that is what happens. Just look at the SJW movement. You won't, of course, but i'm mostly responding for the benefit of others.

       I don't think you know what Marxism is.  You are using the word to mean something completely different.

      <p>
       I have read Solzhenitsyn, I think you are trying to sound smart there.  It must be nice to live in a world where there are good guys and bad guys and everything is so simple.  There's marxists out there in the universities teaching everyone not to question them and if we could just get them out there then... I don't know, something good.

       That narrative is not based in reality.  I have never seen a safe zone anywhere ever, or a trigger warning.  Some student group goes out and makes a "safe space" one time for whatever reason and it gets passed around over and over by the right wing media until people are absolutely convinced that colleges are a breeding ground for Tumblr thoughtslaves.  Get out of your bubble and walk around a college.  Although there's a good chance it'll turn you trans, from what blog posts I've read.

       As someone who worked in a department processing students applications let me tell you most are thick as shit and probably don't even care about what they're studying. Waste of money for the taxpayer, waste of time for the students. A huge con and a joke. Also the attitudes on campuses are basically you're either one of us or we will attack you, sad fragile pansies who can't handle a discussion they don't like. Thought is gone and irrational feeling has taken over. Rip. A respectable institute has turned into a cancer.

       I have a funny story about that. A few years back, the Dead-related Dark Star Orchestra played a show on campus. The PRESIDENT of the university sent out an email to EVERYONE on campus (all students, faculty etc.) telling us not to interact with the Dead-heads who would inevitably come to town. It was hilarious, Cornell's uptightness clashes so hard with Ithaca's vibe!

       The elite is basically eating the next generation alive.   One of the most trajic things I have ever seen as they actually come out more stupid,  so its more like Hanibal Lecter eating their brains with fava beans level stuff here.
      </p>

       The elite had better not let any of those folks who wake up to mix up their coffee at Starbucks.   There might be a little bit of resentment.

       Sounds like they are logistically vulnerable in that case to interruption of supplies and personnel.    Also easier to target individual utility supplies.    Such large compounds must also be in rural areas I would imagine,  where the hotbeds of vigilantes are most intense.

       It is also no longer the 20th century. They have modern communications, news sources probably better than what we have, cell phones, CCTV, in short they have access to lots of technology that will help them know when the shit is about to hit the fan. Some, of course, will fail to get out in time. We can string them up. But, most will be smarter than in the past. They can also move faster, farther. Some of them will just hire private muscle. There will be plenty of guys who need a job and will be willing to work for food etc.

       Chaos would be a page turner,   there would be a new world to rebuild.   All bets are off on how that would work.    It would be better to be in a place further from the center of empire,   and place less fragile,   and in less denial.

       Yeah, when things go sideways, it will be tough. No doubts about that. Some of the megarich will have thought of these things and have their own power supply, water system, ethanol stills or bio-diesel rigs etc. There have been reports about some of them preparing getaways. But, for us, we will starve.

       The Subvervie-studies programs go by the name 'CRIS'. standing for, 'critical inter-sectionalism'.
      </p>

       Basically, that's a fancy word for trying to unit minority identities with convoluted feminism and Freudian-apology.

       Just a few of the phrases that stood out. I think you have some unresolved issues towards women in general, a lot of which seems to revolve around resentment toward's women's sexual autonomy, that are biasing your opinions. A long time ago I was that guy, and friend, I can tell your life will be much more at peace if you can learn to let go of that.

       As a current community college student, I can say that I almost fell into that trap. I was going to transfer to a public university that would've cost me about $17-20,000 for the (approximated) two years I would be there...and that's without room and board.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm now debating whether or not to stay at community college, because my "associates of science" degree actually only has a handful of science classes. The rest is just basic classes like english and algebra...3/4 of the classes I'm in right now I took and passed with A's in high school. The only thing stopping me from quitting atm is the fact that I'm going there for free, and my parents would be beyond pissed if I decided to leave and lost the scholarship...but still I feel like I'm wasting my time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am a STEM major, so I do plan on getting a certificate somewhere else...found one in another state that's a hell of a lot cheaper than a university, and nothing but courses related to what I want to do. Haven't made any solid choices yet...lots of stuff to consider and work out.

       In the past, the banking system used the "dream of owning your own home" to create the debt slavery situation of the home mortgage. This worked for a few generations until recently when real estate appreciation actually made it possible for an average person to work their life to pay off a piece of property and end up in a financially stable position or to hand down property to their children that made the next generation move up the class ladder and be in a better financial class than there parents or grandparents. The simple act of passing down real estate property over a couple of generations could make a significant difference for a large number of the middle class to make them less dependent on the wage slave system.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fast forward to today and they have created a system where higher education is nearly requisite for having any type of career. Couple that with tuition costs that require the equivalent debt to what used to be a home mortgage and you have created a class of wage slaves that have the same bonds of perpetual debt without the payoff of achieving ownership of real property as the outcome.

       Why are universities allowed to run huge investment companies where their investments are tax free? Why does the taxpayer have to pay wealthy universities, and in return the people are told they have to pay even more ever year to attend? Why are universities taking billions per year in payments from giant corporations?

       As a student from a predominantly engineering school, my university experience has been pretty apolitical, especially in contrast to what we hear other colleges are like.  While other schools put up safe zones, know that there still exist places where you can talk about quantum mechanics with any stranger at the gym without it being weird.

       Greedy fucking fat cats at the top tricking people into lifetime debt, and indoctrinating them with liberal ideals by a state funded education system that encourages globalism. It's almost a sick joke when one thinks about it - we are paying to be brainwashed... but as long as they have all-u-can eat pizza at the student dining hall and subsidized football tickets, we'll go along with the program!

       The real issues is that a lot of people who have no business being at a university are at the university.
      </p>
      <p>
       Historically the people who went to universities were,
      </p>
      <p>
       Wealthy, Intelligent, or Athletic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today there are people who have none of those attributes attending universities. And that devalues the university.
      </p>
      <p>
       When universities stated getting filled up with stupid, fat, and poor people. The mission changed. And the
       <em>
        value
       </em>
       of a degree declined as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       The institutions are not the
       <em>
        reason
       </em>
       for success, rather that already successful people attended them.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is where we went wrong. You have to "earn" your place at a university. It's not a right.

       There's this myth that Universities don't present contradictory accounts of reality to challenge students, but rather indoctrinate them into a pre-determined narrative. It's not true, and most people that argue this have probably never attended a university. Of course some states, universities, and professors will have their own biases and lean towards reinforcing their worldview in the classroom, on both sides of the political spectrum, but in large part professors are not Nazis tasked with beating a paradigm into the minds of young adults. What people often describe universities as in this regard is largely what public secondary schools are. Universities mostly present a much wider range of discourse than high schools. I've met some radical professors in the time I spent at university that made me question the rhetoric I've heard from every corner of academia, whether conservative or liberal perspectives. I even had a metaphysics professor that discussed the merits of conspiracy theories from a philosophical perspective.

       You dont rely on the professor, the professor provides you tools with how you make conclusions based on available information. Academics teach through tested methods that are continually revised and updated based on results and data interpretation.

       All news is fake news? So then you dont trust everything you read online and yet you want to steer people to become solely dependent for their information from the internet?

       Pickup a current respected academic journal and you'll see what I mean. It's not like they're hiding some great secret it's just that the results of recent studies and any recent papers are published in these journals and not available without subscription.

       Sounds like they are logistically vulnerable in that case to interruption of supplies and personnel.    Also easier to target individual utility supplies.    Such large compounds must also be in rural areas I would imagine,  where the hotbeds of vigilantes are most intense.

       Yeah, when things go sideways, it will be tough. No doubts about that. Some of the megarich will have thought of these things and have their own power supply, water system, ethanol stills or bio-diesel rigs etc. There have been reports about some of them preparing getaways. But, for us, we will starve.

       Why would you need a source? It's quite obvious, when you see people who are academic, they usually have a certain perspective. There is no source needed, all you need is eyes and a brain to see.

       Just a few of the phrases that stood out. I think you have some unresolved issues towards women in general, a lot of which seems to revolve around resentment toward's women's sexual autonomy, that are biasing your opinions. A long time ago I was that guy, and friend, I can tell your life will be much more at peace if you can learn to let go of that.

       Thank you for not helping. Where did you start your research if u would like to help? Is there a source for these extremely precise measurements? That would be an easy source id think.

       Ancient-Code.com - The source for the measurement that I quoted to you. The site is controversial and I myself know that it is not always entirely factual, it is first filtered through the perceptions of the author, as all news is.
But don't let that throw you off guard, the source can be found on thousands of sites.
