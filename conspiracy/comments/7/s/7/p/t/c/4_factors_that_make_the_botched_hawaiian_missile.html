       Got one for you around the botched Hawaiian missile alert. 4 different factors make this story terrifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) Intelihub confirmed that a NBC crew was spotted inside the missile bunker (where the button is pressed) hours before the alert went out. When interrogated, the news crew said they were swimming outside their hotel, but after pictures emerged of them inside the bunker, they admitted they were in fact inside but the timing was just a coincidence. Link here:
       <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/confirmed-nbc-news-crew-spotted-inside-bunker-that-sent-hawaii-missile-alert-just-hours-before/">
        https://www.intellihub.com/confirmed-nbc-news-crew-spotted-inside-bunker-that-sent-hawaii-missile-alert-just-hours-before/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Reports claim that it was a simple error where a technician accidentally pressed the wrong button. They even went a step beyond to release a picture of the supposed moron who activated the alert, with his activation password postit noted to his desktop... Reports came out that it is a known fact that these missile alert systems are required to have a 5 step sequenced process ending with a two person double key turn to activate the alert. How could one person "accidentally" click the wrong button?
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) ~50 people have come forward including a Hawaiian tourist boat company saying they saw a large explosion over the ocean.
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhto4f-NiQs">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhto4f-NiQs
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) Just a few days later- a similar alert goes off in Japan... And they again say it was an accident.
      </p>
      <p>
       What do you all think? Was it a mistake? Was it a test to see how civilians will respond to a missile threat? Or was there an actual missile that was shot down?

       That's not the point, this is the fourth version of the process of pushing that button I've heard. I'd like some external verification of the process, and hopefully their investigation will reveal one.

       The podcast 99% invisible talked about it earlier this week. They said the design of the menu was bad and it was easy to make the mistake because multiple menu options looked similar or something like that. Now, I’m not saying that is the case. They are just reporting info they had been told about the system.

       An accident? Certainly not. The media would have us believe that there is a single button for "send nuclear alert to all phones in the state". Bullshit. There are many steps each of which require a fail safe abort method and much higher authority approval before
       <strong>
        anything
       </strong>
       gets released. This was purely intentional - in both cases.

       Do you always ask dumb questions? Try to actually
       <em>
        think

       Right? Just like Healthcare.gov! This country is a bloated mess of kickbacks and payoffs leading to bloated budgets based on the lowest possible bids. This wasn't the 2 person system of turning the keys at the exact same time to launch a nuke. This is old software that probably hasn't been updated in forever, because they got lazy and thought...meh, we'll never need to use the "THIS IS NOT A DRILL" option.  That being said...It is 4 kinds of weird.

       Healthcare.gov was designed to fail intentionally. You don't get it, do you? There is treachery going on right before your eyes and it passes you right by. This little stunt in Hawaii and Japan was intentional to scare the people. It worked - unfortunately.

       Nobody wants a war. Therefore the ruling party must either con the people (Pearl Harbour) or condition them (TSA in Airports) to accept a war like society. The economy is shattered. This government shutdown is proof. Also there is a major power play going on that Trump is only

       winning. War is coming and this little Alert stunt is only the start.

       A couple of hypotheses go through my head.
1) Provoke a response from the US - starting a war.
2) Provoke a response from the US - to make Trump look stupid.  Don't discount this one, there are folks out there who would literally nuke an American city if they thought the end result would get Trump out of office.  In their mind they are Patriots protecting us from a greater evil.
3) Distract while 'something else' took place.  You could pull off a lot of shit out in the open broad daylight while everyone is running for their lives to hide after a missile alert.

       I agree - the statement regarding all of the fail safe's to trigger such an alert does not have any well sourced basis.  Therefore I tend to throw that argument out as well.  It's apparently not that hard to set these off by 'accident' (Hawaii then Japan).

       I worked in law enforcement and directly with IT near a nuclear facility. We had these computers, we called them “bat phone computers” they had one SINGLE purpose and were NEVER touched. Once a month a few members of the military would come in and run maintenance on the system and its backup. It was on a special generator all by itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that they are passing this off as a button you can click right beside the “amber alert” system is 100% complete lie. In fact, even issuing something like an amber alert is way more than that. You have to go through manually key in a bunch of info so it’s not done by accident.
      </p>

       My belief is the missile was real and it was shot down. They are keeping us in the dark to prevent panic/potentially prepare for an invasion.

       You place too much trust in the abilities of the US Military. Shooting down an incoming missile is possible in theory. But the reality is quite different. Actual battle conditions, in Israel, have shown this. That said, I do think that there is far more to this story then is being publicly known.

       Not necessarily.  If knowledge of the missile attack would provoke war (and with the wrong country), I can absolutely see it remaining completely hush hush.  I tend to think if it was a missile attack, it didn't come from NK or Iran.  Probably came from somebody else trying to make it look like it came from NK or Iran to provoke a response.  What if that somebody else is Israel/US traitors/UK/France/get the picture.....  Keep it quiet while we deal with the rogue SOB's.  Might never know the truth.  FYI, I also think this 'alert' is just as likely to have been a hack with the same intention of provoking a response.  I don't buy into the accident story.

       Playing devils advocate here just for fun as i do feel there is much more to the alerts than were disclosed; any proof/source of the multiple steps? Logic says its unlikely to be a single button situated in a badly designed ui but I remember reading a rumor that US nuclear assets launch code was left on something like 5 consecutive zeros for a large period of time (maybe cold war)so maybe there is some level of incompetence?

       Elaborate?  I could write a book!  With the exception of Tulsi, they're all pretty much corrupt and incompetent.  They have a nepotistic buddy system that ensures that no real issues are ever addressed, and nothing ever really changes.  Contracts go to their cronies with little to no oversight.  They do wonderful things like grant inter-island shipping monopolies to companies with a month waiting list to ship large items inter-island.  When it comes to anything important, they just can't get it done.  Do a search on the rail fiasco on Oahu.

       I knew this as soon as people believed 9/11 went down the way it did. Just because this sub doesn’t believe the official story doesn’t mean everybody in the world doesn’t too. The majority of people are fucking gullible as shit and believe anything the media says.

       Check public opinion polls, the majority of people know the official story on 9/11 is bullshit. There are idiots who believe the lies, of course, but they're a minority. The media will tell you that we are the minority, but public opinion polls show the truth clearly. Most people know the "mainstream" media and the government cannot be honestly trusted.

       Good point. I hadnt heard about 50 witnesses to an explosion in the Pacific. In fact I havent heard of any. The youtube video provides very little in the way of support for any claim there was an explosion.

       Lack of recorded evidence could be explained by the explosion happening too fast for anyone to get their camera out. Also, if there was an explosion I'd be more concerned about getting to safety than filming.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why those 50 witnesses aren't all on television sharing their story, who knows? I could see a lot of people not wanting to, but out of 50 there should be at least one who'd want to share the story. Maybe the news station won't believe them without the corroboration of the other witnesses, but it having been on a tour boat none of the witnesses know each other and so the one who tried couldn't get in contact with the others?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, why didn't any of the witnesses post their story online themselves? Maybe one/some of them did, but OP simply hasn't come across it?
      </p>
      <p>
       The story could easily be made up. But the lack of evidence by itself doesn't prove this guy is lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       If one wanted to figure it out, they could go through this guy's YouTube channel and try to make a determination as to whether he's full of it or tends to be forthright and honest, and use that to help make a judgment as to the odds that he's being truthful or not now.

       Considering all data flowing through the internet goes through a handful of spots before even going across the web, yeah, its totally possible. Thats the problem with the NSA, they dont collect some information, they collect EVERYTHING and they had to build a infrastructure with choke points to be able to scan everything. And on a side note, then use computer intelligence to find the things they are interested in, and im sure the little bit we know about machine learning available to the public is probably just the tip of what these things are capable of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, they managed to scrub most of the videos of the "aerial exercises" a few months ago, remember when people thought they seen a huge craft flying across 3 or 4 states.  Some of the videos did not look like craft flying in formation, who knows though. We truly live in the age of the bible where nobody knows what is real or not anymore, thanks to "fake news".

       If someone is socially isolated enough, then if something's not on the internet, they won't know about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most people have friends, family, and co-workers, though. I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure word-of-mouth is still a thing. If you're on the phone with your grandma and the phone beeps everytime you say the word explosion, both of you would know something's going on. If it keeps happening, people might start leaving their houses to talk to people in person.
      </p>
      <p>
       Facebook posts for example could be censored with the poster being none the wiser, but with live chats it's quite a bit harder to block what somebody's saying without causing a ruckus.

       I’m particularly interested in this rabbit hole because I know you do your research properly.
      </p>
      <p>
       Have you ever seen any evidence for nuclear weapons that you think looks somewhat credible?
      </p>
      <p>
       I’ve seen many videos that purport to be nuclear detonations. They look pretty convincing to me, but what do I know. Right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically, I’m curious to know why you apparently deem nukes a “hoax” when, if such a (classified) weapon did exist, any ‘evidence’ in the public domain would surely be misinformation anyway... such is the nature of ‘classified’ things, that knowledge of them must never be allowed to leak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it the physics of nukes that convinces you they must be fake? What was the tipping point for this particular topic?

       Nope. The archival footage is clearly fake, and even the underlying 'science' is obviously silly, once you take the time to study it for yourself.

       The massive amount of footage we have dating back to the 40's/50's which would be extremely difficult to fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am absolutely aware of the fact that some of the nuclear test footage we have been shown is bullshit, but most of it looks very genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just my own personal take on it.  I wouldn't consider myself an expert but I studied film/media production and stuff like this simply wasn't in the cards for a 50's film crew, even with government funding.

       See I have a feeling you wouldn't really believe in the reliability of anything, so how about instead you offer us some alternative explanations for how the footage was created.  Give us something to think about.

       Here is another theory:
We were hacked by an enemy country (Russia, North Korea, China etc.) to see if they could activate or deactivate the alert system. And they sent the alert out was the test to see if they could in-fact tamper with our system. They also infiltrated Japans same system.

       It is speculation obviously. It helps by sparking the conversation of another angle regarding these strange alerts. And to say that the possibility of a foreign power not having the ability to hack into any of our defense systems is pure ignorance.

       This is the only way I buy the idea that the two independent missile alert systems were both compromised to send a scary message. I'd definitely believe a nuclear missile was intercepted and shot down before I believe some random asshole infiltrated a module warning system just to cause some chaos and scare a bunch of people.

       My buddy thinks this is the most logical. There's no way that it was an accident and took them more than 30 minutes to respond to it. At least the Japan one was recalled in a few minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing I could think of is there was an actual missile, but I think we would have much more evidence of that if it were true, so hacking seems the most likely to me.

       Would we have much more evidence?  There aren't many folks sitting out in the middle of the pacific if this was a sub launch - nobody really around to see it.  I'm not saying this happened, but I'm not sure it would be so obvious - especially if it was disabled in flight (there are many ways to stop a missile without shooting it down with another missile, that's the last resort)

       It wouldn’t be a tipping of the hand. If they can hack the alert system, there are also far more harmful things they could hack as well. Not to mention, if the goal is to make the public confused and distrustful of the govt, then this incident being a hack fits well.

       The whole thing is a farce.  Think about it.  We all know what the consequences for false alarms are.  Looting, panic, traffic jams/accidents, possible deaths, hysteria, etc...  To say there are no safeguards to absolutely prevent false alarms is ludicrous at best.  Imagine if a false alarm went out in LA or NYC.  It would be devastating.  You mean to tell me Hawaii's system is somehow different from the other 49 states?

       "Pacific Command detected a missile, those systems DO NOT EVER SCREW UP, which means they shot it down, and it took them 38 minutes to confirm they destroyed the sub and another missile would not be launched. Israel is missing a sub."

       Hey Op, think about it... if someone had the goal of trying to hack our first-strike detection to deactivate it, where would they start?  Maybe a fake missile alarm?  Maybe to make all the NORAD systems light up on the grid?  Hawaii is probably a pretty good target isn’t it?

       There are several articles like this discussing missile alert protocol:

       It was a canned response that the news organization pushed to its app. Its like when a celebs or notable person's canned obituary gets posted. It would be like AP sending a bulletin to their app based on a US govt release. What happened in Hawaii was an official release through government maintained notification channels. The same ones that deliver amber alerts, weather notifications etc. Thats why in the article it says NHK subscribers. Not japanese people.

       You other examples are not good either. Try harder my friend, a little thinking goes a long way.

       Agree - but can you really accept this degree of coincidence.  To me it looks like the hackers were only able to activate certain systems in each 'attack'.  Example, in Hawaii the sirens did not sound, but they did get the commercial systems (TV and Cell phones) to activate.  In Japan appears they only got the TV broadcast to activate - which sent alerts to phones with the NHK app.

       You are just focused on proving that the Japanese alert was a mistake. That's not my point by any means. If you think that these 2 events are not a coincidence- ignore this post and move on to something that interests you.

       The alert in Hawaii occurred via official government maintained channels. What happened in Japan was a news org fucking up. How is this hard to process? If there were two offical govt fuck up you might have a point but nothing points to anything supporting your pet theory.

       Considering in my 42 years of life, I've never seen one such f'up (I'm sure they have happened, but none I'm aware of), then we have 2 inside a 3 day span.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Frankly it's insulting to my intelligence that these are 'accidents'.  I questioned the official story on Hawaii, then after Japan I pretty much know there's something else going on.

       You keep saying this.  They are different but similar.
      </p>
      <p>
       Similar - A missile alert was ‘sounded’
Similar - A missile alert was not sounded across all systems that should happen in the event of a missile alert.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hawaii, Emergency Broadcast System and commercial EAS system was triggered.  Sirens were not.
      </p>
      <p>
       Japan - NHK  (Japan’s national public broadcasting system) issued an alert to users of their phone app.
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference I see is the scope of the alert.  Both are claimed to be ‘mistakes’. NHK sent correction quicker than in Hawaii.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bottom line, 1 day apart, hard to swallow as mistakes.  My best guess is hacks which were more successful in Hawaii.

       It might help if you express your point.  First you said ‘read the article’.  Then after copying and pasting from the article you continue to say your missing the point.  So what is your pioint?  That NHK did not send out inbound missile alert?

       Seems to me that asteroids or something are falling from space and showing up as unidentified missile threat, triggers the alert, but gets shot down before it lands and since it wasn't a missle there isn't a giant explosion, just a normal one.

       The only issue with this, is why wouldn't they just come out and say that it was caused by an asteroid? What benefit is gained from lying?

       Yea, seems like it would have been a good excuse even if it wasn't true.... maybe they didn't know what it was and just shot it down but had to explain the false alert before finding out it was a meteorite.
      </p>
      <p>
       The meteorite could actually be a ufo/jet that was blasted and melted into a hunk of metal rock.
      </p>
      <p>
       There have been a few meteor sightings, as well as a lot more planes in the sky, so who knows. The missile seems the least likely honestly.... I don't think NK is that stupid, we just think they are.

       So I am doing a research video on nazi rocket scientist Wernher von Braun and I inevitably came across his infamous bluebeam speak to Carol Rosin.
      </p>
      <p>
       He said the order of false flags occuring for space control were:
1) russians
2)terrorists
3)3rd world crazies
4)ASTEROIDS
5)aliens
with all of it being fake.
      </p>
      <p>
       But with recent events, could third world crazies be this situation? North Korea/Iran/whoever fired a missile omg!
      </p>
      <p>
       And even all of this asteroid/meteor news lately is also strange. Are they speeding things up or all coincidence?

       It was a hack!  By a foreign power likely China!  The purpose was to test our missile detection systems and see

        where
       </em>
       on the internet the signals originate!!

       What is scary is the

       <strong>
        deactivate

       the actual missile tracking/defense systems remotely.  Let that sink in...

       The alert system cannot be activated, as in it is not on the menu, unless the system reaches a given alert condition. This could not have happened without an elevated alert condition. Some element or multiple elements of the defense system likely indicated a threat, even if it was a false alarm. The notion that some goofball clicked the wrong icon is preposterous. More plausible is that threat detection systems are being evaluated and/or exploited. Spooky.

       I said this before, its far too much of a coincidence that both japan and hawaii had a false alarm. It is very likely that they are testing real world reaction to an alert.

       I think this is all pretty solid except for the eyewitness reports of an explosion.
      </p>
      <p>
       If NBC was present in the bunker hours before the alert, that would suggest the alert was fake.  A psy-op.  If that's the case, there wouldn't be an actual missile/object to shoot down.

       So if it was a missile being shot down, who fired the missile? i think the military is blowing up a few semi-big meteors with some new weaponry but i think it is just me believing that.

       Keep in mind Hawaii is the only US state that isn't in our NATO / umbrella alliance deal. In other words, if Hawaii gets nuked, unlike any other US state, our NATO allies do no consider it an attack on them.

       My buddy thinks this is the most logical. There's no way that it was an accident and took them more than 30 minutes to respond to it. At least the Japan one was recalled in a few minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing I could think of is there was an actual missile, but I think we would have much more evidence of that if it were true, so hacking seems the most likely to me.
