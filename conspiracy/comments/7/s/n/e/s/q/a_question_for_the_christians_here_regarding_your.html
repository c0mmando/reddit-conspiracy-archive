They hated him because of the unity and anti-authoritarianism that he preached. He was a threat to the power structure not their religion. And this only relates to those in power not the common folk.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a very simplistic way of looking at Christianity. Jesus and God are sorta concidered the same thing, him being the son of God and all that.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Christian, thouh not very devout (raised atheistic like most of us I assume), but I do sorta know Jesus died for our sins, not his.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if Jesus existed, nor do I care that much, like I said I&#39;m not a practicioning zealot, but when looking at the values Jesus presented (show the other cheek, be nice, don&#39;t steal, help the ones in need etc..) it seems to be A-OK.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the same with the ten commandments: sure it&#39;s all cheesy religious shit, but if those commandments were implemented and strictly followed, the world would be a nicer place...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait are you referring to the fact that “Christianity stems from Judaism”? Because one thing to point out is that Judaism isn’t based on the Old Testament. It’s based on the Talmud. The Talmud is what has those statements about Jesus.</p>

<p>The Old Testament is actually filed with prophecies about jesus throughout the whole thing.  </p>

<p>Keep in mind, the ancient Hebrews and Jews of today are two different people with two different belief systems. Jews of today are pretty much the same as Christians in the sense that they took the core belief (Old test) and made something new. </p>

<p>One can argue that the New Testament is significantly more authoritative than the Talmud. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you read the OT you will notice that the Jews today are no different than Israel was throughout the majority of their history with God.  They are denying him and rejecting him as they consistently do.  It&#39;s no different today.  Israel is blind in part to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  They are some of the hardest to get saved.  Salvation has been offered to us Gentiles because of this rejection.</p>

<p>Rom 11:25  For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. 
Rom 11:26  And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: 
Rom 11:27  For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. 
Rom 11:28  As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers&#39; sakes.</p>

<p>Once the fullness of the Gentiles come in (catching away of the Body of Christ) God will turn back to Israel during the time of Jacob&#39;s trouble and turn ungodliness away from them (Jacob = Israel)</p>

<p>All that one needs to do to be saved is repent of your curernt sinful, rebellius state and turn toward God and belive the Gospel of Jesus Christ who is God manifist in the flesh who&#39;s blood spirutally washes away all sin:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: </p>

<p>Repent and believe the above gospel in your heart and you will be saved.  Nothing you do can save you.  Only the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ saves:</p>

<p>Rom 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; </p>

<p>Isa_64:6  But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I had this great 50 minute uber ride with a young conspiracy theorist Muslim guy and we talked alot about the lies and large families and groups that control us etc..</p>

<p>We then went onto Religion and he said as a Muslim he revered Jesus because he prophesised the coming of Mohammed.</p>

<p>He told me to also ignore everything in the bible and just focus on everything that Jesus actually said. He said everytime jesus speaks in the Bible focus on those words only.</p>

<p>If i do this i will understand the truth.</p>

<p>Still to this day i dont know what he was talking about but i might one day investigate and see whats up</p>
