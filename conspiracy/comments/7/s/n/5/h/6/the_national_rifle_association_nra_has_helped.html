        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>In the linked article, it details everything from how greed, lying, cheating and outrageous payouts and salaries rule the day.</p>

<p>In essence, you&#39;ll learn you have no voice in the organization you trust to protect your rights. Their priorities have NEVER been about machine guns, silencers, or even semi-auto &quot;AK-47&#39;s&quot;, which past NRA President Heston said we had no business owning.</p>

<p>Check out Wayne&#39;s salary and payouts. MILLIONS of dollars a year and their internal struggles are about money and power. Your rights are nothing more than a marketing tool to gain more money and power. This is why they&#39;re backing the ATF rewrite on what a machine gun is, it&#39;s to clamp down on semi-autos, which they don&#39;t think you should own, and to use it as leverage (scare tactics) to extort more money out of you. </p>

<p>Interesting little tidbit:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The core issue was how the NRA’s PR company, Ackerman McQueen, was drawing millions of dollars a year from the organization and improperly controlling NRA staff. The Board directed Wayne to sever ties with Ack-Mac, and Wayne promised to do so, then claimed to have done so, by bringing in a new PR company called Mercury Group.</p>

<p>The “new” PR company turned out to be a wholly owned subsidiary of Ack-Mac, with all of the same players in all of the same positions, still bleeding the association of the same millions of dollars.</p>

And then these same gun enthusiasts put faith in the NRA defending them from this gun control, when really it was all a bid to sell more guns through fear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Originally after Vegas, the NRA came out and supported regulation on bump-stocks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The NRA believes that devices designed to allow semiautomatic rifles to function like fully-automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations. In an increasingly dangerous world, the NRA remains focused on our mission: strengthening Americans&#39; Second Amendment freedom to defend themselves, their families and their communities. To that end, on behalf of our 5 million members across the country, we urge Congress to pass National Right-to-Carry reciprocity, which will allow law-abiding Americans to defend themselves and their families from acts of violence.”</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The best way I&#39;ve heard it said is that the NRA is pro gun manufacturer, not pro gun owner. And I can completely believe it. Their whole business model seems to be fueling the fear of gun bans but when it comes to actually fighting for those rights, they have only a very specific set of rights they are actually willing to fight for. If I didn&#39;t have to be an NRA member to use my local gun range, I would have quit long ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They probably do get kickbacks, because they host a ton of NRA sponsored/sanctioned competitions and events.

    <div class="md"><p>Nearly every gun club and range I&#39;ve belonged to has basically upcharged (sometimes by 3x the annual dues) for non-NRA members.  I think the goal isn&#39;t screwing over people but getting many gun owners involved in the cause.  It helps minimize the free rider problem where people who are &quot;only hunters&quot; or something feel like they don&#39;t need to participate in gun rights because all they have is a shotgun.</p>

<p>I asked one gun club officer why the upcharged non-NRA members and he basically said they don&#39;t want free riders, and that the extra club dues charged to non-NRA members just got sent in as an NRA donation.  He said there was like one guy who got upset about the dues difference but didn&#39;t care that he was basically subsidizing an NRA membership because he didn&#39;t want to join.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always thought of this as just really good organizational discipline.  What makes the NRA effective is by being the &quot;primary&quot; gun rights lobby, eliminating the splinter politics of other advocacy issues where money and lobbying strength get diluted.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure the NRA has some problems, but mostly they seem effective and I don&#39;t buy the &quot;pro gun manufacturer&quot; argument.  There&#39;s plenty of compelling reasons related to shooting for buying a lot of guns and accessories, paranoia about gun control has nothing to do with it.  This is just an attempt to poison the well with gun owners.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It makes sense to get as many members involved in gun rights groups as possible, but I just don&#39;t agree with a lot that the NRA does and wish we were free to select other groups. I also sort of agree that there could be a bit of a problem with smaller splinter groups competing, but as long as you keep forcing people to be members of the biggest group then no other group can ever really hope to replace them, even if they are arguably much better groups for gun owners.</p>

<p>My biggest complaint with the NRA is their constant fear-mongering and super partisan politics. It makes it really hard to attract moderate and liberal gun owners when they are constantly screaming about how evil the left is and how if you don&#39;t donate even more money right this second then the liberals are going to take your guns and destroy America. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the big conflict between the NRA and a (perhaps even large) subset of gun owners is that they own a shotgun, a rifle (hunting type; bolt or lever action), maybe even a simple handgun like a revolver and they see the NRA as advocating for &quot;hard core gun nuts&quot; and being opposed to &quot;common sense&quot; gun control ideas that they, themselves, support since they believe those gun control measures sound reasonable and wouldn&#39;t really affect them or they types of guns they own.</p>

<p>That being said, I think that the forces of gun control really do want UK-style gun control where private firearms ownership is essentially banned and where it is allowed requires intensive law enforcement supervision, gun registration and so on.  Going after the AR-15s and high capacity handguns is just step 1, the &quot;sensible&quot; gun owner really is next on their path to near total gun control.  I don&#39;t think this is paranoia, I live in a really liberal city and have a bunch of liberal friends and they&#39;re all very opposed to gun ownership of any kind.</p>

<p>The only way it&#39;s really &quot;paranoia&quot; is that kind of gun control isn&#39;t <em>politically</em> possible in the US <em>right now</em>.  But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not where liberals want to go.</p>

<p>So the NRA really has to be sort of extremist, because if it allows those &quot;sensible&quot; gun controls -- and I&#39;ll admit, some have a compelling appeal -- it only enables the push for the next set of sensible gun control laws.  It&#39;s boiling a frog -- you just turn the heat up a little at a time.  </p>

<p>Look at states like New Jersey where owning certain types of ammo can get you in big trouble.  They jailed a guy traveling <em>legally</em> on an airline with a gun because his connecting flight got cancelled and he had to claim his luggage, including his gun packed per TSA rules.  This is in spite of a Federal law making &quot;safe passage&quot; through states with gun control laws immune from those laws.</p>

<p>I&#39;d actually be happy to bargain on some aspects of gun control, but it&#39;s a compromise -- if I agree to something like enhanced background checks or licensing, what do I get?  With my license or background check, what regulations will you lift on me?  Nationwide concealed carry?  The ability to ship my guns via FedEx across state lines to myself or another licensed gun owner?  Never have I heard a gun control advocate say they would allow increased liberty for increased scrutiny, it&#39;s always a take-from-gun-owners thing.</p>

<p>I do agree that the NRA is a little too eager to get in bed with a kind of Mike Pence style Republicanism, but I think that&#39;s just because they have to support some segment of the political spectrum to be successful.  I think the good news is that, by and large, other than endorsing/not endorsing candidates based on their gun control positions they are pretty good about not becoming a general right-wing advocacy group.  My state has a number of Democrats who get NRA endorsements because of their gun control positions, despite their other liberal advocacy positions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;Hard pro gun&quot; ? How do you show this to be true and not support NRA? What are those &quot;better choices&quot; ?</p>

<p>The NRA helps protect 2nd amendment rights including using their influence to help craft legislation that is going to happen one way or another. They don&#39;t sponsor the antigun legislation they represent gun owners when it&#39;s written.</p>

<p>Huge difference.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are better pro gun organizations out there, but the fact is that the NRA is the biggest and has the most resources behind it.  The left attacks them constantly because of this.  They want the NRA gone because the smaller organizations won&#39;t be as effective.

So I support NRA, in spite of the problems that they have as an organization, because the people who want to ban guns have made getting rid of the NRA a priority, and I would never do anything that could conceivably help the anti-gunners accomplish their goals.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What specifically is muh russia bs? And I&#39;m truly saddened by your other answer - partisanship will be our downfall. </p>

<p>The NRA sent a delegation to Moscow and met with Alexander Torshin (Russian central banker, implicated in Russian mob money laundering) and Dmitry Rogozin (Deputy Prime Minister of Defense). After, one of the NRA delegates (Paul Erikson) emails Sessions and Dearborn stating that the Kremlin wants to make contact with Trump. The email included:</p>

<p>“Putin is deadly serious about building a good relationship with Mr. Trump,” </p>

<p>“He wants to extend an invitation to Mr. Trump to visit him in the Kremlin before the election. Let’s talk through what has transpired and Senator Sessions’s advice on how to proceed.”</p>

<p>In the exact same month Torshin was trying to make contact through other means - through Rick Clay. Clay invited Trump to a dinner that would also be attended by Torshin, specifically so the two could meet. This email was passed on to Kushner, Manafort and others.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>&#39;lied to Americans that Obama was coming to take their guns away&#39;
Highly debatable, the Obama administration sought numerous paths to weapons control, including test flights of ammunition control and magazine limitations, not to mention the continued false labeling of AR-15&#39;s as Automatic Weapons in the never ending dialog claiming the 5.56 is some how more powerful than a .308 despite the obvious fact that a .308 is essentially a 7.62 and far more lethal both in range and accuracy. People who know little or nothing about weaponry seem to constantly engage in the debate as though they did know something about the subject. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s nuts.  Even if gun manufacturers quit making any new guns tomorrow, there&#39;s still many compelling reasons for serious hobbyists to buy more guns.   Many of of the ones I was interested in weren&#39;t even currently manufactured.  Part of the fun is finding <em>used</em> versions of what you&#39;re looking for, especially if they&#39;re harder to find.</p>

<p>No two guns (other than identical models) shoot the same, even in the same caliber.  Variations in barrel length, weight, trigger mechanism, etc, etc, all result in different shooting profiles.  Of course no two calibers shoot the same, either, even in guns sharing the same brand and frame size.  A S&amp;W model 57 in .41 Mag and a model 29 in .44 mag shoot differently, even if you load the .44 magnum to similar ballistics as the .41 mag.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a zillion accessories from the silly to the useful as well.  It&#39;s no different than cars or computers or anything else technologically oriented.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are completely overlooking the simple explanation: of the gun advocacy group is helping to write the law, the law is going to be less harsh on gun owners. </p>

<p>Examples: castle doctrine laws(the nra baby); revisions to the firearms act to allow interstate transport of weapons through states in which they are illegal (also an nra victory). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well I saw everything you posted in the part after you typed interesting little tidbit in the article but the rest of that shit is just hearsay. I let my NRA membership lapse when Obama got elected because I didnt want to be on one of his fucking lists. But the guy who wrote this article is just some cunt with a competing organization. Fuck him. The NRA is great. </p>
