        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>The participation of players in the national anthem before games used to NOT be a thing at all.</p>

<p>The Department of Defense pays the NFL big fucking money to promote the armed forces and whip up nationalism at their games as a recruitment tool.</p>

<p>“Until 2009, no NFL player stood for the national anthem because players actually stayed in the locker room as the anthem played,” ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith explained in 2016. “The players were moved to the field during the national anthem because <strong>it was seen as a marketing strategy to make the athletes look more patriotic</strong>. The United States Department of Defense paid the National Football League $5.4 million between 2011 and 2014, and the National Guard $6.7 million between 2013 and 2015 to stage onfield patriotic ceremonies <strong>as part of military-recruitment budget line items</strong>.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.truthdig.com/articles/pentagon-paid-nfl-displays-patriotism/">https://www.truthdig.com/articles/pentagon-paid-nfl-displays-patriotism/</a></p>

<p>I don&#39;t pay much attention to mainstream, so I don&#39;t know, but I seriously doubt that any of the &quot;news&quot; networks bothered to mention any of this information while they were covering the whole upset about players taking a knee during the Anthem.  </p>

<p>Pundits cried about the disrespect it showed towards our country, but the real upset behind closed doors is that the DoD wasn&#39;t getting the advertisement time nor the PR boost they have been paying for.</p>

<p>Tax dollars hard at work manipultating the populace.</p>

<p>Edit: No, this is not &quot;just marketing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Marketing&quot; for the Department of Defense that can&#39;t be recognized as such by the average NFL consumer isn&#39;t marketing.</p>

<p>It is military industrial complex propaganda inserted as subtly as possibly into a wildly popular platform.</p>

<p>Those arguing that it&#39;s &quot;just marketing&quot; are suggesting we all just go back to sleep and not pay any attention to the constant manipulation of the populace in ever invasive forms.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m fed up with all this mind control bullshit.</p>

<p>They wanna buy <strong>ad</strong> space during games and run their <strong>ads</strong> during an appropriate time slot or show, <strong>that&#39;s perfectly fine</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>That&#39;s not what they&#39;re doing, though.</strong></p>

<p>They&#39;re spending money infiltrating a sport to subconsciously influence all the brainwashed drones watching it. ** What they&#39;re doing isn&#39;t even recognizable as an ad to most people, and that&#39;s where the conspiracy lies**.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t advertisement. This is manipulation on a deeper level that I don&#39;t think is okay.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Excellent point. What would be so hard about creating a law that requires the acknowledgment of any advertising to let people know when they are being sold something. Seems pathetic that it’s legal to trick anyone into using your product using a “marketing strategy”. Pretty soon advertising will become a competition to find out how subtle it can be. Before we know it, we got ads left and right and no one can discern them</p>

<p>You&#39;re just trying to slide the discussion with semantics.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, not everyone watching sports is a brainwashed drone. But, the subconscious programming <strong>does</strong> affect those that are watching that are brainwashed drones.</p>

<p>Any one with a brain can differentiate between a sport they want to see and ads.</p>

<p>These aren&#39;t ads were talking about here. This is subconscious manipulation being perpetrated by the DoD which paid millions of dollars to underhandedly influence young men.  If these were paid advertisements that would be fine.... But they&#39;re not.  </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Following a huge crowd doesn&#39;t not make you a drone.  50+ million people watch the &quot;news&quot; every day and think it&#39;s real.  Their vastness of their numbers doesn&#39;t make the official fabrications they believe magically come true.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re idea of your viewpoints in life being vindicated is that millions of other people are doing it too, you seem to have gotten lost.</p>

<p>This is r/conspiracy, where 50+ million people doing something should be a red flag to any thinking individual.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just cause it&#39;s r/conspiracy doesn&#39;t make your tinfoil spinoffs right. Yeah the DoD pours IMO too much money into the advertisement with the NFL. However, alot of that money is seen back in what the NFL does for military personnel. Between free tickets to games, special practices and care packages they give back a good amount. Not to mention the charities that benifited from the NFL service uniforms (forgot what they were named). I mean are you really upset that a military is trying to recruit people? It&#39;s smart recruiting, not sure how it&#39;s a conspiracy at all. gotta do something better than those cheesy ass commercials every branch has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So, you&#39;re saying that we should all be okay with the commercials disguised as television shows (military recruitment propaganda inserted directly into something millions are watching) because the NFL uses that money to in turn do some favors for military personnel and some others can make a buck on the side too?</p>

<p>That is a fascinating perspective.</p>

That&#39;s what it&#39;s all about, and it&#39;s amazing what people will do to be in a group, to those outside the group, and to protect their own. Group mentality is engrained in everyone.

<p>&quot;On the contrary, there are specific laws and regulations for both the flag, and the anthem. These laws and regulations on patriotic customs stipulate that, during rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present, except those in uniform, should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First time I ever noticed hardcore military recruitment of young kids when I babysat some 10-15 year old boys and had to watch them play video games. It was so cringe worthy how apparent the agenda is in these games. They&#39;re training little kids to think, reflexively, that any brown person is the enemy and must be blown up or shot. Same treatment for any of their teammates who are acting like &quot;noobs&quot; or &quot;fags&quot;. Insert joke abour your momma here. 
The whole &quot;Killing people is fun and cool and everyone&#39;s doing it! You&#39;re a fag if you don&#39;t do it too!&quot; thing is so blatanly obvious i just dont understand how parents are allowing 10 year olds to get exposed to that in their own house. Over and over again, for hours everyday. Its sad. There would never be THAT much violence in video games if it wasn&#39;t being paid for by someone like the US Military.
It works, too. I just learned that one of those boys is going to college next year and plans on getting some law enforcement leadership degree or some crap. Sounds like a kid who is either too scared or too lazy or too smart to join the military or enter the police academy, but doesn&#39;t want to be seen as a total &quot;fag&quot; by his online friends so he&#39;ll study up on how to have a pencil pushing law enforcement job that will allow him to play Xbox in his parents basement well into his 40s.</p>

<p>That, my friend, is a false dichotomy.</p>

<p>How about exciting games where the CIA-fueled false narrative of terrorists vs counter-terrorists isn&#39;t even introduced?</p>

<p>i don&#39;t think it teaches that specifically. only that factional violence is an acceptable part of life on earth and the basics of how to commit a mass shooting. i read somewhere that mass shooters who played shooters had more kills than their non gaming counter parts. because they are more aware of things like surprise, cover, and aiming high for vitals.</p>

<p>personally i like the contest aspect of shooters. could skin all the characters as robots and it wouldn&#39;t change the fun.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have direct experience with this, I worked for the Army creating games as part of their recruitment effort.  It is a PSYOP in their mind but it&#39;s not what you&#39;re thinking.  The Army went to games as a medium to communicate with kids because that&#39;s where their attention already was, not because they wanted to steer kids towards violence.  </p>

<p>I would recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Americas-Digital-Army-Anthropology-Contemporary/dp/1496201914/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1516820128&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=america%27s+digital+army">this book</a> written by an anthropologist who embedded himself into what was called at the time the Army Game Project.  </p>

<p>It was a dive into creating media that they could engage future recruits through led by a Colonel at Westpoint who was an economist who worked on finding new and cost effective ways to reach potential recruits.  As software developers we were constantly having to work in various requirements from the Army some of which were specific to technologies they wanted to showcase in order to get funding but by and large the effort was around being able to tell kids that they Army offered career choices other than being just a rifleman.  There was another thing going on in that the Army spends a ton of money through the military industrial complex to create trainers and simulators for soldiers.  By using video games, specifically the engine the Army licensed (Unreal engine) and the digital assets that we created for the game they were able to start turning around projects much quicker and cheaper than they previously had been able to.  This is why at the end of the game development project (it still limps along but is a shell of what it was) the AGP moved to the Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville Alabama.</p>

The R&amp;D for video games directly goes into technology for warfare. There is a place in your brain for every action. The finger movement on the trigger, which was in duck hunt and now on all modern controllers, programs that spot in your mind. When coupled with the sights and sounds that stimulate positive brain chemicals, people are unwittingly being programmed to kill.</p>

I&#39;m sure you have seen &quot;false flag&quot; said around here often.  Governments love false flags because they are very effective.

<p>I disagree. If you truly fight &quot;for your country&quot; then you should have no want of either of those things. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a mode of control and brainwashing designed to make people identify with the nation. It takes the borders between geopolitical units and uses them to divide humanity against itself psychologically.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t say that such divisions were <em>new</em>, just that they&#39;re harmful illusions we need to overcome, and nationalism is only the most recent incarnation.</p>

<p>The accident I mean is that <em>you</em>, as a conscious subject, were born into a body. The fact that you were born American, rather than Rwandan, is a matter of luck from the perspective of your soul/inner-subject.</p>

<p>Stand for the anthem and kneel for prayer. </p>

<p>However - the NFL kneeling was highly politicized to the point where everyone knew why the players were kneeling: Kaep wanted to shine light on disparities in the criminal justice system.  Other players pitched began to kneel fort he reason and also other reasons, like, we don&#39;t like our gov&#39;t; we don&#39;t like the path the country is headed down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Virtually every NFL broadcast I watched has noted that the players didn&#39;t used to be on the field, and that a return to the previous format may be in everybody&#39;s best interest.  But that is NFL coverage, not news.</p>

<p>I do not watch news, so maybe they didn&#39;t relay this info.  </p>

 I haven&#39;t watched a pro football game in decades.  I had no idea this was being mentioned during the games.</p>

<p>My assumption is that they never mentioned why it all started in the first place (DoD money) but, as you said, that&#39;s NFL coverage, not news.</p>

<p>If they wanna buy ad space during games and run their ads during an appropriate time slot or show, that&#39;s perfectly fine.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not what they&#39;re doing, though.</p>

<p>They&#39;re spending money infiltrating a sport to subconsciously influence all the brainwashed drones watching it. What they&#39;re doing isn&#39;t even recognizable as an ad to most people, and that&#39;s where the conspiracy lies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see that we&#39;re dominating the world with our military. I see our military <em>protecting</em> interests of the U.S., like South Korea, Philippines, Japan, Europe, and playing a game of Risk to ultimately protect the middle east oil fields from China and Russia. Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan all come into play in that game. This country has a vested interest in those oil fields. When we eventually don&#39;t, our military will be out of those countries. </p>

<p>That&#39;s the way it is. The USA is a player. If it and its interests go down, so does our freedom to sit here and vent on Reddit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I did read the article you linked to.</p>

<p>Did you bother to read my post? </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t appear so.</p>

<p>It is a verifiable fact that the NFL accepted millions from the DoD to change their programming and to use their players as patriotic pawn pieces in order to increase military enrollment.  </p>

<p>Your article link doesn&#39;t change that fact one bit, nor does the NFL declining to run an ad.</p>

<p>Please explain to me why you think it does...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But that was in the past, you&#39;re posting this as if it was still the plan in 2017/2018. If this is still true, then why didn&#39;t the NFL make an effort to force all of the protesting players to stand? The NFL even made a deal with Soros recently:  <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/4/nfl-inks-deal-george-soros-linked-social-justice-g/">https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/dec/4/nfl-inks-deal-george-soros-linked-social-justice-g/</a>
The DoD may have bought off the NFL in the past but now it seems they have been bought off by Soros. There has clearly been a pivot to where now the NFL seems to be against the promotion of standing for the anthem. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for the links.  I don&#39;t follow NFl drama at all so I have no clue what the most recent developments are.</p>

<p>My assumption is that the NFL realized that forcing players to stand (wow, sounds fun) would be yet again shooting themselves in the foot.  They&#39;ve lost enough money as it is. I&#39;m sure they want the whole conversation dropped as soon as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup, nobody in the NFL would say crap to Trump but for Trump coming after the NFL.</p>

<p>Mind you, Trump came after the NFL AFTER the majority of players had stopped taking a knee.  It was down to less than a dozen players protesting... THEN Trump came out and bashed the NFL.  So the NFL rallied.</p>

<p>Washington DC’s role behind the scenes in Hollywood goes deeper than you think.</p>

<p>Files we obtained, mainly through the US Freedom of Information Act, show that between 1911 and 2017, more than 800 feature films received support from the US Government’s Department of Defence (DoD), a significantly higher figure than previous estimates indicate. These included blockbuster franchises such as Transformers, Iron Man, and The Terminator.</p>

<p>On television, we found over 1,100 titles received Pentagon backing – 900 of them since 2005</p>

<p>U.S. Military Helps Create Hollywood Films on War and Warriors </p>

<p>The Pentagon’s partnership with Hollywood starts at this West Los Angeles office tower, where every branch of the military keeps a liaison office to the entertainment industry.</p>

<p>&quot;Our mission here is to get the Navy onto the big screen and the little screen every chance we get, with every production that wants to use us. I’ll be blatant about it: We’re trying to get the Navy out there.&quot;</p>

<p>And what do Hollywood studios want in return for giving the military screen time? &quot;Usually, it’s equipment. Usually, they’re looking for toys. For them, we’re a provider. We’re a supplier, like everybody else. And Hollywood, they want the real thing. If they can get the real thing, they want the real thing.</p>

<p>If you want the military&#39;s assistance, you have to give them five copies of your script. They review the script. They make changes to the script to make it conform to the kind of film that they want to see. Most Americans have no idea that the content of the films and TV shows that they&#39;re watching are being influenced by military censors, that the military or the government is telling filmmakers what to say and what not to say. </p>

<p>How the CIA Helped Make “Zero Dark Thirty” </p>

<p>When Zero Dark Thirty premiered in 2012, the Hollywood film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden became a blockbuster hit.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, the CIA secretly worked with the filmmakers, and the movie portrayed the agency’s controversial “enhanced interrogation techniques” — widely described as torture — as a key to uncovering information that led to the finding and killing of bin Laden... but the massive Senate torture report released in December 2014 found that the program was brutal, mismanaged and — most importantly — didn’t work. </p>

By the same token you could argue that we should have the most expensive military because our enemies are forced to develop even more devious means of subverting us, forcing us in turn into a literal arms race to prevent that subversion. </p>

<p>In other words, it’s geographically virtually impossible to invade us, hence the existence of ICBMs and SSBNs, which we then have to spend shitloads to counter. </p>

<p>I agree we need to stay on top of the cyber side of things, but I think we have that locked up, relatively. China will probably pose more and more opposition, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re as interested in us as we are in them. Anyway it seems like they&#39;ve simply adopted the effective American strategy: occupation by real estate investment. They are slowly moving into Africa, and are surely buying up properties throughout the West. Ultimately I think it will end in a wash.</p>

<p>I would say the same thing to somebody criticising fox news or cnn.  They are ratings driven news channel. If people stopped watching, they would be gone. </p>

<p>You presented a problem without suggesting any solutions. I suggested a few. You dont like them,  thats fine. What is your solution then? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The level of control exerted by the influence of the NFL on the minds of it&#39;s viewers fall under the category of Political Indoctrination. This is the level you will stay at until you become a problem. People are a problem from birth for those in power, so they put all under the next level of mind control labelled Pavlovian Psychology. In this level stimulus-reaction mechanisms are built like triggers into the human mind. Beware that you don&#39;t fight back or you will be put under the third level of mind control labelled Full Physical Control. This is where they put you in a cage, shackles or other restraints, and inject things into your bloodstream without your consent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, just off the top of my head here...it starts with how a memory is formed; it has every sense plus more wrapped into a single memory. I can only speak for myself, but I can remember best by focusing on the photographic, but I can switch to audio and hear music as if I was there, by only focusing. The body also remembers how it feels overall. There are many forms of stimuli. The one people forget is the overall feelings, so think about what we eat. Junk food is designed to peak the pleasure centers of the brain, and so the brain actually gets the same brain chemicals from sugar, that it gets from Heroin. As an aside by feeding kids sugar we are priming them to become H junkies later in life. This is a real conspiracy. Anyways so when you watch a movie you&#39;re warm hopefully, and comfortable, and happy because the sugar, and very alert/aware (in theory), and then come the sights and sounds and vibrations through the seat. It&#39;s the same at a football game. This is not something one can merely escape with a mental trick. It&#39;s engrained in the very form of your brain matter. It&#39;s there, but the brain doesn&#39;t access it all the time. That section of the brain only becomes active when you focus on it- or when you are accessing it, in other words. So when you go to game after game, drinking and eating the same thing you build that portion of your brain en mass. It builds new stronger associations, and the most clear, shortest path will be the one the electron takes by nature (by design some say). This trick is a trap, and it&#39;s one that correlates to other triggers like sex and violence. By reducing a man to his primal urges, the powers that be have justified aggression against all humans, wrapping them in a great controversy. East vs West, is a class conflict after all. The winner is at the top. The winner does studies on rats to perfect it&#39;s science of success in warfare. Without constant, total war, mankind would flourish and once again dominate the planet, but it seems we are entering a new Dark Ages. The light has surely faded.</p>

For example your blind competitive drive (you told me you&#39;d prove me wrong before I made my argument). Yet my argument couldn&#39;t possibly be fully formed in such a short comment. Perhaps we both have shreds of the truth and won&#39;t be able to match them together if we consider this about competition. You&#39;ve made it a fight. That&#39;s proof of the programming. </p>

I said Id prove you wrong because you are jumping to conclusions about me. It has nothing to do with competition.

    <div class="md"><p>This is literally not a conspiracy. The US military is an all volunteer force. Since it is a volunteer force they need to incentivize and attract people to join. The DOD has a yearly budget with money allocated for recruiting. Your dumb claims that it&#39;s brainwashing aren&#39;t mirrored by reality. Just look at social media and public internet forums. Supporting the military is not a popular opinion, which makes sense because the people that don&#39;t, and the people that don&#39;t understand a necessity for recruiting are stupid. So stupid that they also don&#39;t seem to get that the military doesn&#39;t just operate under free reign like the CIA/NSA, and they have their orders. Their orders come from elected politicians that (so many seem to ignore) choose what our military does.</p>

<p>Here have all this anger and drivel about how these people are acting during a marketing campaign disguised as patiotism.</p>

<p>It would be a real shame if volunteer numbers start dropping off because the military can no longer keep positive face on thier endless wars. It would be a real shame if they were forced to bring back the draft so people would wake up from the coma they&#39;ve been in since 9/11. </p>

<p>Maybe we would actually get marches in the streets to get out of these wars instead of muh whoohaa! Maybe then we would do something productive instead of having to vote for lying politicians.</p>

<p>They know this. They remember Vietnam and they know support for these damn wars is at or below that level. They don&#39;t have any more justification, but this Russia/Iran with a side of spooky terrorism bait is just enough. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My point was the lack of opportunity (jobs, jobs that pay enough) and the high cost barrier of entry to advancement. (college, technical training)</p>

<p>Doesn&#39;t matter if you have a high school diploma. I said nothing of minorities. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>A closer examination of the relationship between family income and military service reveals that the family incomes of those who have never enlisted in the military are somewhat higher than those who have served at the low end of the distribution (56.25% higher at the 5th percentile, 42.85% higher at the 10th percentile, and 8.57% higher at the 25th percentile), are no different between the 50th and 90th percentile, and are substantially higher (140%) at the 95th percentile. <strong>Therefore, among the working class, those who have served in the military have tended to come from poorer circumstances, while there is low representation of the children of the very rich.</strong></p>

<p>Indeed, additional analysis (not shown here) finds that the highest income quartile was significantly less likely to have served than the lowest, while the second and third quartiles were not significantly different from the lowest quartile in their likelihood to serve. <strong>In sum, the economic elite are very unlikely to serve in the military.</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>“When the economy slackens and unemployment rises and jobs become more scarce in civilian society, recruiting is less challenging,” said Curtis Gilroy, the director of accession policy for the Department of Defense.</p>

<p>“They are saying, ‘There are no jobs, no one is hiring,’ or if someone is hiring they are not getting enough hours to support their families or themselves,” said Sgt. First Class Phillip Lee, 41, the senior recruiter in the Army office in Bridgeport, Conn.</p>

<p>He said he had been struck by the number of unemployed construction workers and older potential recruits — people in their 30s and beyond — who had contacted him to explore the possibility. The Army age limit is 42, which was raised from 35 in 2006 to draw more applicants.</p>

<p>“Some are past the age limit, and they come in and say, ‘Will the military take me now?’ ” Sergeant Lee said. “They are having trouble finding well-paying jobs.”</p>

<p>Of the high school graduates, a few told him recently that they had to scratch college plans because they could not get students loans or financial aid. The new G. I. bill is an especially attractive incentive for that group.</p>

<p><a href="http://download.militaryonesource.mil/12038/MOS/Reports/2014-Demographics-Report.pdf">Department of Defense Demographics 2014 PDF</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since 2009, the recruiting environment has been extremely favorable for the military. This success is largely attributed to continued weakness in the civilian labor market, which has produced a prolonged period of historically high unemployment. Young adults have had difficulty finding employment; the unemployment rate for 16- to 24-year-olds ranged from 15.5 percent to 18.4 percent during FY09 through FY13. As a result of this economic morass, most of the services have consistently met their recruitment goals. In fact, the recruiting environment has allowed recruiters to be increasingly selective, so the quality of newly enlisted accessions is higher than ever before.</p>

<p>QMA report estimates that <strong>only 17 percent of 17- to 24-year-olds are available (i.e., not enrolled in college) and qualified to enlist without a waiver.</strong> In practice, the services typically deny enlistment to youth who score in the bottom 30 percentiles (i.e., category IV and V) on the Armed Forces Qualification Test (AFQT).6 Incorporating this criterion, only 13 percent of youth would qualify without a waiver, be available, and score above the 30th percentile on the AFQT. Disqualification reasons include medical/physical, obesity, drugs, conduct, dependents, and aptitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/IC0PXcE.jpg">There is a direct correlation with unemployment/underemployment and skilled enlistments.</a></p>

<p>So in conclusion, the military is used as an economic draft. </p>

<p>Anyways I joined because I was poor, and I wanted information and I was willing to pay for it. In the end the cost was too high. I didn&#39;t know that I was contributing to a dishonorable war. I asked to be a Mechanic so I wouldn&#39;t have to fire on anyone.
