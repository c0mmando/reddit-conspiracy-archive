They think that if the worm hole is opened the majority of the population couldn’t handle it. 
Peoples brains refuse to believe that other humans (especially if in a powerful position) are capable of such sickness. 
People would rather think it’s scare mongering than actually believe the truth. 
That’s why they call it red pilling but drip by drip. I showed a friend the Posesta art and he just said turn it off it’s sick. How can you look at that!

    <div class="md"><p>This is the problem - you conflate Pizzagate with relatively REAL examples of real abuse.</p>

<p>The Dutroux Affair refers to a real set of crimes. It has REAL perpetrators, REAL victims, and REAL legal testimony. </p>

<p>The Franklin Scandal, famously depicted in &#39;Conspiracy of Silence&#39;, also has REAL perpetrators, REAL victims, and REAL legal testimony. </p>

<p>Pizzagate has none of this - again, your link sends me to nothing more than hyped up &quot;concern&quot; over so-called suspicious art, Instagram posts and e-mails that are taken out of context. </p>

<p>Do you not realize that none of this would ever hold up in a courtroom?</p>

<p>You haven&#39;t read the links I gave you. If you did you would see this is more than out of context BS. Pgate is intimately connected with Dutroux and Franklin, it is the continuation. These cases didn&#39;t happen in a vacuum, were covered up, and didn&#39;t just &quot;end&quot;. To believe they did is incredibly naive. </p>

<p>I&#39;m very familiar with the Pizzagate &quot;evidence&quot; - it&#39;s associated with spirit cooking and pizza symbols and Lady Gaga. It is blatantly ridiculous and is patently dangerous. You cannot accuse others of a crime if THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF SAID CRIME. I do not see any convincing arguments that attempt to connect Pizzagate with Dutroux/Franklin. Again, the only &quot;evidence&quot; cited is trumped up accusations based on nothing more than the same stupid photos, paintings and language. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>You didn&#39;t answer the question. And are you f-ing kidding me? Every day, REAL abusers get a free pass from the legal system because of circumstantial evidence. They get OFF because someone forgot to file paperwork or submit testimony. Cases where there are REAL victims and REAL testimony often get tossed out because of various legal red tape. But you honestly think something birthed off the bright minds at 4chan would actually be a slam dunk in the courts? Jesus...</p>

<p>So many distractions and innuendos! Nice job! I answered your question with my question, which you understand but choose to ignore. And while other people are getting off on technicalities, our own elite are getting off because of the corrupted police, courts, and higher echelons of government. Dutroux and Franklin show how the cover up is done. And again- if all of this circumstantial evidence was found on an unimportant citizen, their local PD would be investigating. </p>

<p>I didn&#39;t question your intelligence. Ignorance doesn&#39;t have to do with being smart. It has to do with being aware of the facts, which you clearly are not. I also didn&#39;t say you supported abuse, nice strawman tho, bud!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never suggested you accused me of supporting abuse - I said that proponents of the theory often resort to that when cornered by requests for real evidence. Also, in no way did my comment suggest a strawman argument. </p>

<p>Nobody suggested that it was illegal and/or private information. It&#39;s just kind of sad use of your time, to be honest. Again - you want to help REAL victims of child abuse? Go get your Social Work degree and go work with CPS...don&#39;t waste your time playing armchair investigator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Typical insults always leveled against citizen activists. Nice job bud.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Citizen activists? Because you sit around and spam Conspiracy boards about &quot;creepy&quot; e-mail exchanges and pizza slices? In my neck of the woods, we don&#39;t call that citizen activism - we call that being bored and willingly immature. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve offered you everything you need and more. And you choose to remain willfully ignorant. I know you haven&#39;t read what I gave you, because there&#39;s a ton of reading involved. You think you understand but you really, really don&#39;t lol.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;ve offered me nothing other than the same re-hashed arguments courtesy of 4chan and voat. Again, do you have any real evidence or just your &quot;gut feeling&quot; that the Clintons were dismembering babies in a pizza restaurant basement?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I did answer the question, with my question. It is a form of rhetorical response. You know this, you choose to ignore it, like many other things. Have a good day bud!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rhetoric is relied upon when the speaker realizes he or she has nothing else to hold up as support. Again, you have no interest in responding to the question because you realize there is no answer - all you know is all of those creepy photos MUST mean children are really being abused! Oh, and you have a great day too, &quot;bud&quot;!</p>

<p>The youtube video isn&#39;t just any video bud, it&#39;s an actual documentary that was banned from airing on national TV. It interviews Paul Bonacci and Alicia Owens, two children heavily involved int he Franklin Scandal, and John DeCamp, the lawyer for it all and advocate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s actually a fair critique - as concerning as the Franklin scandal is, I&#39;ll gladly admit that there are several holes and issues with credibility.
