       This doesn't really answer your question but I thought this was interesting. I recently went back to school and in one of my classes we have to right a paper on "fake news." One of the first prompts is about pizzagate and how the "fake news" got out of hand and ended up leading to a shooting based around false pretenses. It's not even a discussion as to whether or not it's fake news, it's under the  "confirmed list" of "fake news" stories that we have to choose from. This is a statewide curriculum as I understand it for a master's program

       I guess it depends on what country you’re referring to. I have noticed a lot more stories in the news in the last year coming out about human trafficking rings being broken up and taken down.
      </p>
      <p>
       As someone who lives in South Florida, we see plenty of child exploitation arrests go down in Polk County. Sheriff Judd seems to have so many of these busts it’s almost routine to the point of being suspicious.

       It’s certainly no conspiracy theory
It’s FACT
They think that if the worm hole is opened the majority of the population couldn’t handle it. 
Peoples brains refuse to believe that other humans (especially if in a powerful position) are capable of such sickness. 
People would rather think it’s scare mongering than actually believe the truth. 
That’s why they call it red pilling but drip by drip. I showed a friend the Posesta art and he just said turn it off it’s sick. How can you look at that! 
I said it’s real n people need to wake up because until everyone thinks like me kids are going to continue to be sacrificed

       Does Pizzagate have any actual concrete evidence? Actual victims? Any testimony or support from law-officials? Or is it still just general hatred of the Clinton's and Democratic party disguised as a concern over "suspicious" Instagram photos and taken-out-of-context e-mails?
      </p>
      <p>
       Human trafficking does EXIST and needs to be combated. But Pizzagate is a 4chan fantasy.

       This is the problem - you conflate Pizzagate with relatively REAL examples of real abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Dutroux Affair refers to a real set of crimes. It has REAL perpetrators, REAL victims, and REAL legal testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Franklin Scandal, famously depicted in 'Conspiracy of Silence', also has REAL perpetrators, REAL victims, and REAL legal testimony.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate has none of this - again, your link sends me to nothing more than hyped up "concern" over so-called suspicious art, Instagram posts and e-mails that are taken out of context.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you not realize that none of this would ever hold up in a courtroom?

       You haven't read the links I gave you. If you did you would see this is more than out of context BS. Pgate is intimately connected with Dutroux and Franklin, it is the continuation. These cases didn't happen in a vacuum, were covered up, and didn't just "end". To believe they did is incredibly naive.

       I'm very familiar with the Pizzagate "evidence" - it's associated with spirit cooking and pizza symbols and Lady Gaga. It is blatantly ridiculous and is patently dangerous. You cannot accuse others of a crime if THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF SAID CRIME. I do not see any convincing arguments that attempt to connect Pizzagate with Dutroux/Franklin. Again, the only "evidence" cited is trumped up accusations based on nothing more than the same stupid photos, paintings and language.

       You didn't answer the question. And are you f-ing kidding me? Every day, REAL abusers get a free pass from the legal system because of circumstantial evidence. They get OFF because someone forgot to file paperwork or submit testimony. Cases where there are REAL victims and REAL testimony often get tossed out because of various legal red tape. But you honestly think something birthed off the bright minds at 4chan would actually be a slam dunk in the courts? Jesus...

       So many distractions and innuendos! Nice job! I answered your question with my question, which you understand but choose to ignore. And while other people are getting off on technicalities, our own elite are getting off because of the corrupted police, courts, and higher echelons of government. Dutroux and Franklin show how the cover up is done. And again- if all of this circumstantial evidence was found on an unimportant citizen, their local PD would be investigating.

       While it's kind of cute that you insist on calling me "bud" and questioning my intelligence, it really just goes to show what results from just about EVERY discussion surrounding Pizzagate. People ask for evidence - evidence doesn't exist so proponents of the theory just claim you're "stupid", "ignorant" or somehow supportive of child abuse. It gets old.

       Rhetoric is relied upon when the speaker realizes he or she has nothing else to hold up as support.

       The youtube video isn't just any video bud, it's an actual documentary that was banned from airing on national TV. It interviews Paul Bonacci and Alicia Owens, two children heavily involved int he Franklin Scandal, and John DeCamp, the lawyer for it all and advocate.

       The Voat links are heavily sourced and if you bothered to read them, which I know you didn't, you would know that. Attacking a source w/o reading it is the sign of a weak mind.

       So, because something wasn't aired on national TV equates it to being banned? That's a pretty extreme definition - and I'm not being obtuse. You want to be taken seriously? Use the correct words to support your argument, not rhetoric.

       Was "obtuse" the word of the day on dictionary.com or something? Again, I'm not being obtuse - I'm asking you to be accurate in your statements. The documentary was not banned. The rights were purchased and pulled at the last moment - this is concerning and certainly reason enough to consider it suspicious. But banned it was not.

       Owens spent time for perjury because she refused to recant the testimony of her abuse...after the FBI turned Paul Bonacci, who later recanted the testimony the FBI forced him to make. You need to watch the documentary. Alicia Owens was telling the Truth and it's why she was silenced.

       That's actually a fair critique - as concerning as the Franklin scandal is, I'll gladly admit that there are several holes and issues with credibility. However, there's enough legal testimony to suggest that something illegal and unethical occurred. I wouldn't recommend DeCamp's book because he isn't the most credible source - however, Nick Bryant's book is actually pretty well written and well sourced.

       Child trafficking is not a game, you are correct. REAL children are being harmed, abused, murdered. That is precisely why we need to speak about these issues with maturity and logic...
      </p>
      <p>
       ...but - and feel free to correct me if I'm wrong - no children (or even parents of children) have come forward to accuse the players in Pizzagate of abuse, no? So, when you say children are being put through horrific torture as evidenced by Pizzagate, my response would be, okay, what children are you speaking of?

       Yes, spending sixty-five thousand dollars on food for a social event is a waste of tax-payer money. Personally, I think tax-payer money should be used for more important things like, say, efforts to combat the trafficking of children.
