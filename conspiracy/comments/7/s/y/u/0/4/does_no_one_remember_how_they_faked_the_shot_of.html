       You'll have to try harder.  There is no flight path that minimizes exposure, it's a radiation belt.  The belts range from 400 to 36,000, it would take the Apollo rocket 1.5 hours to get through that, not 7 minutes.

       How does it being a belt imply this? Obviously a path perpendicular to the belt would reduce exposure compared to one that is at an angle, for instance.

       Try to get your facts straight before you try to make me check your math.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         There are two distinct belts, the first ranges from 600mi to 3700mi, and the second from (roughly) 8100mi to  (roughly) 37300mi.  This matters. By conveniently forgetting the gap between them, you're adding 4400 miles to the total exposure.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The "roughly" above is important because the second belt varies in width dramatically, and the Apollo missions passed through the thinnest portion
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The first belt doesn't fully encompass Earth, it can be bypassed completely, which the Apollo missions did. So that's another 3100mi you falsely include in your estimate.

       Copy&amp;paste, the same reply that I wrote to some other guy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Apollo flights didn't go straight trough the VA belts, but instead went mostly "above" them. If the Earth poles were straight up &amp; down relative to our orbit and the Moon was in equatorial orbit this'd be hard to achieve, but as it is, there are launch windows to mitigate the radiation risks.

       Apollo flights didn't go straight trough the VA belts, but instead went mostly "above" them. If the Earth poles were straight up &amp; down relative to our orbit and the Moon was in equatorial orbit this'd be hard to achieve, but as it is, there are launch windows to mitigate the radiation risks.

       Indeed. I once questioned the Moon landings, but since then been educated to know better. That was fueled by a book around the time internet was birthing, so I give myself that and the young age, but today as all information is so easily available, probably in the first 2 hits in google, it is baffling.

       Some conspiracies are an entertainment for me and I guess an escape method from something too. I guess those traits, the latter especially, could be quite significant for some and explain part of the believing everything at first youtube video -thing.

       Outer space is the biggest hoax of all time.  People really don't want to believe it though because then logically it points to there being a God.  I think that's pretty good news personally.  Not sure what the big deal is.  We've been lied to and indoctrinated our entire lives.  Knowing there is a God is better than occult space fantasies.  It's good news, be happy!  Now figure out who God is and what he wants.

       Uh no, this is nonsense. The absence of space would in no way logically imply there being a God, and the presence of space doesn't disprove God either.

       Maybe to you but it fits with Genesis, Job, etc perfectly.  The final decision is of course up to the individual but if one knows "outer space" doesn't exist then it changes the balance at the very least.  If it doesn't for you then that's you.  Many people don't want to have to answer to anyone so they will deny until they are standing before the White Throne of Judgment which is when they will bend the knee.

       I can't....I can't tell if you're insane or just bored. Water filters colors at different depths. If I was looking through any amount of water, say more than 30 feet, no matter how clear, ALL colors would be washed out. That's why you need a flash when you take pictures underwater even in Crystal clear water. Why can I see colors in distant nebula and galaxies?

       I didn't say you were underwater.  There is simply water above you.  If there is light on it it's blue, just like the ocean.  You only see the surface.  Imagine a light a few feet underwater in the ocean at night and you are looking down on it from above at night.  They can be different colors etc.  That's what we are seeing when we look up.

       Both is fine but it does mess with your interpretation of the Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance:
      </p>
      <p>
       Gen 1:16  And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also.
      </p>
      <p>
       This clearly says the moon is a light.  Saying it is reflecting the sun's light is man's knowledge getting in the way of what God is telling us in his word.  This is why they have created this deception.  It keeps people like me from believing in God in the first place and people who believe from being able to trust the word.

       That's because true born again Christian women know how to rightly divide and know that Jesus Christ's blood sacrifice was the end of the law:

       Rom 10:4  For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.

       The fantasy known as Jesus. Cool story. Too bad most don't actually try to emulate him. They just use it to placate their greed and desires.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is well known the Jesus myth was just compounded older myths.
      </p>
      <p>
       First mention of him was 80 years later. A magical human who could walk on water, end disease and suffering, starvation and pestilence. But he didn't.  And wasn't heard about until long after he was gone.

       It would have been well written about whole it was happening.

       And if he could heal lepers why is there still leprosy? Was he just a bit of a dick?

        Thallus reasoned that this was due to an eclipse. That is impossible, however, since Jesus was crucified at Passover, which was the time of the full moon. A solar eclipse cannot occur when the moon is full, since at that time it would be on the wrong side of the earth!

       Why are you taking the Bible literally?

       What about this:. 
"If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found, 21 she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death."

       I believe the law literally existed exactly as it's described back in those days.  What's your point?  Christians have nothing to do with the law of Moses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Col 2:13  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; 
Col 2:14  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;
      </p>
      <p>
       Unsaved people like to use this argument all the time when it's the equivalent of reading the US Constitution today and seeing that at one point black people only had 3/5th a vote and concluding "hey did you know black people are only suppose to have 3/5 a vote if you believe the consultation?".  That's simply not true because the 3/5th compromise was nullified in a later amendment.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn't even believe in God or the Bible until I discovered they are hoaxing everything about outer space.  You will have to figure that out first.  Even Christians that have fallen for the deception don't get it.

       Do you have a source for your claims? I believed that too until I grew up and looked at the evidence. Even your other post about SpaceX CGI "glitches" has been debunked by all of the posts in it.

       Carbon dating is just fake as "outer space."  Nations only exist for the slaves not for the elite.  They all work together to control the population.  All the conflicts between nations is manufactured.  Literally all the world's a stage and they put on a show for you.

       You will have to come to terms with the fact that everything you have been taught is a lie before you can figure this stuff out out.  Good luck!

       The moon is just a light.  It gives off a cooling light.  You can test this yourself by magnifying it.  Works just the opposite of sunlight:

       And the "cooling light" is because it had a direct line of sight to the sky, so it radiates heat more.

       Yes the proof is a verifiable repeatable scientific test that anyone with a magnifying glass and a clear night can do.  It's been repeated countless times.  If you don't want to do it to verify it yourself that's on you.  You cannot focus "direct line of sight to the sky" but you can focus moonlight and sunlight.

       Yes, and I've explained that the reason why that occurs is because the heat is radiated away when it has a direct line of sight to the sky.

       How would this be possible when the moon is a point of light? Do you even understand your own argument?

       No, I'm afraid not - the reason why it's cooler is because it radiates heat away. If the moon was a light, this would not happen. The opposite would.

        A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.  When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colours because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight.

       The white light from the sun is a mixture of all colours of the rainbow.  This was demonstrated by Isaac Newton, who used a prism to separate the different colours and so form a spectrum.  The colours of light are distinguished by their different wavelengths.  The visible part of the spectrum ranges from red light with a wavelength of about 720 nm, to violet with a wavelength of about 380 nm, with orange, yellow, green, blue and indigo between.  The three different types of colour receptors in the retina of the human eye respond most strongly to red, green and blue wavelengths, giving us our colour vision.

        This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in.  From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank.  The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses

       Have you tried that experiment? It works.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more, since the earth is at an angle to the sun at sunset, there is more refraction occuring, turning he light red - which makes sense given that red has a longer wavelength than blue light
      </p>
      <p>
       How does your argument account for different wavelengths of light? It doesn't at all. In fact it doesn't even explain how "inert gases" magically make the light blue.
      </p>
      <p>
       I look forward to hearing your argument on why the light can appear red.
      </p>
      <p>
       Wasn't it supposedly a magic ocean above the earth? Now it's inert gases? Why have you changed your argument?

       Why are you taking the Bible literally?
      </p>
      <p>
       What about this:. 
"If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the young woman’s virginity can be found, 21 she shall be brought to the door of her father’s house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death."
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are you taking a 3000+ year old book that's been translated and mistranslated literally?

       You'd be a fool to. Space does exist, I'm afraid. Sorry :(
