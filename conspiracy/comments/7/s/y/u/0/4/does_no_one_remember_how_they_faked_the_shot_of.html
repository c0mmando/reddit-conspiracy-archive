<p>There is no flight path that minimizes exposure, it&#39;s a radiation belt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How does it being a belt imply this? Obviously a path perpendicular to the belt would reduce exposure compared to one that is at an angle, for instance.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The belts range from 400 to 36,000, it would take the Apollo rocket 1.5 hours to get through that, not 7 minutes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try to get your facts straight before you try to make me check your math.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>There are two distinct belts, the first ranges from 600mi to 3700mi, and the second from (roughly) 8100mi to  (roughly) 37300mi.  This matters. By conveniently forgetting the gap between them, you&#39;re adding 4400 miles to the total exposure.</p></li>
<li><p>The &quot;roughly&quot; above is important because the second belt varies in width dramatically, and the Apollo missions passed through the thinnest portion</p></li>
<li><p>The first belt doesn&#39;t fully encompass Earth, it can be bypassed completely, which the Apollo missions did. So that&#39;s another 3100mi you falsely include in your estimate.</p></li>

<p>Apollo flights didn&#39;t go straight trough the VA belts, but instead went mostly &quot;above&quot; them. If the Earth poles were straight up &amp; down relative to our orbit and the Moon was in equatorial orbit this&#39;d be hard to achieve, but as it is, there are launch windows to mitigate the radiation risks.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<p>Gen 1:16  And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars also. </p>

<p>This clearly says the moon is a light.  Saying it is reflecting the sun&#39;s light is man&#39;s knowledge getting in the way of what God is telling us in his word.

<p>Col 2:13  And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses; 
Col 2:14  Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and I&#39;ve explained that the reason why that occurs is because the heat is radiated away when it has a direct line of sight to the sky.</p>

<p>How would this be possible when the moon is a point of light? Do you even understand your own argument?</p>

<p>A clear cloudless day-time sky is blue because molecules in the air scatter blue light from the sun more than they scatter red light.  When we look towards the sun at sunset, we see red and orange colours because the blue light has been scattered out and away from the line of sight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>￼</p>

<p>The white light from the sun is a mixture of all colours of the rainbow.  This was demonstrated by Isaac Newton, who used a prism to separate the different colours and so form a spectrum.  The colours of light are distinguished by their different wavelengths.  The visible part of the spectrum ranges from red light with a wavelength of about 720 nm, to violet with a wavelength of about 380 nm, with orange, yellow, green, blue and indigo between.  The three different types of colour receptors in the retina of the human eye respond most strongly to red, green and blue wavelengths, giving us our colour vision.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t even read the post, you just jumped straight to &quot;indoctrination&quot;!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This can be demonstrated by shining a beam of white light through a tank of water with a little milk or soap mixed in.  From the side, the beam can be seen by the blue light it scatters; but the light seen directly from the end is reddened after it has passed through the tank.  The scattered light can also be shown to be polarised using a filter of polarised light, just as the sky appears a deeper blue through polaroid sun glasses</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you ask for proof, and then ignore it whenever proof is presented. Isn&#39;t there a word for that - ignorance?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you tried that experiment? It works. </p>

<p>What&#39;s more, since the earth is at an angle to the sun at sunset, there is more refraction occuring, turning he light red - which makes sense given that red has a longer wavelength than blue light</p>

<p>How does your argument account for different wavelengths of light? It doesn&#39;t at all. In fact it doesn&#39;t even explain how &quot;inert gases&quot; magically make the light blue.</p>

<p>I look forward to hearing your argument on why the light can appear red.</p>

<p>Wasn&#39;t it supposedly a magic ocean above the earth? Now it&#39;s inert gases? Why have you changed your argument?</p>
