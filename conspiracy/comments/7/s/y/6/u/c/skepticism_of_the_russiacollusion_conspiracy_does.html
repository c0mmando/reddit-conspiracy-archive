       <em>
        Earlier today,
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7swvqm/reminder_skepticism_of_the_red_scare_20_does_not/">
         this post

        was on the front page of
        <a href="/r/conspiracy">

        </a>
        and rising.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        Soon after,
        <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">
         /r/topmindsofreddit
        </a>
        stickied a direct link to it. Now the comment section shows obvious signs of vote manipulation.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       <em>
        TMOR has increased their attacks against me as of late, and this includes regularly stickying links to my submissions and manipulating the comment sections.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       When I questioned the behavior of Israel I was labeled an "antisemite".
      </p>
      <p>
       When I questioned the policies and military interventionism of George W. Bush I was labeled as "unpatriotic" and a "crazy leftist".
      </p>
      <p>
       When I questioned the foreign policy/drone assassinations of Obama I was labeled an "extreme right-winger".
      </p>
      <p>
       And today, when I question the Russian collusion/bogeyman narrative I'm labeled a pro-POTUS Russian "agent."
      </p>
      <p>
       I find it interesting that expressing doubt or concern over the "official" narrative and policies of TPTB/MSM gets one automatically pigeonholed and "classified" by those who parrot and embrace the status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       They are attempting to use these issues to turn us against each other, when we should really be setting our sights towards the top of the pyramid.
      </p>
      <p>
       They'll continue to pull these labels out of their asses because honestly, at this point, it's all they have left.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just remember that if you get attacked by these partisan hacks, then you know you're doing something right.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when your posts are regularly
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/7sx41b/top_mod_axolotl_peyotl_defends_himself_as_a/">

       It's true...what's funny is they actually believe that just because their narrative is upvoted and any dissenters are downvoted...that's it..end of argument, mission accomplished..
      </p>
      <p>
       All they ever really manage to accomplish is to show they cannot be trusted to adhere to truth when it does not align with their agendas.
      </p>
      <p>
       We see this happening even now...on a grand scale in almost all political conspiracy posts that involve one topic and one topic only...Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet..we still have to listen to the babies cry that the sub is overrun with T_D shills...
      </p>
      <p>
       Well...the truth says different...everyday now we see the anti-Trump upvoted massively and the pro trump downvoted massively..
      </p>
      <p>
       And if you are one of the really unfortunate ones who dares to criticize Trump, his policies or actions of any of his cabinet (fuck you Haley..and fuck you too Tillerson) while at the same time call out the blatant propaganda spin from the liberal/progressive democrats...just get used to it.
      </p>
      <p>
       At some point in going to demand the right to call anyone who says this sub is now overrun with pro Trump users a fucking liar any time they do so.

       It's unfortunate that they've convinced themselves that they are somehow helping their own cause by subverting another community, but the fact that they're stupid enough to out themselves like this is a good sign. More sloppy work like this only makes the real skeptics and free thinkers take up their cause with heightened zeal.

       I love that their angle was to say stop posting all this partisan BS, when that was the opposite of what the post was about.

      <p>
       You're saying we need to detach our discussion of Russia from partisan leanings or else we will get stuck in the circle jerk of "oh you don't fully believe the Russia narrative, you're a shill, end of discussion."

       As one of the loudest voices that talks about Trump/Russia in this sub, the one main issue I have regarding skepticism is the intellectual dishonesty, or willful ignorance involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s one thing to look at the facts of the case and make your own determination, it’s another thing completely to just avoid the facts all together.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that people constantly say things like “where’s the evidence” despite a year+ of consistent uncovering of new facts on the case, four indictments of individuals with significant roles in the campaign, etc., shows that there is a concerted effort to sweep things under the rug.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day we’re all just users on a forum, we don’t have control over where the investigation goes. I just hope people are willing to accept the findings when they come out

       you mean facts about Mueller's past, the fact that the original hacking assessment was made by an Atlantic Council cybersecurity firm, or the fact that not even during the height of the Cold War did intelligence agencies make an official claim that members of the govt were "puppets", but oddly now they have because of meetings with diplomats, facebook ads, and amounts of dirty money that likely change hands every single day (and people have been pointing out but get called "conspiracy theorists" in every other context but "Trump-Russia")?

       "Meetings with diplomats" that campaign staff lied about. "Facebook ads" that were purchased by foreign influences promoting a specific candidate. "Dirty money" that may have been given to the NRA by Russia and then donated to the Trump campaign. This is the exact type of thing the above commenter is discussing, the complete rejection of facts and reason to push a narrative.

       People meet with diplomats. No one is ever saying meeting with diplomats is bad. Its the constant lies about doing so, which is suspicious. And they lie until its been proven they were there, and then the goal posts begin to get shifted more and more.

       There’s lots of sketchy stuff about Flynn. He got a plea deal. He won’t be arrested for most of the sketchy stuff he did, because he’s actively cooperating with the investigation. That’s what happens when someone flips, and that’s why people flip

       Care to explain this? Because the investigation into Uranium One is nowhere near finished..new indictments have been made..the FBI informant that testified shows once again that the FBI mishandled another investigation into something Hillary Clinton was involved in...

       This kind of bullshit right here. You use a false equivalent that attempts to accomplish two things...demean users on this sub that believe Manafort's actions and Flynn's actions do not prove Trump is guilty of collusion with Russia..while at the same time insinuating that anyone who believes that HRC may be involved with Uranium One should be dismissed.

       Let’s place this in the proper context, which was in a subject about
       <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-president-maryland-based-transportation-company-indicted-11-counts-related-foreign">
        the Mark Lambert indictment
       </a>
       , where he was arrested for trying to bribe Russian officials. It has a tenuous connection to Uranium One, and no real links to Hillary Clinton in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was commenting on the fact that there has been a strong effort to tie this indictment to Clinton in this sub (if you don’t believe me on that, I’ll find sources), even though there’s a few degrees of separation there.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is also an effort to describe the four criminal indictments in the Russia investigation as “having nothing to do with Russia” or “nothing to do with Trump” despite the fact that Flynn and Papadopoulos were charged with lying
about Russian connections (and have started cooperating), and his campaign manager and deputy being charged for being paid to lobby for the pro-Russia party in Ukraine while also helping to change the Republican platform to one that was exactly in line with the party they were lobbying for
      </p>
      <p>
       To see the Lambert indictment as having bad implications for Clinton, but the four indictments I described above as inconsequential to Trump takes extreme mental gymnastics. That’s what I was trying to say, I hope that helps clarify things!

        Is there evidence to suggest that the FBI did not handle the original investigation into the Uranium One deal correctly?

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There was no "original" FBI investigation into Uranium One or Clinton. There was, however, an investigation into a kickback scheme with a Rosatom subsidiary that was entirely unconnected to anything Clinton though.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's literally nothing to the Uranium One/Clinton thing, but mountains of evidence and four indictments to Trump's cluster fuck, and I'm the one mired in confirmation bias?

       Being anti someone doesn't mean you have to buy into every crazy allegation lobbed against them by some armchair expert. I'm staunchly anti-Clinton and I feel the evidence has shown a few times now that the uranium one scandal is based, like so many conservatives conspiracy theories, to be based on half-truths, misresprentation of facts and a general misunderstanding of how these government agencies operate. Can you show where some of these indictments resulting from the uranium one deal occurred?

       The only indictments so far are for the trucking company. But the Hill does a good job of laying out the "facts" surrounding the original Uranium One investigation and the mishandling of it. That's why alot of users on this sub are once again bringing it up.

      <p>
       The fact that some users are prematurely claiming the trucking company indictments link Hillary should not qualify as a reason to end all discussion on the possibility that further investigation into the matter is needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have 33,000 missing emails to account for...the possibility that some of those emails contained discussions about the Uranium One deal cannot simply be disregarded.

       I am curious as to how you feel about a Russian working as a campaign advisor for a US presidential candidate or working for the campaign of a presidential candidate in any capacity.  I feel like everyone involved in a US campaign should be a US citizen, or am I somehow wrong for thinking that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it is clear that Russia has been trying to influence our elections for some time now and they cant be the only ones.  The US has know about foreign influences for decades now.  The only thing that changes is the how.  Why has the US not done much to prevent this?  I think that given our own history of influencing elections abroad, it makes it difficult for us to effectively manage the situation.  But that is me.  What do you think?

       Very well said. This sub should be in the spirit of debate and I have personally had discussions with people who ask, "where's the evidence?" with complete disingenuousness. Its pure bait because they want to argue the minutae until nothing means anything. Don't fall for it people!

       If you don't work for a PR or marketing firm, you should consider it. Honestly. That's some great spin. I almost believed it for a second.

      <p>
       Your insertion about their cooperation is flat out wrong. All the statements and charges are online. Fun reading. They got them for lying, no more than that. In Flynn's case his contacts with Russia are well detailed, all of them occurring after election.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other two were for things done way before any of this Russian narrative was a gleam in Hillary Clinton's eye. They have nothing to do with anything. For every link you could dream up tying them to Trump, I could dream another tying their lobbying actions to the Podesta group and the DNC.

         willing to cooperate with the government

        <strong>
         undermine his ability to serve as a proactive cooperator.

        In addition, public disclosure of defendant’s arrest and the accompanying criminal charges may alert other subjects to the direction and status of the investigation.

       Can you paste from the article where it explains the connection of Trump collusion with Manafort. It spells out how Manafort was involved with Russians before the election began, but I can not see where it relates Trump as being involved with Manaforts dealings. This seems like unrelated things. The only relative item is the word Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like your making the argument of guilt by association, but if you know someone that is a criminal it doesn't mean that you must also be a criminal.

       You're complaining that people aren't interested in the Russiagate narrative. The natural inclination of this sub is to be skeptical of any agenda pushed on such a scale by the U.S. press.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the comments sections we often see comments equating an opposition to Russiagate as pro Trump, pro government, pro republicans, pro alt right. We've been called Russian trolls, Russian bots,  Putin's puppet, been told to 
 "Go back to Russia",etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes there are accusations of shillery coming from the other side too. But Axolotl's sentiment is one many here share. The constant agenda to demean those going against Russiagate seems much more pronounced to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Free thinking doesn't equate to equal opportunity of ideas. Pretty sure we all freely think pussy is awesome, amirite!?

       Ahhhh u/axolotl_peyotl good to see another wonderful post by you. Just for everyone's info, this specific mod has been caught numerous times banning people who disagree with him on this sub or call him out for his partisan politics. Let me go ahead and post a comment on the r/TopMindsofReddit sub that shows some of the comments he banned people for and how he abuses the threatening violence reason for banning people.

       The right wing propaganda machine also loves "DESTROYED". "NFL players DESTROYED", "Eminem DESTROYED 😭😭😭" REEEEEEEEEE EDIT: I got banned for this post? Lmao

      <p>
       Reason for Ban: Threatening, harassing, or inciting violence permanent

       You have the biggest victim complex on this website. People disagree with you, either respond to their replies with facts or don’t at all. You just post thinly veiled messages about shills and outsiders trying to tear down your righteous thoughts and posts.

       isn't this attacking other users of this sub?

       Well that didn't take long. Axol couldn't hold off on pushing more republican bullshit on this sub. Even after his little pity party self post saying he would stop being so political and grow up because he's a mod here. But he just couldn't help it. Let it flow baby. Just let the bullshit keep flowing. Must cheerlead for Trump and make sure this sub is a conservative circle jerk

      </p>
      <p>
       And let me just add here a little something; the reason other users 'portray skepticism of the Russia Collusion conspiracy as GOP and Trump shills' is usually due to the fact that the only evidence really presented so far against the investigation is the cooked up text messages scandal against some FBI agents. All the evidence we have currently points to there being no scandal at all whatsoever, and it just being an attempt by the GOP to drown out a very possibly huge conspiracy.

       I would say anyone who gives a fuck about actual discussion. This entire post is whining about how anyone who questions the russia collusion conspiracy is immediately struck with downvotes and has the conversation ended, when, in fact, he does the same exact thing (if not worse) than what he is whining about.

       I'm betting most of those who got banned when straight to TMOR to cry about it too.

       I still believe that there were clandestine sanction negotiations with the assistance of Russian intel assets, a deep history of money laundering with Russian organised crime at the Trump Org, and several counts of obstruction of justice that directly implicate the President.

       Seems to me that putting every post in contest mode for 48 hrs would make brigading a lot less effective whoever is doing it.  That said, the brigading from SB and TMoR is out of hand on nearly every post these days.

       Surely questioning the government, any government, every government, is something every conspiracy-minded person should be doing, so when someone, a mod as well, decides to be vocal about not questioning the government on what is a potential conspiracy unfolding before our eyes, it throws up flags to believers. So of course you get a lot of negative response to it. When people question pizzagate, or Uranium One, or Seth Rich, or 9/11, or a plethora of other conspiracies, they get a lot of negative feedback because of it. It doesn't matter who is right or wrong, it doesn't matter what the topic is, as long as it's big enough you will get a negative response if you go against it.

       And you think these types of submissions help your case? Or give people more ammo against you? You get harrassed, you don't show it gets to you, you avoid it, brush it off publicly, or make it stop. In this case you need the admins to step in to make it stop, and it looks like they won't, so your only other options is to ignore it or brush it off.

       LOL, I've been hearing about China and Russia "influencing elections" since the 80's... the people who are still claiming Trump was somehow involved are most likely just bitter losers.  Until the FBI comes out and shows actual votes being hacked/changed then I'm calling BS!!!

       Questioning the government and holding them accountable is what everyone should do as they work for is. Why a lot of people in this sub stopped doing that is a good question.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing wrong with being skeptical but too many in this sub completely deny it. I wish that were an exaggeration. Skepticism is not saying the investigation is about Hillary or Obama or whatever. It's also not brushing aside everything that has happened so far with the indictments.   That kind of denial will lead someone to believe you support the government because Trump is the government now.

       Hey, I guess it's unstickied now (nice timing?), just wanted to drop in and say thanks for all your good work. I checked the mod list and realized you're about the only peg left keeping this tent on the ground. The gentrifiers will be gunning for you, that's gotta be rough. Keep up the good fight. And log everything, hey. For science, if nothing else.

       Also, cheeky question, any chance that for your next self-sticky you could dave-chappelle your way around the story of what happened to the sub ~5 months ago?

       In the world where so many believe in a conspiracy Theory get they are not conspiracy theorist. Very interesting time to be alive. Also Russia hahahahahahahhshahahahahabaha how stupid do you have to be. It's great to watch them believe in this but not 9/11. Some communist bastard said if you repeat a lie long enough people will believe it, or maybe that was Hitler. But what's the difference right!

       you mean facts about Mueller's past, the fact that the original hacking assessment was made by an Atlantic Council cybersecurity firm, or the fact that not even during the height of the Cold War did intelligence agencies make an official claim that members of the govt were "puppets", but oddly now they have because of meetings with diplomats, facebook ads, and amounts of dirty money that likely change hands every single day (and people have been pointing out but get called "conspiracy theorists" in every other context but "Trump-Russia")?

       You have no ground to stand on when it comes to speaking about intellectual dishonesty...10 days ago you made a comment about how we should be anti-Hillary Clinton as well as anti-Trump..
      </p>
      <p>
       But whenever a Uranium One post is made...you're one of the first ones in it...saying there's nothing there...almost every single time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Care to explain this? Because the investigation into Uranium One is nowhere near finished..new indictments have been made..the FBI informant that testified shows once again that the FBI mishandled another investigation into something Hillary Clinton was involved in...
      </p>
      <p>
       And yet...you try to sweep it under the rug...constantly....you criticize anyone that even brings it up.

       This is called a double standard...so I could give a shit what you have to say on this sub.

       I know all the facts that are currently available, and I'm 99% certain that any current investigation is just another political witch hunt to distract Trump's base from the investigation he's currently under, in which multiple associates of his have already been indicted.
