       This "gap" you refer to is Illusory. There is no "left" and "right". There never has been. This is merely for the benefit of the government to give the population the Illusion of a choice. The polices never change...I wonder why?

       Really? Isn't the United States government killing people in foreign countries by Drones and other methods that has been on going through three Presidents and
       <strong>
        both

       There are issues that religion has forced onto society in whole. Some people just vote on abortion issues, that's it, they don't care what kind of person it is as long as they vote to stop abortion. So I think the gap is larger that you say.

       I'm pretty committed to the Democratic party because they typically line up with 90%+ of my social and economic views. I didn't love Hillary, but between her and Trump, she was the best shot at accomplishing liberal goals.

       On Benghazi, there were something like eight republican ran investigations into Clinton's role. I'm not sure how that's still something conservatives hammer her with.

       On abortion, the vast majority of people getting them aren't using them as birth control. Some do, but a very insignificant number. Why even debate that point?

       Your critique of Trump is just about his personality and the things he says. Nobody really cares about his past relationships or things he said 10-20 years ago.
      </p>
      <p>
       We care about conservative policies and stopping the country from falling down the pit hole of Progressivism, communism, and socialism which the Democrat party has wrapped its arms around because of the young vote and colored vote.

       I do not like his tax reform, I do not like his control of his party like let jeff session destroy medical marijuana reform which I think is extremely important for veterans as I am one. I do not like his position on family values as he is a huge hypocrite. He also let Mcconel stop pay for the military during the shutdown on that note though I was deploy from 2010-2011 when the government shit down and my pay was stopped and brewed my distaste for Obama. Those are my reasons I don’t care for him I never meant for this thread to be a political hate thread I was just curious about people opinions on left right party division.

       That and the basic human instinct to want to belong and be accepted.  I've said this before and was completely shit on but we are not meant to be taught that we as individuals are what is important.  We as a group are important.  Political agendas have pitted us against each other so that they can carve out and farm their own turf.  As a species were are and have always been stronger together, not apart.  It's a shame people do not understand this.

       This is my theory.  Political oriented people are fans of Red team/Blue team the way sports oriented people are fans of teams.
      </p>
      <p>
       IMHO more people should be sports fans so they can attach their undying loyalty to a non-essential entity.

       I'm pretty committed to the Democratic party because they typically line up with 90%+ of my social and economic views. I didn't love Hillary, but between her and Trump, she was the best shot at accomplishing liberal goals.

       On Benghazi, there were something like eight republican ran investigations into Clinton's role. I'm not sure how that's still something conservatives hammer her with.

       On abortion, the vast majority of people getting them aren't using them as birth control. Some do, but a very insignificant number. Why even debate that point?

       Why isn’t it Ik where your coming from but seriously. Division is the worst it’s ever been and it’s almost like the media and political powers are trying to program is to think this way. If it isn’t a conspiracy then explain to me your opinion the subject rocket?

       Its anti-establishment versus establishment.  You have party loyalty by those ignorant enough to suck up the disinfo from their favorite MSM outlet.  You have coordinated efforts to silence anything conservative and or anti-establishment on social media.  They want you to believe that establishment agenda is popular opinion and try to condition your thinking.  Most of the division you see on social media is manufactured.

       Missouri was particularly evangelical GOPs, in my experience. I was raised a Catholic Democrat, so it was like religious programming for me. When I went to CMSU (now UCM) is was like I could hear the banjos playing. I got in w the BSU because they were just so damn friendly, but it was during the 2004 election and the DOMA vote that when I walked out of church and thr cars had been fliered with
       <em>
        how good Christians should vote
       </em>
       that I started drinking, drugging and fuckin again, cuz man, fuck.all.that.noise.

       There are issues that religion has forced onto society in whole. Some people just vote on abortion issues, that's it, they don't care what kind of person it is as long as they vote to stop abortion. So I think the gap is larger that you say.
