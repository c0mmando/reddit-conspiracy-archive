I don’t have any hard evidence because I’m a useless lazy fuck, honestly I’m just pissed my phone is acting up but do any of you guys think this is really what’s happening or is it just me?</p>

<p>Not that I&#39;m aware of but I&#39;m not an expert in this area. There might be a way but I would assume it would be very difficult. I don&#39;t think Apple wants people reverting to previous iOS&#39;</p>

<p>No there isn&#39;t a way to go back unless Apple is signing the firmware for your given decide. iOS 10.3.3 is signed for iPhone 5s and below. </p>

<p>You can also downgrade any 32bit device (iPhone 5 and below)</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a solution, that&#39;s paying for your battery to be replaced every year and a half...   My phone is years old, no need to replace the battery because it&#39;s not deliberately slowing itself down.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>A phone battery degrades to 70% its original life after 2 years and it literally makes apps and your internet slower whether you notice it or not. This is well documented, common knowledge. Sure, you can get by with an old battery, but your wasting time that could be spent working to earn that $30 for a fresh battery. $30 vs $1000 for a new phone makes it a compelling investment when you realize the battery makes it feel like a new phone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It will speed up your phone. Batteries deteriorate quickly and they don&#39;t provide enough current for the processor to function properly. It&#39;s just science, but yeah it&#39;s also a poor excuse. Apple doesn&#39;t want people to know that batteries fade so quickly because then the question becomes why they aren&#39;t removable. What phone should I buy? I think the Note 4 is the last good smartphone. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Apple is fucking everybody and acting like it&#39;s not their faulty power management circuitry that&#39;s to blame. Plus pushing the latest OS updates to these older devices is the forced obsolesence scam. Jump ship, get a decent android for $150.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Paid a 3rd party repair shop down the street to put new batteries in my girlfriends 6 and my old 6S which I gave to my Mom. Once the phone gets a new battery and a settings reset it goes back to functioning like new. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Simple. Throw it the fuck out the window and go buy an android. Apple is a fuckin scam and you people should be smarter. Why the fuck would you oay 1000$ for a phone... 20 years ago phones were used to call people... thats it. Just remember that.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Techy here, so here’s what I think actually happened.</p>

<p>Apple use to use decent batteries that you could used to their full life cycles. They would of course lose charge potential over time, but you could still use them for years.</p>

<p>In the 6 and 6s they likely changed suppliers to a less stable or more diluted or even recycled lithium ion as a cost saving measure. Unfortunately this halved the actual life of the battery despite the fact it should be able to still hold more of a charge especially when compared to the lithium ion batteries we had in older iPhones. In other words, they knowingly shipped defective batteries.</p>

<p>The issue didn’t become obvious until a year later when iPhones just randomly started shutting off. Instead of issuing a recall for tens of millions of iPhones or offering cheaper repairs they created a software solution to degrade the performance of the phone to artificially extend battery life so users wouldn’t notice the defective battery. The degraded performance however compromised the integrity of the OS and apps optimized for the full spec hardware. This is why apps and even iOS itself become buggy. They’re not getting enough performance from the hardware to execute processes properly.</p>

<p>Apple implemented this software fix based merely on lifecycle of the battery being cycled. So when you’re phone battery hits a specific programmed number of power cycles the phone throttles down into a lower power mode so that users experience noticeably the same battery life as when the phone was new without the risk of it randomly shutting off when below 30% battery. </p>

<p>This of course comprises the performance of the phone and since the life cycle number is programmed once you hit that number your phone throttles. The only thing you can do at this point is replace the battery and reset the phone to restore full function or wait for 11.3 in the spring when they give you an option to turn throttling off.</p>

<p>They did this to avoid a class action lawsuit and full recall. This way the user has to endure the cost of the $29 battery replacement instead of them. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People pay thousands of hard earned dollars to be monitored by corporations and governments.</p>

<p>I have never owned a smartphone because I have not &quot;had to&quot; for work or personal consumer fetish.</p>

<p>Nobody needs to get  hold of me and I like to move to what I need not gaze into the strobe and let it think for me.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve watched smartphones cultivate an artificial,  ego driven sense of false intellectual apex in people. </p>

<p>Faith in the tech and those who deploy it at great cost to you is given without knowledge. 
Unearned trust in abundance is inevitably abused.</p>

<p>They made a monitoring device into something people sacrifice to attain.</p>

<p>There must be a free will acquiescence to the program.</p>
