      <p>
       I am not saying all Jews are evil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ill say it again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am NOT saying all Jews worship satan!
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bible makes it clear that there will be some who worship satan and hide behind the name of the Jewish religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       The world as a whole seems to reject absolutely anyone that says something negative about anyone Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if that person committed horrid wicked deeds, somehow, just saying they are Jewish is a shield from most reproof.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The Jewish people have gone through enough persecution" says those who defend wicked Jews, "You only think they did wrong because you are anti semitic!" they say.
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, I am here to tell you, that the Bible says there will be, and probably are right now, wicked lying Jews who worship satan.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there are lots of amazing Jews!
      </p>
      <p>
       I know plenty of wonderful Jews!
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to stand with a gun outside of a temple protecting Jews!
      </p>
      <p>
       They are fine folk, but like any race, culture or religion, there are bad ones too.
      </p>
      <p>
       And the Jewish race/religion, or whatever they are, are basically the only ones that are socially unacceptable to speak poorly about.
      </p>
      <p>
       Simply pointing this fact out has become taboo.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to confront this problem head on.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to expose the lying Jews of satan and separate them from the good Jews of God.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to take in what is really going on in the world with Israel, global banking, and governments abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Over and over I see posts about how Jews run everything - a notion widely dismissed as nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe they are the lying Jews of satan?
      </p>
      <p>
       Wouldn't that make sense?
      </p>
      <p>
       And the worst part is that the godly Jews defend the Jews of satan, because they have a blanketed mindset of total defensiveness for anything Jewish.
      </p>
      <p>
       This needs to change!
      </p>
      <p>
       For the good of the entire world, go befriend a Jewish person, and tell them the truth!
      </p>
      <p>
       Tell them that there are evil men, hiding behind the good name of their religion, in order to avoid persecution and to further their of nefarious plans.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here is the Bible quote:
      </p>
      <h1>
       Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.
      </h1>

       Christ spent most of His time in Galilee because that is where there were more Judahites, those of the house of Judah. History shows us and the Pharisees knew it that those of the house of Israel, the ten tribes were already scattered (diaspora) across Greece and Europe, including Ireland and England.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was the Edomites who assumed the part of the Jews. With the inclusion of the Turk-Mongol tribes from the Steppes of Russia the make up of todays people called Jews was complete. The term Jew was created in 1775.

       I agree. Part of that is because things that were metaphorically true 2000 years ago might not be true today.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I have identified several problems with the supposed sign of September 23, 2017. However, there are other, broader problems with it. One of the purposes that God ordained for the stars is for them to be signs (Genesis 1:14). However, to truly be a sign, shouldn’t such things be obvious, at least to a few people? Since the sun will be in Virgo at the time, virtually none of Virgo’s stars will be visible. The three planets in Leo will be visible in the early morning that day, but all will be low in the southeastern sky. Venus is very bright, so it will be relatively easy to spot; however, Mars and Mercury will not be, because they will be much fainter, and they won’t rise until about the time morning twilight begins. The thin crescent moon will be visible in the evening sky, low in the southwest. Jupiter may be visible lower in the southwest, though it will be difficult, since it will set before evening twilight ends. That is, not all of this “sign” will be visible, and those parts that will be visible won’t be visible at the same time. While this event may show up nicely on a computer screen, God set the lights in the “firmament of heaven” (not on computer screens) to be for signs.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You consider this a "divine sign" and wonder why people don't take your religion seriously.

       All that hardly matters as we know this is happening thanks to our technology, something God knew we would have at this time. Thats a really shoddy attempt at deflecting from the absolute fact it happened. Nor do we need technology to know this, the ancient art of astrology and the modern astronomy all show this to be happening without need of direct line of sight. Good try though.

       Who the fuck is "we"? Nobody heard of this irrelevant shit happening. Want to know what a proper "divine sign" would look like? Seas splitting apart. People being reborn from concrete death.

       We is every Christian looking for these signs, we were told to be watchful and we were rewarded. This was the first sign for believers, the eclipses and bloodmoons were designed to be signs for the pagans who watch for such things. There is much more to come and it will come soon, within the next 7 years when the second American eclipse forms an "x" over the states.

       Job 1: 6-12
      </p>
      <p>
       6One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them. 7 The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.” 8 Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.” 9 “Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied. 10 “Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 11 But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.” 12 The LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.” Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan has no power over man, but rather the things that surround man; those that can influence man. God has the final say :)

       Those are lies though. It is Satan who makes the decisions, not 'God'. We are all emanations from God, even Satan but he is too meta to make decisions. There is only one demigod and that is Satan!!

       It says the are specifically not Jews.  You even put it at the end:
      </p>
      <p>
       "which say they are Jews, and are not"
      </p>
      <p>
       They claim to be Jews but are not Jews.  The main people doing this currently are replacement theologians.  Heretics like Steven Anderson.  They claim they are the Jews now and teach that God is done with them (the Church replaced Israel).  Even though the scriptures clearly show that God will turn back to Jacob/Israel after the catching away of the Church (fulness of the Gentiles be come in) because even though the Israel rejects God as they have so many times in the past God still loves Israel for their fathers's sake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rom 11:25  For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. 
Rom 11:26  And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob: 
Rom 11:27  For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins. 
Rom 11:28  As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.

       he lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness.

       He is the All at the end of time and space that permeates every instance of time and everyone point in space. Right now He is at rest after creating all of this as evidenced by every other creation day in the Bible except the seventh being described as having an evening and a morning.

       The Jews of today (supposed Khazarian converts) are genetically similar to the Canaanites tribes who were bound together into the kingdom of Israel. They are closely related to the Palestinians, suggesting one group is merely the diaspora who left and mixed with other races and the other being the Canaanites who remained in their homeland and were converted to Islam. 
The Bible isn't worth the paper it is printed on; it was written by men of that same genetic stock. Yeshua is a fictional amalgam of hundreds of years worth of Jewish revolutionaries beginning with the Essene sect whose Dead Sea materials make mention of a martyred son of god around 300BC, as well as containing a sermon later attributed to the Yeshua supposedly born 300 years later. The entirety of Christianity is just the same swindle as the rest of Abrahamic traditions. It is responsible for destroying the cultures of Europe and installing a cabal of Semites as rulers through brutal tyranny and financial domination.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all of the men of that genetic stock are evil, because theirs is the antirace born from the mixing of others. What's more, their gods are vicious deities whose favor can only be gained through sacrifice with human sacrifice in cannibalistic rituals being the ultimate source of power for their followers.

       It depends on how you view Satan really. The figure was born from the appropriation of Zoroastrianism's embodiment of darkness, Ahriman. However, this was combined with serpent symbolism which traces back to the concept of serpent elites and serpent wisdom present in many cultures, but most relevant for the Canaanites would be the Annunaki rulers of Sumeria. Just as was the case in Egypt, or Mesoamerica, European survivors from the civilization destroyed by the cataclysms surrounding the Younger Dryas period settled among hunter-gatherer tribes in order to gain a base of workers for use in the re-establishment of civilization. They are identified with the serpent for the same reason as the serpent is used to create the double-helix in mystical symbolism, knowledge of the importance of bloodlines. It is exactly that knowledge that the Canaanites needed to demonize when they associated their Satan with the serpent, as they are already a mixed race whose only hope for gaining power over others is to weaken their genetic stability and thus the stability of their cultures to the point that infiltration and domination are possible. Beyond that, the serpent wisdom includes the entire package of agriculture, astronomy, etc. that the antediluvian legacy carriers brought with them. It's really only the Semites who demonize the serpent so.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thus, there is an interesting angle to the worship of Satan as a rejection of the Abrahamic falsehoods, though it is still rooted in the deceptions of that tradition. Better Satan than Yahweh or Yeshua, but best to leave all of them behind.

       Listen not to the deceivers. Lucifer is quite real and anyone who has dealt with demonic attacks will tell you the same. To worship him as the Bible describes him, one of God's most beautiful creations that rebelled for want of God's power and was thus cast out of the higher realms along with his followers, is to worship the entity from which all human suffering originates. There are many who are Satanists that don't worship the actual entity but instead consider themselves rationalists and atheists who would uplift themselves and humanity to "godhood" through science and technology, which is ironically a Satanistic pursuit as the desire to be God or attain godlike power is what got Lucifer banished in the first place.

       Tithing has not been required since the days of the Old Covenant between Israel and God. Since the New Covenant established by Jesus it is seen as secondary and more of an expression of gratefulness to the Savior or for some great work He has done in one's life that God repays in blessings. Don't fall victim to the false profits of the modern church.

       Tithing has not been required since the days of the Old Covenant between Israel and God. Since the New Covenant established by Jesus it is seen as secondary and more of an expression of gratefulness to the Savior or for some great work He has done in one's life that God repays in blessings. Don't fall victim to the false profits of the modern church.

       Jesus was very much against this too. Don't confuse the modern church for the authentic message of Christianity like most people before you. The two are radically different.

       1 billion+ people follow the Pope, who is
       <strong>
        an
       </strong>
       anti-christ. I'm not saying you're wrong, but I wouldn't just focus on the Jews in this respect. Imo, it does kinda come off as a direct target -even when you preface it with saying not all Jews are bad- when Christians are just as complicit. And that is, in no way, an allusion to anti-semitism because it's obvious you're not being anti-semitic. I think if you broaden the focus, you'll be right on the money.

       I would hesitate to call Catholics Christians. They set themselves against the teachings of Christ when they began requiring priests to speak with God as proxies in order to attain forgiveness, which was the whole point of Christ dying for us in the first place. That plus the saint worship and pay-to-win purgatory shows their beliefs drifted very far from the Scriptures they claim to follow.

       Know your post was was great, I'm just talking about people on the board who are constantly blaming "the Jews" without understanding that they are not real Jews. Zionist are not real Jews and are the descendants of people who practice occultic worship. They want to position things so a fake anti christ can reign and pretend it's the real one and I'm just amazed a lot of people have not studied and understood the actual bloodlines of these people and that they are not the actual Jews that are considered Gods people ect.

       Read Karen Armstrong's "A History of God". It was a bestseller. In it, she has a section on the Frankist sect of Judaism that was based on false messiah Shabbetai Zevi from the 1600s. Zevi was a con-man,  into wife-swapping who married a prostitute. When the Turkish authorities came down on him for his sex parties and immoral behavior, they gave him an ultimatum: Convert to Islam or die. To the shocked Jewish community, he decided to convert.
      </p>
      <p>
       Though losing most of his followers, a hardcore band of zealots tried to rationalize the betrayal. They drew spiritual significance from it. In their revisionist narrative, he only PRETENDED to convert to Islam. His gospel (according to the zealots) meant to convey the idea that you have to sin to get saved. That good was evil and evil was good. A man named Jacob Frank led the revitalized sect and started throwing sex parties like Zevi and engaging in wife-swapping. Frankists went down a dark, dark path, though, and started engaging in many vile sins (as a method to transcend morality). Incest was encouraged, homosexual acts . . . and ultimately (to believe many of their enemies) murder. Especially child-murder.
      </p>
      <p>
       While most Jews denounced them, Frankists at their height had 2 million followers in Poland. They had more in Russia, and across the Ukraine, Belorus, Germany, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first Jew on the U.S. Supreme Court, Louis Brandeis, came from a Frankist family. See here:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Among normal mainstream Jews, Frankists were despised.
      </p>
      <p>
       The entire "Jewish blood libel" of killing Christian children happened as a result of the Frankists. They basically believed that baby blood was good for rituals--and staying young.
      </p>
      <p>
       At any rate, see a woman from a Jewish family, talking about her family's Frankist beliefs and all the abuses she endured in this cult:

        Footnote: When you watch the video, note how similar Frankism is to the whole pedogate phenomenon.

       Job 1: 6-12
      </p>
      <p>
       6One day the angels came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came with them. 7 The LORD said to Satan, “Where have you come from?” Satan answered the LORD, “From roaming throughout the earth, going back and forth on it.” 8 Then the LORD said to Satan, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him; he is blameless and upright, a man who fears God and shuns evil.” 9 “Does Job fear God for nothing?” Satan replied. 10 “Have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has? You have blessed the work of his hands, so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land. 11 But now stretch out your hand and strike everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face.” 12 The LORD said to Satan, “Very well, then, everything he has is in your power, but on the man himself do not lay a finger.” Then Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.
      </p>
      <p>
       Satan has no power over man, but rather the things that surround man; those that can influence man. God has the final say :)
