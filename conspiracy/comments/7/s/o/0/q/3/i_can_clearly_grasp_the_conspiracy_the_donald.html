       I think this clip sums up the ideas of the conspiracy Trump supporters believe:
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7A3QViXy-8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=3m5s">
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N7A3QViXy-8&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=3m5s
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       What is a good summation of the specific conspiracy that makes up the Trump Russian collusion conspiracy. At one point, it seemed that they were getting them for rigging the election. I think that one is done now. Then it moved on to collusion, but all they indicted Manafort was was lying under oath about a meeting after the election. So what are the specifics that Trump is being accused of?
      </p>
      <p>
       So Russian Trump Collusion believers, lay out your best case. I want to hear it.

       This lays out a decent timeline.  Granted, it's kinda dated at this point, because we have 4 indictments/guilty pleas since and more info has come out, but it lays out a good picture for why it's all suspicious as hell.  The events since, only solidify the notion that something was going on.

       That timeline begins in Feb 2016. This Russia crap actually started in September 2015 when the DNC/CNN/Anderson Cooper tried to link Bernie to Russia - his "socialist roots". Then it was Jill Stein. Then Wikileaks. Then Trump. Then Julian Assange. Then the whole election. Notice a pattern?

       Trump Jr literally admitted to collusion when he said he met with Russian agents specifically because he wanted to receive their illegally obtained information regarding Hillary Clinton.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again. He literally just came out and said he wanted the russian governments aid.

       I don't know the outcome of that meeting. Like I said, that's part of the ongoing investigation. The fact that the meeting happened at all is enough for me to be suspicious. The fact that Trump Jr kept lying about it doesn't help either.

       Were in conspiracy right? So just calm the fuck down stop playing this bullshit "other side" game with me. There is a million reasons why to constantly remind people about this being a on going investigation. But while you are discussing the ON GOING investigation seems like a weird time does it not? I mean we are fucking talking about it.

       I think it's important to keep in mind when discussing the topic. Too many people seem to believe the public has seen all of the evidence at this point. What we have so far is the basis for an investigation. That's it.

       You completely ignored it and just fell back to on going investigation. Do YOU think the jr meeting had a real effect on the outcome of the election? I fully understand you are not the FBI and there is a on going investigation, I simply want your personal opinion.

       I think you are very aware of the answer but just dont want to say it because its not helping your argument. The reality of the situation is that the meeting had no effect at all. The meeting was not illegal in the least, as he was in the private sector. To prove criminality of that meeting you would need to show prior knowledge of him knowing the "illegal" origins of this supposed information, even then Im not sure of the exact law that would even be breaking. What you have is just bad optic and a person's inability to foresee the looming Russian boogeymen man around the corner.

       No I sure dont. But you know that as it pretty fucking clear I was asking him that to prove a point. The meeting was not illegal in any real sense. The meeting was not helpful to the campaign at all. The meeting brought no new information at all. You people harp on it because he didnt come out and inform everyone after they built up this evil red scare.
      </p>
      <p>
       Do you think something is a crime because the DNC needed a scapegoat? Do you think someone working in the private sector has any obligation to turn away information that would benefit him? Is bad optics illegal treason now?
      </p>
      <p>
       So how about you tell me what information they got from that meeting that you think helped them win, because you must have some bombshell shit no one else has.

       I think the only people making the solid assertion strawman that Trump directly accepted or in some way brokered help from the Russian government to directly influence the election, are Trump supporters or otherwise critics of the Russia imbroglio. In reality I doubt many people who are serious about the case buy into the particular theory that this helped definitively secure his win and thus the Russians should be blamed for his victory. In reality I think most people see it as a series of attacks orchestrated on America's social platforms and the ongoing investigation is to conclude the exact level of knowledge Trump and his campaign team had of this effort. Were they active in knowingly propagating the attacks? Were they only aware but merely complicit? The exact truth isn't known but the more information that comes out regarding what the team knew and lied about certainly doesn't bode well for many higher ranking officials.

       So you don't actually believe the collusion you just want him impeached because of social media shit posting? That is absolutely insane.

       Oh, I believe in "the collusion" because I believe the evidence has sufficiently shown that the Trump team had some level of knowledge about Russian efforts and we're either encouraging of them or did nothing. That's a direct attack on the American democratic process, no? I personally believe that there is evidence that proves this, and i am willing to admit that although that evidence has not come to light publicly I do believe it exists. that's why I want him  impeached, not because of some "social media shitposting".

       If I'm being honest I think the cuber campaign specifically was just one part of a multi pronged "attack" put forward by Russia. Whether or not the Trump team knew specifically about that it seems like it would be hard to say, harder to prove but I personally doubt it. I do however believe most if not all did fall victim to this prong of the "attack" by circulating false information and passionate lie-driven narratives meant to skew voter perception which I believe totally worked.

       These two ideas are not mutually exclusive and you conflating them is pretty disingenuous. Russia was obviously the one who spearheaded these attacks, it's completely possible for the Trump team to have known about them and allowed it to continue despite Russia propagating them of their own agenda. No one is suggesting Trump came to Russia as though approaching a PR firm and asked them kindly to fuck with the election (well, some people may hold that belief but that's certainly not the majority). I'm not sure I see what your 'gotcha' point is supposed to be.

       How exactly would Trump who is just running for president be able to stop shit posting on twitter originating from another country? My "gotcha point" as you call it is that you are asserting that the Trump team would have any motive at all to encourage Russia to shit post for him. He can easily just pay someone domestically if he thought it was effective, there is literally not a single incentive at all that would lead to him doing this.
      </p>

       So now you have this assertion thats not based on fact or logical deduction. Its absolutely just flat out stupid to think Trump knew Russia was running a AD campaign on twitter, he knew about it, and encouraged it. There is literately fuck all that points in that direction in the least.

         You seem to be under the impression that Russia's campaign consisted of merely using Twitter bots. This is down playing what we have proven they have done to the nth degree. They published and circulated tons of false information across multiple platforms.

      <p>
       So... Are you being serious? You can't think of one single reason why a presidential hopeful would have motive to encourage, or at the very least allow, what he believes is a benevelent ally offering his campaign help to win the presidency and slander his opponent? He doesn't have to pay someone domestically, he's paying Russia with the easing of sanctions.

       Thats my main problem with this theory. Information campaigns online are not that expensive relatively speaking. He could cut a check with a few zeros on it to any legal company to do online PR or he could do a treasonous deal with Russia. There is zero motive at all to do the deal with Russia over online PR.

       SANCTIONS. what if Russia came to Trump theoretically (although it's not theoretical, they actually did this) telling them they had dirt on their opponents, whether it was obtained legally or not is a discussion for another time. They offer to help the campaign in exchange for the easing of sanctions. You expect the Trump team to decline help from what they INSIST is by all accounts a completely benevolent entity because, as you assert, you can get a company to do PR for you?

       Is that what you have been arguing? You seemed to have switched from online information campaigns to illegally obtained information being used as bartering chips for sanctions. That is something completely different. So no, a PR firm cant do that.

       I fully understand they can do both of those things, but I asked you a direct question of what you think is the underlying crime and you told me if was the knowledge and complicity of the Russian cyber information campaign. Then once that hit a dead end you just switch to dirty laundry being used in sanctions bargaining.

       No you didn't, and I never said that because I don't believe that's the only underlying crime, I believe they did both of those things and more to boot. Hmmm seems to me like you're running out of ways you can attack the information itself and now you're reduced to derailing the conversation and attacking and misrepresenting what I personally believe, which in the context of the ongoing investigation, does not matter one iota. I can see you're just not interested in having an objective conversation and it seems to me your mind is made up already.

       Oh, was that the time when Russians secretly mind-controlled Hillary Clinton and her campaign and DNC staff and dozens of media contacts and forced them to collude to undermine Bernie Sanders and leave evidence in the form of thousands of cryptographically verifiable e-mails. Those Russians sure are sneaky!

       <p>
        A source at a London firm which is larger and better known than Steele’s Orbis says “standard due diligence means getting to the truth. It’s confidential to the client, and not leaked. There are also black jobs, white jobs, and red jobs. Black means the client wants you to dig up dirt on the target, and make it look credible for publishing in the press.  White means the client wants you to clear him of the wrongdoing which he’s being accused of in the media or the marketplace; it’s also leaked to the press. A red job is where the client pays the due diligence firm to hire a journalist to find out what he knows and what he’s likely to publish, in order to bribe or stop him.  The Steele dossier on Trump is an obvious black job. Too obvious.”
       </p>
       <p>
        Another leading figure in London due diligence adds about Simpson, with whom he’s worked in the past: “If one considers Glenn to be, on a good day with a following wind, an unreliable witness, the material is at best only about his memories and impressions. I am just going to wait for the movie.”

       Steele has no credibility in the field and the dossier doesn't hold water.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It’s the assessment of both US and British intelligence agencies, including MI6, for which Steele worked undercover in Moscow between 1994 and 1996. His cover was blown; he was evacuated; and as British intelligence sources  report this week, Steele has been unable to enter Russia for a decade. “No Russian with official links and knowledge would risk communicating with Steele for fear of being detected by Russian counter-intelligence,” said an intelligence source in London, Said another: “I met [Steele] a couple of times and thought that for a relatively undistinguished man who never made very senior rank he was a smug, arrogant s.o.b.  So I don’t work with him. The description of his being the top expert on Russia in MI6 is bollocks. ”

       You can easily understand the overall idea of the conspiracy:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Russia identifies their own interest in having a specific person as president of the USA.  This could be someone that they know will be more friendly to them.  It could be someone who they have something to blackmail them with.  Whatever.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         So, they use their resources (money, people, time, knowledge) to set out to influence the election.  This can take many forms: spreading propaganda on the internet, providing "dirt" (real or fake) on certain candidates, and so on.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         On top of that, they can also work
         <em>
          directly
         </em>
         with a specific candidate's campaign, in a collaborative endeavor.  Once they make it known that they can help, they will of course want something in return.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       How much of
       <em>
        any
       </em>
       of those three things actually happened is what is being investigated.

       In order to collude, you have to offer something salacious in exchange. Absent any evidence of wrong doing or any offer of illegal assistance, there is no evidence of collusion.

      <p>
       If I say, "hey wanna hear a bad secret about that co-worker that you hate?" And you say "Hell yea I do!" That isn't collusion. I hope you can understand what I'm saying.

       Hillary and co not only have "ties" to Russia but are also deeply compromised on a shitload of various issues.  If it is the case that "Russians" hacked everyone in the DNC orbit, it stands to reason that they had blackmail material on everybody in the DNC starting with Hillary.  So, it would naturally follow that Putin would want
       <em>
        Hillary
       </em>
       to win, if anything!  Of course, that would render your BS theory without a leg to stand on and I'm sure you wouldn't like that.   "Trump-Russia" is the biggest fucking load of baloney that ever existed.  You can jerk yourself sore all you want, but you ain't gonna squirt.  You know it, I know it and everybody except deranged anti-Trumpers know it.

       What investigation?  Mueller's?  What makes you think Mueller's will be the end of it?  One year later Mueller has jackshit to show for it. 
 At this point, won't be surprised if he goes after unpaid parking tickets and overdue library books on everyone in the Trump orbit. 
 We're only getting started.  You ain't seen nothing yet.  We're in uncharted waters.  Sit back, relax and enjoy the show.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you're somehow harboring fantasies of Trump getting impeached or anything remotely like that, in the interest of your own sanity, it is time for you to give up.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, you should be asking yourself the question you asked me because it doesn't look like you're taking this Trump victory very well.  At this rate, you'll have a very long next seven years.

       just to calm you down -- garden-variety tax evasion can also be termed "conspiracy against United States" and such other scary sounding terms.

      <p>
       also... none of that laundry list of chickenshit you listed has anything to do with Trump allegedly conspiring allegedly with Putin to allegedly steal the election from your bitch-in-chief.

       Trump got elected because Russia supposedly spent a tiny sum of money on social media? And that somehow outdid the $1.2 Billion spent by Hillary? I'm a fan of conspiracy theories, but they have to be at least somewhat believable.

       Please, the international community very obviously think Trump is a joke. Regardless of how you may feel about his politics personally, his pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, his anti-NATO rhetoric, moving the embassy to Jerusalem, the Muslim ban, the transgenders in the military thing - have been widely criticised by the UN and other world leaders.

      <p>
       Other politicians that aren't on his side think he's a joke, i'm on mobile right now so can't dig the quotes out but multiple foreign politicians have come out either denouncing his decisions or straight up mocking him.

       I think he's perfectly fit and is the tonic this country needs after years of rudderless leadership. If you want to live in a country where the rest of the world chooses your President, then you're going to have to get on that, cause that's not how this works. Trump is respected in Asia, feared everywhere else. He's the right guy at the right time and your opinions don't change that. History will regard him as one of the most brilliant political strategists ever.

       I can't speak for Mueller because he's been tight-lipped thru this whole charade but I'm starting to think that his crusade to undo Trump is about to come to an ignominious end. Stay tuned!

       I agree with you, plus you have the media lined up against him from all angles.  I'm not a big fan of Trump, I like some of this policies, our economy is doing well, hes taking steps to get rid of obamacare, and I know thats an unpopular thing, but I sell health insurance for a living, and Obamacare is a fuckin ripoff of anyone who works and especially for healthy people.  On the other hand, I don't like what sessions is doing with marijuana, and I don't care for Trump as a personality, I think hes arrogant, and stubborn, but what billionaire isn't?  I didn't like Obama but I give him his props on certain things....Trump is getting an unfair shake at the presidency because it was supposed to be a shoe in for Clinton.  She has the entire media eating out of their hands, they had dinners with the campaign before it got started, and they have all pretty much defended her thru everything...to me fair is fair, they would have never treated Obama like this, even tho there were those on the Right who were racist, and different shit when he was in office, I won't deny that happened, but the media treated him like a sweetheart...I mean they got fake doctors diagnosing trump over the television with mental disorders....give me a break...Fair is fair.

       I truly don’t understand... you think the media should suppress reporting on the ridiculous stuff trump does/says/tweets because they didn’t have the material to do the same on obama? Trump gets bad coverage because he says outlandish things, he is intentionally inflammatory, and he does it on purpose. Isn’t that why his base loves him so much? “He tells it like it is”. How can you, with a straight face, blame the media for reporting the stuff he does/says?  He wouldn’t get so much negative coverage if he didn’t act “negatively”. Obama didn’t get the same negative coverage because there was no material there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The media loves nothing more than a vandal (any side). If obama had the scandals, they would surely have reported them. I genuinely don’t understand how you can come away with the perspective you have.

       Obama had plenty of scandals, it just wasn’t reported on. Fast and furious, irs, Iran, Obamacare was its Own Scandal and screw job, etc.  he got a pass on everything he did. He couldn’t do any wrong. He lied during his campaign, saying he was gonna do this and that, investigate the bush admin, repeal the patriot act, all this shit that went against everything bush stood for. And as soon as he got into office all of that shit was out the door.  I voted for asshole the first time.  He fucked up things for a lot of people. Black folks did even worse under a black president, economically speaking.  He did more for gay folks than he did for anyone else.  Which makes me wonder, but that’s a whole different convo.  The media has a very left wing slant. Look how the covered for Hillary this whole time.  While she stole the primary from sanders, while she cheated Thru the campaign with answers to debate questions and rigged primaries, even now with her whole cover up of smashing cellphones and deleting emails.  They gave her a pass.  So miss me with the bulls shit that the media is fair.

       I'm not fond of who Trump has surrounded himself with either. I don't like Sessions, Tillerson, Nikki Haley...really hardly any of them. Losers! But I totally agree with you on Obamacare. From my point of view it's expensive insurance that you'll probably never get to use. The media was asleep during all eight years of the Obama administration (I voted for him twice btw) and now all of a sudden they have embraced identity politics and have decided that they must fight against Trump on every single issue even if they have to manufacture outrage. I think most people, even the Never Trumpers, can see right thru these charlatans. And then they have the balls to come out with the narrative that Trump is obviously a Russian spy because he criticizes the media! You're apparently not even allowed to criticize the MSM...just ask Oprah. Hogwash!

       Exactly.  You get it. I feel pretty much the same way. I could understand if there was some things that were questionable with trump and Russia, that an investigation should continue.  But it’s been over a year, and the only Russian collusion I’ve seen is with the clintons and her shady bunch. But that gets ignored, and they are trying to find any little crazy outlying factor that will tie trump to Russia and they can’t find it.  Yes you can’t say shit about the MSM, and they sit up and blatantly lie to their dwindling idiot viewers and then they take that as gospel, never do any of their own research, and repeat what don lemons moist ass told them on CNN, like retarded parrots.  I voted for Obama the first time too but I saw thru the bullshit  really fast. Oh and bye, I wrote only 3 Obamacare policies over open enrollment this year, and one was to a fat homie of mine who wanted weight loss surgery. Nobody wanted and everyone complained about it.  Even still today.  It was the biggest scam against Americans in modern history.

       It's safe to say that most of the mainstream news media in the US and Europe vocally support globalist ideal. Any threat to the status quo (ie a populist/nationalist POTUS, BREXIT, etc) would be deemed unacceptable and put on blast. I argue Trump's not the Big Brother from 1984 that leftists claim as fact. He's more an Emmanuel Goldstein given the 2 minute hate treatment...24/7!

       I don't have all the answers, but if they didn't think there was a possible ROI for backing Clinton, they wouldn't have.  If they thought they could not only back Trump, but then have enough influence on him to get favorable treatment, it would be worth it.

       An even better question is why would you choose to back Trump over Clinton, who had
       <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/355749-fbi-uncovered-russian-bribery-plot-before-obama-administration">
        already taken bribes on your behalf
       </a>
       that during the time of the election weren't even public knowledge? That is some VERY strong Kompromat: just use backchannels to threaten Hillary Clinton at any time - "we're going to go public with the Uranium One deal, where we gave you millions of dollars in return for control over US Nuclear assets, if you don't help us on the Magnitsky Act."
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not like the Clintons have a
       <a href="http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/356323-bill-clinton-sought-states-permission-to-meet-with-russian-nuclear">
        demonstrated pattern
       </a>
       of working very closely with Russia.
      </p>
      <p>
       So why the fuck would they back Trump? That's my question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also let's remember that according to Christopher Steele the sources he got detailing "Kompromat" on Donald Trump were
       <em>
        provided to him by sources within or close to the Russian government.
       </em>
       Hmm...doesn't it strike you as the least bit odd that sources close to or inside the Kremlin were leaking (probably false) information damaging to the Trump campaign and putting it in the hands of someone who was being contracted by Clinton?
      </p>
      <p>
       Because, to me, it seems like the evidence seems to point to towards the idea that it was
       <em>
        Clinton, not Trump,
       </em>
       who was likely to have been compromised by Russia.

       For all we know, Russia did try to work with Hillary. But what we don't have is Hillary accepting Russia's offer for support. Shortly after the Trump Tower meeting,
       <a href="https://youtu.be/ZnY7D4M4k68?t=47">
        Trump said this.
       </a>

       <p>
        "Russian,  if you're listening, I hope you find Hillary Clinton's missing emails"

       Isn't that allegation somewhat undermined by the fact that the Steele Dossier (which was used as ammunition against Trump by the Clinton campaign and possibly the FBI) was purportedly compiled based on information gathered from sources either close to or inside the Russian government?

       Isn't that allegation also somewhat contradicted by the Veselnitskaya meeting? Why would the Russian government need to send Veselnitskaya as a representative of their interests to Trump Tower if they already had an open line of communication with Trump?

       I didn't say they already had an open line.  The meeting could have been one of the methods they were using to open that line.  Of course, they could have had many avenues into the campaign, via Manafort and Flynn, for instance.

       My problem with that is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
       That is pure unadulterated speculation. There is absolutely no evidence that I am aware of that either Manafort OR Flynn were even Russian agents themselves, much less provided "avenues into the campaign" for Russian foreign influence. Can you point me to any halfway credible source that suggests that Manafort OR Flynn had any substantial Russian ties?
      </p>
      <p>
       I want you to imagine a scenario for me real quick. You are Donald Trump, and Paul Manafort comes into your office one sunny afternoon and says "Hey by the way if you want to collude with the Russians let me know" to which Donald Trump says "totally dude! fantastic idea." What happens next, exactly, in this scenario? What is Russia actually giving Trump? Where is the quid pro quo?

       So, is paying a foreign national to dig up (at whatever means necessary, and with no burden of proof) dirt on your political opponent is ok because they own/work for a company that specializes in just that?  Or are we saying that just Trump getting info from foreign sources is illegal.

       Face it, America is full of shit and acts like an entitled brat trying to control what everybody else does while saying "don't fuck with me".

       Fuck off with that shit.  Trump won.  Nobody voted for Trump because of some bullshit ad on Facebook or some kind of horseshit thing they read on the internet.

      <p>
       In fact, It's likely he'd have had MORE votes if the media did their damn job and stopped lying all the time and also exposed Clinton for the terrible human beings she and her husband are.  Trump ain't a saint, but he isn't half the evil that she is.

       You have the idea Russian intel set up a scheme to help Trump win in exchange for potential sanctions relief. You have the idea this was done because Putin has leverage over Trump (blackmail in the form of sex tape and/or financial kompromat, far more likely in my view). Then, based on Trump's own actions and words. you have the idea of obstruction of justice in order to kill any number of investigations into his campaign and administration.

       Not all the preceding needs to be true in order to maintain the "Russian collusion" narrative, various iterations are possible. The whole thing really isn't that hard to grasp, seems like OP is judging the complexities and possibilites of Trump malfeasance as unworthy compared with the simplicity of the GOP counter-accusations against their opponents.

       So what you're saying is that you're more likely to believe that, if Trump did engage in illegal activity, he only committed a single crime, because your feelings tell you that a corrupt person engaging in multiple crimes is "too many options" for law enforcement to reasonably investigate without their harboring an ulterior motive?

       I'm saying that the claims from the right appear to be clear and provable. They claims from the left seem to be more about throwing mud at the wall and hoping some sticks. This does not mean that the claims are wrong. I think with the Mueller investigation, we should be able to get to the truth on Trump though.

       Are they though (clear and provable)? A series of FISA warrants were approved by judges, Trump's people were talking to foreign nationals under suspicion, which the campaign decided to blanket deny, falsely, for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
       The GOP is positing a far-reaching conspiracy involving the entire Obama administration and relevant Obama-era law enforcement agencies, along with the Clinton campaign. "Clear and provable" are far from realistic-- their theories are much more complex and dependent on various factors than Trump/Russia or Trump obstruction.

       Manafort and Gates went down for laundering money they received for lobbying for Ukraine in 2013.  Your thinking of Flynn who lied, not under oath, but to the FBI when they interviewed him.

       The technocrats (autistic west coasters who form monopolies) are trying to destroy the very idea of democracy, so used their control of mass-media to insert a historically inept candidate.  Most countries meddle in other countries elections, so they're placing the blame on Russia.  It's a great narrative and has caught absolute fire.

       1: "Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing" - Trump 2016
2: Trump's DOJ nominee Jeff Sessions committed perjury by lying about not meeting Russian officials while he was on the Trump campaign.
3: Trump's son and Paul Manafort met with Russians who promised to give them "dirt" on Hilary, Don Jr. literally released proof of this on his twitter.
4: Manafort was the adviser to Putin's puppet president in Ukraine, registered as a foreign agent after the fact. Trump then hires him to be his campaign chairman.
5: Trump's National Securty Advisor Michael Flynn has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, a felony, about contacts he had with the Russian government during Trump's presidential transition.
6: July 2016 the FBI opens a counterintelligence investigation into Russian meddling in the ongoing presidential election. Trump fires the head of the FBI a few months after becoming president.
7: Trump's son had a connection with Wikileaks. In the messages, WikiLeaks urged Don Jr. to promote its trove of hacked Democratic emails.

       This is just what I quickly pulled off the top of my head. Unreal how anyone interested in conspiracies did not know this information. It was discussed non-stop for the past year if you payed any attention to any news(right-wing, left-wing, independent, etc) it's been talked about everywhere. To not see anything even a little fishy here you have to be a full blown partisan hack.

       I think the issue here is that I actually wanted those emails too and am pretty fond of Wikileaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I appreciate the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just on your points. 
1: That's not illegal, right?
2: I hope Sessions goes down. He and his wacky anit-marijuana crap (and I'm not a pot smoker, I just think it should be legal).
3: I assume this is illegal. But it also sounds like Hillary had foreign intelligence agents provide her with information too. 
4: Manafort seems like a really bad choice for Trump to have had be his campaign chairman, except for the fact that he got him elected. 
5: It is strange that the crime was just lying and not anything important. To me, that said that there really weren't any illegal activities to go after. But time can tell us differently.
6: This seems to actually be the crux of the illegal activity that the right says was committed by Hillary/FBI.
7: I read the Wikileaks communications and Don Jr was really noncommittal in those few interactions although Wikileaks was definitely trying to get him to cooperate.
      </p>
      <p>
       So in conclusion, the illegal activity doesn't seem that big here. Is this all there is?

       Okay so you are partisan. You ask for evidence of Russia-Trump collusion and then dismiss the publicly known evidence(who knows what else the investigation has found, that info has not been released) and claim "B-B-B-B-But HILLARY". I say let's agree to let Robert Mueller prove Trump is innocent, let him investigate and he will find nothing because obviously there's nothing going on here.

       I think the case is better for the crimes in the FBI than crimes by Trump, but I am not partisan unless there is a Bernie party.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I am not convinced yet on the crimes of Trump. In the end, my being convinced is irrelevant. Maybe Mueller will lay out crimes in a convincing way though. But, and I am in a conspiracy subreddit so humor me a little, it seems that the powers that be are upset that Trump won and want to remove him before he messes things up too much. Personally, I would have preferred Bernie messing things up.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the end, Trump could be guilty of crimes, but you should be able to see that the case laid out against him isn't all that damning if all that was shared here is what has been done.

       Stop asking people to think for you and look at the data. Ask why someone would admit on national tv that he fired the lead for the FBI because he was investigating the "russia thing". The more damning pieces of evidence are the denials and coverups, the false statements and the propos against those who aren't loyalists to the Trumphouse.  Why try so hard to stop or sidetrack investigations if you have nothing to hide and they are done within the bounds of the law? The intent to coverup is what I feel is the most compelling thing against Trump and  the elected Republican (you're probably going to be surprised by this next part) AND Democrat establishment.

       Also ask yourself. What lead to the investigation? What evidence was there for an investigation? Who spearheaded the investigation? When was this investigation orchestrated? Who initiated the investigation? Who was involved? Were parties involved in initiating the investigation biased? The big one, was there a decision to investigate Trump as an insurance plan when he got elected?

       It's very simple. No goal post has been moved. Russia seeked to help the Trump/hurt Clinton in the election. Trump was not the only goal, even if Trump lost, the political attacks and release of emails ought to damage Clinton enough to hobble her Presidency - even Aasage knew to put a quote around "lost". Trump was prepared to cast doubt on whether the election was fair if he lost as another attack on US democracy. The only question is how much in cooperation the Trump campaign and Russian campaign was. The Trump administration would not have been so suspicious in the beginning if they had not offered lie after lie, and hired so many people who deal with Russians...oh​and firing the head of the FBI after asking him to stop investigating one of people who has just pled guilty to lying about talking to the Russian embassador.
      </p>
      <p>
       The​ whole attack on the FBI/Mueller has taken numerous iterations:
1. Mueller hired people who donated to Democrats, he's clearly stacking the deck against Trump - yeah, Trump donated to Democrats bitches
2. Mueller delivered uranium to Russia, he's compromised by the uranium one deal 
3. Trump Tower meeting was a setup by Fusion GPS - Um Trump Jr still agreed to meet with Russian government agent to get dirt on Clinton
4. Fusion GPS works for Russia/DNC to produce the dossier so investigation needs to be stopped because it's based on false promise - also turns out to be not true
5. FBI has someone who hates Trump texting with his mistress, CORRUPTION
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if they want to investigate Storkz or Clinton again, go ahead. But anyone who try to tie these numerous to stopping the investigation on Trump/Russia and obstruction of Justice, are not genuine. They are partisans who wants to protect a Republican administration from having its crimes found out.

       The collusion was a made up charge to deflect attention away from those crimes committed by Hill, her FBI and her DoJ officials.  That's why there has been no proof.  Hill thought she would win and everything would evaporate. When Trump won, they knew he might dig deeper so the plan was hatched to derail his presidency with a "mean old Russia" collusion story.

       "Russian Trump Collusion" is the biggest pile of steaming dogpoop ever in history.  It is nothing more than the DNC and Hillary getting caught with their pants down and cooking up whatever BS came to mind to save their arses.  And with every passing day, it unravels.  The inevitable collapse of Hillary, Obama and their merry band of treasonous political bandits will be glorious.  Just sit back and enjoy the show.

       The Russian Trump Collusion believers will never be able to make a rational case OP because there is absolutely zero evidence that anything of the sort ever occurred. It's been a year and NO EVIDENCE HAS EVER BEEN PRESENTED  by ANYONE, outside of hearsay and conjecture.

       I don't have all the answers, but if they didn't think there was a possible ROI for backing Clinton, they wouldn't have.  If they thought they could not only back Trump, but then have enough influence on him to get favorable treatment, it would be worth it.

       For all we know, Russia did try to work with Hillary. But what we don't have is Hillary accepting Russia's offer for support. Shortly after the Trump Tower meeting,
       <a href="https://youtu.be/ZnY7D4M4k68?t=47">
        Trump said this.
       </a>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Russian,  if you're listening, I hope you find Hillary Clinton's missing emails"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This was a message to the Kremlin that Trump was ready to play ball.

       I'm saying that the claims from the right appear to be clear and provable. They claims from the left seem to be more about throwing mud at the wall and hoping some sticks. This does not mean that the claims are wrong. I think with the Mueller investigation, we should be able to get to the truth on Trump though.

       How is he "unfit"? Can you give an example of our 'lowered standing on the world stage' because of Trump? These sound like your opinions and not facts.
