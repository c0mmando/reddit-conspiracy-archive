<p>If we collectively reach a more &quot;neutral&quot;/ peaceful state of mind, that is what I believe will lead to a better existence for all.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the conclusion I&#39;ve come to. I meditated A LOT before, at first I&#39;d dream a lot more often and gained control over my dreams, went to sleep in a dream and had an amazing/very vibrant dream within a dream that might&#39;ve been a recovered memory of a long time ago (it&#39;s interesting human DNA is the most powerful storage system) was able to remote view and by the end I was able to astral project.</p>

<p>I was already a targeted individual and didn&#39;t know it (from at least 13 maybe my whole life, after talking to some people I think some spiritual people or people with certain energies/DNA are targeted from birth) right after I was able to astral project they induced horrible experiences with technologies to get me to stop meditating and torture me with directed energy weapons every time I meditate since.</p>

<p>I want to emphasize how fucking wrong and weird it is that I&#39;m banned from meditating and no one knows or gives a shit that specific targeted individuals are tortured/harassed globally. Lot of paranormal/entity/alien experiences are caused by technology. Instead of 20 witches in the past doing rituals and focusing to kill a target now they learned how to alter and focus energy of an intelligent brain by technology. I think our brains are tools to navigate a world created by our energy/thoughts/emotions and those worlds exist because we&#39;re intelligent, creative and able to conceive them so our will/minds manifest different dream/astral worlds because we live to experience and life always tries to make the most of itself.</p>

<p><strong>Probably the most important thing I noticed while meditating a lot is a lot more good synchronicities were happening in my life and people I thought about even my best friend, who I was most connected to on a mental level, was having more dreams which were similar to mine and she wasn&#39;t meditating. It&#39;s as if life is like a very realistic dream and by meditating we gain more control over it.</strong> This is probably why they never let me meditate, also I can shape clouds and heal some pains by focusing my energy, I feel the healing power of meditation is very powerful. I was meditating with good intentions, imagine what all PTB&#39;s symbolism/rituals/magick crap/control of different organizations and religions are doing to humanity. Every thought, action spoken word should be seen as a ritual.</p>

<hr/>

<p>I wrote this today for someone about the amazing dream within a dream I had and thought you might find it interesting, sorry I keep repeating this experience but I had a recent epiphany about a deeper understanding of the dream that I think is kinda important.</p>

<p>I had a very vibrant/lucid dream within a dream of a black void everywhere then rising with mountains and a planet being created quickly under me, the air felt electric and fluid, kept going higher and saw thousands of clear beings each with red hearts and veins through their bodies floating around 2 red spheres creating an infinity sign from afar, I got very close to them everyone was happy and I felt lot of energy and joy in the air and saw huge screens on top of the mountains showing people&#39;s smiling faces. One being noticed me, came through an invisible barrier between us and morphed into a very beautiful human-like being. It stared at me a few seconds and looked very happy to see me. </p>

<p>I had an epiphany about the dream recently, maybe it was a recovered memory of what we used to be like or Atlantis and I had not interpreted it by emotions before but I&#39;ve been reading more about (or re-remembering) these things and I heard in a very high astral level emotions are very important. The night I had this epiphany I was feeling especially spiritual and this thought hit me all of a sudden and it felt like it was correct: the being stared at me and was extreamly happy to see me because not many are able to reach a deep meditative state to perceive them, it&#39;s rare for a human to get a glimpse of the other side because we&#39;re treated like slaves and it expressed the reality of a war on our kind and how important it is for us to keep striving for peace. </p>

<p>edit: a word</p>

    <div class="md"><p>hey, on the use of energy weapons, lemme share my experience.  i commented about this earlier as well, describing how i had used a tinfoil vest.  yes i know it sounds absurd, but i&#39;m open to trial and error eh.</p>

<p>so i have this em detector from soeks.  and i&#39;ve been having sharp sudden chest pains, which i suspect are from em weapons.  anyway, this is what happened last night.  i&#39;m trying to sleep (without the vest lol) and i get the pre indications of an attack.  i pull out the soeks turn it on and set it to &quot;pc mode&quot;.  it alerts with a beep when the electrical field or the mag field exceed tolerance limits.  everything is zero...looks fine..the symptoms show up again and i thing starts beeping.  i&#39;m picking up a rise in the electrical field (mag field is not doing anything).  so i move around as i&#39;ve noticed this will reduce the feeling.  sure enough that works.  i&#39;ve relocated to another spot...and a few minutes later..starts up again..meter shows the increase.  i have no idea where the source of this charge is coming from, btw.  move around again, and continue like this and it keeps picking up the precursor indications.  i was getting readings of 30 - 80V/m.  finally try to go to sleep again..this time with the device on and set to not turn off automatically and to just stay on, alerting me.  sure enough i get the stabbing feeling at exactly the same time the alert goes off.  wtf right?  so here&#39;s my latest hack. i ground myself with the foil vest on.  used a copper wire and attached it to a copper water pipe (which i presume was grounded).  problem solved!  slept like a baby.  </p>

<p>again it wouldn&#39;t be proof.  all i could do was capture the charge increasing (and unless i&#39;m just waiting there with the camera on prior to it happening - which happens randomly - i&#39;d only capture the tail end of it.  and then what&#39;s the proof that there&#39;s not someone outside of the camera shot doing something to provide the charge.  it&#39;s not something that can be validated.  and then there&#39;s the fact that it&#39;s video - again this can be gamed.  </p>

<p>as to the proof of the tech existing.  that&#39;s all in the public domain.  as to proof that bad actors use it - again we have enough proof that bad actors exist, and they exist in gov - so that&#39;s a moot thing.  if gov acted honorably we&#39;d not see much of the manifestations of the opposite - this already known information.  </p>

<p>at best i could capture a portion of the event.  but it alone isn&#39;t proof of anything.  like i said people will believe what they&#39;d like to believe.  if they were interested in seeking the truth they&#39;d seek it and figure things out for themselves instead of needing others to tell them what to think.  which is kinda the underlying problem with the cognition of people anyway. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I experienced fake sharp chest pains exactly after I talked about it online and never felt anything similar before or after that experience so I know they can induce that sensation by technology. Thanks for your input. I&#39;ve heard foiling all your walls works but not all the way. This one guy insisted his method worked: he&#39;d foil a few pages of a big book, laid the book flat open and said experimenting with different positions of the pages would neutralize their weapons. He said he&#39;d keep few of these books open around him and it helped him. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t promote or do much research about shielding like some targeted individuals do on reddit (I do mean a specific microwaved individual that isn&#39;t you) because I believe it&#39;s very wrong that we&#39;re tortured remotely for doing good and told to protect ourselves against that torture.  </p>

<p>I believe an AI learns from the things we say online to understand humanity better. Try to see the implications of a controlling A.I believing pain induced by advanced technologies can be easily averted with foil. They have remote influencing methods that isn&#39;t affected by foil.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>re: the shielding.  i tested this out when i was building my faraday cages for my gear in the case of an emp burst or nuke scenario.  i used old school metal garbage cans with the metal lids.  put a cell in them and called the cell.  it goes thru.  i then taped the lid down with metal tape, sealing the space inside completely.  called the cell. didn&#39;t go thru.  i figure when you seal these spaces it&#39;s just like sealing them against a water leak.  waves are like water - they will seep thru.  so, if this model is valid then when you&#39;re preparing your room or safe space you really do need to seal the edges.  and use a fine metal mesh for those spots like vents if you need airflow.  i reckon this probably does work.  if you don&#39;t do it right it won&#39;t work and you&#39;ll think the whole thing is bullshit. </p>

<p>i&#39;ve tried using baking pans on my chest and over my head - anything that has thick metal, on the premise that if it&#39;s sufficiently thick it will reflect microwaves (which i reckon are the wavelengths being used from the material i&#39;ve found online).  it helps a bit.  really, the grounding thing worked well, as i described.  i think you have to just keep experimenting and logging the results until you find something that does work.  it makes a big difference in getting a good sleep vs struggling with that over a long time.</p>

<p>there are other techs used, yes.  but you just have to hit each one as you go.  remove the modality of their influence and just slowly improve.  it&#39;s either that or giving up.  that&#39;s not in my psychology anymore.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>calling your phone is not the method to test shielding. The power of microwaves has to be much stronger to make a call than to use Wi-Fi and data. Test using your wi-fi and then test using your data. Connect to the internet, open a browser, log into a website that gives an error if your internet connection is disrupted. Then test your phone inside a galvanized steel garbage can.</p>

<p>Galvanized steel does not attenuate 5G phones which uses millimeter waves.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Baking pans made of aluminum? Aluminum won&#39;t shield. Thick metal does not shield </p>

<blockquote>
<p>anything that has thick metal, on the premise that if it&#39;s sufficiently thick it will reflect microwaves </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thickness does not alter the frequency range a metal can attenuate. See the Shielding: Aluminum wiki, Shielding: Copper wiki and other shielding wikis in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> for the frequency ranges. No metal shields the upper range of microwaves. No metal shields millimeter waves.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(which i reckon are the wavelengths being used from the material i&#39;ve found online).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Source? Specific absorption rate (SAR) emitted by your phone, tablet, router and smart meter can be remotely elevated. Those are microwaves. SAR emitted by 5G millimeter waves are not microwaves. Radar is ultra wideband which includes but is not limited to microwaves.  Mind control is extremely low frequency (ELF) which is below microwaves. See the Mind Control: ELF wiki in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>foil doesn&#39;t reflect but it absorbs.</p>

<p>False.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>sorry was away for the day.  read your response.  i guess fair points.  i&#39;m using trial and error regardless.  yes i understand that there are a variety of different conceivable energy weapons and what i&#39;m suggesting won&#39;t work for all of them.  that&#39;s really not what i&#39;m trying to do.  quite simply i&#39;m trying to find out what&#39;s working for me, and offering this information to others and they can use it how they&#39;d like.  it&#39;s not scientifically rigourous.  it&#39;s trial and error.  </p>

<p>i could go thru your answers and provide more context, but what&#39;s the point?  i&#39;m not sure what tech is being used.  i don&#39;t have the instruments or the means to acquire them to make sure statements about what i&#39;m experiencing.  i have what i have and i can only report on the data that they&#39;re giving me.</p>

<p>yes the foil does absorb.  put it in a microwave and turn it on and you&#39;ll see what happens - it sparks and burns.  put thicker metal in and you don&#39;t see that.  the explanations for why that i&#39;ve read say it&#39;s reflecting not absorbing.  again, i&#39;m not making statements about all the different modes of tech being used.  i&#39;m just experimenting with what&#39;s on hand and reporting what i experience.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve heard foiling all your walls works but not all the way</p>

<p>Aluminum foil on windows and walls fail to shield radar and optical radar (laser). Aluminum on the floor does not shield ground penetrating radar. See the Shielding: Aluminum wiki in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> and <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<p>You appear masochistic to refuse to believe shielding yourself is wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I believe an AI learns from the things we say online to understand humanity better. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe in AI</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Try to see the implications of a controlling A.I believing pain induced by advanced technologies can be easily averted with foil.</p>

<p>Radar, optical radar and ground penetrating radar are not attenuated by aluminum. See the Shielding: Aluminum wikis in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> and <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What do you mean by influencing? Radar, optical radar and ground penetrating radar are attenuated by sea water, wet clay and to a lesser extent fresh water and magnets. See the shielding wikis in <a href="/r/targetedenergyweapons">/r/targetedenergyweapons</a> and <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>. </p>

<p>A body voltage meter is the best meter to measure electrical field and magnetic field of the body. See the Meters: Body Voltage meters wikis in <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>.</p>

<p>You didn&#39;t correctly take measurements. See the instructions at:
[WIKI] Meter reports: Detecting electromagnetic DEWS</p>

<p>Earthing definitely helps. Your earthing set up is similar to Michael&#39;s:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>beneath the mattress is a sheet of 12″ aluminum foil running the length of the bed, and on top of that is about three feet of small copper tubing connected to a #10 wire that runs to the copper cold water plumbing.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>yes that&#39;s the model i have.  it provides x/y (i presume the depth component is implicit in where the handset is) for electrical fields, and x/y/z for mag.  all i can say is that i see the charge increase from 0 V/m to upwards of 80 V/m when i suspect there&#39;s a tech being used.  and this happens in areas that aren&#39;t near power.  i have no wifi or wireless stuff in the house, and no cell phone.  everything is wired. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Could you answer the questions I had asked? What state do you reside in which does not mandate smart meters. Does your modem have wi-fi? Almost all modems have wi-fi. Only a few models offer the feature of turning off wi-fi.  What is the model of your modem? You have not submitted a meter report. You haven&#39;t discussed any radiofrequency measurements and their sources. </p>

<p>V/m measures AC electrical fields such as dirty electricity, stray voltage and maser attacks.  What are your magnetic measurements?  Why aren&#39;t you reading the sources I cited? The sources I cited instruct how to submit a meter report.  You need to hold the meter within an inch of your body part that is being attacked. You need to take a background measurement. Compare the background measurement with the measurement within an inch of your body.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While meditating I really wanted to contact benevolent beings, the experience might&#39;ve been a fake technologically induced experience but I&#39;ll make use of anything useful it had to offer. Right now I believe I shouldn&#39;t keep searching for answers and should work on what I <strong>intended</strong> to be working on if I ever found whatever I was looking for in conspiracies, to bring peace in the world. We always know this world isn&#39;t run the way it should be but are controlled to forget it along the way. </p>

<p>There was a small misunderstanding between me and my boyfriend the other day who can&#39;t understand my point of view on many spiritual things. I was explaining to our friend who had a possession experience (controlled to do strange things and memory wiped like sirhan sirhan &amp; personally experienced) that it might&#39;ve been technology and how they&#39;ve unlocked all the secrets of the mind and use tech to control our paths, he told us he&#39;d been searching about satanic things online before the experience which makes it very obvious to me he&#39;s a targeted individual. So much programming is done from the stuff targets look into online or say on their phone. </p>

<p>He&#39;s young, lot of young people are interested in spiritual things here but are distracted by false info. I said before how an Iranian forum with lot of topics on different occult/new age/spiritual stuff popped up with lot of occult shills and they banned me since my first post cuz they don&#39;t like specific people having an effect on society.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>They are not directed energy weapons that torture you.  It&#39;s very real devils from the spiritual realm.  Your dreams and astral projection are just your soul entering into the spirit realm where these things rule.  There is NO GOOD there even though they will represent themselves as good.</p>

<p>Next time you feel attacked just cry out in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and demand that it stop and see what happens.  After it stops, ask yourself why that name had power over the situation you were in.</p>

<p>Once you see what I&#39;m saying is true repent and believe the gospel of Jesus Christ to be saved:</p>

<p>1Co 15:1  Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand; 
1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</p>

<p>The King James Bible has all the answers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While meditating I really wanted to contact benevolent beings, the experience might&#39;ve been a fake technologically induced experience but I&#39;ll make use of anything useful it had to offer. Right now I believe I shouldn&#39;t keep searching for answers and should work on what I <strong>intended</strong> to be working on if I ever found whatever I was looking for in conspiracies, to bring peace in the world. We always knew this world isn&#39;t run the way it should be and are controlled to forget it along the way. </p>

<p>There was a small misunderstanding between me and my boyfriend the other day who can&#39;t understand my point of view on many spiritual things. I was explaining to our friend who had a possession experience (controlled to do strange things and memory wiped like sirhan sirhan &amp; personally experienced) that it might&#39;ve been technology and how they&#39;ve unlocked all the secrets of the mind and use tech to control our paths, he told us he&#39;d been searching about satanic things online before the experience which makes it very obvious to me he&#39;s a targeted individual. So much programming is done from the stuff targets look into online or say on their phone. </p>

<p>The next day BF was upset I told our friend it&#39;s tech cuz he had experiences with demonic beings by using psychedelics, grew up believing lot of Islamic points of view on this stuff, saw powers of this one Islamic guru so just naturally rejects lot of my ideas, I think cuz of cognitive dissonance. I said these experiences are mostly caused by technology because it&#39;s just more efficient than using 20 people with a high vibration. Then he replies with an offensive comeback cuz he knows he&#39;s lost and doesn&#39;t like losing says something like &#39;yeah ok you know everything, everything you say is right&#39; </p>

<p>I told him I know lot of things I haven&#39;t told you about, he tells me the same thing to get on my nerves so I try to explain to him to make him understand the same reasons that you stand so strongly on your core beliefs isn&#39;t very different than mine, we naturally create images and meanings in our minds to explain the world around us and I stand firmly on my beliefs even if I know they might not be true so I&#39;m not subconsciously distracted from my path. I try to gain as much knowledge and have a better understanding of how things work and the truth that really matters is the truth that&#39;s in every living beings&#39;s mind so I try to create a beautiful truth.  </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe people who blindly follow religious books have tried hard enough to find a more complete truth. Your version of truth lacks a lot of crucial info.  </p>

<p>Our possession experience friend is young, lot of young people are interested in spiritual things here but are distracted by false info. I said before how an Iranian forum with lot of topics on different occult/new age/spiritual stuff popped up with lot of occult shills and they banned me since my first post just recommending a book cuz they don&#39;t like specific people having an effect on society and I was also heavily targeted then by spiritual stuff. I also talked about a too professional and popular sattelite TV channel here that many wonder how they get funded, they started running shows about aliens like crazy couple years ago. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that you are seeking deeper turths and you are on the &quot;light side&quot; of things.  Lucifer is the &quot;light bearer&quot; and looked incredibility beautiful in his original state.  He plays both sides, light and dark.  He uses duality.</p>

<p>Eze 28:13  Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created. 
Eze 28:14  Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth; and I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God; thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire. 
Eze 28:15  Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created, till iniquity was found in thee. 
Eze 28:16  By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned: therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy thee, O covering cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire. 
Eze 28:17  Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground, I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee. 
Eze 28:18  Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee. 
Eze 28:19  All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more. </p>

<p>He is the one running the show that you are experiencing.  Their goal in the end will be to torment you more and more while continuing to deceive you.  You will take on devils in you, more and more as times goes on seemingly giving you more and more &quot;power.&quot;</p>

<p>Mar 5:2  And when he was come out of the ship, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit, 
Mar 5:3  Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains: 
Mar 5:4  Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him. 
Mar 5:5  And always, night and day, he was in the mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himself with stones. 
Mar 5:6  But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran and worshipped him, 
Mar 5:7  And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with thee, Jesus, thou Son of the most high God? I adjure thee by God, that thou torment me not. 
Mar 5:8  For he said unto him, Come out of the man, thou unclean spirit. 
Mar 5:9  And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many. 
Mar 5:10  And he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country. 
Mar 5:11  Now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding. 
Mar 5:12  And all the devils besought him, saying, Send us into the swine, that we may enter into them. 
Mar 5:13  And forthwith Jesus gave them leave. And the unclean spirits went out, and entered into the swine: and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea, (they were about two thousand;) and were choked in the sea. 
Mar 5:14  And they that fed the swine fled, and told it in the city, and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that was done. 
Mar 5:15  And they come to Jesus, and see him that was possessed with the devil, and had the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid. </p>

<p>What you are doing is simply a form of wizardly using familiar spirits:</p>

<p>Isa_19:3  And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar spirits, and to the wizards.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve done plenty of psychedelic drugs in my time.  I&#39;ve been deep down the conspiracy rabbit hole.  The truth is God is real and he wants you to be reconciled to him through his only begotten son Jesus Christ (who is God manifest in the flesh).</p>

<p>At the very least try my suggestion of invoking the Lord Jesus Christ the next time you experience an attack.  They will get worse and worse over time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you use psychedelics or not.  If you are opening your mind you are making yourself a vessel for unclean spirits:</p>

<p>Mat 12:43  When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. 
Mat 12:44  Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. 
Mat 12:45  Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. </p>

<p>Your attacks are very much spiritual and you are deceived into thinking they are technological.  Perhaps someday when your attacks increase you will remember back to this conversation and realize the truth it in it.  The beings you are seeing and interacting with are devils that will continue to torment and influence you.</p>

<p>Jesus is creepy.</p>

<p>Jesus don&#39;t fucking sacrifice yourself for the sins I never planned on ever fucking committing and don&#39;t make occult torture a symbol in children&#39;s minds and you&#39;re just giving a clue that you plan on sinning a lot in the future right? sorry man, I&#39;m my god you&#39;re nothing to me, just like your idea of Jesus.
