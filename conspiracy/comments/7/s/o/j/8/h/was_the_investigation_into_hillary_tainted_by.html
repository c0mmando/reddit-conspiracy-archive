       Clearly the people investigating Hillary had a bias for her and it was unlikely that we would ever see a fair trial. Do you think the investigation should be reopened under new supervision so that we can get down to the actual truth about her rigging the primary, mishandling classified material, and the various other crimes she’s committed?
      </p>
      <p>
       And if the Trump Russia collusion investigation is tainted, should it be treated the same way and re-opened, or should it be treated differently?

       Is there anyone left in DC who can investigate these things in an impartial way? I feel like we get all this rolling, and then they will just stack the investigation with her cronies, and it will just be a huge dog and pony show.

       Funny how this is all you hear about on reddit coming from Sharia Blue, formerly Correct the record. As if somehow because Hillary lost the election she should be absolved of her crimes.

       They are still looking for DB Cooper who jumped out of a hijacked plane with ransom money how many decades ago, but the Clinton investigations just go away with a "nothing to see here". Tells you something.

       We don't know, he could be part of the Deep State. Sessions might be, too. At this point, its incredibly difficult for the general public to identify the white hats.

       They should hand over the investigations to the cadets at the academy. They don't have loyalties yet. How great would that be? let a bunch of greens looking to prove themselves dig in to all this mayhem. With guidance from instructors of course.

       The low hanging fruit are the Clinton Foundation, and the emails, plus nuclear one, and the tarmac meeting with Lynch.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is/was already a lawsuit about rigging the primaries but since the parties can do as they please, that isn't much to chase after.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the investigations should be opened up again since it looks like Comey/Lynch let her off the hook. The bigger issue here is looks like some folks at the FBI have some explaining to do.

       What about the house investigations that never found anything against her?  Those we're all spearheaded by GOP members that have hated her for years.

       If the FBI wasn't going to recommend prosecution, using terms like "grossly negligent" would be incorrect because it implies guilt.

       It wasn't the FBI's job to recommend or not recommend prosecution. Their job was to investigate and determine if there was any culpability. Peter Strzok removed the verbiage that would have allowed Hillary Clinton to be prosecuted. To me, it seams like Peter gave her a pass.

       What's your source on this? I'm not understanding how Strzok had the power to prevent a case being brought simply by changing some words. You just told me it's not the FBI's job to recommend prosecution, so why does an FBI agent have the power to prevent an indictment?

       The change was significant because gross negligence in the handling of classified information is a federal crime, whereas extreme carelessness is not a legal term.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this was not changed by Peter Strzok their would have been a legal avenue to prosecute Hillary.

       Based on what we are learning now about now, it seems that there was an extensive network in place that existed to protect Clinton, Obama, etc. The FBI and DOJ, specifically, were compromised and high level insiders (Strzok, Comey, Lynch, etc.) may have been working to help cover tracks and exonerate her.
      </p>
      <p>
       Based on the texts between Strzok and Page, we now know that Strzok was manipulating Comey's comments, Lynch was aware of what the FBI would say and playacting as if she didn't (to appear impartial), and then Comey was getting in front of the cameras like the good little shit he is and regurgitating their script.
      </p>
      <p>
       We don't know the extent of the corruption here and if what I said above is any indicator, it's completely possible that any investigation into something like Benghazi (which I think is one of the things you may have been referring to in your comment) was compromised as well.

       House investigations don't prosecute. You can be held in contempt of Congress for not appearing before Congress after being summoned/subpoenaed (

       <em>

       Susan Rice), but the prosecution lies within the bounds of a US attorney (DOJ).
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole controversy lies in the fact that Comey took it upon himself to clear Hillary and overstepped his bounds, acting as both the investigator and DOJ. The FBI doesn't prosecute, they investigate and then bring the findings to the DOJ who in turn prosecute. There's tons of information on Hillary having classified and SAPs on her personal server with who knows what she was doing with it (selling to foreign actors for $$$ maybe?).
      </p>
      <p>
       What America has witnessed in this past race was that there are two different laws established in American society. One, for the ordinary American people. Two, for the elite. She grossly misused her power, and so far has came out scotch free thanks to a extremely corrupt DOJ and FBI (leaders - not the majority of the organizations). Apparently you can keep classified and SAPs on a personal server if you're an elite, but if you take a picture on a classified submarine, you're court martial-ed and sent to prison. Both are law breaking, but in 1 situation you can get out scotch free by having a class status.

       Could it be that people are "politically attacking" Trump because of his perceived wrongdoing and not any simple "political grudge"?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a big Trump fan, but it isn't just because I hate Trump or the Republican party. It's because everything I see in terms of what Trump has actually done and is doing astonishes me in it's absurdity. And I'm not even talking about CNN's spun version of events, but releases from the White House, Fox News, and Trump's own tweets.

       No, it's because Trump was never supposed to be president, Hillary was, and that messed up the plans of some powerful people.  We know from the Podesta emails that the Hillary campaign planned the whole Russian line of attack right after it became clear that their pied-piper candidate actually had a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not a fan of Trump either, I think he's a moron.  That said, it's clear that a large portion of the government has been subverted by the intelligence agencies and the MIC, and that they're attacking Trump.  He may be a moron, but he's the duly elected president, and these elements of the government that don't respect that should be exposed and punished.

       Again, fair is fair.  If there is something there that warrants an investigation, than by all means.  But it’s looking more and more like it was all bullshit and all stemming from that fake dossier.  So In that sense, no I think the investigation should focus on who was involved in illegal spying of a presidential candidate, and the collusion that has already been shown by the Clinton campaign, and the subsequent cover up and cover ups that they were involved in. I’m not against holding anyone accountable who is breaking the law.  Left, right, black, white.  We all need to be held to the same standard and if you fuck up, you need to deal with the consequences, no matter who it is.

       If the team was tainted against Trump and a year later they STILL haven't produced enough evidence, I can't see how a more fair team would fare any better. Besides, it's looking more and more like the entire collusion thing was a made up charge to distract Trump and the public from Hillary's crimes, of which it now appears the FBI and DoJ participated in.
