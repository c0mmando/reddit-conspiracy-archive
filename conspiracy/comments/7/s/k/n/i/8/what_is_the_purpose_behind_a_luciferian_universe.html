       Why wouldn’t the creator of an entire Universe and the only source of existence be benevolent?
      </p>
      <p>
       I
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       Lucifer is the dark matter, the eternal substance behind existence and being.
      </p>
      <p>
       God isn’t an entity. God is solely an idea... awareness without form, the idea behind the Universe. God is existence, awareness, and being, which includes all things and is beyond duality and time. With that said, one becomes God by immensely suffering...
      </p>

       Why?

       You are making several statements, that I'm not sure I agree with.  Yet you are making them as if they are written in stone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Statements you've made within your post:
      </p>
      <p>
       1.) The Creator of the Entire Universe IS benevolent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree.  I think He is.  And, why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       2.) Lucifer is the dark matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       No, I disagree.  I think Lucifer is a being - a fallen angel - now called Satan.  I don't think it's a metaphor for something, I think that both God &amp; Satan are beings.
      </p>
      <p>
       3.) God isn't an entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       (see above)
      </p>
      <p>
       4.) One becomes God by immensely suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       I totally disagree.  I don't think anything any human can do, including suffering, will make them God.  It might help make them more spiritual; maybe a bit more reflective, etc. - but not God.
      </p>
      <p>
       And for your question: "Why?"  I cannot attempt to answer that since I disagree with your previous premises.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.

       Satan and Lucifer are different in he Mystery Religion.  If you are Christian, then you probably disagree.  Mark Passio has a good video about Satan and Lucifer.

       I personally cannot answer this without a lot of research.  There are many Bible verses dealing with the answer to this though.  A Biblical scholar might be able to give a decent answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyhow, some verses say that he is in hell (Tartarus) locked in chains.  (2 Peter 2:4)
       <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm">
        http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In another verse, God asks Satan where he had come from and Satan answers and says he was walking the earth to and fro and going up and down on it. (Job 1:7)
       <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-7.htm">
        http://biblehub.com/job/1-7.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       In still others, it is said that after Satan's "prison term" or 1000 years, he will be let out of Hell and his chains loosened to allow him to go back to Earth to deceive nations.  (Revelation 20:7 &amp; 8)
       <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm">
        http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm
       </a>
       (and the next).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, I'd say it's going to take either a lot of study to properly answer that question or someone well versed in The Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are others who say that Satan and the Fallen Angels were just found in Antartica and that's why so many prominent people have recently gone there.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd really have to do your own research to come up with your answer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd hazard to guess though, that no one really knows the answer to that and anyone giving an answer would mostly be giving their own opinion on it.  So, beware.
      </p>
      <p>
       Good luck.

       I have certainly read my Bible, and can honestly say that my personal opinion is that it does not hold any objective truths regarding any Old Testament characters, unless they're from the later books, Kings and Job and Daniel and the like. That being said, Revelations is a book I can only attribute to mushrooms, or other such divinations (Delphi, et al).  I don't believe it has any bearing to the spiritualism and civics as taught by Jesus. Everything else was taken from much earlier stories, Babylonian and Sumerian and such. While they're not objectively true, they do hold a lot of truth in them. So while some being we call Lucifer might have pissed off some being we call YHWH, he probably wasn't imprisoned for 1000 years. The years blur the lines of history.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, where did the Fallen Angels go? What ever happened with the other Tree(s) that Mankind did not eat of? Are these pertinent questions for humanity these days? Does the occult (not witchcraft, et al. but actual hidden knowledge) still have bearing on our modern lives?
      </p>
      <p>
       I have an avid interest in this subject. What knowledge did the cities that existed before the Flood have? Where would the G(g)ods live?

       Good question. My opinions are based on the idea's presented in the Urantia Book.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only creation that is perfectly settled is Havona, the central universe, which was made by the thought of the Universal Father and the word of the Eternal Son.
      </p>
      <p>
       Havona is an existential, perfect, and replete universe, surrounding the home of the eternal Deities, the center of all things.
      </p>
      <p>
       The creations of the seven super universes are finite, evolutionary, and consistently progressive.

       I have perused the Urantia book and ultimately found more grandiose claims and proclamations all boiling down to your choice to BELIEVE in the absence of any credibility, attempted proof or verification of anything.

      <p>
       If you found something of value in that word salad, congratulations.

       In my opinion it is just more recycling of time worn themes with cut and paste New Age wishful thinking.

       I didn't have a religious up-bringing, and this may be why I'm drawn to the book. I had just enough to where my family believed in God and Jesus, but we never went to church, or practiced any one sect of Christianity.

       I believe the natural state of things is a rest state. Energy is needed to produce movement and cohesion. But the end result of everything is determined by entropy.

       Interesting.

       No Creator Son begins universe organization until the power directors have effected the mobilization of the space-energies sufficiently to provide a material foundation - literal suns and material spheres - for the emerging universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Local universes are all approximately of the same energy potential, though they differ greatly in physical dimensions and may vary in visible- matter content from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
       The energy charge of a local universe is approximately one one-hundred-thousandth of the force endowment of its super universe.

       Maybe those who embrace satanism are trying to lesson their own personal suffering by making others suffer. I think though, that the opposite is probably true: that if we can lessen the suffering of others we also lesson our own suffering. It's because we're all the same thing.
