       Nobody cares. I mentioned it to two different coworkers and posted comments online to a couple MSM newspapers, and got basically destroyed for asking about it. Like it's normal for one of the biggest airports in the world to go dark for 11 fucking hours without any explanation. People can fuck their fists, hard.

       Couldn't agree more.  Civil infrastructure is redundant at many levels.  Here, we have a case where the busiest airport in the United States is out of commission without so much as a cursory explanation.  Of course, you would be chastised for even daring to opine that there could be a reason that has been withheld.  But, yeah.  Fuck those people anyway.

       I’m starting to think about giving up on any concentrated effort towards helping people care about anything. Package it any way possible and they just don’t care. Not at all.

       I don’t think it’s that people don’t care, it’s that no matter how loud we demand something, tptb just thumb their noses at us. It’s like officer barbrady in South Park...’ nothing to see here, move along’. The midterm elections in Obama’s last year of presidency had one of the greatest unseating of incumbents, people were fed up with big gov, and nothing changed, same as yesterday. It’s hard to care + commits + continues when no matter what we say, or do, nothing changes except we get a pat on the head and told to move along, nothing to see here.

       I was reading an article right after it happened that went into detail about how there was one plane that came and went during the power outage.
      </p>
      <p>
       The plane was registered to an Israeli company that deals in shipping hazardous materials and other things that can do serious damages (nukes and such). The plane came from Mexico, landed in the middle of the outage, was loaded up very quickly with whatever, and then left in a hurry.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s all I can recall at the moment, I’ll try to find the article.

       The plane was previously owned by Evergreen Airlines, as well. Evergreen is well known as a CIA front.

       Still blows my mind Evergreen is/was a CIA front. Rode by their HQ on the way to school every morning growing up. Nothing ever happens around here so thinking about clandestine ops taking place under everybody's nose is pretty wild. Their owner was notorious for not paying bills timely if at all, being a ruthless employer, and running the company into the ground while living in a mansion. I suspect money laundering in there too with how many ways that company seemed to lose money.
