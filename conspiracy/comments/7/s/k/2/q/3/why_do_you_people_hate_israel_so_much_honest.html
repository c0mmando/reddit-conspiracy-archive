        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I keep hearing the word ‘Zionist’ thrown around. Why is Israel demonized but not all the other countries we are invested in? We’ve invested trillions propping up Western Europe and dealing with its ideological messes (Nazism, Communism) in the 20th century. We still have troops there, still dealing with Russia decades after the fall of the USSR, and still would fight a war over it all. And yet, a meeting with the leaders of the EU, individual member states, or NATO wouldn’t make you guys bat an eye. Nor would it with Japan, Korea, Australia, etc.</p>

<p>Israel building houses in Palestine gets you guys fired up but no outrage about the rampant corruption that exists from the Rio Grande all the way to Antarctica. Or from the Straight of Gibraltar to the Cape of Good Hope. Corruption, violence, poverty and misery. And I’m supposed to care that Trump wore a yamaka, moved an embassy, and basically maintained the status quo? </p>

<p>Is this just a reason for you guys to hate Trump (while still hating his enemies), is it anti-Semitism, or do you guys have an actual reason? I’m honestly curious. I get that we are propping up Israel too but so what when you look at where our foreign aid is going? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this concern about Israel regarding Trump is a cop out by the conspiracy community who refuses to admit that Trump is a victim. You can’t admit that he is being targeted by an actual deep state group so people dip back into the comfortable well of blaming the Jews. I’m asking why being a friend of Israel is any worse than, say, FDR being an Anglophile. Why do we tolerate allegiances to the United Nations and EU, groups that do not love the United States, but not Israel? Is it possible to appreciate Israel as a nation and not be a puppet? </p>

<p>The opposite of Zionism, at this point, is the Holocaust/War. There is no other option. These people aren’t going to leave their country and they aren’t going to allow themselves to be victimized again. So what do you want them to do? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Let me give you a bit of back-story: I remember seeing the Monica Lewinsky scandal unfold on television when I was young. I watched 9/11 happen <em>in high school</em>. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 32, not wise by any means, but seasoned enough to know the pattern of who becomes president and which interests they serve. If you think for a second, that any president elect would get their name on the ballot in all 50 states (Only Rep or Dem), and <em>not</em> be down to play ball, well you need another decade of living before you have a shot at understanding how the game is played.</p>

<p>George Bush campaigned on a platform that was anti-nation building. I.E. reduce foreign troop presence. Anyone wanna guess how that turned out?</p>

<p>Barack Obama campaigned with &quot;Yes we can&quot; and &quot;Change you can believe in&quot; rhetoric, claimed to target all sorts of middle american crisis such as healthcare, tax reform, economy recovery (from the war) etc. The platform was indeed about <em>change</em>, just not what everyone had in mind.</p>

<p>Trump campaigned with the stance that he was gonna &quot;drain the swamp&quot;. He does appear to be doing that... but just what is he filling it with?</p>

<p>Do you get it now? These are all slogans meant to entice the average voter into thinking the candidates are something they are not. Designed to give the illusion that a president, or president elect, has the general public interests in mind while special interests are getting their way. That&#39;s not limited to American corporate interests. Foreign interests play a big part in the game, and Israel has always been a big player.</p>

<p>People in my age group are jaded. Disillusioned. We&#39;ve been lied to far too much, we&#39;re not gonna believe the next establishment patsy that CNN says is good for us, so they gave us the opposite.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got someone they demonize. Looks legit, right? I&#39;m gonna tell you to stop looking at his suit and smirk and presence, and just watch what actions he takes. Actions will always speak louder than words, whatever you <em>think</em> is going on behind the scenes, isn&#39;t happening until it actually happens.</p>

<p>He <em>is</em> throwing Israel a bone (a genocidal apartheid state), our VP Pence is practically shuffling at Netanyahu&#39;s feet as we speak. You wanna tell me how Trump has actually improved your life, beyond having new team colors to wear at the rally?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Any politician or leader in world history had to play ball with some special interest. I don&#39;t care if you are talking about Caesar, Hitler, or every American President. If you don&#39;t have support, you won&#39;t amount to anything. There is a reason that Bernie Sanders is an insignificant figure in American politics. Even then I doubt he isn&#39;t backed by influential players. Labor unions backed him, which means that international left-wing/Marxist movements backed him.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t elect Trump to make my life better. My life was already good. We elected him to not make things worse. Obama&#39;s entire agenda was about cutting America down at the knees. I don&#39;t need Trump to babysit me. I need him to make business easier in this country, making us richer and goods cheaper. Those tax cuts are paying dividends for people of all income levels already. Raises, bonuses, tax cuts, job growth, repatriation of foreign cash, etc. That is how you create wealth in a nation of 330 million people. We will never be tiny rich and formerly homogeneous Sweden or Switzerland. </p>

<p>As for draining the swamp, just follow the FBI story. The media and Washington establishment is facing the toughest opponent, maybe ever. If they owned Trump, they would have leverage on him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Many many reasons, in no order, , here’s a few- note none of these specifically have to do with Judaism  in of itself: </p>

<p>1) new (sinister) relationship with KSA as a proxy vs Iran. Granted the US is too...see death of Yemi children as a result. </p>

<p>2) AIPAC. I can’t stress how weird it is and it’s control over congress. This is a rabbit hole. </p>

<p>3) in 2016, when presidential candidates were finalized, both D &amp; R candidates met in private with the PM of Israel to discuss their attitudes and policy. Apparently all candidates do this. </p>

<p>4) certain members of Congress hold dual citizenship with Israel. Our founding fathers would consider this treasonous, regardless of state. </p>

<p>5) the every American pays $10 a year to Israel on average in the form of foreign aid.  </p>

<p>6) boycotting Israel is now sewn into certain statues in states. AFAIK, this is the only foreign power that has this type of influence over states’ rights </p>

<p>7) 2/3 of all diamonds (many of them ill-gotten) in the US “inexplicably” come through Israel, though the country itself produces no diamonds. </p>

<p>8) Israel is a nuclear state, yet it is unclear how they procured these warheads and the US only admitted this as recently as 2006. What’s even more strange is that the US just turned a blind eye towards this </p>

<p>9) Mossad, foreign  agents, actively operate in the United States, sometimes for, sometimes against its own citizens. </p>

<p>10) US media is strangely quiet when it comes to criticizing Israel. </p>

<p>There’s a lot more and I’m just scratching the surface. 
Notice I did not mention Palestine, or any specific religion. </p>

<p>I’m just throwing out random talking points. There are more users here with a better understanding of the state as a whole.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why is Israel blamed for a proxy against Iran? Our interests in the Middle East aren’t about Israel maintaining control over their tiny, insignificant bit of land. We are there for the oil, aren’t we? We are the bigger partner and they the junior. We pay Israel to remain a key ally in the region. Yet you are implying that the Israelis exert all this control over the United States. It seems we are the ones dictating things, not Israel. </p>

<p>I’m not understanding what Israel’s ambitions are. Survival? If that is the case then why are they being treated as villains? The state of Israel is built on the dead bodies of millions of murdered Jews. Survival is a more noble and understandable modus opererandi than expansion or imperialism. We are the imperialists. Britain, France, Russia, and China too. Yet the Jews are being blamed for our global battle over resources and important strategic locations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>1)Proxies, since the beginning of the Cold War and til this day, are the best way for countries to fire in anger without triggering immensely chaotic events.</p>

<p>This is also why when certain states are in conflict with each other, they attempt to undermine each others&#39; governments until the enemy state&#39;s government becomes more favorable of them, i.e willing to make more concessions that would benefit the intervening state&#39;s interests. </p>

<p>So how does it surprise anyone that Israel is trying to use KSA as a proxy against Iran?</p>

<p>Iran has been using proxies against Israel since the 1980&#39;s. Once even started an active war against Israel. Iran is a threat to Israel, so how is this something that can be condemned?</p>

<p>Sure, many people really love Iran because of the whole ISIS thing. ISIS were portrayed in the media as the &quot;bad guys&quot; in Syria and Iraq, as if there weren&#39;t literally hundreds of large groups that were practically identical to ISIS other than size, and thousands of local gangs that practiced the same thing. Iran fought against ISIS because they threatened Assad and Hezbollah. </p>

<p>KSA either aided ISIS or at least didn&#39;t intervene that much against them because they were a disposable tool against Iran. </p>

<p>Lets say your mind on Israel was set regardless of this argument, and you support Iran. That&#39;s perfectly fine. But to say Israel uses KSA as a proxy but not condemn at the same breath Iran for using proxies against Israel as well, is a double standard.</p>

<p>2)Lobbies exist everywhere. AIPAC lobbies for Israel, other countries lobby for themselves in the US through other means.</p>

<p>3)It&#39;s not abnormal for candidates to have some form of dialogue with allied states to express their interests with these states, and policies they intend to push. </p>

<p>4)That is weird, yes, but that is because they&#39;re Jewish. Hence, they automatically are entitled to citizenship in Israel. </p>

<p>5)The military aid is not a bad thing. It&#39;s there to protect the interests of Israel and the US alike. To say that the taxpayer loses any money because of that is false. To say that the US doesn&#39;t profit from it, is doubly so. </p>

<p>Without doubt the US profits from this aid more than Israel does, both directly and indirectly. And the taxpayer doesn&#39;t lose anything because all that money goes not to Israel, but to American defense companies - primarily Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and Raytheon. </p>

<p>6)Boycotting any state is illegal. Not just Israel. I don&#39;t know the specifics and why Israel was mentioned last year when these news came up, but the law is pretty general about all states. </p>

<p>E.g Russian-based companies in America cannot boycott German companies/products only because Russia may have sanctions on Germany. They need the US to lay sanctions on Germany first. And that won&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>7)The word you&#39;re looking for is &quot;explicably&quot;. If something is inexplicable, it means it cannot be explained. Meanwhile, keyboards and search engines such as google pretty much prove that it IS an understandable matter.</p>

<p>If Israel holds the world&#39;s largest diamond exchange, and is involved in the whole process of cutting and polishing diamonds to exporting them (after receiving them in a rough state from various suppliers), then it&#39;s only natural for Israel to also be the largest supplier of processed diamonds.</p>

<p>You can read more here:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Diamond_Exchange">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Diamond_Exchange</a></p>

<p>8)Again, how is it not clear? France built a nuclear reactor in Israel. Argentina supplied the raw materials. And the reactor went to work. Few years later, in 1973, Israel showed its nuclear weapons to the US. Wanna hear of even more nuclear states?</p>

<p>Among our allies; the USA, UK, India and France. I guess they should all be condemned.</p>

<p>Among the rest; Russia, China, North Korea, Pakistan, and soon also Iran.</p>

<p>9)News flash: Intel agencies of countries operate in other countries. How many times was the US caught spying on Germany? On France, UK, etc etc. How many times have they spied on Israel?  </p>

<p>The leading conspiracy theory in this sub is the USS Liberty attack. That ship was used by the NSA, which in some cases is parallel to the Mossad. </p>

<p>Allies spy on allies. That&#39;s a rule that cannot be disproven. Everyone needs to know what their enemies are doing to counter their moves, but also what they&#39;re allies are doing to make sure there isn&#39;t anything bad cooking between the two.</p>

<p>10)Without even thinking, CNN comes to mind. For a western news agency they&#39;re vehemently anti-Israel.</p>

<p>Notice that I didn&#39;t mention the 170 or so states that are doing the exact same things as Israel does, that are not condemned though.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You seem to be a little triggered. How can it be genocide when amount of palestinians grew ten times from the beginning of so called occupation? And with help of UNRWA people being BORN refugees, how is that makes sence? One thing i admire trump for is cutting bullshit with palestinians. Decades of peace talks with them led to nothing as their current leaders are not interested in one. Few days ago abbas bought private jet for $50 million, so much for the struggle. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope. Let me give you a bit of back-story: I remember seeing the Monica Lewinsky scandal unfold on television when I was young. I watched 9/11 happen <em>in high school</em>. </p>

<p>I&#39;m 32, not wise by any means, but seasoned enough to know the pattern of who becomes president and which interests they serve. If you think for a second, that any president elect would get their name on the ballot in all 50 states (Only Rep or Dem), and <em>not</em> be down to play ball, well you need another decade of living before you have a shot at understanding how the game is played.</p>

<p>George Bush campaigned on a platform that was anti-nation building. I.E. reduce foreign troop presence. Anyone wanna guess how that turned out?</p>

<p>Barack Obama campaigned with &quot;Yes we can&quot; and &quot;Change you can believe in&quot; rhetoric, claimed to target all sorts of middle american crisis such as healthcare, tax reform, economy recovery (from the war) etc. The platform was indeed about <em>change</em>, just not what everyone had in mind.</p>

<p>Trump campaigned with the stance that he was gonna &quot;drain the swamp&quot;. He does appear to be doing that... but just what is he filling it with?</p>

<p>Do you get it now? These are all slogans meant to entice the average voter into thinking the candidates are something they are not. Designed to give the illusion that a president, or president elect, has the general public interests in mind while special interests are getting their way. That&#39;s not limited to American corporate interests. Foreign interests play a big part in the game, and Israel has always been a big player.</p>

<p>People in my age group are jaded. Disillusioned. We&#39;ve been lied to far too much, we&#39;re not gonna believe the next establishment patsy that CNN says is good for us, so they gave us the opposite.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve got someone they demonize. Looks legit, right? I&#39;m gonna tell you to stop looking at his suit and smirk and presence, and just watch what actions he takes. Actions will always speak louder than words, whatever you <em>think</em> is going on behind the scenes, isn&#39;t happening until it actually happens.</p>

<p>He <em>is</em> throwing Israel a bone (a genocidal apartheid state), our VP Pence is practically shuffling at Netanyahu&#39;s feet as we speak. You wanna tell me how Trump has actually improved your life, beyond having new team colors to wear at the rally?</p>
