      <p>
       I want to give anyone who will listen a very serious warning about the spread of zoonotic diseases that I think the WHO/CDC is downplaying or ignoring completely. I have been doing veterinary surgery in Panama and Ecuador and recently got back from a clinic in the Galapagos islands. My colleagues and I have been noticing some very worrying trends in nearly every central and south American veterinary clinic we have been working at. I'll try to quickly summarize our findings and then go into a little more detail.
There has been a massive increase in the percentage and type of zoonotic diseases being found in the animals.
Nearly 100% of the dogs we tested had antibodies for parvovirus and  parainfluenza virus. Over 2/3 had antibodies for adenovirus and about a 1/4 distemper. These were wild type antibodies in unvaccinated dogs and in many cases we were finding that the families that owned these dogs had contracted these viruses. Many people think that a lot of these viruses can only infect their pets but this is not true.
We also found over 25% of the dogs and cats infected with dirofilaria immitis, bartonella, and wolbachia pipiens. Bartonella was nearly 70% and almost every family member who lived with the infected animal had also contracted this. Over 2/3 of the cats had T. Gondi and toxoplasmosis was very prevalent in their human family members as well. A good % of the cats also had herpes virus.
      </p>
      <p>
       One of the most disturbing trends was the % of animals we found testing positive for the T. Cruzi parasite that causes Chagas disease. Even more disturbing is that we believe this is being spread by some other vector other than the kissing bug which is currently considered its only vector. Our current theories are that certain arthropods such as ticks, bed bugs, fleas, or certain hexapods are spreading this. This is particularly bad because it is being spread between humans as well and can be fatal if untreated.
      </p>
      <p>
       Currently the CDC says chagas disease can be trasmitted in these ways 
-contact with the feces of an infected triatomine bug
-mother-to-baby (congenital),
-contaminated blood products (transfusions),
an organ transplanted from an infected donor,
-laboratory accident, or
contaminated food or drink (rare)
      </p>
      <p>
       In our testing we have shown that T. Cruzi parasites can be transmitted between rodents through sex, unknown arthropods, and that food/drink contamination is certainly not rare. I can assure you that if it can be spread through sex between animals that it can be spread through human sex. If it can be spread from animal to animal through unknown arthropods, it can be spread to humans this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       The crisis in Venezuela is going to make this much worse. Climate change is going to make this much worse. Globalization is making to this much worse when people all around the word are having south american crops in their stores I can assure you that these parasites/viruses/bacteria are going to become a big problem in Texas after the Harvey flood waters have spread everything around.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of these parasites cause lymphatic filariasis which the WHO states cannot be contracted in the United States. I can assure you that a parasite doesn't give two fucks about what country it is in and isn't magically prevented from crossing the border.
The WHO and CDC would like to pretend that many of these things are very rare or that they can only be spread through certain vectors, but this is simply not true and people need to know they are at risk.

       Thank you for the informative and detailed analysis. If there is an intentional virulent outbreak in these areas, it would seem to possibly fit in with the strategy of depopulation of areas with enormous resource potential, as well as the threat domestically of imported contagion. Please keep us posted should/as you learn more.

       I don't think that these things are purposely being spread around in order to reduce population. Mostly because there is no need to spread these things around, they spread on their own. But I do think that their health impact is being ignored for monetary gain or even possibly depopulation.
      </p>

       For example, it is well known that billions of people are infected with T. Gondi, the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis. It is said that it doesn't cause any issues in most people but that it can lead to toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised people. However, people with schizophrenia or bi polar disorder are much more likely to test positive for T. Gondi than people without those mental disorders. In fact in many studies the majority of bi polar or schizophrenic patients tested were positive for T. Gondi.
T. Gondi is a brain parasite that secretes dopamine and can cause anything from behavioral changes to seizures.
Bi polar disorder has no know cause but is linked to dopamine regulation in the brain. Seems like a pretty obvious connection that should be looked into more, but you make a lot more money from lifelong bi polar drugs than you would from curing brain parasites.

       Me and my best both had the same problem  a couple years back of always being tired and having a headache. Went to the doctor it was toxoplasmosis and we both had to stay in for a while. I even got an attest saying I could stay home from school pretty much as often as I deemed neccesary. Are there differences between Toxo? I don't have a cat either

       When my sister was pregnant she was diagnosed with toxoplasmosis. The doc recommended she terminate the pregnancy. She didn't and her son was perfectly normal. She had probably been infected years if not decades earlier; it likely wasn't a brand new acute infection at the time of her pregnancy. Seemed like rather reckless advice on the part of her doctor and caused an awful lot of stress.

       I think people's immune systems in general are also waning, and from my courses on parasitology &amp;c i think the attributes we memorize are too fixed, it could be that these diseases and vectors have always been prevalent, but unrecognized. Good post 👍

       Yes. Aren't those all carried through the endocrine system? Is there a way to flush that out?  T Gondi breaks the blood brain barrier though right?

       Perfect, well then I'm doing the best I can.  I always thought it was interesting that these kind of things grew more virulent in warm/humid environments.  Could any evidence you've seen substantiate that,  and if so do you think a case could be made for cold therapy?  I really appreciate the advice and response to my earlier questions.

       Special antibiotics.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Currently recommended drugs in the treatment of toxoplasmosis act primarily against the tachyzoite form of T gondii; thus, they do not eradicate the encysted form (bradyzoite). Pyrimethamine is the most effective agent and is included in most drug regimens. Leucovorin (ie, folinic acid) should be administered concomitantly to prevent bone marrow suppression. Unless circumstances preclude using more than 1 drug, a second drug (eg, sulfadiazine, clindamycin) should be added.
       </p>
       <p>
        The efficacy of azithromycin, clarithromycin, atovaquone, dapsone, and cotrimoxazole is unclear; therefore, they should be used only as alternatives in combination with pyrimethamine. The most effective available therapeutic combination is pyrimethamine plus sulfadiazine or trisulfapyrimidines (eg, a combination of sulfamerazine, sulfamethazine, and sulfapyrazine). These agents are active against tachyzoites and are synergistic when used in combination.
       </p>
       <p>
        Careful attention to dosing regimen is necessary because it differs depending on patient variables (eg, immune status, pregnancy). Pyrimethamine may be used with sulfonamides, quinine, and other antimalarials and with other antibiotics.

       Yes I can do that. I am also currently working on editing this post on how to prevent and treat/cure these things on your own using veterinary medicines. It is extremely hard to get treated for these things in the US because doctors don't seem to think its a first world problem, nor do they ever bother testing for them. So they go untreated and end up causing serious chronic conditions. Things like arthritis are often caused by parasites and can be cured if caught early enough. In the US you can buy fish/aquarium or racehorse drugs without a prescription that are exactly the same as what people take and I always keep myself stocked up on vet meds just in case of emergencies.

       What are some urgent things I should look for? I live in central texas and im a medical assistant, so oddly people ask me about their pets. I feel like im shooting in the dark sometimes and i always just say "feed them better and take them to a vet" but living in a college town, no one can really afford it.
Please do keep us updated! And thank you so much for sharing

       Here are some things I would often see when people and their pets were sick with the same thing. A change in smell of stool/gas. This is actually something I noticed in myself when I contracted worms while at a clinic. The infected cats feces had a very distinct change in smell and one day I noticed my stool/gas suddenly smelled exactly the smell and then noticed the parasite eggs in my stool. 
Anytime a person with pets starts to have body twitches or spasms or they notice their pet has started having spasms/twitches. This would almost always indicate that a parasite infection was present in the brain or nervous system. 
If someones pet came in contact with any sort of rodent or rodent nest/urine/feces they should be examined closely for any parasites and should immediately treat themselves and their pets for fleas/lice even if they don't see any. So many cases where people and their pets didn't know where they could have become infected but remembered their pet chasing a mouse outside at some point. All it takes it for one rodent flea to bite a pet and then whatever that rodent had is now in your house. 
Any rectal itching, itchy or red/puffy eyes, any stagnant water around the house or yard.
Any wheezing or labored breathing from pets can indicate mold spores in the house and the pet is kind of like a canary in the coal mine because they are smaller and will show symptoms first.
Anytime a pet tests positive for intestinal worms or parasites, their owner should too. A couple days of fenbendazole will cure this in humans. It is pretty much only used in animals for some reason but is extremely safe and effective in humans and is by far the safest dewormer.

       Yes diatomaceous earth is great for parasites, it pretty much shreds them apart. Same with garlic. Fenbendazole is my go to treatment for roundworms as it is very safe and easy/cheap to get and you only need to take if for 3 days.

      </p>
      <p>
       u/ilikerealmaplesyrup states diamotaceous earth is "great for" it but doesn't mention ingesting it. (I personally thought you put it around your house.) Then mentions garlic ingestion
       <em>
        for himself
       </em>
       (not his pet).
      </p>
      <p>
       Then OP gives the thumbs-up about it but doesn't sufficient disambiguate it enough to be sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then you chime in with pet ingestion (of the garlic) plus onions.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sensing a lot of crosstalk.

       Garlic and onions are not to bed fed to dogs, but garlic oil on their neck, can keep fleas away.

       Eating raw garlic for humans, is useful for many things. Onion as well, but mainly when cooked.

       Diotamaceous earth(DE) is consumed by some people, but I've only ever used it in gardens, and for dealing with insects in general. I have read there is food grade DE, but forget what people were taking it for.

       Your dogs and cats can eat chocolate, garlic, and onion just fine in small quantities with basically no consequence. These substances are toxic, so you should not give them to your pets in large amounts or consistently over a long period of time. You can use charts to find out how much of these substances is harmful for your pets, and in what way. Just be very conservative with how much you give, consult toxicity guides, and don't give these things to your animal unless you have a very, very good reason to do so.

       What is the dosage of garlic that would be needed to be effective? Please cite support for this dosage, perhaps a study of some kind please, or a credible pet information site. Wherever you got this information should suffice.

       Diatomaceous earth (food grade) Is completely safe to ingest. I have ingested this stuff for years and given it to my dog many times. There are thousands of people who ingest this stuff with no problem. My own grandpa started taking this stuff years ago who is in his 80's and says that it has helped his joints ever since he started taking it.

       Idk how there is "food grade" diatomaceous earth. Its got a significant amount of ALUMINA in it, and that will cause brain damage if you eat it. Breathing it in will also cause lung problems.

       There are much safer alternatives.

       Food grade DE doesn't have Alumina. It has a very, very small amount of silica in it however, that has been shown in some studies to reduce the absorption of aluminum and help prevent alzheimer's.

       What dose of fenbenzadole should a person take? I noticed symptoms of worms in my dog this fall, and gave this medicine to her for the three days (she's very picky with noticing medicine in food, so I used a nice big piece of crispy rotisserie chicken skin, poured the powder onto the inside of it, and rolled it up and gave this along with a juicy piece of chicken to the dog and she loved it, took it diligently every of the 3 days). I was right, her symptoms cleared up and she is healthy and put weight on, no diarrhea or blood in her stool. She had vestibular syndrome while she had the worms, the vet diagnosed the vestibular attack but said nothing about worms so I took matters into my own hands. $20 and 3 days later, very easy course of medication. I will use it on her 2-3x a year from now on, or if I notice symptoms. She eats grass in warm months, not feces but eggs can be in soil anywhere for years if I remember.

       Cats and dogs aren't necessarily "pets". Think barn cats &amp; hunting dogs. Necessary for survival as part of thefarm team in areas where food happens because someone grew it or caught it for their families.

       What parasites cause or are linked to human arthritis?  What vet meds to treat or what test would you recommend to someone to ask for? A relative of mine has arthritis at a freakishly young age and works in an animal shelter...  this is interesting.

       Parasites, and spirochites especially like to hide from the immune system in the cartilage/bone/joints and can cause really bad arthritis and joint pain.

       Lyme. Lyme was discovered partly because kids were coming down with arthritis. Tests are highly unreliable. Doxycycline is the common antibiotic. Would probably have to see an LLMD. For joint pain and inflammation take cats claw and Japanese knotweed. Look up stephen buhner for natural treatment of lyme.

       The problem is even if you do figure out how to rid yourself of the spirochetes the damage they cause takes a long time to heal from.

        Things like arthritis are often caused by parasites and can be cured if caught early enough. In the US you can buy fish/aquarium or racehorse drugs without a prescription that are exactly the same as what people take and I always keep myself stocked up on vet meds just in case of emergencies.

       You are making a generalisation that involves 19 countries, and I'm not sure you and/or your colleagues explored them all. And I know you didn't say "every country in South and Central America", but anyone could read your text and then report it by saying "there's this crisis in all of the countries in South and Central America."
      </p>
      <p>
       Just thought this could be useful for this and other reports you might present in the future. It certainly is interesting and worth keeping an eye on.

       AIDS is what they call it when your immune system is functioning so poorly because of HIV that you begin getting opportunistic infections that threaten your life. So it does exist ya. It's the terminal point of an HIV infection.

       Having air and water filters in todays polluted world isnt exactly bubble wrapping. Everything else i listed with the exception of the oral antibiotics should be in everyones medicine cabinet or first aid kit and are at literally every corner drug store. Nothing exotic.

       I've heard of the fungus theory. I've heard it had to do with our exposure to Lithium (batteries) and/or nickel. Also heard it is what allows TIs to be remotely attacked. I don't know how much of that woo is credible much less verified!

       So Lyme disease is going wild in South America as well.  I think that's the plague that will take out the planet.  Not sure ppl realize how quick it can take out a countries meat production.

       Here’s the problem, Lyme disables you slowly over time. It won’t kill you quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was likely designed as a bioweapon to weaken the population, but leave them living so countries are forced to care for them eating up resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       I’m pretty sure I have Lyme and I can tell you this shit fucks you up slowly in a wide variety of ways. It’s unlike any other illness.

       Recovery is hard as hell.  If you want a good doctor, look up Susan L. Marra out of Seattle.  She treats people remotely if you can make it in person a few times a year.

       Thanks I’ll keep her in mind but sadly I can’t afford doctors right now unfortunately. Already spent tens of thousands of dollars trying to treat myself and I’m out of money at this point. Making just enough to cover bills now.

       My supplement and herb regimen is working slowly. I’ve already consulted to make sure I’m on the right path. I am confident I can clear the infection, but I’ve had this disease likely since I was a child and may need stem cells to make a full recovery.

       Be very careful with visible short wavelength light(blue). It causes rhodopsin mediated photo reversal and retinal damage through increased reactive oxygen species production in the eye.

       The ROS production is why blue light therapy kills bacteria, but you MUST wear eye protection!

       What part of Ontario are you in? The southern part near the US boarder has very high Lyme disease rates. Make sure there are no ticks left on your dog and be extra vigilant for anything resembling muscle stiffness, fatigue/malaise in your dog or yourself in the near future to make sure your in the clear. You can't spot the typical bullseye lyme rash through the dog's fur so it is hard to tell if the ticks were carrying it.

       I mean this respectfully, but many of the things you mention are because of sanitation issues that are not present in the US (or at least, most parts). Giardia is a good example--I got that ailment just about every month when I lived in one place where it was basically an inevitability if you wanted to eat anything that wasn't cooked, like fruit. Drugs knocked that shit out fast, no pun intended. When I'm in the US, I never get it. As you mentioned, things can be fatal... if left untreated. But the US hospitals even managed for an ebola patient not to die, back when all of us here were terrified it was an inevitability. Harvey is a good point, but the US has withstood the effects of several floods with no widespread plagues to note.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the pet stuff, not sure why you mention treating distemper. I took in a stray with distemper and that straight-up doesn't go to humans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I get that your specialty is very different than mine. But I'll preface this by saying I have a relative who is a vet, who
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       went to the Galapagos at a clinic (small world), and wasn't concerned with any of what you've raised here. I'm not saying that your assessment is wrong, just that I don't share the same concerns based on my own experiences and understanding of how viruses/parasites/bacteria work.
      </p>
      <p>
       For anyone who thinks I'm a pro-pharma shill (or any kind of shill) I encourage them to check my post history.

       Most of this stuff is due to sanitation issues, but there are still sanitation issues in the US. Thousands of cities across the US have decades old water pipe systems that have tested positive for heavy metals, bacteria, and parasites. There are certain towns in the US where over a third of all the people tested were positive for various parasites. 
60 million people in the US have chronic toxoplasmosis infections which has recently been linked to much higher rates of Alzheimers and cancer.
I'm not saying there is going to be a plague where everyone suddenly gets sick and die. These things don't cause that, they cause chronic health issues that mimic chronic diseases such as arthritis or autoimmune disorders. 
Distemper can be transmitted to humans with very compromised immune systems.

       I've been a big fan of tropical disease lore for thirty years, and have been waiting with bated breath for one of these bad boys to wreak havoc in civilized society, but I just don't think it's going to happen. Modern sewer systems, chlorination of drinking water, insecticides, and disease reporting all conspire to keep these third world diseases at bay--any significant outbreak would require either very exceptional circumstances, or the complete breakdown of modern society. I'm not worried about this stuff anymore.

       This stuff is already wreaking havoc on society. Toxoplasmosis has recently been linked to Alzheimers and cancer. Other spirochite infections cause arthritis, lupus, various autoimmune disorders. These things aren't going to suddenly cause everyone to die, but nearly every chronic disease is strongly linked with either a fungal, bacteria, viral, or parasite infection.

       In any case, what the OP seems to be talking about are new disease threats that are just emerging, yet everything they mentioned have been around forever, and a number of them (like the canine viruses he listed) are readily prevented by canine vaccination.

       Look at SARS for instance. SARS is one of the worst kinds of infectious disease that nature could throw at humankind: originally spread to humans from animals, it became anthroponotic, highly infectious and airborne. Yet in spite of that, worldwide infections were kept in the tens of thousands, and deaths below a thousand. I remember when it happened, and there was a bit of havoc wreaked in isolated areas, but its spread was halted on all fronts within just a year or so.

       It's possible that there might be another Spanish flu-type epidemic waiting in the wings, but it's been almost a century since the last, and modern medicine and communication has advanced by light years in that time, so I'm not that worried about it even if it does make its entrance in my lifetime.

       There’s also a dog flu outbreak.
      </p>
      <p>
       I would argue no to your original question, parasites and viruses function differently. Influenza has very specific patterns of infection and mutation.
      </p>
      <p>
       This isn’t to say parasites and viruses can’t attack the same host. Many people with a virus or a parasite have a weakened immune system allowing them to become more susceptible to the other. It is common that people with parasites get sick more often and have more complications from viruses.
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is the influenza pandemic in the US right now is likely the result of viral shedding from vaccines, as well as increased globalization and economic factors (people are working more, making less, and have worse access to health care). Parasites merely compound the issue and possibly increase the death toll, but they aren’t responsible for the pandemic itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       Something else caused the pandemic, and the reason I believe it is vaccine / viral shedding related is because rural states with very small populations that don’t even have international airports are now infected. The only logical explanation is the delivery mechanism is beyond human to human contact, and the only probable explanation is the vaccinated are shedding the virus they inject into themselves and infecting the non-vaccinated.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I believe is then happening is the non-vaccinated who get sick now have a mutated version of the vaccine virus which they are now giving back to the vaccinated which is why the vaccine isn’t working and why the only people who seem to be dying of this strain of influenza are those who have been vaccinated. It’s likely because this is a mutated version of the vaccine virus that was virally shed, found a non-vaccinated host, mutated, and then reinfected a vaccinated host with no immunity to this mutation.

       re the flu:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         vaccination theory makes sense, but it needs to be flushed out with data
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         MSM is actively downplaying the flu this yr meaning there is something to hide. CDC is full of shit.MMR vaccine causes regressive autism in some cases. vaccines are not what they seem. the new flu shot only works eith 23% of people and works best on young healthy people. It is not worth the risk, and who knows what else is in that shit. vaccines dont have to go through any real vetting or approvals.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         support for the theory could come from Hawaii, where flu is not endemic.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       heres some context data from the cdc.

      <p>
       If your theory is correct, then we would expect to see more cases of the flu in places where more people got the vaccine. that said factors like population density and weather would also effect the rate of spread.
      </p>
      <p>
       will see if i can dig anything up.

         Research viral shedding from vaccines. There’s a few studies I’ve read over the years. Use DuckDuckGo or Bing, Google censors them from search results. You’ll find them if you search hard enough, there’s a lot of data on viral shedding. It’s real, and horrifying.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Agreed.

        <p>
         Hawaii is interesting. First and foremost, influenza doesn’t seem to be as prevalent in countries with year round warm conditions. So climate is likely a factor. Also many Hawaiians do not trust the government, and probably do not get flu vaccines in the same numbers as other states especially since it’s less prevalent there in the first place. Many people are actually poor as well and less likely to go to the doctor if they do have the flu.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Then you also have to consider reporting. Just because it isn’t being reported doesn’t mean it isn’t happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       All of the landlocked states are at pandemic levels. It’s not too surprising an island so far removed isn’t there yet, and my theory could still hold for the reasons I mentioned. Hawaii has a lot of variables not present in the mainland. I believe Alaska hasn’t reached pandemic levels either and also has a poor population which is likely under reported and isolated.

       Thanks for your research please keep posting here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always get confused when people I know go to these countries to vacation. I always warn them not to drink the water, especially ice in drinks, or spend time around any of the animals. They always look at me like I’m crazy, then they think about it and realize I’m not. Can’t tell you how many of them come home sick with parasites.
      </p>
      <p>
       I didn’t realize how bad it actually was based on these numbers. It’s also crazy to think Bartonella which is essentially Lyme disease is present in 70% of the population. That’s an insane number to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       I predict Lyme cases in the US are much higher than the CDC will acknowledge in humans. The possibility that 70% of the animals in these countries are carrying this disease indicates to me even my estimates are conservative. These diseases are clearly being spread through other methods than just ticks to reach 70% of animals tested. My research indicates it can be spread from a range of bugs as well as possibly saliva and sex.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile all those dogs and cats from Texas were shipped all over the country after the hurricanes. Rich people from the Bay Area were literally chartering private planes to go pickup displaced animals to bring them back to the Bay Area. Let’s not ignore the fact actual people were dying and suffering while these people were rescuing animals instead. Always found that bizarre during disaster.
      </p>
      <p>
       But anyway we now have a major outbreak of canine influenza going around the Bay Area now after bringing all these potentially sick animals to our city. Hesitant to even let my dog say hi to other dogs right now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Had to put my own dog on probiotics and medicinal mushrooms to boost his immune system after he started getting warts recently. There’s clearly something serious going on with our pets, and likely us as well.

       I didn’t even think about that. Ugh makes sense and explains the 70%.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is dogs have a higher body temp than humans, and they’re mostly asymptotic from Lyme. Only when a dog has a weakened immune system do they occasionally present with flu like symptoms. After that they merely become a carrier, and it can possibly effect their joints later in life.
      </p>
      <p>
       So that means anyone who gets licked by an infected dog is at risk of getting Lyme disease. That’s insane, as Lyme eventually disables 50% of humans that contract it, and caused a range of neurological issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       I myself believe I’m dealing with a Lyme infection and let me tell you it’s damaged my nervous system and I might require stem cells I can’t afford. It’s a horrible disease.

       This is mostly about eukaryotic parasites or bacteria and fungi, which are much easier to transfer between different species than viruses. Viruses have a harder time jumping between species.

        Some of these parasites cause lymphatic filariasis which the WHO states cannot be contracted in the United States. I can assure you that a parasite doesn't give two fucks about what country it is in and isn't magically prevented from crossing the border. The WHO and CDC would like to pretend that many of these things are very rare or that they can only be spread through certain vectors, but this is simply not true and people need to know they are at risk.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Turn your very true argument around: Given the societal &amp; political climate where even the most trivial arguments (climate change is real, using antibiotics left and right is a stupid idea, and parasites don't care about borders) are still "open up to debate" what chance does the WHO/CDC have?

       I'm in the U.S. and have had indoor cats suddenly test positive for bartonella and herpes when they had previously tested negative, plus there seems to be a general overall increase in illness amongst cats here.
       <br/>
       I think it may be something in the cat food, water or air that is damaging their immune system and making them more susceptible to contracting/developing maladies.

       I've always been confused by this. Does infection really equal a serious issue? What's wrong with the following scenario?
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Get infected
       </li>
       <li>
        Develop immune response
       </li>
       <li>
        Make lots of antibodies
       </li>
       <li>
        Fight off the virus
       </li>
       <li>
        All better, life goes on

      </ol>

       But as far as parasites --- now that's pretty scary. I don't want worms crawling through my guts.

       And I certainly don't trust a politicized agency like the CDC.

       Yes. Wear gloves or wash your hands before you touch your eyes, nose, mouth or genitals. Toxoplasma gondii is spore forming, meaning it can survive outside the body of a host for long periods of time.

       OP, I am spending some time in Peru later this year. Do you know what the situation is there regarding the Zoonotic type diseases you and your colleges are seeing? I'm taking this news quite seriously and I will look into it more myself. I will either cancel plans or find out what I need to do to prepare. I really don't want to be vaccinated if at all possible, but at the same time I'm not going to be stupid about this and go to Peru unprotected. Thank you for the time you took to give us this eye opener of a self post.

       My dogs and myself got Leptospirosis presumably from a stream behind my house (where we used to rockhound) in rural Tennessee. I had never heard of it, but it's no joke and can completely shut down your kidneys. It is a bacterial infection that spreads through water, wildlife, and transfers to between animals and humans. It sets up exclusively in the kidneys. Since the symptoms for humans can be so mild and are hard to detect it is often too late when you finally figure out what's going on. Apparently a large chunk of cases involving kidney failure in humans is caused from untreated Leptospirosis or other bacterial infections in the organs. Luckily, my elder dog showed some immediate symptoms and a really smart veterinarian tested for it.

       What precautions do you recommend for pet owners? Are there any tests in particular they should get for their animals?  Is there like a general screening for these things and how much would it cost? Just curious. I take my animals to the vet regularly and I think they get screened for certain things already.

       Hi thanks for your post, can you give us some evidence of this claims? records, sources, or the epidemiology of the diseases mentioned and their respective spread in the last years.

       The only evidence I can give you would be pictures of research and lab notes from the various clinics I worked at. I can provide some other studies as far back as 2008 showing very similar trends in tested animals in the Galapagos islands. Almost identical rates of infection as I saw on Santa Cruz Island as well as in Panama and mainland Ecuador.

       They will bring it up when it is near election time.  This is one of the sides political strategies to get conservative people not to vote.  The more disgusted and fearful you are of germs, the more likely you are to be conservative (This has been scientifically proven as liberal is more open and less disgusted with specific stuff).

       Your statement is well written and I thank you for the information,  Would it be possible to get a definition of Zoonotic disease within your statement so we may understand what it is?  I think that would carry a lot of weight within your statement.  I think you forgot many of us are not as informed as you.  Please consider we don't have all the basic foundation of information.  I didn't know what Zoonotic disease is.  Thanks again for this post.

       Zoonotic means that is is something that can be transmitted from animals to humans. So something like the T. Gondi parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, or the T. Cruzi parasite that causes Chagas disease in humans would be zoonotic. HIV started out as a zoonotic disease but is not anymore as it can only infect humans currently.

       Thank you for the explanation.  Are the diseases that are transferred new to cross over infections or normal transmissions that have accelerated?  With the numbers you've listed, this is an alarming rate.  What might be the cause?  (Other than a change in climate?)  Your report was very good.  Again thank you for telling me about it.

       (Some questions I've asked may be included in your statement but it's the next day and I may have forgotten some of it.  I am sorry if I am being redundant. )

       Im amazed how little Vets and MDs really know about this problem.
I have a major problem with parasites in my dog and cats and myself, and the Vet tells me that Parasites arent indigenous to Las Vegas NV because its too hot here. Well, its 61 degrees right now. Too hot for parasites? I think not! Our bodies are normally 98.5 degrees, thats where they live.

       Got it. So basically they get year round flu due to tourism so their standards for a pandemic are likely skewed because of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they’re basically pandemic all the time, and the pandemic here is merely normal to them. How depressing.
