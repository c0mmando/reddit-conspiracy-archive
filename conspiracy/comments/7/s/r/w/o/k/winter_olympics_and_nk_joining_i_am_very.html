        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Don&#39;t you find it odd how NK suddenly wants to join the Olympics with SK and act like everything is okay? Like the past 10 years of bullshit is suddenly out the window and everyone should look ahead and not worry or think its a little suspicious that they are allowed to join?   </p>

<p>I&#39;m not worried about Kim specifically, I am worried about his handlers and what the TRUE plan of the Olympics is. Maybe place him as a patsy?? </p>

<p>TIN FOIL HAT ON.... Here is what I would do to spark WW3 if I was Kim (or his handlers).....</p>

<p>You know there are diseases out there which are manufactured that we don&#39;t know about... Ones the government has manufactured or other (worse than AIDS, ETC). Government or elite only have the &quot;serum&quot; so it wouldn&#39;t affect them.</p>

<p>People from around the world would attend the Olympics. Why not send sick people from NK to attend with some disease that doesn&#39;t take affect for a couple of weeks... and once everyone is back to their home countries the disease will spread widely and there would be no turning back. </p>

<p>It could be worse than a NUKE in my opinion because it could affect many different countries and spark the biggest war ever. </p>

<p>Just think about it. </p>

<p>Kim spent his childhood in Switzerland land of the bankers, he knows the west, might even be recruited and definitely is uninfluenced by heavy indoctrination of Swiss/Roffs secret service.</p>

<p>What if Kim could stay get more power and help his country, just had to stop with nukes. sound like a offer he can&#39;t refuse.</p>

<p>Also Trump conceded in delaying planned military training with he South, this is what led Kim to change his position and send a small delegation</p>

They just need to scare people so they can do whatever they want, same as 9/11, they don’t need to kill all their little worker bees (I mean sheep) who else will dig up their precious minerals and build their mansions.</p>
