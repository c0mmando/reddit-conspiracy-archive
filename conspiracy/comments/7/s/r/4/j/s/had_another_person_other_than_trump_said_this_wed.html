I was watching this video and I realised what he was saying has such an anti tptb tone that had this of been said by another unknown candidate instead of trump we would be jumping at thoughts the end of tptb and add Q to this wed be having a field day thinking there was a serious challenge to hidden power and corruption. So why is it we wont entertain Q I mean I dont wholeheartedly believe it but I keep an open hopeful mind</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t interested in him at all.. didn&#39;t listen to any of his campaign speeches or debates.  It was only the media&#39;s reaction and blatant character assassination tactics that caught my attention and made me wonder what Trump was saying to provoke this.  The first article that convinced me was the one about feeding fish with Japan PM.  The article&#39;s title is:  &quot;Trump feeds fish, winds up pouring entire box of food into koi pond&quot;.  It makes him sound like a complete baffoon which we all kind of think he is... but when I watched the video, he did absolutely nothing wrong nor did he break any taboos or embarrass the US.  He did what any of us would have done in a foreign unfamiliar situation... he followed the lead of the PM.  The PM gave the fish a little food a few times.. so did Trump.  Then, then PM poured what was left in the box into the water.  Trump followed suit and did exactly the same thing.  I knew then that something was up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People are a lot more likely to talk about their hate for trump than their praise for him. I know tons of trump supporters but they literally never bring it up unless they know everyone they&#39;re with is also trump supporters. There is indeed a silent majority. I&#39;m in Ohio and his support has only grown while disdain for the left continues to pile up. </p>

<p>You can point out the popular vote all you want but it doesn&#39;t change the fact there was a paradigm shift in this country. Without California trump wins the popular vote by more than a million people. I guarantee he wins in 2020. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m just saying the popular vote is a little misleading because the most liberal and most popular state is what put clinton over the edge.

    <div class="md"><p>But those voters do exist.</p>

<p>If I throw out 13 million voters from deep red states, for example, threw out Texas and North Carolina, who combined equaled roughly the same number of voters California did, what does that say about voter trends and the popular vote then?  Not much, because I just threw out 13 million voters because of who they voted for.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The voter trends aren&#39;t in deep red or blue states. Trump flipped 200 Obama-Obama counties out of a possible 700 while clinton only flipped 6 of 2000 McCain-romney counties.

    <div class="md"><p>Then look at those trends under the paradigm of the electoral college.  That&#39;s a fair and reasonable way to look at the electoral shifts that helped lead to Trump&#39;s victory.  That&#39;s fine.  Don&#39;t use a model that might offer some insight under the paradigm of the electoral college to try and explain the popular vote, because when your model of the popular vote requires eliminating 13 million voters in order to work, it&#39;s a bad model.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those taxes are even more brutal in Denmark, but people earn good money and don&#39;t mind paying tax... there&#39;s plenty left over because health care, education, university and so on are all FREE for everyone. So they are the happiest nation on earth, with very low crime because people at the bottom of the pile aren&#39;t forced to commit crimes just to feed their kids. But you go on in your dog-eat-dog world, hiding behind your barricades to keep the angry poor people out. I bet you think you&#39;re a Christian as well.</p>

<p>Here in Britain it&#39;s not so good, but it is still a hell of a lot better than America. I got a free heart bypass a few years back..... which would have cost you more than your house is worth, probably.

<p>Socialsim like Denmark&#39;s works ok when you have a good solid base without too many free-loaders. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed, but Denmark has had one of the strict stances on immigration and taking refugees.</p>

<p>We have a lot of free-loaders here in America, which is why massive social programs get so strained. England is becoming the same way, which is why you guys are particularly fucked, like Sweden and Germany. Its only going to get worse for you. I shudder to think at what your country will look like in 50-100 years. Probably something closer to Somalia than to the England of the past.

    <div class="md"><p>What a politician says vs what they do are different things though. He talks about getting rid of corruption but 4 members of his team were indicted in his first year (one he knew was compromised, and one that had already been under investigation when he hired them). Talks about corporations in politics yet fills his cabinet with corporate stooges. Talks about politicians making money off their position when the Trump family has personally profited off his position. </p>

<p>Judging any politician by their campaign speeches is kind of pointless because it&#39;s pretty much a free pass to tell people what they want to hear. </p>

It would be naive to think anywhere else is different.

    <div class="md"><p>I wasn&#39;t interested in him at all.. didn&#39;t listen to any of his campaign speeches or debates. It was only the media&#39;s reaction and blatant character assassination tactics that caught my attention and made me wonder what Trump was saying to provoke this. The first article that convinced me was the one about feeding fish with Japan PM. The article&#39;s title is: &quot;Trump feeds fish, winds up pouring entire box of food into koi pond&quot;. It makes him sound like a complete baffoon which we all kind of think he is... but when I watched the video, he did absolutely nothing wrong nor did he break any taboos or embarrass the US. He did what any of us would have done in a foreign unfamiliar situation... he followed the lead of the PM. The PM gave the fish a little food a few times.. so did Trump. Then, then PM poured what was left in the box into the water. Trump followed suit and did exactly the same thing. I knew then that something was up.</p>
