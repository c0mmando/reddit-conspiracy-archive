        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was reviewing this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74qrxy/i_dont_think_stephen_paddocks_window_was_broken/">old post</a> where u/Bernie_Sanders_2020 (thanks for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/74qrxy/i_dont_think_stephen_paddocks_window_was_broken/do0hb3r/">your help in that post</a> ), shows how the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/IIehxc3.png">window of the main suite doesn&#39;t look broken</a>, even though the <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oFsoX">picture looks to be after the event</a>.  If that&#39;s true, I had thought that Paddock probably was shooting out of the second room and that&#39;s probably where he had his snipers nest setup so he could use the bipods.  The issue with that is, in the new photos released, there doesn&#39;t look like any <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ESUBj">gun powder residue on the bed sheets</a> from him firing 1000 rounds out of that room.  Also, if those guns were used, you would expect there to be residue on the bed from him picking them up and laying them down.  Just a thought.</p>

<p>Edit: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Ldk3Y">Here is the full set of photos from TMZ</a>, I did see an article with more pictures than what TMZ has.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly this doesn&#39;t seem like too much of a stretch. But what&#39;s the motivation, gun awareness? When I hear those theories about staging these events to push an ideology, I kind of check out. 9/11 has enough meat on the bones for me to stay at the table a while but to take innocent lives requires malice or some degree of psychosis unless extreme amounts of money are in the same vicinity.</p>

<p>Maybe paddock was set up in some way by the feds. I don&#39;t particularly like them and paddock doesn&#39;t seem like a really stand up guy to me based on what I know about him. So I like the pursuit of truth and I&#39;d honestly like to know what was behind everything but the answer will ultimately be unsatisfying either way</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Also, he shot 35 JFK bullets down the hallway, not 200 as was reported for the past 4 months:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>LVMPD officers located several documents, to include photographs, identifying Paddock as the
suspect who was lying on the floor with an apparent gunshot wound to the head. Also located
inside the room investigators found documentation related to Danley who was later identified as
the longtime girlfriend of Paddock.
Located throughout the 100-wing hallway from the double doors of room 32-135 to the alcove
wall of room 32-105 were <strong>over 200 bullet strikes. The bullet strikes consisted of actual impacts
and holes. These strikes were caused by approximately 35 rounds</strong> fired down the 100-wing from
inside of room 32-135. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>So 35 rounds caused over 200 &quot;actual impacts
and holes&quot; down the hallway, how are bullets rickashay off the walls?  What are these walls made of?  </p>

<p>Many high rises have concrete dividing walls between suites. Even a really old hotel I used to work at. </p>

And you&#39;re right recently concrete structures have been all the rage, but I think the industry is beginning to change their minds with building like Millenium Tower sinking.  Even Mandalay&#39;s main structure sank 17 inches and they had to use jacks to correct it.  But as for those walls that the bullets hit, I doubt they&#39;re concrete from that pic.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well we can&#39;t see the inner hallways though. </p>

<p>Pillars along the outer perimeter for lots of windows is normal. </p>

<p>I worked in high rise construction for years. The elevator shafts, hallways, stairwells and many room walls are concrete construction. Some for structural support and some for noise reduction </p>

<p>Mind you my buddy lived in a high rise that boasted &quot;concrete construction&quot; yet as it turned out large portions of suite dividing walls were just double layer drywall. </p>

<p>All it takes is to knock on the wall... anyone in Vegas?</p>

<p>Seriously, I second that!</p>

<p>Also, let me point out, the bottom 3 floors you can see through the wings, I&#39;d me amazed if they built a steel structure on the bottom 3 floord and concrete walls in the above floors.  Hope we have a LV resident around.</p>
