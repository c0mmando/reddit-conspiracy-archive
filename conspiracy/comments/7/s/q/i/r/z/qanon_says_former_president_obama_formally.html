It’s already begun, they’re in damage control. Everyone has to know about this info in order to really make a change... </p>

<p>Whole other point here is... this could all be a ploy by that very same “deep state” to divide and concur... trump and friends could be in on it from the get go. Art of war. </p>

<p>Doubt it but don’t put it past TPTB...  Always remain objective... these guys clearly don’t play around...</p>

<p>When?</p>

<p>There is no constitutional way for the president to be tried by the military. That&#39;s not just saying that it hasn&#39;t happened before, it would be antithetical to the basic principles of American government.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that the military trying the president would <em>literally</em> be an armed coup, it would a constitutional crisis because it would be the Commander in Chief being tried by his own military. That&#39;s repugnant to a system founded on the concept of checks and balances.</p>

<p>It would also violate modern understanding of the Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendments. (Also whatever part of the core constitution guarantees jury trials for criminal cases--I forget where that is.) </p>

<p>I&#39;ll be more specific--when has an American citizen on American soil been detained and tried in a military court?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Obama is no longer the commander in chief.</p>

<p>Yes, I got caught up in the hypothetical--you&#39;re right that seizing Obama wouldn&#39;t necessarily be a coup. </p>

<p>But it would still be grossly illegal. The Military Commissions Act prohibits military tribunals holding exclusive jurisdiction over American citizens, at least on US soil.  </p>

<p>None of them on American soil, as far as I&#39;m aware. The rationale is that enemy combatants on foreign soil may be subjected to military jurisdiction--I&#39;m not aware of it ever happening on American soil, or outside of active hostilities. I&#39;m not an expert in this field, so I could definitely be overlooking something, especially historical examples like Civil War actions, but nothing that I&#39;m aware of would be even remotely analogous to the military arresting an ex-president.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s true that they don&#39;t have a choice, in that the military doesn&#39;t get to decide &quot;that the people running the courts-investigations are the people attacking America.&quot; That violates the principal of civilian control of the military, and now we are talking a coup. Literally.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Controversial as they may be places like GITMO exist for a reason.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And they exist on foreign soil for a reason. But even if Obama went overseas for a vacation and the military snagged him there, it would be the biggest Constitutional crisis the country has ever seen, but for the Civil War. </p>

<p>If the military wants you they will get you. If it comes done to grabbing someone and just flying them to GITMO (or some place we have never heard) they will do it. They have done it. This is one of the reasons Assange doesn&#39;t leave the embassy.</p>

<p>No, but because presidents have to be citizens, it makes him immune from prosecution <em>by a military court.</em> The Army absolutely cannot roll up to his house, pick him up, and put him on trial--it would be an enormous violation of statutes (the CMA and maybe the Posse Comitatus Act) and the Constitution (Amendments 5, 6, and 14--and maybe 4, off the top of my head). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can count me as someone who is skeptical of Q.  Consequently, I won&#39;t address the rumor presented in this thread regarding Obama and legal counsel.  I want to specifically address your statement: &quot;We know for a fact that there is a lot of shit going on, but not a shred of credible evidence seems to picking up steam against the dems.&quot;</p>

<p>Purely in regards to just the FISA memo, I suppose this is technically true since we have not seen it yet. However, it seems unlikely that there&#39;s no &quot;there there&quot; given the vast number of congressmen who have publicly stated that the contents of the memo are shocking and point directly to the weaponization of the Federal Government against a Presidential candidate by the Obama Administration.  They&#39;d be sticking their necks out awfully far if there&#39;s genuinely no evidence in that document.</p>

<p>But bigger picture, your entire comment betrays a lack of understanding of the situation.  The GOP doesn&#39;t &quot;control all 3 branches&quot; of government, the Uniparty does. Most of the people that populate those 3 branches belong to the Uniparty.  Consequently, most of the Republican law makers that appear to be on Trump&#39;s side are doing so because they&#39;re either a) bowing to public pressure, b) recognize that the tide is turning and they&#39;re trying to align with the winning side or c) they view the exposure of the Obama Admin&#39;s crimes as an opportunity to consolidate more power.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t cowboys vs. indians.  This is play acting on stage and very few of the people on that stage are playing themselves.</p>

<p>The corruption that&#39;s slowly but steadily being revealed inside the FBI, the CIA, the DOJ and the State department isn&#39;t about the perpetrators aligning themselves with the Democrat party, it was about making sure than an outsider couldn&#39;t get in an spoil the party.</p>

<p>If someone like Mitt Romney would have had the nomination in 2016, we wouldn&#39;t be having this discussion for numerous reasons.  But prime among them is that there likely wouldn&#39;t have been an effort made by the Obama Admin to keep him out. With Romney and Clinon running, it&#39;s a win-win for the Uniparty.</p>

<p>So despite your comments and despite your coarse, cretinous name, I just invested a bunch of time in you by writing this comment; a comment that was written in good faith in an attempt to wake up a fellow human being.  I hope that in exchange, you&#39;ll seriously consider what I&#39;ve written here.</p>
