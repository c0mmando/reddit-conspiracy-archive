        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This country is hitting an all time high for opioid use, the US is 5% of the total world population yet we consume 85% of the opioids produced worldwide. I live in Philadelphia where there are no go zones scattered throughout the city where police officers won’t even go unless there are shots fired (they probably avoid those calls most of the time as well).</p>

<p>To me it seems pretty obvious that this is yet another attack on the poor by Sessions. </p>

<p>For instance when a rich person is caught with a bag of marijuana that is clearly for personal use they call their lawyer and are usually let off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist.</p>

<p>On the other hand when a poor person is caught with the same amount of marijuana they have the book thrown at them (in most states). After said poor person is booked they usually spend a little time in county before their court date and release. Then the fun really starts, because now they can’t find a job because they have a record and they can’t pay their court fees or their probation fees so they are picked back up, brought to jail, and the cycle continues.</p>

<p>Sessions is trying to bring this old school mentality back to every state, it is extremely expensive to the tax payer and is set up to favor the rich.</p>

<p>We need to use those resources to fight the drug war that really matters, the opioid crisis.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When it was announced it was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/search?q=sessions+marijuana&amp;amp;include_over_18=on&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;t=month&amp;amp;sort=relevance">discussed on here</a>and many other subs. So far there hasn&#39;t really been anything other than the announcement. All of the legal states governments and representatives, plus several others, have come out condemning the decision. A LOT of <a href="https://thinkprogress.org/republicans-sessions-pot-crackdown-9ba10d6b4724/">republicans</a> have come out against it and when your own party is pissed you know you said the wrong thing. </p>

<p>It will very likely go no where and it may even be the catalyst to finally get it look at on the house floor for change. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly. Show me some Federal enforcement that directly contradicts relevant State law (that isn&#39;t a holdover prosecution from Obama era) and we can start having a real conversation. What is happening now appears to be some bizarre distraction or posturing, possibly even manipulating Congress into changing the law. As far as I know, both Trump and Sessions believe that the issue should be left up to the individual States as per the 10th amendment. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, unfortunately they believe federal law is more important then states&#39; rights. They want to ignore the Cole memo.</p>

<p>Sessions has received numerous contributions from the tobacco industry combined with his old school thinking is why this last ditch effort to stop legalization is taking place. There is also pressure from from alcohol and the private prison industry which Sessions is cozy with.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have to understand that this was always going to happen under Trump; just like DACA, the weed issue is an Obama special. People seem to be under the impression that Sessions is taking something away from them.. He isn&#39;t, weed is and has been illegal this entire time; Obama, perfecting one of his signature policies: where people are happy with him because he &quot;solved&quot; the issue, but in reality he kicked the can down the road to be dealt with later, by someone else and in doing so overreached his authority so that even if that next person down the road was ok with it they actually <em>have to</em> do something about it to make it constitutional if nothing else. </p>

<p>A big upside for his plan was that while everyone was happy with him, and with the help of the MSM reporting what he was doing but not making a fuss about it, he was able to direct his politicized weapon known as the IRS at the newly &quot;legal&quot; dispensarys, who often times couldn&#39;t find a bank that would open them an account and partake in some civil forfeiture and put something away for a rainy day.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what people should be talking about, but instead you&#39;re mad that the Attorney General has decided that current laws can&#39;t just be ignored as the plan to end them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama didn&#39;t legalize weed due to perception and at the state level legalization was moving quickly. There is also numerous international laws when it comes to drugs with only Uraguay opting out currently. </p>

<p>He also didn&#39;t want the feds enforcing federal law when the states made there own decision. This is the opposite of Jeff Sessions who want to ignore the Cole memo. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Because he is a Trump appointee and all the idiot Trump cultists on here won&#39;t say a bad word about him because it makes their daddy God emperor look bad. Oh and also they think Sessions is somehow about to bring down the &quot;secret FBI society pedophiles&quot;... or something like that. All this treasonous stupidity is honestly getting hard to follow at this point. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obama didn&#39;t legalize weed due to perception and at the state level legalization was moving quickly. There is also numerous international laws when it comes to drugs with only Uraguay opting out currently. </p>

<p>He also didn&#39;t want the feds enforcing federal law when the states made there own decision. This is the opposite of Jeff Sessions who want to ignore the Cole memo. </p>

<p>But of course it&#39;s blame Obama!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed. Threatening to pull federal funding as a punishment is laughable when the cannabis tax revenues are huge and dont require states to jump through hoops to get them.</p>
