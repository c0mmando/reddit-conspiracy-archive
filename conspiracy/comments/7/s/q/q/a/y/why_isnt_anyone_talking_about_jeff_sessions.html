       This country is hitting an all time high for opioid use, the US is 5% of the total world population yet we consume 85% of the opioids produced worldwide. I live in Philadelphia where there are no go zones scattered throughout the city where police officers won’t even go unless there are shots fired (they probably avoid those calls most of the time as well).
      </p>
      <p>
       To me it seems pretty obvious that this is yet another attack on the poor by Sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
       For instance when a rich person is caught with a bag of marijuana that is clearly for personal use they call their lawyer and are usually let off with nothing more than a slap on the wrist.
      </p>
      <p>
       On the other hand when a poor person is caught with the same amount of marijuana they have the book thrown at them (in most states). After said poor person is booked they usually spend a little time in county before their court date and release. Then the fun really starts, because now they can’t find a job because they have a record and they can’t pay their court fees or their probation fees so they are picked back up, brought to jail, and the cycle continues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sessions is trying to bring this old school mentality back to every state, it is extremely expensive to the tax payer and is set up to favor the rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       We need to use those resources to fight the drug war that really matters, the opioid crisis.

       and many other subs. So far there hasn't really been anything other than the announcement. All of the legal states governments and representatives, plus several others, have come out condemning the decision. A LOT of

       have come out against it and when your own party is pissed you know you said the wrong thing.

       It will very likely go no where and it may even be the catalyst to finally get it look at on the house floor for change.

       Probably because its been a year and there has been 0 federal enforcement. If dispensaries start getting raided like they did under Obama, you can bet that people will start speaking out. Personally, I don't think he's going to do anything.

       Exactly. Show me some Federal enforcement that directly contradicts relevant State law (that isn't a holdover prosecution from Obama era) and we can start having a real conversation. What is happening now appears to be some bizarre distraction or posturing, possibly even manipulating Congress into changing the law. As far as I know, both Trump and Sessions believe that the issue should be left up to the individual States as per the 10th amendment.

       No, unfortunately they believe federal law is more important then states' rights. They want to ignore the Cole memo.

       Sessions has received numerous contributions from the tobacco industry combined with his old school thinking is why this last ditch effort to stop legalization is taking place. There is also pressure from from alcohol and the private prison industry which Sessions is cozy with.

       Yeah it seemed more to me like a "we are going to enforce the laws on the books."

       The last administration seemed to think that once appointed, they could dictate the laws. The laws are made by the people and their legislators, appointed officials shouldn't get to pick and choose what they want to enforce.

       You have to understand that this was always going to happen under Trump; just like DACA, the weed issue is an Obama special. People seem to be under the impression that Sessions is taking something away from them.. He isn't, weed is and has been illegal this entire time; Obama, perfecting one of his signature policies: where people are happy with him because he "solved" the issue, but in reality he kicked the can down the road to be dealt with later, by someone else and in doing so overreached his authority so that even if that next person down the road was ok with it they actually
       <em>
        have to
       </em>
       do something about it to make it constitutional if nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
       A big upside for his plan was that while everyone was happy with him, and with the help of the MSM reporting what he was doing but not making a fuss about it, he was able to direct his politicized weapon known as the IRS at the newly "legal" dispensarys, who often times couldn't find a bank that would open them an account and partake in some civil forfeiture and put something away for a rainy day.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's what people should be talking about, but instead you're mad that the Attorney General has decided that current laws can't just be ignored as the plan to end them.

       The president subverting democracy and co-opting an independent organization with as much power as the IRS to target and attack his political opponents and vulnerable entities with limited legal protections is better than the US Attorney General enforcing the law?

       I would argue that one is just doing his job and the other should be hanged for treason, but that's just me, maybe you don't agree with the idea of logic.

       Where in Philadelphia are these no-go zones you speak of? I've lived in this city all my life, all over(good and bad neighborhoods) and I've heard this myth before and no one has ever been able to tell me where or offer proof. I mean shit I got pulled over in the middle of the night at 4th and Indiana in west Kensington and I can't think of a worse neighborhood than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Aside from that I agree that there's an option crisis and that marijuana legalization seems to help a lot in places where it's been implemented.

       Kensington and somerset, and Kensington and Allegheny are the two main spots that pop up. I accidentally ended up at somerset station once and it was the only time that I was honestly scared in Philly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know that there are some infamous open air markets up in swampoodle as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also walking around in the cutoff area between north and south Kensington you’ll see little heroin shanty towns made out of cardboard all over in the area that runs across Lehigh ave. It’s honestly horrifying that places like that still exist in one of the biggest cities in the us.

       Because he is a Trump appointee and all the idiot Trump cultists on here won't say a bad word about him because it makes their daddy God emperor look bad.
