    <div class="md"><p>Yeah being under oath is a trap for Trump who has nothing to hide. Millions of people have been under oath but for the president this is a big NoNo. We all know why. They know they have him when he is under oath because he is literally unable to not lie. They will ask about Comey and at one point he confirm that he is a criminal ( OOF ). I wonder why his fans don&#39;t want him to go under oath. He could just show the world he is a fine individual with nothing criminal to hide.</p>

<p>Emin just called and asked me to contact you with something very interesting. </p>

<p>The Crown prosecutor of Russia met with his father Aras this morning and in their meeting offered to provide the Trump campaign with some official documents and information that would incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.</p>

<p><strong>This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government&#39;s support for Mr. Trump</strong> - helped along by Aras and Emin.</p>

<p>What do you think is the best way to handle this information and would you be able to speak to Emin about it directly?</p>

<p>I can also send this info to your father via Rhona, but it is ultra sensitive so wanted to send to you first.</p>

<p>That is from emails that Donald Trump Jr released himself. Did he get info in that meeting at Trump Tower? I don&#39;t know but he sure as hell went in their thinking he was going to get info directly from the Russian government.</p>

<p>He claims it was about adoptions. That&#39;s a problem as well. Because That involves sanctions from The Maginitsky Act. See Russia stopped US adoptions of Russian children in response to the Maginitsky Act sanctions.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/28/world/europe/russia-us-adoptions/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2012/12/28/world/europe/russia-us-adoptions/index.html</a></p>

<p>Also why haven&#39;t Russian sanctions been enacted yet?</p>

<p>And nothing incriminating</p>

<p>Based on the evidence it looks like russia supported Hillary when they bought the pro hillary ads and sold her the trolls</p>

<p>And since obama approved the fske russian lawyer to meet with them we can assume obama also colluded with russia to set up trump</p>

<p>“There’s two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump,” House Majority Leader and California Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy reportedly said in mid-June 2016, referring to the leading presidential candidate and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a Californian Republican known for defending Russia.</p>

<p>Some lawmakers present laughed, to which McCarthy said: “swear to God.” House Speaker Paul Ryan told lawmakers to keep the exchange between them.</p>

<p>“No leaks,&quot; he said. &quot;This is how we know we’re a real family here.”</p>

<p>He has guidelines, i literally linked you his guidelines.</p>

<p>He is a republican, he was appointed by a republican and with the glowing unanimous recommendations by Republicans and his scope was outlined by Republicans.</p>

<p>And not one describes Republicans. Your just paranoid and frankly nuts</p>

<p>What was kicked out? Because fox news is in every country and has never been kicked out. But cnn has</p>

<p>And we have many different outlets. You call tgem all &quot;fake news&quot; because you hate the truth</p>

<p>Cnn msnbc the daily show stephen colbert rachel maddow etc are all basically one channel. They repeat the same story at the same times</p>

<p>U could watch any one and know exactly what the others are saying</p>

<p>And coincedentally they are the actual fake news (not fox)</p>

<p>Lying to there uneducated uninformed gullible followers knowing they wont fact check them. </p>

<p>Its pathetic</p>

<p>Republicans never used bots. But we have a hillary clinton manager ADMITTING to buying russian bots on twitter to manipulate the election.</p>

<p>Leftwing terrorism is the largest in the united states.</p>

<p>Even if u dont include the world trade center</p>

<p>The leftwing orlando nightclub shooting was the second worst Terrorist attack on us soil. </p>

<p>The vegas shooter was the first</p>

<p>And considering he shot right wingers we can assume he was leftwing</p>

<p>And dont forget the far left socialist who shot the gop members playing baseball for charity.</p>

<p>Sorry but slate claiming otherwise is just sad</p>

<p>Loretta lynch LITERALLY obstructed comeys Investigation</p>

<p>But nice try when u attacked the fbi and congress Investigation FOR YEARS when they Investigated hillary and obama on emails and benghazi.</p>

<p>And faily criticized them for lying about weapons of mass destruction</p>

<p>But suddenly u lile them when they increase your election chances? Youre not even a GOOD partisan hack</p>

<p>Neither flynn nor gates flipped.</p>

<p>But stzork and other fbi agents were caught red handed. Obama is going down</p>

<p>Your idiot bigot in chief of the last 8 years is a criminal and you are an acompliss</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He won&#39;t respond. You hit people with these things called facts and they tend to back off rather quickly. They might put a fight up for a minute. Truth will always prevail. You see it&#39;s not the truth they&#39;re worried about it&#39;s the fear they want to spread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are of course those who do not want us to speak. I suspect even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way. Why? Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power. Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of truth. And the truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn&#39;t there? Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression. And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and soliciting your submission. How did this happen? Who&#39;s to blame? Well certainly there are those more responsible than others, and they will be held accountable, but again truth be told, if you&#39;re looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror. I know why you did it. I know you were afraid. Who wouldn&#39;t be? War, terror, disease. There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense. Fear got the best of you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think V for Vendetta perfectly lays it out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>He is completely single-minded convictions and has no regard for the political process. Eventually, his party launches a special project in the name of &#39;national security&#39;. At first, it is believed to be a search for biological weapons and it is pursued regardless of its cost. However, the true goal of the project is power, complete and total hegemonic domination. The project, however, ends violently... but the efforts of those involved are not in vain, for a new ability to wage war is born from the blood of one of their victims. Imagine a virus - the most terrifying virus you can, and then imagine that you and you alone have the cure. But if your ultimate goal is power, how best to use such a weapon? It is at this point in our story that along comes a spider. He is a man seemingly without a conscience(Steve Bannon) for whom the ends always justify the means and it is he who suggests that their target should not be an enemy of the country but rather the country itself. Three targets are chosen to maximize the effect of the attack: a school, a tube station, and a water-treatment plant. Several hundred die within the first few weeks. Until at last the true goal comes into view. Before the St. Mary&#39;s crisis, no one would have predicted the outcome of the elections. No one. But after the election, lo and behold, a miracle. Some believed that it was the work of God himself, but it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members made them all obscenely rich. But the true genius of the plan was the fear. A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty, and executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims. Fear became the ultimate tool of this government. . . The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nixon would have been impeached, he also likely would have been convicted by the Senate if he didn&#39;t resign. If you look at it Clinton got to remain in power and was never removed by the Senate, while Nixon resigned in discrase.</p>

<p>Clinton probably had plenty of possible charges that could have been levied against him and a list of reasons why he should have been removed, just like every modern president in the past 30 years.</p>
