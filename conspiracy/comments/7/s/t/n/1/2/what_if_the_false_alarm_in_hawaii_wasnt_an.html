        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My theory is that it was done intentionally, in order to gauge the response to an actual missile attack. In this day and age &quot;this is only a drill&quot; wouldn&#39;t get much of a genuine response from the public, especially not as it would have in the Cold War era (which is the last time these systems were used).</p>

<p>This is just a theory I came up with on my own (almost immediately), and I admit that I haven&#39;t really looked around to see of it exists elsewhere. I just wanted everyone&#39;s thoughts and am hoping to start a discussion. Thanks for reading!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, OK. Bali sounds awesome but personally, I use drug laws as a sort of litmus test for countries I&#39;d like to visit. Not that I would bring drugs, but a lot of these countries can enforce strict rules that criminalize common OTC drugs, and those laws usually reflect the level of freedom.</p>

<p>I thought of the British guy who was jailed for having 0.003 grams of marijuana on his shoe in Dubai. But I realize those are extreme examples and you can find horror stories of any tourist hotspots.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are a few social issues where I would have a big problem going to country that harshly regulates them.</p>

<p>Same-sex relations, for example. Do I want to go to a country where I could be put to death because the government says I relations with another man? I&#39;m heterosexual, but it would still concern me, especially in countries with questionable judicial processes. If I go to a country and save money by sharing a hotel room with a male friend, would I be risking my life?</p>

<p>Things would be different if the country had a stringent set of requirements for prosecution for a crime, even if the crime shouldn&#39;t even be a crime at all. But where there are draconian penalties for victimless crimes, the judicial process is usually very questionable.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree, I think that what happened was intentional.</p>

<p>I just wish I knew what happened and what the intent was. Just a hoax to scare people? There was really a missile and it was intercepted? Maybe the missile system intercepted something that wasn&#39;t a missile at all? I&#39;ve heard theories ranging from Tiangong-1 coming down early to straight up aliens. I don&#39;t know what happened, but I am pretty sure that the alert going out wasn&#39;t an accident. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>An intercepted missile wouldn&#39;t create a mushroom cloud, that&#39;s not how interception of intercontinental ballistic missiles work, even in the case of nuclear weapons. Nukes don&#39;t create mushroom clouds without the chemical process of fission being deliberately triggered. A huge splash of water in the middle of the ocean also wouldn&#39;t necessarily have been easily noticed or captured on camera. Even so, <a href="https://www.intellihub.com/claim-hawaii-charter-boat-group-witnessed-explosion-in-sky-on-morning-of-false-missile-alert/">I have seen reports that some witnesses say they saw an explosion in the Pacific Ocean</a>.</p>
