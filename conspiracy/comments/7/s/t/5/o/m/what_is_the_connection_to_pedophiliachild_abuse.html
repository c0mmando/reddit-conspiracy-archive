       Honest question. I've never quite understood the connection between a lot of conspiracy theories and pedophilia/child abuse. What's up? Is there a definitive connection?
Tbh I've speculated that an inordinate number of conspiracy theorists have experienced childhood sexual abuse. We are a group that seem to have a deep-rooted tendency to distrust authority.

       It's multilayered. The child abuse is tied to ritual magick practices as well as to blackmail. It is a sort of "entrance" into the system, and a mutually assured means of destruction for the entire elite. And as I said, it also ties into Occule and magickal practices. If you doubt the veracity of child abuse in the highest echelons of power here are some places to start-

       Acts of desperation tied into a base psychosis. Generally enacted out of defiance. When it comes to mainstream, large scale, politicians, Hollywood, etc the beast feeds itself through confirmation bias. Surrounding ones self with like minded individuals either its spoken of not.

       The connection is a psychosis if the individual. Individuals with said psychosis seek people who think like they do. Generally it is all derived from an act of defiance from a once trusted peer, or society at large. By not being accepted in their belief they surround themselves with people who are more or less comfortable with their belief, feeding their ego, themselves, and continuing said psychosis. 99% of the time you wouldn't ever know, unless you taught yourself to see, you were brought up in it recognizing those aspects, or you were taught by another to see said tells.

       Interesting, though I think this is common place amongst mankind as a whole not limited to those that were abused. Or to the perpetrators.
      </p>
      <p>
       You see it with identity politics. With the "elite class". With the "poor". Religious communities. And so on. This whole world seems to be in a state psychosis. Not really connected to the whole external world. Rather living in their own little bubbles.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I suppose there are those with a more advanced forms of psychosis in which they retreat inward and by large do not involve themselves with the external world much.

       Well, if you are trying to scan for data points or having willing people admit to things. I can say you pose an interesting question. I am someone who was abused. I oppose authority. I am/ or was a broken mess.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only real question I have now after so much time struggling with it, is  why?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I haven't been able to forgive. But I think I have overcome that recently. Though I haven't forgave in person or even let him know.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know man. I was filled with hate most my life. Filled with anger. But so full of empathy at the same time. The hate was self hate. But by extension I lashed out on to others. Misplaced my anger. Still have anger. But mostly just confused as to why someone would throw away their family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've scorned GOD, walked the line of darkness, but always was the bearer of light. Always writing about god and darkness even though I was not religious. Even though I didn't follow any doctrine. I felt my soul battling itself. All I could see is life shouldn't be this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone kept saying god has a plan but how could I accept a god that would allow such things. Then more recently I understand. It shaped who I am. For better or worse. I love who I am. I don't know how life would have been. But I know my struggle means something to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I've seen the darkness, I've been the darkness. I know all can see the light. That even though there is evil acts. I'm not so sure there are evil people. I just think we've all the capacity to be vile. We all the capacity to see the light. No matter how long our journey in darkness is.

       Another thing I notice is I can easily wear mask, change who I am. To fit in with social groups. To blend. I think it is because I don't truly know myself. I'm locked up in my own mind. Trying always to find out who I'm supposed to be. NO guiding force in life. Carving a path on my own. Trying to find my place. I don't fuck it. Just letting some things out here that I can no longer hold on to.

       The fact that you want to find your proper place in life puts you miles ahead of a lot of people. You'll find it. This place helped me find it.

       lol.. what? Everyone knows that "conspiracy theorists" are just about the only people who will even address the issue, and they keep being proven right, over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
       What's more interesting is analyzing those who obsess over "conspiracy theorists" and push all kinds of wild speculation, in an attempt to discredit. We all know where the term came from, right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a conspiracy theorist is the noble civic duty of every internet citizen, to seek truth and guard against corruption.

       Chill! I'm not hating. I'm a conspiracy theorist. If you've noticed there aren't a ton of us in the general population. I speculate folks like me who recognize truth in conspiracy theories got there by questioning authority. A lot of us probably got burned by authority figures to set us on our path.
