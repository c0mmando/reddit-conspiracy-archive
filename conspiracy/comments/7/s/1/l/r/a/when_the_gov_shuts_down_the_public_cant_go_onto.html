    <div class="md"><p>Sure. Taxes could also cover the cost of getting your driver&#39;s license renewed, eliminate the need for toll roads, and provide universal health care.</p>

<p>That said, a vast chunk of the US population and their representatives are extremely averse to increasing tax revenues and would rather shift the revenue burden onto people who use the services in question.</p>

<p>Furthermore, even if it were covered 100% by tax revenues, during a shutdown there&#39;s nobody there to actually mail out the paychecks. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really not that simple. It&#39;s a really confusing mess, but the bulk of taxes go to purchasing US Treasuries, which really just represent more debt. The 6% number is just the interest on debt held by the public. In contrast, the entire monetary system is built <em>out of</em> intragovernmental holdings. Where does the cash come from when Social Security (for example) sells off Treasury notes? Well it is printed by the Federal Reserve. But what is a FRN really? Well, it&#39;s a liability of the Federal Reserve and an obligation of the US government which is backed by the collective holdings of the Federal Reserve, much of which is (you guessed it) more debt.  </p>

<p>So I stand by my point. The majority of taxes go to servicing the US debt, including the monetized debt which is the foundation of our monetary system. </p>

<p>Also for paper, folders, pens, socks, boots, staples, etc. I was in the Guard for over a decade. It&#39;s unfortunate that military units must spend all allocated funds or be punished with a lower budget the next year. We couldn&#39;t afford to return any funds each year because some years we needed it. Changing that culture alone would, I believe, re-purpose allot of tax dollars. We would have liked to return money some years, but other years we have to have it to meet the standards. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>4 times in NY. In spite of having sufficient population density (11 MILLION daily riders on week days) that the MTA should be not just self-sufficient, but profitable, not only have they not updated anything in 50 years, but they can barely keep it operational.</p>

<p>It&#39;s paid for by regular taxes, rider fees, advertisements and starting a few years ago, a corporate tax on businesses (and sole proprietors and contractors) operating in the lower NY counties called the MCTMT. The MCTMT was instituted because riders were revolting over the already increasing fares, and because apparently they still couldn&#39;t afford proper maintenance, never mind upgrades on hundred year old equipment, that is now failing and causing disruptions and tracks to be shut down.</p>

<p>Part of the problem is that the state government has viewed the MTA budget as a &quot;piggy bank&quot; they can use to fund other things, even while the MTA has been operating at a loss, so they take money from its budget, increasing the short falls. Both Dems and Reps have also cut about 1.5 billion dollars from its budget over the years, and it currently runs at a 900 million dollar deficit - one that wouldn&#39;t exist without both parties undermining it.</p>

<p>This has led to deferals of maintenance that&#39;s now biting the entire area in the ass, made worse because Amtrak also refuses to do it share of maintenance at Penn station, on what is one of its few actually profitable lines.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Depends on which part of the MTA you&#39;re talking about, as it controls a lot.</p>

<p>You probably mean the NY City subways, in which case the number you&#39;re looking for is most likely $2.75 for one ride. However a single ride ticket without getting a metrocard (you can get them everywhere) is $3. Metrocard has a minimum $5.50 purchase, plus a $1 fee for a new card if you&#39;re not refilling one you have, so $6.50 vs $3 if you want just the one ride, $6.50 vs $6 for 2 rides. Weekly unlimited ride tickets are $32 and monthly unlimited rides are $121. There&#39;s a whole bunch of programs for discounts also.</p>

<p>LIRR and other rail service tickets can range from as little as under $5, to over $30 one-way depending on how far you&#39;re traveling, and whether it&#39;s peak travel time or off-peak.</p>

<p>Tolls on the bridges they control range from $2.16 to $17 depending on whether you have ezpass (discount) or not. The Verazano bridge is about $12 for EZpass holders, and $17 to pay by mail. Residents of some areas (Staten Island for the Verazano) pay significantly reduced rates.</p>
