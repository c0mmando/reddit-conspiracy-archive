       Ss: if the land was owned by the public, they could go on it 24/7 without above stopping them. Even when the government isn't funded, they can afford to deny people a right to their own land. When the government goes bankrupt, they'll still be able to afford to protect the rich. Petty insane that the people have nothing.

       Sure. Taxes could also cover the cost of getting your driver's license renewed, eliminate the need for toll roads, and provide universal health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       That said, a vast chunk of the US population and their representatives are extremely averse to increasing tax revenues and would rather shift the revenue burden onto people who use the services in question.
      </p>
      <p>
       Furthermore, even if it were covered 100% by tax revenues, during a shutdown there's nobody there to actually mail out the paychecks.

       Driver's licenses are individually and privately owned. Toll roads are usually privately owned or are tolled in lieu of taxes. Universal healthcare is tricky.
      </p>
      <p>
       Public land is public land. We have paid for it. The fees are going to employees who upkeep and secure the land. We should still have access to it. Regardless of whatever McConnell or any other politician thinks.

       Once everyone owns something you don't get the right to do decide how it's taken care of. That's why we have placed a group of people in charge of that in the national park service. And we trust our fellow Americans to be good stewards to the land.

       No your driver's license is the property of the state.

      <p>
       Even your license plates are. In some states you even get your license suspended for not turning in your plates. Toll roads are rarely privately owned if ever. They still receive highway taxes.

       The real problem is that the vast majority of our taxes go directly to servicing the national debt. The debt based Federal Reserve Note system is robbing us blind. We could have AMAZING taxpayer-funded public services and infrastructure across the board right now if we switched back to a real currency instead of our 105-year Ponzi scheme trash.

       It's really not that simple. It's a really confusing mess, but the bulk of taxes go to purchasing US Treasuries, which really just represent more debt. The 6% number is just the interest on debt held by the public. In contrast, the entire monetary system is built
       <em>
        out of
       </em>
       intragovernmental holdings. Where does the cash come from when Social Security (for example) sells off Treasury notes? Well it is printed by the Federal Reserve. But what is a FRN really? Well, it's a liability of the Federal Reserve and an obligation of the US government which is backed by the collective holdings of the Federal Reserve, much of which is (you guessed it) more debt.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I stand by my point. The majority of taxes go to servicing the US debt, including the monetized debt which is the foundation of our monetary system.

       I wish that I was mistaken, but the entire monetary system is built out of debt, and ultimately this can only lead to more debt. The monetary system is backed by promises which are backed by promises which are backed by promises, and on and on and on. It's a disaster waiting to happen.

       That's a different point, and also mistaken.

       But it doesn't have anything to do with your original claim that "the vast majority of our taxes go directly to servicing the national debt". That claim is just wrong.

       Perhaps I shouldn't have said "directly", but you are hiding behind the inherent obfuscation in the Federal Reserve system. Tax revenues that don't appear to go towards servicing the national debt ultimately go towards more debt.

       Also for paper, folders, pens, socks, boots, staples, etc. I was in the Guard for over a decade. It's unfortunate that military units must spend all allocated funds or be punished with a lower budget the next year. We couldn't afford to return any funds each year because some years we needed it. Changing that culture alone would, I believe, re-purpose allot of tax dollars. We would have liked to return money some years, but other years we have to have it to meet the standards.

       That's a temporary condition.  Are we going to pay taxes forever just because there was a period between 1940 and 2018 when it was more convenient for the government to set up a coal plant than for us to throw a couple turbines on the roof?

       The reality is that slowly over the years much of our public lands have been turned over to the U.N. otherwise known as the Rothschilds. Does anyone remember the old quote from Thomas Jefferson " if the American people ever allow a private bank to its currency the central banks and corporations that rise up around it will leave your children homeless in the streets on the continent your forefathers had conquered". It gives credence to this topic and if you see how our the federal reserve conducts its business you realize it is all to grab up the land to have soveirgn rights to it.

       It's designed to ensure that the public transportation is used only by members of society that will be financially supporting the system. Either going to work or going to shop. Wouldn't want people using public transportation for LEISURE! Haha

       4 times in NY. In spite of having sufficient population density (11 MILLION daily riders on week days) that the MTA should be not just self-sufficient, but profitable, not only have they not updated anything in 50 years, but they can barely keep it operational.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's paid for by regular taxes, rider fees, advertisements and starting a few years ago, a corporate tax on businesses (and sole proprietors and contractors) operating in the lower NY counties called the MCTMT. The MCTMT was instituted because riders were revolting over the already increasing fares, and because apparently they still couldn't afford proper maintenance, never mind upgrades on hundred year old equipment, that is now failing and causing disruptions and tracks to be shut down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Part of the problem is that the state government has viewed the MTA budget as a "piggy bank" they can use to fund other things, even while the MTA has been operating at a loss, so they take money from its budget, increasing the short falls. Both Dems and Reps have also cut about 1.5 billion dollars from its budget over the years, and it currently runs at a 900 million dollar deficit - one that wouldn't exist without both parties undermining it.
      </p>
      <p>
       This has led to deferals of maintenance that's now biting the entire area in the ass, made worse because Amtrak also refuses to do it share of maintenance at Penn station, on what is one of its few actually profitable lines.

       Depends on which part of the MTA you're talking about, as it controls a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
       You probably mean the NY City subways, in which case the number you're looking for is most likely $2.75 for one ride. However a single ride ticket without getting a metrocard (you can get them everywhere) is $3. Metrocard has a minimum $5.50 purchase, plus a $1 fee for a new card if you're not refilling one you have, so $6.50 vs $3 if you want just the one ride, $6.50 vs $6 for 2 rides. Weekly unlimited ride tickets are $32 and monthly unlimited rides are $121. There's a whole bunch of programs for discounts also.
      </p>
      <p>
       LIRR and other rail service tickets can range from as little as under $5, to over $30 one-way depending on how far you're traveling, and whether it's peak travel time or off-peak.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tolls on the bridges they control range from $2.16 to $17 depending on whether you have ezpass (discount) or not. The Verazano bridge is about $12 for EZpass holders, and $17 to pay by mail. Residents of some areas (Staten Island for the Verazano) pay significantly reduced rates.

       Thank you, being public does not mean being free for everyone to use however they want. It's actually the exact opposite, it makes it so that people preserve the land and don't build a bunch of shit on top of it.

       we live in 1984 because in reality private land is government land and public land is what is normally calle private.  Public land is available for the public to own and extract resources from while land not available to the people is private government land, but government likes to sell it's sell as "we the people" so they do the whole up is down, black is white crap.

       Ice been trying to research this and it seems a split of how one interprets the law. But the one thing that seems agreed are that the people should not be free to be on the land without an official watching. Edward abbys dessert solitaire makes me think of the fact that the earth is tough and beautiful and no one should stop man from finding this. Natural law is given up when money dries up lol....

       Same reason meat inspectors are still working. If they let people go in and they got hurt by something normal staff would've cleaned up or kept them away from there's a law suit.

       They don't let them go in, and the parks are already understaffed and it takes tens of thousands of dollars to rescue someone from a park.

       You can definitely still go on public land and to public monuments.  Sometimes, Rangers will put up a simple barrier(happened more under Obama than Trump).  I went to Assateague this weekend, nobody stopped me.

       I think it might be that the workers on the publicly owned land are paid by the government, but when there is a shutdown they can't be paid. They shutdown the parks because they can't maintain them.
Thats how I think of it.

       This kills me. WE THE PEOPLE gave our politicians the power to decide when we can enjoy some "publicly owned land". If you want that to change, go canvas and campaign for politicians who are willing to change that. The government is only a private institution if you sit around and do nothing to fight for what you believe in.
