       Feedback loops, with increasing depravity, something sadly common with porn addiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, more you get sensitize to porn, the more extreme stuff is needed, which leads to an increase in searches which the market then fulfills by producing more of.

       Maybe I’m odd, my tastes never changed from solo girl or lesbian.  I am not saying I didn’t watch 2g1c out of curiosity or occasionally clicked something weird like Asian stuff with pissing, but a quick view was always enough to immediately know “nope, not my thing” except for rare instances where you keep watching but out of wtf’ness and it is not erotic at all.

       Same, i almost exclusively look at mmf pictures. Really hard to find porn where the girl looks like shes enjoying it these days. Too much DP and choking etc.  I like to think of the pleasure the chic gets being banged and suckin a dick, but it is all so violent etc nowadays.

       damn where are you guys seeing this violent porn? i’ve noticed the incest stuff (i think it’s just a fad and people are into it because it’s “wrong” or taboo) but i haven’t noticed “depraved” shit or violent porn being pushed

       Yes, being desensitized is a big part of it. Plus availability of porn for free means people who sell it have to offer something "extra." Also, most of us first see porn when we're kids and it's a "bad" thing we're not supposed to do. That feeling makes it more exciting. But looking at something you thought was really hot when you were 12 would seem pretty tame now.
       <br/>
       And like you're saying, a feedback loop where sites provide what people search for, people become desensitized and search for the next thing, site provides it, and so on.

       I think it's a sliding scale of Taboo's (but I have seen the family stuff more and more lately.)
      </p>
      <p>
       When someone isn't getting off on straight sex they start to seek out more and more "wrong" stuff.

       My guess is that now that they've "normalized" porn, they're making the content sicker and sicker so people who want to watch porn are forced to see really gonzo shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The violence I can understand, because I think there's almost always a subtext of dominance and surrender in sex, just in the primal archetypes of man and woman, so amplifying it may affect people in ways they can't begin to understand. It's bad, I don't like it and reject it, but I can understand why.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm mystified by the alleged interest in incest, however. I read an article somewhere more than a year ago that the "Incest" stories on Literotica get more traffic than all the other stories combined.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, as a guy who's battled with porn addiction in the past, all the incest stuff makes it easier to stay away. Brother/Sister, Dad/Daughter, Mom/Son, even the Step-stuff....it makes me sick. I'm feeling mildly ill even as I type this.

       But, save for lesbian and homosexual porn, are not all of them simply that? A man and a woman?
      </p>
      <p>
       The descriptions are simply that; descriptors of the action. So in essence, thats all it comes down to.

       A previous comment stated that its a matter of who is telling the consumer what to watch, what is depraved, etc. I think thats accurate.

       The breakdown of the nuclear family, out of wedlock pregnancies, and high divorce rates mean that more children are being raised by step parents. Fantasizing about having sex with your step-daughter is the ultimate taboo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now that more women watch porn than men, there’s probably going to be more rape porn since that is their #1 taboo fantasy.

      <p>
       They watched more porn in 2017 than they did
       <em>
        in 2016
       </em>
       . Not that they watched more porn than men.
      </p>
      <p>
       The story itself says that "Women watched 26% of porn on XHamster."

       You didn't read the story, did you?

       Plus, Mashable
       <em>
        SUCKS

       . No wonder their headline is misleading, the story has two typos and there's a correction at the end, LOL. Don't read Mashable, much less use it as a citation resource. C'mon, dude.

       It's just saying women watching porn is increasing. Not that women watch more porn than men.
      </p>
      <p>
       As to why women are watching more? Probably because today's males are beta as fuck and by being little pussies their wives and girlfriends pussies are drying up.
      </p>
      <p>
       Theyre searching for the ultimate fantasy through porn now and it's more acceptable for them to do so than it ever has been. My two cents.

       I just hope the increased incest doesn't lead to people trying it more in real life. Even if it's all fake, some of it is just straight up cringey with the chick calling you "big bro" every 5 seconds.

       i dunno if this is going to make you more or less comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       but porn companies, like all companies, need profit. how do you make profit? develop a product people want.
      </p>
      <p>
       in traditionally businesses, identifying what your customer want is a very expensive guessing game.
      </p>
      <p>
       for a lot of internet businesses, specifically ones developed around search, your customers are literally telling you what they want.
      </p>
      <p>
       and so specifically in the case of incest porn, my theory has been that there is just a very high, albeit secret demand for this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       on that note, seems kind of like a conspiracy to call some of this stuff "depraved" anyway. i'm not into this stuff, but like, who ever actually decided that fucking your step sister was really depraved? probably someone with an agenda or someone who wanted to fuck your step sister.
      </p>
      <p>
       and so i kind of think the real conspiracy here is that we are taught what is "depraved", even if it is counter to our own instincts. are we trying to normalize step-incest now? or did we just get tired of trying to de-normalize it now that we realize it's profitable?

       That's how addiction works. Especially since it's so easy to access free porn nowadays. I was wanking ~3/4 times a week before new years, but since then I've only wanked 2 times (I also quit weed and alcohol too, so I think just the mentality of kicking bad habits is beneficial in all areas). I've also gotten back into meditation and have been more productive in my day-to-day life, so it helps to replace bad habits with healthy ones, that is, if you have difficulty moderating them.

       Ah that's interesting. To be honest I've personally always had a low sex drive. And I'd barely been drinking over the last 2 months or so anyway. I honestly think it was the weed in my case. I'd smoke, sit about in my room watching YouTube or do lazy shit, and just wank for the sake of it. I started attributing smoking to those lazy activities, so when I smoked (most days, if not every day) I'd do all my "lazy activities". Since I'm all clean I've replaced those lazy habits with healthy, productive ones, and it's great! I'm actually doing the shit I've wanted to get done over the last few months and my creative output is way up!

       Thank you! Yeah it's definitely easy to fall back into old ways. I've done that myself a few times with weed when I'd tried to quit before, as I had/have the problem where if there's weed about then I simply couldn't say no... So I've found that eliminating it from my immediate grasp will do for me.
       <br/>
       That's great that that's working for you! And that's what it's about, hey? Just finding what works for you. We're all different. I'll be open to partake again on special occasions in the future, but I need the straight detox right now. I reckon that once I don't have it for long enough than it should be far easier to not fall into that mental addiction again on the future should I smoke again.

       Why do you not plan on having sex for a very long time? If there's a problem then you should focus on solving it even if it takes time. Porn is shaping your mind even in ways you wouldn't imagine, lowering your testosterone, giving in to nihilism, doing anything to not find your way in life.

       Because I don't trust a single woman on the planet. Why risk one night of pleasure when she can turn around the next day, call rape, and ruin my life? I may eventually use a prostitute but that's not a priority. Btw, masturbation does not lower your testosterone or have anything to do with nihilism.

       Well I'm not talking one night stands, that's incredibly toxic and unsustainable to the civilization. Go out on a date.
      </p>
      <p>
       And no, frequent masturbation does lower your testosterone and shapes your thinking into submission as you do not need to go out and conquer a woman to orgasm/procreate. Read up on it. You're killing yourself.

       It's a conspiracy I tells ya! Must be those new-age feminists who see porn as the devil infiltrating it so that it is in fact an industry of violence and degradation rather than of course it's true place as the last stage in woman's sexual liberation.

       I thought this was interesting until it got all super religious and fundamentalist.

      <p>
       I also hate videos where they just put up news clips without narration, but that's another issue.

       The deaths are interesting and it'd be good to see a secular take on this instead of the religious preacher man.

       Katie from pornhub wrote a good post that made front page and talked specifically about the rise in incest videos on their. They said up until the last few years production companies made what they thought would sell and went forwards based off the numbers. Now though, they have metrics on everything, they know each kink and where it's biggest in the world. Using that data they were really surprised to find a lot more incest searches than they ever expected, armed with that data they felt comfortable trying to market some of it, it did really well, and now it's seeing a big jump in production numbers as everyone tries cashing in on it. I think it will fade into the background a bit once it's been normalized a bit and isn't so newly available, but for now it's an easy taboo for people to migrate towards, everyone knows they aren't actually related, but it still has that taboo feeling to it because it wasn't really talked about until recently.

       It's probably more common than you think to fantasize about your relatives. Lot's daughters fucked their father in the fucking old testament. Incest is probably an inherent sexual trait to humans, similar to homosexuality and all that shit.

       I imagine it's a lot easier to fantasize about incest if you're an only child or you have ugly relatives (as in my case). The primitive disgust instinct comes into play when you have relatives that you'd probably fuck if you were never related. If we didn't have that instinct we'd be retarded as hell lmao.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        One explanation sees the incest taboo as a cultural implementation of a biologically evolved preference for sexual partners with whom one is unlikely to share genes, since inbreeding may have detrimental outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another school argues that the incest prohibition is a cultural construct which arises as a side effect of a general human preference for group exogamy, which arises because intermarriage between groups construct valuable alliances that improve the ability for both groups to thrive.

       I think the truth is actually somewhere in the middle. We're actually evolved to select for people who carry a higher genetic similiarity than random chance, for a few reasons. One being selfish genes. When we have a kid, you're only passing on half your genes, so you're putting resources into ensuring the survival of half your genes and half someone else's. Genes are selfish because that's what gets you replicated, so to counter this we've evolved to find others who share our genes attractive. Then the kids you make will have more than 50% your genes, because you're both kicking in the same stuff. The most successful couples have higher genetic similiarity. Another reason being that genetic similiarity between parents increases the chance of passing on genes that work well together.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's a balancing act, because too close crossing increases the chance of expressing deleterious recessive alleles. (Which would actually be a benefit to the overall fitness of the species, but selection and thus evolution happens at the individual level, not the group) Mechanisms are necessary to balance the drive to select for genetically similar mates. I'm aware of two.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first being the Westermark effect, in which we imprint on those we spend enough time around in formative childhood years in a way that inhibits sexual attraction to those individuals specifically. This leads to situations where cohorts of unrelated children that were raised and schooled closely will not see each other as viable sexual partners, and(more strangely) direct relatives who were raised apart meeting later in life and experiencing intense sexual attraction. (This, known as genetic sexual attraction, isn't entirely verified as it's very hard to study, but anecdotes abound)
      </p>
      <p>
       The other being the Major Histocompatibility Complex, an area in our genome that encodes variability in our immune response. Parents with dissimilar MHCs will produce children with more robust immune responses, and we will be more attracted to the smell of a person if their MHC is highly dissimilar to ours than if it's close.
      </p>
      <p>
       Interestingly, all this is universal between known cultures. Oh and if you knock up your first cousin, there is only a 1% increase in the negative outcomes for the kid! Breathe easy, the South. ;)

       Even phenomenal senses tell us we are attracted to the better genetic match and usually the strongest is there most genetically different. It's wired in our DNA to hate Incest. Side note, our gender is also wired on our DNA.

       Yea, but it's not just disgust. If parent and child (or other relatives) are separated until the child is adult it's common for there to be a romantic / sexual attraction once they are reunited. Some act on them and try to get married.

        The study shows that Afghanistan's populations, like other Islamic populations, have a high level of consanguinity.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        When she was 17, marrying age for a Saudi girl, Salha al-Hefthi was presented with a husband.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was lucky, her parents told her when they planned the wedding, that she was to marry such a good man, a man from her own tribe, a man who would care for their children and make a good living. He was the son of her father's brother -- her first cousin --
        <strong>
         and everyone, including the bride, agreed that ''a first cousin was a first choice
        </strong>
        ,'' she said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across the Arab world today an average of
        <strong>
         45 percent of married couples are related
        </strong>
        , according to Dr. Nadia Sakati, a pediatrician and senior consultant for the genetics research center at King Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh.
       </p>
       <p>
        In some parts of Saudi Arabia, particularly in the south, where Mrs. Hefthi was raised, the rate of marriage among blood relatives ranges from
        <strong>
         55 to 70 percent
        </strong>
        , among the highest rates in the world, according to the Saudi government.
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       So, not quite the universal taboo you thought it was.

       Yep, Islamic counties have a very high rate of second cousin marriages and as result the 1400 years on inbreeding have caused severe birth  defects and lower IQ relative to other cultures who don't marry first cousins. It's actually quite sad, but also explains quite a bit.

       And at what rate are fathers and daughters married? Mothers and sons? Brothers and sisters? Like I said, it's a fairly universal taboo. Some cultures are fine with first cousins, some are with second, some with uncle and niece or aunt and nephew. But what you will rarely find, with few exceptions (and even those not widely throughout those cultures) is marriage and sexual relations being acceptable within the nuclear family unit.

       I don't know. But if half of them are fucking their cousins... I'm pretty sure there's a bit of everything going on in the lower percentages.

       I don't think that you can 100% assume that just because there are search numbers there that it means that real humans want to see it.  Looking at Elsagate, where they have videos with massive numbers of views that literally no normal person wants their kid watching, there is clearly some sort of paying for clicks or views or a bot farm to artificially inflate the numbers for videos in poor taste such that they get bumped up in the algorithms and put in front of live people.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying thats true in this case, but rather that it'd be interesting to know how they qualify their numbers to rule out the astroturfing.

       MILF is for older female (not granny types) with young male. Those looking for older male (not gramps type) with young female will use dad, stepdad searches because that’s all there is. And most people know those are actors and not really related.

       Wishing to see big age differences, with the idea of one being the child of the other. Whilst the big porn sites won't be showing paedophilia, and "incest" could just as easily be a scene featuring actors playing siblings, some of the searchers will be seeking the closest thing to fantasies about children.

       . The popularity of "mom" is very well known. Add that with the easiness of maybe a step-fantasy video (doesn't require more money or a set, just some words) and you get the recipe for a very popular niche.

       They've never been shy about the fact that they know our porn habits better than we do. Aren't they the ones who made the lists of top searches by state and country and stuff. I don't think it's anything they're trying to hide or should be worried about and Katie's always struck me as really cool and honest about the site and it's inner workings so I doubt anything like that's going on. I could be combining something she wrote with something someone else wrote too and mixing them up, memory is a terrible thing to rely on for stuff like that.

       I think it has a bit to do with people seeking a context to what they're watching. Instead of pointless depravity, they're seeking a story, a plot, and plausibility.

       I think the globalists are trying to take over the porn industry, and controlling our minds to find all sex normal, no matter the kinkiness so they can over populate the world, by sending in a legion of robotic succubi, design to just fuck every man it sees, thus getting rid of the need for the common female.

       Not to burst your bubble, but this stuff has been around for a long time. When I was thirteen ( in 1996?ish), I happened upon a site called "white shadow". It didn't have porn images, but it had "xxx rated stories" and every one of them was either incest
Or beastiity or..... god knows,,, those were the tame ones.

       It is the same a booze and everything else. Once you can't get drunk from 1 beer, you need 2, then 4. Once you can't enjoy the thrill from a coffee, you need a double expresso. Once you can't enjoy normal skiing, you need the advanced hill. It is the same deal everywhere.

       Have you ever seen Hot Girls Wanted on Netflix?  The second half of the documentary is about the morphing towards more degrading and physically abusive porn.  They pay the women more, and because porn keeps women so subjugated and impoverished (spending most of their money on "rent" at a producer's house and work-related costs like makeup and outfits), the women take the jobs purely for the money, but they have to do absolutely vile shit like slurp puke.

       The "step-sister" porn is getting old.  It's just the same old grimy teen porn with the words "step-sister" slapped on the title.

       I noticed the same thing kinda happened with anime. It escalated from gratuitous cleavage to toddlers in thongs, incest, etc.  I feel like they're trying too create creeps for municipal fodder. Now porn is the new tool. I'm no saint. I enjoy my flicks, but when the " What Others Are Watching" suggestions are ALWAYS teens, incest, and some chick with one foot on her head, and another in her butt, etc. I have to wonder. Is America that fucked up? It's not perfect, but it's not that fowl yet. It also doesn't help If a vid with  Ron Jeremy banging a WOMEN with a damn C-Section scar, who sounds like a dirt bike  is labeled. "Teen Loses Virginity To Grampa".  Labeling a flat chested 35 year old women as " Teen" is already pushing it. The extra pervy labels aren't necessary.

       Probably the Luciferian-worshiping globalists. The more depraved it is, the more they feel it's poking God in the eye, and they actually want to break every one of the Ten Commandments.  They feel they're above morality and we're cattle to be used. It's like a feather in their cap. That's why they copy Catholic rituals, but with an evil, negative twist. I don't watch and don't like it. I think it's actually harmful to the psyche. It's like women reading too many cheesy romance novels. Then they're disappointed that the real thing isn't anything like what they've read and they become vaguely dissatisfied with their partners. The only thing is, I don't think they'd really get much pleasure out of having someone just forcefully take them like in their "romance" books. It's called rape and it's traumatic in real life.

       I've definitely noticed this.  I've noticed it in particular when searching for not depraved stuff it feels like it tries to push things on you.  Also yes, insane amounts of incest porn showing up top of the list in mainstream categories (think "blonde" or "babes") on the pornhub app.

       It’s intentional. Think of what purpose it may serve and who benefits from it. Populations moving into the west eh masse that practice incest and pedophilia now have one less barrier to deal with, even if it’s occurring subconsciously for people. Part of the process of destroying national borders.

       The President of The United States said he'd date, ie, grab her by the pussy, his own daugther if she weren't his own daughter. That's the classic path to incest, it normalized it for the depraved society.

       Two decades ago, we started seeing trimmed pussies.  It was nice.  And then there was the Brazilian Wax, which is the best thing ever.  Then there was the completely shaved thing, which is a little creepy.  And now, we're going back to the messy giant bushes of the 70's?  Fuck no.  We're going backwards here.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's so disgusting to me that if I want to watch stepdads fuck their stepdaughters they have to have hairy pussies now.  What is wrong with our country?

       Boy am i glad others have noticed this. Now, i am into weird shit, i accept that. But seeing "incest" videos all over the front pages of porn sites has been unnerving. I honestly cant fathom the appeal, and like i said, im into some weird shit. But this is beyond me.
      </p>
      <p>
       I almost believe this is in a series of predetermined social changes. For example, things like homosexuality. Once deemed unacceptable by a vast majority of people, now believed to be repressed and seen as a proud and prideful shift towards public acceptance. Over time, introducing more and more questionable sexual topics. Kinda like this:
      </p>
      <p>
       Interracial &gt; Homosexual &gt; Transexual &gt; Incestual. 
Soon, i fear we will see the gradual acceptance of pedo-sexuals or whatever fucked up  name the sick fucks want to give themselves. 
Hell, throw in some inter-species sex too.

       If the incest taboo is indeed eroding, it just occurred to me that this might be due to the decreasing prominence of the nuclear family in child-rearing, with institutions and other caregivers taking over more of that role. We imprint on whoever we spend enough time with as kids so that we don't see them as viable partners(the Westermark effect). Of we're not being raised by our parents and interacting often and closely with our siblings, it makes tons of sense that the taboo imprinting might not be working as it evolved to.

       If the globalists have a fear of high-IQ populations and are importing cultures with low-IQs due to cousin marriages [like people from Muslim countries, who average an 86-IQ due to inbreeding], wouldn't it stand to reason that (among the host-population) they'd encourage the same behaviors?

       They want dumbed-down people. Through dumbed-down education, dumbed-down immigration trends, vaccines that cause autism, etc.

       And the biggest threat is people of European descent, especially those with ancestry from within the hajnal line (though that boundaries relevance is eroding).
      </p>
      <p>
       With the average IQ these people have, there's around 5 million genius level IQ Europeans, and honestly I'd say maybe 15 million, as IQ isn't perfect, it's more of a really good indicator of someones intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't understand is, why isn't Asia being targeted like the predominately white countries have been? North East Asians have comparable IQs to the Whites I mentioned. Maybe it's because the Europeans have the added personality factor of less collectivism, less social pressure, willingness to be a rebel? Even if it's not genetic, culturally it's extremely relevant to how these high IQs are used.

       In answer to your question about East Asian IQs---
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a lot of fallacies based on statistical averages. Like the myth that "Romans keeled over of old age when they were 25." In fact, they averaged about 75 years. It's only when you include high infant mortality that you get this skewed picture. The fact is: If you lived past the age of 2, you would most likely have lived about the same length as modern people. We have proof that both Neanderthal man and Cromagnon lived to about our lifespan, as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       So human lifespan hasn't changed as radically as a statistician might lead you to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       You get distortions in IQ-aggregates, too, based on this same methodology. For instance, we know that rural populations tend to have lower average IQs than urban populations. It's not that urban populations are naturally smarter. But urban areas are magnets for smart kids from the rural areas. So they'l be born in a rural area to rural parents, and then move to the city for university, or to get a job at a bank or corporation afterward, etc. All the opportunities are in the urban areas, so the smart people flock to them. This causes an even bigger "brain drain" in the rural areas, so the IQ gap widens even further.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we look at a place like Hong Kong and say, "It's the smartest place in the world, with a 105-IQ average." The reality is: Hong Kong is an artificial environment. It's synthetic. If you take all the residents there and blend them back in with the larger Chinese population (that they came from) that 105 sinks back down to a REAL average of 98, nationally. Because now the "smart kids" are blended back in with their rural uncles, cousins, grandparents, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       National IQ averages
       <em>
        love
       </em>
       tiny micro-nations like this to skew averages.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jews, too, benefit from this phenomenon. In the 19th and early 20th Centuries, they had significant illiteracy rates. (The term "kike" in fact comes from the Yiddish "keikl," which means "circle". Which is what illiterate Jews would "sign" with on documents in lieu of the Christian cross, like Gentile illiterates.) Urban Jews would ridicule rural "shtetl-dwelling" Jews as "kikes," because they couldn't read. In IQ tests of the time-period shtetl Jews had lower IQs than both urban Jews and Gentile counterparts. So this was not a race of super geniuses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then WWII came, and rural Jews were killed, leaving a superfluity of urban Jews. So magically the IQ average goes up.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the early 20th Century [before the rural Jews were deleted from the samples] average Jewish IQ was around 98. Which it still is in Israel today.
      </p>
      <p>
       So when you have a
       <em>
        large
       </em>
       sample size of BOTH urban and rural Jews, you get 98. When you ONLY sample urban Jews you get 102.
      </p>
      <p>
       Factoring for these realities, the highest REAL averages are not found among East Asians or Jews, but among Germans, Austrians and Italians.
      </p>
      <p>
       And these nations take into account BOTH rural and urban populations. So whites DO in fact have the highest REAL IQs.

       Oh hahaha, you sound a lot like me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trust me, I have been well aware of the infant mortality/lifespan thing, and how our entire culture is steeped in the idea that humans were disgusting savages that died under 30 (they lived the same or longer), that barely ate enough food (they ate 2-5x the amount of calories and had virtually no obesity), that didn't shower or bathe (most cultures have had around the same amount of personal hygiene as we do now, if their environment permitted). If you search my post history you might find me talking about it. I remember telling people in high school and no one believed me. I actually was talking about this exact subject with some acquaintances the other day, surprisingly I'm being believed now (too many times I've been right I guess).
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a study that can support our opinion:
       <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672390/">
        https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672390/
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       "Analysis of the mid-Victorian period in the U.K. reveals that life expectancy at age 5 was as good or better than exists today, and the incidence of degenerative disease was 10% of ours. Their levels of physical activity and hence calorific intakes were approximately twice ours. They had relatively little access to alcohol and tobacco; and due to their correspondingly high intake of fruits, whole grains, oily fish and vegetables, they consumed levels of micro- and phytonutrients at approximately ten times the levels considered normal today. This paper relates the nutritional status of the mid-Victorians to their freedom from degenerative disease; and extrapolates recommendations for the cost-effective improvement of public health today."
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure how true their conclusion on the causes of the Britons good health is, but the census records don't lie.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's similar to the same stupid belief that neanderthals were idiots (they likely had a bigger brain than modern day humans, with the same encephalization quotient).
      </p>
      <p>
       Humans are much weaker, sicker, and likely dumber than 1,000 years ago, and honestly were probably much healthier and intelligent before the beginning of agriculture (big maybe on intelligent, we have the benefit of tons of intellectual stimulation nowadays).
      </p>
      <p>
       Agriculture really was the fall of man in a lot of ways. Basically every problem we face stems from it, and every good as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also am aware that averages don't mean shit:

       ^ Previous post of mine.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, if you had a population where 5% of them were 160 IQ, and the rest had a horrible mutation that left them mentally retarded, you'd see some very misleading numbers when averaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, I was thinking the same thing, that the IQ for Hong Kong was misleading as a number for the whole of China, and also was wondering if the Chinese government was just straight up lying. But we definitely cannot discount the high IQ of the Japanese and Koreans (which are both doing quite well, arguably due to the US's support, as these countries were never relevant on the world stage (besides some wars between each other) until the US swooped in, which leaves me very confused, is it a cultural issue here? These people are certainly NOT stupid).
      </p>
      <p>
       For the Israeli IQ, I think I know the reason: the country has a sizable population of Mizrahi/Sephardic Jew (which BTW many of the Ashkenazi are incredibly racist towards). Mizrahi Jews are the 'Jews left behind', they developed completely separately from the Ashkenazi, with none of the same environmental pressures the Ashkenazi faced. In terms of IQ, the Mizrahi seem to have an IQ similar to other groups living in the same area. The Mizrahi/Sephardic make up about 1/4 of Israels population, another 1/4 goes to various Arab groups, and the rest is roughly Ashkenazi, so it makes sense why Israel's IQ would be so skewed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason for Europe's complete dominance of the world is probably due to the potent mix of Whites + Ashkenazi. But really, the Ashkenazi haven't existed in their "full form" until very recently, so the only explanation I can come up with is that Whites are very special indeed. I mean, the masses of Whites are complete idiots, but they aren't as dumb as other groups, and are generally peaceful comparatively, and the best part is that the White pool very often creates very special people. Combined with the personality traits of whites + culture and you have an explanation for why everything turned out the way it did.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, there's good evidence the ancient Greeks were blonde whites, that the Romans were whites, that even Genghis Khan had some Euro traits (he was said to be a sparkling man, dude had green eyes and red hair).
      </p>
      <p>
       I never sought out to come to this conclusion, but it's the conclusion I've come to.

       Yeah, we agree on almost everything. I just don't buy the revisionist "Jewish race of super geniuses".
      </p>
      <p>
       In pre-WWII IQ tests, they scored lower than European populations.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when you look at historical innovations and accomplishments, you had Europeans with marble palaces, million-person metropolises and engineering marvels . . . while Israel had tents.
      </p>
      <p>
       Socrates, Plato and Aristotle were inventing science and metaphysics and the Israelites were dealing in fables and fairytales.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's why the Greeks so easily rolled over the Middle East. Technologically they dwarfed them. The only impressive structures in the region are from the Greeks and Romans. Even the Weeping Wall (which the Jews claim was built by the fictitious Solomon was actually built by the Romans).
      </p>
      <p>
       They were Antiquity's Honduras.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that didn't really change for Jews in Europe. Historically, they weren't exactly known for brilliant architecture, innovations or inventions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like on T-shirts, you often see a picture of Einstein with a nuclear explosion and E-mc2. But the problem is: Enrico Fermi (an Italian) split the atom [not Einstein]. And E=mc2 ALSO came from an Italian [Olinto DePretto]. Even Relativity wasn't Einstein's. It came from his hero, Henri Poincare. Einstein was part of a fan club of his back at school. Poincare wrote a paper called "On the Theory of Relativity": years before Einstein.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point being: Had Einstein never been born we would have still had:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Atomic bombs,
      </p>
      <p>
       2) E=mc2
      </p>
      <p>
       3) Relativity.
      </p>
      <p>
       (He didn't invent any of these things. But, hey! Jewish people needed a hero to help sculpt a new image, to displace their old one of usurers and pornograhers.)
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why you saw a lot of abuse of the Nobel prize system--to help their image. It was used as a political tool. Like when the CIA admitted that Boris Pasternak was given the prize in literature as a snub to the Soviets. It's been politicized for a long, long, LONG time.
      </p>
      <p>
       I actually like Jews, so I don't want to be a dick to them. But yeah: They do a lot of media work to address their persistent public relations problems. And one common tool is: "Hey, Jews are assets to the world! Look at all the Nobel prizes!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah, like Obama's Nobel prize.
      </p>
      <p>
       (Totally legit, lol.)
      </p>
      <p>
       No, when you look at the totality of Antiquity and modern history, Germans, Austrians and Italians dominate--just as their national IQ's suggest they would.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like the earliest modern computer that we have. It's unpopular to allude to it, but it was created in Hitler's Germany. (It was called the Z3. Our later Enniac was based on this earlier model.) Just like the V2 rocket technology that NASA later stole (when they co-opted German scientist Werner von Braun). Likewise with the Manhattan Project. It languished . . . until Project Paperclip brought over the Germans. THEN it worked.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just about every modern invention we use was from Germans, Austrians and Italians . . . with some side-help from Serbian Nikola Tesla (but he was born in what was then the Austro-Hungarian empire). So I guess you might put him in the Austrian category. He was raised and educated in their schools.

       I had a similar thought about cuckold porn. Seems like that'd be really niche, like incest or violent porn. Not to kink shame the people who are actually into these things, but I wouldn't be surprised if there was some coordinated effort to subvert "normal" sexual behavior by encouraging these sorts of things. Then again, at the same time, I can imagine a prude person trying to tell me that even "normal" porn is a conspiracy to subvert "normal" sexual behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even so, I think it's still possible. I know that the US has attempted to "weaponize" sexual behavior before, so it would be foolish to not believe that other bad actors would try to weaponize sexuality too. Especially if we remember that the people in charge of such government programs would likely themselves be the type of "prude" I mentioned above. Perhaps they feel they can "damage" American culture by encouraging such "deviant" sex acts when the reality is that no one with a brain cares what consenting adults do in the privacy of their own homes.

       From a pyscho-social cultural perspective (Western Culture) the last 3 decades have seen a massive rise in divorce and mixed family structure (parents re-marry, thus creating step sibilings). Not that there aren't other factors that play into this phenomenon - I attribute it to the mixed/blended family - ie wanting to fuck your step sister/ step brother - which technically isn't true incest as it is not blood.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not saying it's right. Not saying it's wrong. But it sure is kinky and given the west's cultural climate these things are much more legitimized/justifiable  compared to the traditional family model.

       Violence and humiliation had high points on the early 20ies, then 70ies, and now again. Esp. with the rise of eastern european producers.

      <p>
       Incest had it's high points in the 50ies, 80ies and now there's a little bit more, but not as high as in the 80'ies with the hugely successful Taboo series.

       Ugh.  There's so much political correctness and social justice in our lives now, in our workplace, and recently in Hollywood, now you're coming for our porn?  I dunnow, maybe society is getting more civilized, and as a reaction our porn is getting more depraved?  Now you want to sanitize our pornography?  Let obscenity be obscene, Make smut great again!

       the whole market is reading this wrong.

      <p>
       what you have are tons of pedophiles looking for younger teens, and most of the teens in these videos look like todays higher mileage pam anderson.
      </p>
      <p>
       So they start typing daughter, sister, amateur, incest, into searches because the implications are that these will be even younger and you know you don't want to type child porn right into google, so you use these peripheral search terms.

       I don’t think it’s THAT deep. Porn has always been about displaying a person’s fantasy. Just like anal and destruction porn fanatics...there are ppl into incest or at least have entertained the thought. Therefore porn companies target that person and their fantasy. Porn doesn’t discriminate haha. But seriously, do a search for the “Ortega sisters” O_O

       You'll see the same video posted under different titles including the category terms and terms like step brother, stepmom, cheerleader etc even though nothing like that is in the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, some of the videos are amateur videos posted the same time with about 6 different titles which leads me to think ph are doing this themselves to build up a model of metrics. I don't think it's a conspiracy or anything, they're directly testing titles like a marketing firm would test email subject lines for example. Then they'll probably take that information to their partners/clients to inform them of how to get more clicks. It's research, nothing more.

       I'm Catholic and porn is considered adultery. From an extreme perspective. Just saying, porn isn't really good for you. It's not rocket science, then it's there everywhere to f us up. Like a pillar on the obstacle course of life. Living life is a battlefield of temptation.

       A lot of porn has the girl doing stuff to you. This can make some individuals less sexually assertive. It pacifies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Normally the man "takes" the woman and she "receive." A lot of porn has her as the "active" party. This never struck me as weird, until I gave up porn for a while. Not it strikes me as weird. It can make you more of a lazy observer.

       Sometimes I think the devils people have to force themselves to do these things. I'm pretty surr they try to fulfill prophecies etc... We are either in the end times or are right on the cusp of them.

       Maybe I’m odd, my tastes never changed from solo girl or lesbian.  I am not saying I didn’t watch 2g1c out of curiosity or occasionally clicked something weird like Asian stuff with pissing, but a quick view was always enough to immediately know “nope, not my thing” except for rare instances where you keep watching but out of wtf’ness and it is not erotic at all.

       Yes, being desensitized is a big part of it. Plus availability of porn for free means people who sell it have to offer something "extra." Also, most of us first see porn when we're kids and it's a "bad" thing we're not supposed to do. That feeling makes it more exciting. But looking at something you thought was really hot when you were 12 would seem pretty tame now.
       <br/>
       And like you're saying, a feedback loop where sites provide what people search for, people become desensitized and search for the next thing, site provides it, and so on.

       And the biggest threat is people of European descent, especially those with ancestry from within the hajnal line (though that boundaries relevance is eroding).
      </p>
      <p>
       With the average IQ these people have, there's around 5 million genius level IQ Europeans, and honestly I'd say maybe 15 million, as IQ isn't perfect, it's more of a really good indicator of someones intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I don't understand is, why isn't Asia being targeted like the predominately white countries have been? North East Asians have comparable IQs to the Whites I mentioned. Maybe it's because the Europeans have the added personality factor of less collectivism, less social pressure, willingness to be a rebel? Even if it's not genetic, culturally it's extremely relevant to how these high IQs are used.
