Yes, I agree that the hints are cryptic, this is on purpose, as the average person is not being targeted by Q. His messages are not easily digestible news friendly sound bites. </p>

<p>Now, the same thing can be said for evidence supporting flat-earth, except for the fact that flat-earth can actually be debunked by 2000 years of science and common sense about the number of people required to maintain the cover-up. </p>

<p>Besides saying that Q is a LARP, no one has actually tracked down the guy who is sitting in his mom&#39;s basement.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Q makes any attempt to call out Zionists &amp; Israel, then I will believe what they have to say. At this point I think it should be clear to anyone paying attention and who has done some research on the globalist Cabal, that Israel is a big part of it due to its creation, direction and basically ownership by the Rothschild&#39;s. It&#39;s also deeply tied to to Freemasonry (there was a thread about that in the last couple of days), runs the American government, planned and orchestrated 9/11, was in on the JFK hit, etc. Q has called out Rothschild&#39;s, but NOT ONCE in connection to Israel. In fact, Israel is only mentioned twice in the Q posts, and one of those mentions was simply a list of Rothschild&#39;s central banks, the other mention was in passing. Q does not call out Israel on ANYTHING, and in fact is actually more or less diverting attention away from them. Couple that with how blatantly pro-Israel the US foreign policy in the middle east is proving to be... it&#39;s pretty clear what&#39;s going on. Trump is owned and operated by Zionists and Q is a psy-op to accompany the Zionists plans. We are going to see, soon, the creation of Eretz Israel. Which, frankly, I see as having an extraterrestrial connection. Bear in mind that the Law of One channelings indicate links between all of the Abrahamic religions and the &#39;Orion group&#39;, which is essentially Draco (reptilian). Christians believe there will be a second coming, while Jews are holding out for the &#39;first coming&#39;. I believe that upon the creation of Eretz Israel we will see the Jews&#39; &#39;first coming&#39;, but it will be an extraterrestrial, Archontic force -- the kind of thing David Icke has been warning about for decades now. On top of that, what we are seeing in terms of a purge of corrupt elements/a take down of criminal elements like the elite pedos, folks like the Clinton&#39;s, etc. is all described at length in the Protocols of Zion which openly state that as they &#39;come into their kingdom&#39;, there will be a purge of many of the corrupt agents within governments, media, etc. as well as much of the secret societies -- people who have helped them achieve their agenda, but are later to be thrown onto the fire as the total despotism they&#39;ve planned for takes hold. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been meaning to write a post on all this, because I&#39;ve gathered a lot of bits and pieces to support the theory. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I do think a lot of what Q says is true and a lot of the right people are being referenced as &#39;on the chopping block&#39;, shall we say. But the big issue arises from what ISN&#39;T said, what and who is <em>not included</em>, coupled with all the research I&#39;ve done over the years and what&#39;s happening in terms of the Trump admin re: the middle east, I think it&#39;s pretty clear that the new world order is being prepared, We could be facing severe economic crashes, bringing about a digital currency, pretty large scale global conflict a la the Albert Pike plan. There&#39;s a lot to put together. </p>

<p>I did make a thread on twitter about it if anyone is interested, but I really should sit down and prepare something more fleshed out and connect more of the dots. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am not up enough on this to prove to you that Q is not pro Zionist at this moment.  I can tell you from studying Q that he is definitely pro Israel but not pro zionist. I understand this may sound like he is threading the needle here but we can support Israels right to state hood but still recognize that zionist goals are not good.   If you do just a search of his posts for the word Israel it is true it only comes up twice but Q does not always call things by there name.  He often uses initials and other names for things.  I remember him pointing out that Netanyahu was questioned for hours by the police, but if you search for his name nothing comes up. Search for his initials and they don&#39;t either.  But, He is not for Him at all. Wish I could remember what he called him that you could search by that. Q is anti Rothschilds who are the ultimate Zionists.  He also exposed the zionist agenda by asking questions about Hitler and other people who in order to understand the answer we had to look at zionism and its connection to the Globalists.  Since I cant give you the exact questions or names he used I am afraid you are just going to have to read him.  I know that is a big task at this point.  Here is the questions and answers link.  This is the best source to use to read Q since the answers are already provided. If you find the date that Netanyahu was arrested and questioned you could go to the dates around that time and just read those posts. Then see what he calls him and then search for that name, but even that gives you a very small slice of what is presented and you miss what the questions lead the researcher to find.  </p>

<p>I assume that Q&#39;s lack of discussing Israel is that no US Republican politician can attack Israel and get re-elected.  Christians would turn on him as well as the American Jewish population. But I can assure you that Q and CBTS is not pro Zionist having spent the past 3 months reading and studying the Q&#39;s and A&#39;s.  Hopefully that is good news for you.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not seen any not come true except one. That was Q saying there could be riots and power outages that weekend.  That was the weekend Soros had planned his big riots nationwide called days of Rage. George was a no show and Q said it was because he had posted saying they already had control of the National Guard so they knew that their paid mercs would be arrested and it would be discovered that they were paid merc.   Can you show me anything else?  I do not know of anything else at all.  Those riots may still happen when the arrests happen but probably not because Q has done a good job of publicizing what is really happening and we are so far down the stream and the roof is there for the arrests now.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He gave dates that hey would be indicted and they are very likely one of those sealed indictments.  You can be indicted months before you are arrested and you can be arrested and it not be made public.  Often people of this stature are allowed to voluntarily surrender at a law enforcement office at night and they are promised a media black out in exchange.  Sealed indictments are used when there are a large number of defendants and they do not want to tip off other members of the organized crime group that one member of the group has been arrested.  many people suspect that Soros, Both Clinton, both Bushes and handful of others have already been taken into custody and are at Gitmo since around the 19th of December.  Looking at their Twitter accounts they have all been silent since then. I am doing this post from memory so if you go and check and one of them has been spotted then I am remembering wrong or it is a false report that they are somewhere. Likelast week there was a false story put out that the c/intons were in Hawaii.  But the story had a picture from 2015 that was supposed to be taken that visit.  And back at the beginning of January there were 3 different posts on twitter that showed Obama supposedly holding an event but the pictures of it were again from last year.  There have been a few posts on Clinton&#39;s twitter recently but they were the type that were scheduled in advance like she pushed a new book release that is favorable to her image there were 2 after like 10 days of silence and then it went silent again  None of them have commented on big stories to my knowledge.  I have not checked it recently since they have not posted in almost at all since the 19th of December.  I am not sure that Obama will be arrested. I think he may have made a deal with the CBTS plan to participate and he may claim he was forced to do everything he did.  Q posts about 2 different Husseins but people think they are one and then they think Q is down on Obama but early posts give the impression that Obama is part of the mission.  Its not clear.    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It does sound outlandish upon first read I am sure.  But do a search on Gitmo and you should find a few stories in the news that lend credence to Q&#39;s claims that they will be held there as enemy combatants and then tried at Nuremberg type military tribunals.  These people have worked to undermine our democracy, economy and basic freedoms.
Yo will find a story about gitm obeign expanded with new secure listening rooms for private phone conversations and about General Mattis going to Gitmo when people who have held his position for the past 15 years have always done a Christmas season visit to a battle zone. Instead he went to Gitmo.  Then you may find a story about Gitmo facilities for high profile inmates being expanded from 750 to 2000 high level inmates.  Then there are 8chan autists tracking the traffic in and out of Gitmo, which is typically very routine and limited.  There are reports of additional flights.  I am not an expert on this and I have not been able to interpret their reports.
I am not sure what Q said that had people looking into Gitmo. Sorry cant be specific.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you.  Iposted it on CBTS-Stream to see what people think.  they seem to be great at fidning the sme picture/ video a year or more earlier and then we know its a fake.  There seems to be a good deal of this going on to make things appear normal and I do not know if its the CBTS_stream doing it so that the other conspirators are not tipped off or if its the globalists trying to keep everything looking normal while they get that DJT out of office.</p>
