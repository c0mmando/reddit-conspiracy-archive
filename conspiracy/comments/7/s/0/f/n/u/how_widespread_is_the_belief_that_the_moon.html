        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>At this point I&#39;d say for anyone under 30, the percentage is quite a bit higher than it was just 5 years ago. There was a poll that said 52% of British people believe that it was hoaxed and I&#39;m sure that number has grown substantially, especially after the resurgence of the flat earth movement.</p>

<p>But I&#39;m wondering what the US consensus is like, does your circle of friends think it&#39;s a hoax or believe it? In Canada I&#39;d say the numbers of hoax believers are similar to Britain&#39;s </p>

    <div class="md"><p>People claim that because there is no delay between when the guys on the moon say something and Nixon responds that it&#39;s fake (speed of light means there should be a 1 sec delay). They of course forget that the call was recorded on the earth side, so the only delay should be between when the earth talks and when the moon responds. Sure enough, there&#39;s a delay there.</p>

<p>They show a lot more than pixels, and I don&#39;t know why you keep saying NASA pictures are meaningless. You have yet to provide any evidence of a single fake NASA image. You&#39;re attacking the source without any explanation.  </p>

<p>The truth is not &quot;losing&quot;. There will probably always be people who believe it was fake, and they will always be wrong. I&#39;ve turned a few people on this sub already, so I know your statement isn&#39;t true anyway.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Like I said before I want to believe and the fact that no other nation has called us out is some strong evidence to the fact that we me made it there, at least in my opinion. However that video of Jack Schmitt you showed is some of the weird stuff I am talking about. That doesn&#39;t look like he is lighter to me. It looks suspect. I would think that someone trying to get up on the moon wouldn&#39;t be that hard. The suit ways less on the moon than on earth, therefore it should be easier for him to get up than it is on Earth. In a basic sense.</p>

<p>It definitely does not appear heavier. You can see when he first falls over how he almost flies into the air. His movements are awkward because the suits are pressurized and as stiff as a board. You really have to strain to be able to move at all.</p>

<p>It depends on how you&#39;re looking at the stars and from where.  Why is that difficult to understand?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I guess you just don&#39;t understand what the word proof means.</p>

<p>Refute what?</p>

<p>The systems involved were no longer needed. A gantry elevator and launching platform for an obsolete rocket isn&#39;t much use to anyone.</p>

<p>It depends on where you&#39;re looking.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and you also have to come up with an explanation to why and how we &quot;destroyed&quot; the technology needed to get to the moon. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because it wasn&#39;t needed anymore.</p>

<p>The next phase of NASA&#39;s missions focused on different things, like ike building a more efficient, reusable shuttle and like launching long-term habitation experiments. That phase involved zero manned-lunar missions. No reason to have any of that stuff around.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Youtube videos aren&#39;t evidence. Use words, numbers, science, data. Not copypasta or someone <em>else&#39;s</em> thoughts.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you do manage to explain these inconsistencies I will respond with more for you to address, because I have many, many more.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And these dumb copypasta to have very simple answers.</p>

<p>It&#39;s almost like you&#39;ve done exactly zero research.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not that complicated. Look at the astronauts&#39; press conference. Look at their body language. Take a good look at the LEM (I posted a pic of it earlier today). It&#39;s made of curtain rods, aluminum foil, and cardboard. How can anyone with a functioning brain think it is a real space ship?</p>

<p>Even the Chinese admitted to viewing Apollo sites with rover.</p>

<p>Lots of tracks/gear left over from follow on missions, less evidence from first landing (Apollo 11), as they berely left the pod. With newly redundant systems, I believe they succeeded, as they had the 3 best military test pilots they could find, a 50% projected chance of failure was much higher odds than they were accustomed.</p>

<p>First of all, I just want to correct something there. The telemetry data we lost was the telemetry data <em>of</em> the high quality footage in the form of tapes. They&#39;re the same thing.  </p>

<p>We lost them after they were overwritten during a tape shortage in the 80s. We still (of course) have the lower quality version of the video, and there are <a href="https://imgur.com/a/Pi7zY">pictures</a> of the higher quality video.  </p>

<p>Not only that but it seems they have lost the data not just for that one mission, but for ALL Apollo missions from what I read.  </p>

<p>No, we have the higher quality/color video. The only other video that is messed up is <a href="https://i.imgur.com/zimYZCc.gifv">this small part</a> of the Apollo 12 color footage when Alan Bean pointed the camera at the sun and destroyed it.   </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If anything, they proved it <em>can</em> be faked, not that it wasn&#39;t. People act like these guys went into the experiments unbiased but by the end of the episode when their skewed experiments gave them the results they pushed for (even though inconclusive), the one guy goes &quot;Take <strong>that</strong>, conspiracy theorists!!&quot; No bias, huh. They wanted so badly to bust the myth but failed. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah they did some of that. They just addressed some of the different theories that were used to claim it was a hoax. Go check it out on YouTube. Personally I&#39;ve always been on the fence. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And? We still have most of the technology, but it&#39;s not operational.  </p>

<p>We may not have the designs for LM Transistor 38BC-3 either. There was a great comment on an earlier thread about this. The Saturn V had <em>millions</em> of individual parts. If one tiny part was made by some subcontractor that folded 20 years ago, we probably don&#39;t have the design for it anymore. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know it&#39;s frustrating to have to defend Apollo, man. More and more people are realizing it&#39;s bullshit every day and NASA does nothing to help your cause either. It&#39;s been demonstrated so many mathematical and practical ways that every aspect of the missions was a colossal hoax, and the very photographic record certifies this. </p>

<p>Sure it&#39;s got to be a drag especially when you have people like me that you can&#39;t face without sputtering and sweating about &quot;facts&quot; and &quot;math checking out.&quot; But the truth is, when you get burned out so much that your performance begins to suffer, it might be time to find a new hobby or employment.</p>
