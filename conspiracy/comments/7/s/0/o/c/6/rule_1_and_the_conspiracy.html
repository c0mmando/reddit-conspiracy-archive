        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I&#39;ve been a lurker on reddit since 2009. And in these last 8-9 years I&#39;ve enjoyed many a photoshop battle, TRPG subs, news, politics, and pitchforks. r/conspiracy is what drew me to this platform in the first place. I&#39;ve had a mind for conspiracies ever since I read Holy Blood, Holy Grail in my teens. I know it in my bones that we are being lied to, manipulated, stolen from, and even murdered by TPTB. It&#39;s all terrible and fascinating at the same time, and in my opinion it&#39;s the last mythology in a world where our gods are dead.</p>

<p>That being said, I have a real problem with the rampant anti-semitism that I encounter daily here and on other forums. </p>

<p>My reason for posting this today is to ask a simple question: At what point does blaming (((them))) for anything and everything amount to being a bigoted or racial slur? Sure you don&#39;t see &quot;kike&quot; thrown around too often, and those obvious outbursts are handled by the mods. But what about the other comments and posts? What about the endless posts portraying (((them))) as greedy devils, or murderous rapists, or even a subhuman species? What about the damn (((parenthesis)))? </p>

<p>Think critically for a moment. Do you really think that millions of (((people))) from all walks of life, around the world, are in on some global conspiracy to to subjugate the goyim? Do you really think that thousands of eyewitnesses, the Nurenburg trials, and US and Russians solders are all misleading you about the Holocaust? </p>

<p>I know this is a platform for free speech and that&#39;s why I love it here. I&#39;m not attempting to silence anyones voices or enforce any rules. But Jews, just like you, are human beings as diverse as any other ethnic group. Please, at the very least, consider what I&#39;ve said. Consider that your words have true power in this forum and beyond. TPTB are here to divide and conquer us, but at least on this issue we&#39;re doing that work for them.</p>

<p>With love,
(((MerchantOfSargoth)))</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry, my dude. I felt like I was responding to trolls and I got a bit nasty. It was immature. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I think it could be either/or. It depends on the individual, I&#39;d imagine. I being an Anglican raised Scotsman couldn&#39;t give an informed opinion on the subject. I&#39;ll try though. Being a European Jew would mean it&#39;s more of a religious identification. Being an Israeli or Levantine Jew would be more ethnic. But even a Levantine Jew may not identify with the religion if that&#39;s their choice.  </p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;m not too familiar with Jewish religious sects, but I&#39;ve heard it mentioned that Ashkanzi Jews are European and Sephardic Jews are Levantine. Even now as I write this I have the urge to look it up. But I wanted to give you an honest answer as to what I know here in this moment. Am I off the mark?</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>OK. So now we&#39;ve got some distinguishing characteristics. <em>IF</em> both my Jewish bosses were telling me the truth, it would suggest there is a <em>CULTURAL</em> conflict inside a <em>RELIGIOUS</em> group. </p>

<p>The Sephardic side of the equation want to assimilate into the cultures it joins. The Ashkanazi want to rule. That&#39;s how it seems to me, with the full awareness that of course there are decent, fair-minded, even handed human beings of Ashkanazi descent. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>well sure, because of its heavy history.</p>

<p>however im sure that in an academic background, if you have proof to back your shit up and not have a history of racism/anti-semitism, you wont be called so.</p>

<p>on the other hand, ive never seen someone not-racist question the holocaust, outside of an academic background. smart people avoid it, as they know its a sensitive subject and theres ultimately very little to gain from it. on the other hand, as a racist, you can go around your tail with bullshit paranthesis and achronyms like jq all you want or saying you dont mean <em>all the jews</em>, the truth still becomes obvious ultimately.</p>

<p>perhaps you should remind yourself of the origin of the &quot;k&quot; word. there has been a slow a constant push to throw your values onto other cultures, and your collective insistence that it is the &quot;right&quot; way,  while manipulating (((science)))  to support your views, has not gone unnoticed. </p>

<p>the fact that you have systematically manipulated people to spread also does not bode well. Instead of continued victimization, perhaps you should do more extensive research into the claims of the &quot;goy&quot;, and then maybe you will come to realize what we all have, this implicit segregation is no different than any other &quot;divisive&quot; tool.

<p>I&#39;m not sure why you feel as though I have made an unreasonable assumption. But perhaps that was the point of this misdirection. </p>

<p>Regardless, it is somewhat concerning you feel the need to defend something that you do not completely understand. It is also clear you intended to make a &quot;feel-good/I&#39;m a good person&quot; statement and not have a conversation, despite the rather shallow depth of your comments.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I understand it, generally it means a certain sort of person similarly associated with TPTB. The assumed controllers of the vast amounts of wealth and weavers of the financial web that spans the globe are the Rothschilds and their ilk. To add, the way I understand it, this would also include Israel, as per the Balfour Declaration and events leading up to WW1 ( of course there is much more to understand prior to this ) and their goals for a Greater Israel, fomenting plans that have supposedly been laid out for more than a century. The problem lies more in who is actually occupying Israel than simply &quot;Jews&quot;. They are Judaic in their belief and their way of life following Kabbalah and not even close to the Roman Empire version of Christianity that supposedly intertwines both religions. When taken in that light there is a clear distinction between two worlds (peoples/fundamentals/perceptions) that are vehemently opposed to each other.</p>

<p>I could go on. Suffice to say it&#39;s neither and it&#39;s both. Most use the parenthesis to either state the context without saying it directly, history as some know it as they&#39;ve dug down the rabbit hole like myself, while some use it to be divisive.</p>

<p>Jews, Muslims, and Christianity has survived and thrived for centuries, millennia, in the cradle of civilization to no I&#39;ll effect; (((They))) aren&#39;t who they are pretending to be. (((They))) are TPTB because no one disputes it. It&#39;s a wonderful story to claim as their own, but it&#39;s a lie.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I only claim to know what others have researched and presented their findings along with what I have researched and can present. I know nothing except my own experiences. My experience tells me there is a grand scheme that has been happening long before I &quot;woke up&quot; around the age of 5 or 6. My first book report in school grade 1 was in J.D. Rockefeller. Couldn&#39;t tell you why it was him that I chose. That scheme is something no one has direct control over; certainly no one I&#39;ve met. I&#39;ve met billionaires and politicians. I&#39;ve met bums and off gridders. They, like everyone, find a niche that fits them. Some struggle and fade. Some accept what is and thrive. Some move up and some move down. In the end there is only one choice, and that is whatever you want it to be.</p>

<p>Most of what you see around these parts anymore is a game of ebb and flow. I&#39;ve paid visits to this sub for many years. It only got bad after Obama legalized propaganda. Those who are left and who seem to find themselves here from never before are quickly stifled between bigotry, ignorance, lies, and a sliver of truth. Salt is good for you, so I&#39;ll say take what you see with a grain of sand. Course, gritty, and unpleasant. So take in what makes the most logical sense in the discourse of nonsense and have a happy life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had two Jewish bosses who spoke with me quite frankly about how Jews see each other and how they see non-Jews. One was drunk at the time, the other was a guy who just couldn&#39;t keep his mouth shut and was an inveterate gossip, whether the subject was business, who was sleeping with who, religion, or pretty much anything, really.</p>

<p>The conversations came about a decade apart and in different parts of the country. It&#39;s led me to believe there is a Civil War raging among the Jews. One side, I think, hates non-Jews much more than the other. </p>

<p>The Civil War appears to be between the Ashkenazic Jews and Sephardic Jews. The Ashkenazic Jews, one of my bosses told me &quot;are killers.&quot; Of course, he was Sephardic, so take that as you will. He also said the war was between &quot;thinking, intellectual Jews&quot; and &quot;Warlike Jews.&quot; Again, he was the &quot;thinking, intellectual&quot; Jew. </p>

<p>To emphasize: This is just what I&#39;ve been told, these are not my own words. But it has colored my thinking since. </p>

<p>This boss also told me that there are certainly a lot of Jews who hate Christians. He flat out told me that. He actually told me to look up the origin of the word &quot;Kike.&quot; I did that, and a little more digging and I found out a couple things that I didn&#39;t like reading. </p>

<p>For example: Did you know there is no &quot;Plus sign&quot; as we know it in Israeli math books? They think it looks too much like a cross, apparently. They use an inverted &quot;T,&quot; called the &quot;Up Tack.&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plus_and_minus_signs</a></p>

<p>I also learned the ugly slur &quot;Kike&quot; comes from immigrant Jews refusing to use an &quot;X&quot; on their entry to Ellis Island, because they thought it looked too much like a cross, which they refused to acknowledge. So they used a circle instead. They Yiddish word for circle was shortened to &quot;Kike&quot; as a term of contempt in response to the Jewish refusal to use make an &quot;X.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kike">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kike</a></p>

<p>Al Goldstein, the notorious pornographer, once said Jews were behind the porn business because &quot;We think Christ sucks.&quot; But he also said, when asked what it means to be a Jew, &quot;It doesn&#39;t mean shit. It means that I&#39;m called a kike.&quot; When asked about God, Goldstein said &quot;I believe in me. I&#39;m God. Fuck God. God is your need to believe in some super being. I am the super being. I am your God, admit it.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Goldstein">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Goldstein</a></p>

<p>So I&#39;m not sure we&#39;re even talking about &quot;Jews&quot; at that point. Is being Jewish a RELIGIOUS thing or a CULTURAL thing? Do both the RELIGIOUS, observant Jews and the CULTURAL Jews hate everybody else? I don&#39;t know, but I don&#39;t think so. I hope not. </p>

<p>I hate to make the cliched comment that &quot;Some of my best friends are Jews,&quot; but it&#39;s actually a fact. I&#39;m a Christian, but the best man in my wedding was Jewish. I&#39;ve worked for several Jews and there have been honorable men who paid me well and there have been greedy liars. I have met incredibly wise and spiritually in-tune Jews who have helped me on my personal journey. I have met deeply cynical atheistic Jews who were only in it for the money. </p>

<p>It&#39;s an incredibly complex issue, but I also feel it&#39;s one of the most important ones facing our country and the world. I don&#39;t think the Jews are at the root of all evil, but I think the complexity of their place in the world and the spiritual/secular and religious/cultural intricacies deserve more discussion.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#39;t happen because whenever anybody approaches it, the reflexive response is to shout &quot;Anti-Semitism!&quot; And the shouting isn&#39;t always wrong. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s not my intent. My intent is to give you some heavily shaded grey area to this subject. It ain&#39;t easy. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just telling what I&#39;ve heard from other, highly successful Jews. They were the ones who told me some segments of their religion/culture resent Christians. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I appriciate the friendly discourse. Thanks for that. As far as the &quot;X&quot; goes I have no clue. I promise I&#39;ll look into it. But off the top of my head I would imagine they didn&#39;t like Christians. I&#39;d imagine the Jews coming to Ellis by in large would be of European background. And the Jews have had a bad lot under Christian rule. </p>

<p>As far as the math books in Israel goes I would suspect nationalism. Consider the nation is less than 100 years old and was born from the fire and blood of WWII. It may have been an atempt, albeit a negative one, to keep the culture together as so many were fleeing broken nations and families. </p>

<p>As far as the media conspiracy goes, just look at how many politicians in America and Europe are Christians. Do you see many people suggesting there is a Christian conspiracy to control the government? </p>

</blockquote>

<p>America is 75% Christian, so it would be expected that the majority of politicians would be as well. But also at least half of the media conglomerates, wouldn&#39;t you think? </p>

<p>America is 2.2% Jewish. So it would be expected that.....well, less than 5 of the 6 major media conglomerates would be run by Jews (all six if you consider Rupert Murdoch, whose mother is Jewish, Jewish as well). 5% of Congress is Jewish, which is about right in line. </p>

<p>Thomas Edison and others on the East Coast were involved in the early movie business. They would not employ Jews, so the Jews went west and started their own movie studios. </p>

<p>Then Edison and others&#39; studios on the East Coast burned down. The West Coast took over the movie business and never looked back.</p>

<p>The news business, however, is a different story. Most of the early news media oligarchs---Pulitzer, Hearst, Greeley, Raymond, etc.--were not Jewish. </p>

<p>I will simply add this: this discussion doesn’t date back to the 20th century, or even the 19th. It’s much older than that. <a href="https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/v/voltaire/dictionary/chapter287.html">Here is an example from the 18th century.</a></p>

<p>To appreciate this link, one must first be reminded the luminary Voltaire was, and the masterpiece his <em>Dictionnaire Philosophique</em> represents. Indeed it is unquestionably his magnum opus. Also, realize this chapter is absent from most modern editions, including in French. Still, few serious people dare call Voltaire “antisemitic”, as that would likely prove counter-productive, rehabilitating that word instead of dissuading anyone from consulting his work.</p>

<p>Of course most Jews are good people. Saying “men are taller than women” is not sexist, nor does it imply any given man is necessarily taller than any given woman. Similarly, one can recognize certsin cultural traits without that equating with hate, or a call to democide; if neo-Nazis want to exploit certain truths to advance their nefarious agendas, that they’re problem, and it shouldn’t prevent others from engaging in civilized discourse.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a massive conspiracy involving every single Jew on the planet. However I do think Jews are very tribal and very nepotistic people. I think they will always put Jewish interests over the interests of their nation. I&#39;m speaking in broad terms here, not every single individual Jew. I think it&#39;s quite clear that Jews have a lot of institutional power. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s deniable. Because of their massive influence in the media that will reflect how they view society and how they want things to work. Also they have massive influence in the banking industry, the same banking industry that finances massive wars and wrecks the lives of millions. Jews also have a lot of political power that explains why Netanyahu gets like 30 standing ovations in front of Congress as he encourages the United States citizens to send their sons and daughters to fight wars overseas.</p>

<p>As for the Holocaust I think there&#39;s ample amounts of evidence to show it didn&#39;t really happen. First of all I think this is the most damming evidence but there were probably hundreds of articles written well before Hitler came to power detailing how 6 million Jews were starving or 6 million Jews were dying. You can find that information easily. About the Nuremberg Trials I think you should look up what Historian David Irving has to say about this. It&#39;s quite evident that the Germans who spoke at the trials were brutally tortured and forced to say what the USA Britain Soviets wanted them to. Also there may be thousands of eyewitnesses but no Holocaust Denier I know doubts that people in the camps had it rough. Supply lines to the camps were cut off so many of the prisoners were starving and were suffering, it&#39;s just the existence of gas chambers that is questionable. </p>

<p>I could go on all day with this but I hope I answered your question. I consider myself Alt-Right, but I hate no one, I want nobody to suffer or die. I just have my criticisms of Israel because of their support for the Yinon Plan and the Kalergi Plan, I think it&#39;s just harmful for whites to accept so much Jewish influence. Jews have been persecuted a lot by Europeans throughout history, that is true but people hardly look at the other side of the coin. I think it&#39;s best if we separate, our races, our cultures are incompatible over the long run I think it&#39;s best we separate and I don&#39;t want things to get violent or bad. But it is kind of scary how Israel always has the Samson option in their back pocket </p>

<p>The debate is made possible by the fact no order, plan or budget was ever found for the Holocaust; and by the fact much of the evidence admitted in Nuremberg has since then been discredited as Soviet wartime propaganda; the fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haavara_Agreement">the Zionist Federation of Germany made a deal with Hitler in 1933</a>, which greatly helped rebuild Germany’s war industry, also throws a wrench in the orthodoxy taught in primary schools worldwide.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The way I understand it, generally it means a certain sort of person similarly associated with TPTB. The assumed controllers of the vast amounts of wealth and weavers of the financial web that spans the globe are the Rothschilds and their ilk. To add, the way I understand it, this would also include Israel, as per the Balfour Declaration and events leading up to WW1 ( of course there is much more to understand prior to this ) and their goals for a Greater Israel, fomenting plans that have supposedly been laid out for more than a century. The problem lies more in who is actually occupying Israel than simply &quot;Jews&quot;. They are Judaic in their belief and their way of life following Kabbalah and not even close to the Roman Empire version of Christianity that supposedly intertwines both religions. When taken in that light there is a clear distinction between two worlds (peoples/fundamentals/perceptions) that are vehemently opposed to each other.</p>

<p>I could go on. Suffice to say it&#39;s neither and it&#39;s both. Most use the parenthesis to either state the context without saying it directly, history as some know it as they&#39;ve dug down the rabbit hole like myself, while some use it to be divisive.</p>
