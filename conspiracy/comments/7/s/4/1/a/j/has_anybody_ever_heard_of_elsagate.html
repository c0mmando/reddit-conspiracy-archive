They have been successful in most of our colleges/high schools as well. Social media has made it so much easier for the best manipulators to get ahold of the people. I think it&#39;s working better than even they expected and we&#39;re headed for some interesting times. This is all just my general observation though. </p>

That’s why our own is letting it happen and are not protecting us, why do you think google is censored in China, both to control their citizens, but as well make sure no outside influence causes havoc through manipulating them via internet.
