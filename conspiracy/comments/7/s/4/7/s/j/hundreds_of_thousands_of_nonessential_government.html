        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So said my local news just now.</p>

<p>The first question I have, is why does the federal government have <em>hundreds of thousands</em> of employees they don&#39;t need? Isn&#39;t that what not essential means, unneeded?</p>

<p>Who determines what is essential, and what isn&#39;t? Maybe what&#39;s essential in my life, isn&#39;t essential in Congress&#39;s elevated opinion. I think the US Mail is essential, I think national parks are essential. </p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands? How many hundreds of thousands? Two hundred thousand, nine hundred thousand? They&#39;re always really fuzzy about the numbers.</p>

<p>This is a scam. The whole thing is an update on P.T. Barnum&#39;s famous quote, “There&#39;s a sucker born every minute.” </p>

<p>Congress defines an essential employee as &quot;an employee that performs work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property&quot;. </p>

<p>How many people don&#39;t fit that definition? Does that make them useless? Why would you be glad that all those people aren&#39;t getting paid? Have you no empathy?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can give examples real quick.....</p>

<p>I work at a school house that trains military.
We have about 80 instructors (mix of govt employees and contractors and active military) who rotate thru different duties. Example you might teach classes for 2 or 3 three week....then you do other duties like update curriculum and do maintenenace on the training systems.....stuff like that </p>

<p>At any given time maybe 40-50 instructors are teaching classes - they are essential because we cannot slow down the training for the students.</p>

<p>The other 30 or so - if they are &quot;busy&quot; updating curriculum - they will be considered non essential and they will be given time off because....we &quot;could possibly&quot; continue to teach with current curriculum for a few weeks until the budget is approved. But if it goes too long - it would be a very bad thing to teach students old stuff for months or years straight.</p>

<p>The curriculum maintainers are vital. They are important to success of the school house long term. But they are not essential on monday-tuesday.... jan 21 or 22. We could take a few days off that task and catch up in a few days if needed.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. </p>

<p>When you combine it all up. </p>

<p>Federal income tax, State income tax, Property tax, and sales tax will easily get most middle class Americans to 50%. </p>

<p>Then add in all the other taxes, FCC taxes when you pay your cable bill or internet bill. EPA taxes when you pay your gas and electricity bills. </p>

<p>One a car? License, registration, and tax on gas (~50 cents a gallon). </p>

<p>And that doesn&#39;t even factor in luxury taxes, like owning a boat, or a gun, or fishing, or owning a business. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is also what I call the &quot;bread tax&quot;. </p>

<ul>
<li>A farmer buys some land pays taxes on it.</li>
<li>The same farmer buys seeds and pays taxes on them. The same for pesticides, any workers, equipment, etc.</li>
<li>The wheat is then sold to someone to turn it into flour and it is taxed.</li>
<li>The flour is then sold to someone who turns it into bread and it is taxed.</li>
<li>The bread is then sold to a wholesaler and it is taxed.</li>
<li>The bread is then sold to a business and it is taxed.</li>
<li>Someone buys the bread and it is taxed.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m calling bullshit. Prior to the new tax law, you could deduct most if not all of your state taxes from your federal income taxes thus making it virtually impossible for your total taxes paid to exceed that of your top fed income tax bracket. The only way you could get yourself into a scenario where you are paying over 60% of what you earn is if you took on a shit ton of debt that vastly exceeded your income and spent it all thus wracking up a bunch of consumption taxes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Small business taxes are a lot different then personal income tax when you work for someone else. </p>

<p>A while back I had a bad year, made only $28,000 total profit (after all deductions that year) and still had to pay $1,800 in quarterly. And that was only federal. I still had to pay state income (SSBT) of 4.8%, and a city tax of 2.4%. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that the $1,800 quarterly was <em>after</em> state and local tax was deducted. </p>

<p>So I made $28,0000</p>

<p>Paid $700 for city taxes. </p>

<p>Then $1,300 in state income taxes. </p>

<p>Leaving me with $26,000</p>

<p>Then $7,200 in federal business taxes (MC, Income, Payroll, and SS) ~27% tax rate. </p>

<p>Or $9,200 a year on $28,000 just in <em>Income</em> tax. </p>

<p>Or 32% of my income in gone for <em>income</em> tax. </p>

<p>I also pay $265 a month in property taxes, Or $3,180</p>

<p>My city passed a school millage that is $280 every 6 months, or $560 a year. </p>

<p>My truck gets 16 MPG and I drive 11,000 miles a year, or $350 in gas tax. </p>

<hr/>

<p>At this point I am at $13,230 in taxes, on $28,000. OR 47%</p>

<p>Now add in EPA taxes (Water, electricity, gas) , FAA taxes (Cell, internet, cable), </p>

<p>Fly on a plane or travel? FAA taxes, DoT taxes, TSA taxes, tourism taxes. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Then add 6% sales tax on every other dollar I spend in a year. </p>

<p>It can easily get to 60%</p>

<p>If your deemed important to the running of the real mission you work. This usually just means a skeleton crew of people in each shop. Same thing happens on snow days. :)</p>

<p>I was deployed during one that almost happened in 2011 and we joked about not showing up, but we had to. For guard workers you don&#39;t go unless the government is open, I had alot of airmen wishing for a govt shutdown to skip drill lol. Also, My ex was working as a civilian gov worker and didn&#39;t get his contact renewed and was furloughed because they lost the funding for it with the shutdown.

    <div class="md"><p>Small business taxes are a lot different then personal income tax when you work for someone else. </p>

<p>A while back I had a bad year, made only $28,000 total profit (after all deductions that year) and still had to pay $1,800 in quarterly. And that was only federal. I still had to pay state income (SSBT) of 4.8%, and a city tax of 2.4%. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that the $1,800 quarterly was <em>after</em> state and local tax was deducted. </p>

<p>So I made $28,0000</p>

<p>Paid $700 for city taxes. </p>

<p>Then $1,300 in state income taxes. </p>

<p>Leaving me with $26,000</p>

<p>Then $7,200 in federal business taxes (MC, Income, Payroll, and SS) ~27% tax rate. </p>

<p>Or $9,200 a year on $28,000 just in <em>Income</em> tax. </p>

<p>Or 32% of my income in gone for <em>income</em> tax. </p>

<p>I also pay $265 a month in property taxes, Or $3,180</p>

<p>My city passed a school millage that is $280 every 6 months, or $560 a year. </p>

<p>My truck gets 16 MPG and I drive 11,000 miles a year, or $350 in gas tax. </p>

<hr/>

<p>At this point I am at $13,230 in taxes, on $28,000. OR 47%</p>

<p>Now add in EPA taxes (Water, electricity, gas) , FAA taxes (Cell, internet, cable), </p>

<p>Fly on a plane or travel? FAA taxes, DoT taxes, TSA taxes, tourism taxes. </p>

<hr/>

<p>Then add 6% sales tax on every other dollar I spend in a year. </p>

<p>It can easily get to 60%</p>
