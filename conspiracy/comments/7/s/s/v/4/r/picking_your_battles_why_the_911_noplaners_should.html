        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is clear that 3 WTC buildings collapsed on 9/11.  According to the official recored, they were the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd steel-frame buildings to experience total collapse due to fire.  They also became the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd buildings of any kind to collapse symmetrically due to fire.  This scenario is all just to unlikely to take on good faith from anybody, let alone the American Government!  And even if you thought the American Government were generally trustworthy and transparent with the people, would you trust anybody who was investigating himself?</p>

<p>I believe that the facts above are both easy to demonstrate--using mainstream sources, no less--and sufficient to motivate a substantial block of the populace, especially those of us who were too young to make our own opinions about 9/11 when it happened, to put in at least the time to, say, sign an online petition calling for an independent, international investigation into 9/11.  I go to a &quot;prestigious university&quot; and not a single person that I have talked to about 9/11 (about 10) had ever even heard of WTC-7.  One particularly skeptical though rational friend of mine said that in the 10-minute crash course I gave him in 9/11 conspiracy theory, he updated his personal probability that it was an inside job from 0% to 25%!</p>

<p>So way bother arguing that there were no planes!?  The burden of proof is so much higher than what I wrote above, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Sidebar: something crazy I noticed the other day (I&#39;m new to the rabbit hole, sorry) was that the fact that jet fuel can&#39;t melt steel beams is apparently one of these &quot;memes&quot; now?  The result of this is that you literally cannot bring it up as an argument because that argument has been associated so strongly with 1) humor and 2) tin-hat conspiracy theory.</p>

<p>Peace everybody!</p>

<p>EDIT: My post is meant to be strategic advice, not a stance on planes.  I am about to watch a no-planes documentary now, but thought my perspective approaching it without knowing the mechanisms would provide insight into what a no-planes theory might sound like to somebody who doesn&#39;t yet know its details.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely no Pentagon plane.  Haven&#39;t looked into the no-planes angle for the Twin Towers, but it is from that perspective that I noticed what was meant to be the insight of my post: you can get to the same message across without invoking the planes.  Most people will respond to the &quot;no-planes&quot; thing by insisting that they &quot;saw the planes on tv.&quot;  It&#39;s a whole thing to explain to somebody who is at that level of awareness how the same hoax videos would end up airing on all their &quot;news&quot; channels.

<p>DEFINITELY don&#39;t bring that up when trying to convince others because of the burden of proof. But for YOU, please research further, planes did not hit the two towers.</p>

<p>There is a lot of info on the fact the the aluminum cone nose of the aircraft actually penetrates the entire building when that could not be possible. It was cgi. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, I stand corrected, I had done a lot of research and must have seen something misleading that lead me to believe what I said. I had not seen these angles presented. I am now going to reopen my research (unfortunately) and start with what I saw before that led me to believe there were no planes. The one I saw showed 3 or 4 videos of people conveniently panning away right as the plane hit, but didn&#39;t show the angles you presented here.</p>

<p>The video you posted clearly shows a plane from multiple 3rd party sources which supposedly didn&#39;t exist according to what I saw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The argument for that is the nose goes completely through the building at multiple angles, which would not be possible for commercial 747.</p>

<p>There are a few too many angles of the second impact to argue that a plane did not hit it. It is true that it did not seem like a typical commercial airliner. If it was designed with that purpose in mind I would not be surprised, because I believe the plan was to destroy the towers before they were even built. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think this is the right idea.  Generally, the best way to turn people on to conspiracies is not to prove to them the mechanism by which they operated: the whole point is that its secretive, and the arguments here get down in the technical weeds, divorced from the larger topic. Whatever your theory is, there are going to be unknown facts.  Focusing on the inadequacy of the official investigation, and the need for a new one, are just as important and useful steps regardless of what you think actually happened.  The overarching question of &quot;who benefitted? Why would they do this?&quot; is also separate from the actual mechanism that brought down the towers.  For people just beginning to question the narrative, my opinion is getting too deep into details distracts them from the issue, and makes it easier for seemingly authoritative figures to rebut your theories.</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I think the no-plane argument is in part promoted by the groups behind 9/11, to make questioning the narrative easier to dismiss.  There&#39;s plenty of evidence now that the plane hijackers were supported by Saudi Intelligence and had indirect connections to the CIA.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is what makes me uncertain about it as well. There&#39;s a good YouTube video about 10 mins that I watched years ago that blew my mind. Also all the videos of the plans crashing have the video looking down and then pan up to see the plan for 1 second before hitting the plan. In one of the videos when the camera pans up, you see a clock on a building and it&#39;s different from the time the plane actually hit.</p>

<p>I still don&#39;t know what to believe 100%, but there was a controlled demolition. Pentagon did not get hit by a plane.</p>

Or the video that shows a nose-cone emerging from the other side of where the tower was impacted? Whats more probable? A glorified aluminum can with a plastic tip going straight through 10 inches of hardened steel (this is just the outer columns) plus reinforced concrete and I-beams and whatever else in its path, literally unscathed.

    <div class="md"><p>Excert from a text describing Operation Northwoods (part of which included plans to use remotely controlled aircraft to warrant action against Cuba):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lemnitzer and the Joint Chiefs worked out a complex deception:</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An aircraft at Elgin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CJA proprietary organization in the Miami area. At a designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with the selected passengers, all boarded under carefully prepared aliases. The actual registered aircraft would be converted to a drone [a remotely controlled unmanned aircraft]. Take off times of the drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida.</p>

<p>From the rendezvous point the passenger-carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Elgin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status. The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan. When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on the international distress frequency a &quot;May Day&quot; message stating he is under attack by Cuban MiG aircraft. The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft, which will be triggered by radio signal. This will allow ICAO [International Civil Aviation Organization radio stations in the Western Hemisphere to tell the U.S. what has happened to the aircraft instead of the U.S. trying to &quot;sell&quot; the incident.</p>

<p>Can agree. No absolutes from me, but why not just go for something that has already been concocted at some point? </p>

<p>I believe that the commercial jets that hit the towers were switched out over Stewarts AFB with 747&#39;s flown remotely. It explains a lot about the speed and some of the aircraft&#39;s movement.

    <div class="md"><p>CG planes (ie. Mossad altering footage and feeding it to the media) were used on 911, as well as nukes to demolish the towers. I find it easier to argue for CG planes rather than the nuclear demolition.</p>

<p>911 was a cheap magic trick - only bad magicians use CG. Want proof that CG footage was used?</p>

<p>A Pentagon employee crawled through the hole and saw no evidence of a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIy9hjB3DGk</a></p>

<p>Major General Stubblebine confirms that the wreckage at the pentagon is consistent with a missile and not a plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jc1ql4TfCZw</a></p>

<p>This WTC witness insists it was a bomb, no plane:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bq1-BCeNcm0</a></p>

<p>These firemen said they counted 3 explosions. The Police/FBI are reported to have attributed this to vans with explosives in the WTC basement:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfxkcBmZfK0</a></p>

<p>You can also see raw footage (ie. not altered to show a CG plane) that shows the missile impacting the WTC (no plane):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5wF74zTLjNg</a></p>

<p>You can see a comparison showing the NBC footage showing no plane was digitally altered to show a plane (as well as adjust the colors to make the buildings appeared white and sky blue for increased psychological impact):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPKq2K2dh6k</a></p>

<p>The altered footage in some cases is obviously fake, for example tiling smoke:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkzfKRe0gbc</a></p>

<p>But what wasn&#39;t CG was the explosions and the plane cutout shape they created. You can see those small explosions here (6 minute mark):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT1z90BB8E4&amp;amp;feature=endscreen&amp;amp;NR=1</a></p>

<p>The cutting charges were planted by Israeli Mossad posing as art students who rented a whole floor and got construction permits at the site, and made a temporary balcony. They even made a book about their &quot;art&quot; - which showed them standing next to boxes and boxes of explosives fuses in the WTC!</p>

<p>Mossad agents filmed the missile impacts/explosions (to add CG planes later and pass on to media) and later went up to the roof to plant radio jamming devices. They were arrested and this is documented by the FBI. There was traces of explosives in their van and they were set up filming BEFORE the attack:</p>

<p>Let me stress that again, the FBI arrested dancing Israelis on 911, not muslims. They refused to take lie detector tests for months, and when they did, they failed. So much of that FBI report is redacted, proof positive of guilt.</p>

<p>They needed to fake plane impacts because a real plane would be shredded by the WTC like cheese through a grater. That&#39;s why when the Transasia plane collided with a taxi, the wing broke off, and the taxi wasn&#39;t sliced in half at all:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQ29Zr7wWnw</a></p>

<p>According to a WTC architect in a 80s interview, the impact of a plane (300 tonnes) is nothing compared to the 13,000 tonnes of force trying to push the WTC over simply because of its enormous surface area.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E15GbdVaV-Q</a></p>

<p>WTC project management engineer atttests the buildings could survive multiple plane impacts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fQlC2AIWrY</a></p>

<p>The WTC designers did a study for 600mph-1 impact which showed the towers would easily withstand the 911 attack.</p>

<p>Someone planted an engine (though wrong make) to further the plane deception:</p>

<p><a href="/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/">/r/conspiracy/comments/34o4y0/911_engine_that_shot_out_of_the_south_tower_was/</a></p>

<p>Essentially the media got punked by Israel, because journalists just report what they&#39;re told. You can see another example of newscasters being fooled by a movie set into thinking it&#39;s a real plane accident. At the 7 minute mark in this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wozTHxykDwQ</a></p>

<p>The larger 911 plan required the destruction of the Washington bridge and Lincoln tunnel. That would take out the fiber optic cables linked to stock market/banking, markets would have crashed and there would be martial law introduced. You can see this TV report on the other Israeli vans that were intercepted, one of them exploded:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmpWe2Rhi_I</a></p>

<p>Israeli companies moved out of the building months before the attack. Israelis in America were warned in advance through an Israeli messaging service:</p>

<p>Hundreds of Israelis were flown out of America, despite a flight ban, to avoid them being arrested by the FBI, including the &quot;art students&quot;:</p>

<p>Israel is the almost only country that benefited from the September 11 th attacks. In the words of Netanyahu, &quot;it&#39;s good for Israel&quot;.</p>

<p>Thermite is a substance made of aluminium powder and iron oxide(rust) the twin towers were steel structures with aluminium cladding, steel is a term used for iron to which between 0.2 to 1.7% carbon has been added typical low-carbon steel (eg astm a36) contains 99% iron,</p>

<p>We know that a large portion of the towers was turned to dust , and iron dust in atmospheric conditions will immediately rust, so it is natural and to be expected that materials that the buildings were made of would be found in the nano-dust of there remains,</p>

<p>What caused the building to collapse is the airplane fuel and the fire-suppression system that we now have, which basically blocks off five-floor blocks, so the fire can’t go up and the fire can’t go down. You now have a fire confined to a five-floor area, burning at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. <strong>The steel in that five-floor area melts.</strong> All the tonnage above the five-floor area comes straight down when the steel melts.

<blockquote>
<p>the engineers and the architects have studied this thing in extraordinary detail, and they can tell you precisely what caused the collapse of those buildings. <strong>What caused the collapse of the buildings</strong>, to summarize it, <strong>was that the super-heated jet fuel melted the steel super-structure of these buildings and caused their collapse.</strong> There’s a powerful lot of evidence to sustain that point of view, including the pictures of the airplanes flying into the building. <em>:: 9/11 Commission co-chair Lee Hamilton in an interview with Evan Solomon for CBC&#39;s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070108233707/http://www.cbc.ca/sunday/911hamilton.html">9/11: Truth, Lies and Conspiracy</a>, August 2006</em></p>
