       Just look at the pathetic performance of Android call blockers, for example. You see blocking specific numbers or area codes, but since numbers can be chosen randomly with each new call that's ineffective.

       Protecting your borders is important, the borders to your house and your mind. If there is a way to reliably get past my border, something is going to be done about it. Communication is what puts us above monkeys, and when the tools of communication are threatened we are threatened on the level of losing some of what puts us above monkeys, so I say it is more important than murder.

       I did some research today after thinking about this. I have a Nokia Windows Phone 8.1. Just for giggles I thought I'd try making my own call filtering app for it.

       I've done something similar to the iPhone. I've added everyone who isn't in my contacts a silent non vibrate ringtone. That gets 90% of them unless I am using my phone when the call comes in. When driving it still rings on my handless in car setup. I wish we could block from the carrier side. That is what I meant by whitelist. Give the carrier the numbers you want to receive calls from and the rest is dropped/blocked. Like a firewall. I look at my call log and I have 2-5 calls a day from spoofed numbers. Most of these are not noticed with my homemade whitelist but again that 10% is annoying. Not to mention that the scam calls spoofing phone numbers should be illegal and blocked by the carrier.

       Telecoms haven't made money from voice calls in a long time.
      </p>
      <p>
       A lot of countries have very strict rules about how calls can be made, and what the line appearance is on the other end.

      <p>
       I understand US laws are very lenient.

       The only conspiracy here is that those who make robocalls just want to robocall you even more. This is something telecom companies could really give 2 shits about.

       Freedom mobile in Canada allows robocalls (in my case collections trying to reach one of the previous holders of my number) to go directly to your voicemail, blocking androids ability to block their calls.

       I don't answer my phone unless I recognize the number, unless it's already in my contacts. If I've never talked on the phone with you before, then you should leave a message. If you don't leave a message telling me who you are and why you called, then it's obviously not important and I don't need to worry about it.

       I keep my phone on silent all the time, actually. I don't receive phone calls from my contacts much anyway and it works fine for me that way. Also, it's pretty easy to set it up to play a unique sound when a contact calls but be silent if it's not a number in the contacts.

       Doesn’t matter how many times you block , another calls right after it. I called the number back once. It was a girl in New Mexico and when she answered she immediately said , “ Stop calling me! I said my credit card rate is fucking fine!” I explained that I was calling a robocall back. She was shocked. We compared the calls to our phone logs. It was a bizarre experience to say the least.

       I heard this on NPR. Because of an old FCC rule that comes from deregulation, they can't. Telecoms must route all calls. There's a code that identifies the station that originated the call, which can be spoofed, and the phone number, which can be spoofed, and the telecoms know about this but they must route the call regardless because of this FCC rule. T-mobile has been tagging these calls as "SCAM LIKELY" but they are still required by law to route the call. If you care about this issue, please tell your senators and email whatever house committee controls this and let them know that there's no point in keeping this law around anymore, and Telcom companies need to have the power to preemptively block calls that don't have valid station codes.

       The problem is not the calls get to my phone. The problem is the inability for apps to give them a captcha test or call them back on their own number if it happens to be real, and only if they pass that then ring my phone.

       I don't see how that's any different from letting calls go to voicemail and then calling people back. Just turn the ringer off on your phone. That's probably why nobody has made an app like this. It's got nothing to do with the phone, unless you're asserting that there's something stopping an app from automatically answering all incoming calls silently, interacting with the caller, and then sending you an alert that a call is connected that has passed your test. At least I don't know of anything Android related that would prevent this. Can you be more specific?

       What's the conspiracy? Title makes it seems like there's some scheme by phone manufacturers to prevent effective call blocking. I thought maybe OP was going to tell us about some hardware or firmware features designed to circumvent blocking. But the complaint seems to be "no one has made a good app for that." That's annoying, sure, but it's more a sign that there's no real market for such apps than any kind of conspiracy.

       One way blockers are defeated is by Android automatically sending anything blocked (not answered for any reason) to voicemail (where you either listen to it or accidentally delete other useful voicemails). So I dont check voicemails anymore and let it get full and stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also maybe indirectly related, androids on cell networks appear to be firewalled against accepting incoming network packets that they didnt first send out for (ServerSocket).

       I've done something similar to the iPhone. I've added everyone who isn't in my contacts a silent non vibrate ringtone. That gets 90% of them unless I am using my phone when the call comes in. When driving it still rings on my handless in car setup. I wish we could block from the carrier side. That is what I meant by whitelist. Give the carrier the numbers you want to receive calls from and the rest is dropped/blocked. Like a firewall. I look at my call log and I have 2-5 calls a day from spoofed numbers. Most of these are not noticed with my homemade whitelist but again that 10% is annoying. Not to mention that the scam calls spoofing phone numbers should be illegal and blocked by the carrier.
