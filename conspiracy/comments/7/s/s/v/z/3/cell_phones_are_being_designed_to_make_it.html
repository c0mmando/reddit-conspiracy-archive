    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done something similar to the iPhone. I&#39;ve added everyone who isn&#39;t in my contacts a silent non vibrate ringtone. That gets 90% of them unless I am using my phone when the call comes in. When driving it still rings on my handless in car setup. I wish we could block from the carrier side. That is what I meant by whitelist. Give the carrier the numbers you want to receive calls from and the rest is dropped/blocked. Like a firewall. I look at my call log and I have 2-5 calls a day from spoofed numbers. Most of these are not noticed with my homemade whitelist but again that 10% is annoying. Not to mention that the scam calls spoofing phone numbers should be illegal and blocked by the carrier. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I heard this on NPR. Because of an old FCC rule that comes from deregulation, they can&#39;t. Telecoms must route all calls. There&#39;s a code that identifies the station that originated the call, which can be spoofed, and the phone number, which can be spoofed, and the telecoms know about this but they must route the call regardless because of this FCC rule. T-mobile has been tagging these calls as &quot;SCAM LIKELY&quot; but they are still required by law to route the call. If you care about this issue, please tell your senators and email whatever house committee controls this and let them know that there&#39;s no point in keeping this law around anymore, and Telcom companies need to have the power to preemptively block calls that don&#39;t have valid station codes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What&#39;s the conspiracy? Title makes it seems like there&#39;s some scheme by phone manufacturers to prevent effective call blocking. I thought maybe OP was going to tell us about some hardware or firmware features designed to circumvent blocking. But the complaint seems to be &quot;no one has made a good app for that.&quot; That&#39;s annoying, sure, but it&#39;s more a sign that there&#39;s no real market for such apps than any kind of conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>One way blockers are defeated is by Android automatically sending anything blocked (not answered for any reason) to voicemail (where you either listen to it or accidentally delete other useful voicemails). So I dont check voicemails anymore and let it get full and stop.</p>

<p>Also maybe indirectly related, androids on cell networks appear to be firewalled against accepting incoming network packets that they didnt first send out for (ServerSocket).</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_9-1-1">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enhanced_9-1-1</a> is a DRM system hooked into all cell phones in USA.</p>

<p>We might need to make multiple calls at once to check if a number should be allowed to pass through to Human attention.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok, so I am 100% all about privacy, security, and technology that respects the user&#39;s rights. I <em>still</em> don&#39;t understand what your complaint is, and I&#39;m coming from a greater than average technical background. If you want to get people on board with this, you need to clearly articulate what you think is happening, and what you think should happen instead, and why.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done something similar to the iPhone. I&#39;ve added everyone who isn&#39;t in my contacts a silent non vibrate ringtone. That gets 90% of them unless I am using my phone when the call comes in. When driving it still rings on my handless in car setup. I wish we could block from the carrier side. That is what I meant by whitelist. Give the carrier the numbers you want to receive calls from and the rest is dropped/blocked. Like a firewall. I look at my call log and I have 2-5 calls a day from spoofed numbers. Most of these are not noticed with my homemade whitelist but again that 10% is annoying. Not to mention that the scam calls spoofing phone numbers should be illegal and blocked by the carrier. </p>
