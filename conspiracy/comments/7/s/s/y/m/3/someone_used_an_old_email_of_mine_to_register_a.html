        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Curious to know what you guys think about this. I was going through an old hotmail account I no longer use when I came across an e-mail from Reddit asking me to verify my e-mail for a username I had never seen before in my life. I checked out the username and they are an extremely active user on the_D, and post pretty much exclusively there. I decided to type the username into google to see what came up. Usual stuff, their profile page and some posts they had made. And then their profile page came up again, except it was under the Russian version of reddit, <a href="http://ru.reddit.co/">http://ru.reddit.co/</a>.
The user in question claims to be an old lady from Texas. Their username bears no similarity to my hotmail account in any way, so it&#39;s not some accidental misspelling.</p>

<p>Has anyone else had anything like this happen to them? Am I reading too much into this? Is the_D genuinely swarming with Russian trolls?</p>

<p>edit: It is no longer possible to hijack the account, there&#39;s no e-mail associated with it anymore according to Reddit. Believe me it was the first thing I tried!</p>

<p>edit2: I also found the username on a pastebin full of the_d users, like thousands. What might this be used for?</p>

Literally every week or so I get Instagram, Facebook, PayPal, all kinds of accounts that they sign up with her email. Today it was this place called Life 360. Anyway, since we have access to her email account, we can ask for password resets and we do it all the time and hijack the accounts.</p>

Somebody on the new account with Ticketmaster, and that was yet another unique person. Today somebody opened a Life360 account with her email address. That was somebody new altogether.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I got into her account, and was instantly able to see the phone numbers and email addresses for everyone in her family.  I could see their present location, since the app tracks everyone.  I knew she was at home (and had her address) and her daughter was at school.  I saw a list of everywhere they&#39;d gone today.  I could see the group chats between phones.  No way I&#39;d ever sign up for this.</p>

<p>I contacted Life360 to warn them of the security issue. They just shut down the account.</p>

<p>This was my text exchange with her.  The first and only time, I might add, that anyone has emailed or texted me back when I was able to determine their phone or email.</p>

Like you said, you were able to get her phone number and location. That is really odd. And then to lie and say it used to be her email. Really suspicious and weird, on her part.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve just been amazed that there are places that don&#39;t require an email confirmation.  For instance, PayPal.  Someone signed up for a PayPal account with her email, and was able to do it.  For that one, I had to call PayPal, and if you can convince them, their &quot;solution&quot; is to shut down the account and prevent anyone, ever, from using that email address again. So, my wife can never have a PayPal account with her email address.</p>

<p>To be fair, there are a LOT of times when she gets an email confirmation and simply ignores it, or clicks &quot;this isn&#39;t me&quot;.  </p>

<p>The thing that gets me is for services like Nest cameras (this happened when it was called DropCam). Wife wakes up to find several &quot;Welcome to DropCam&quot; emails, <em>including</em> the &quot;please verify your email address.&quot; She, of course, doesn&#39;t. I get in, use the &quot;lost password&quot; feature and reset it, so I have control of this person&#39;s DropCam account. There&#39;s the woman&#39;s camera, and I can watch her go about her day. All I can tell from the account is she&#39;s in California.</p>

<p>I actually called DropCam, to warn them about some kind of vulnerability, and their response was &quot;Impossible!&quot;. Basically told me the first thing you have to do before anything else, like adding info or a camera, is to verify your email address. Would NOT listen to me that somehow, this woman had verified her account. So, I tried it. I could NOT set up an account without verifying email address. I even tried things like setting up and account with my email, and then changing the email to something else. It would not let me continue until I verified the new email address.</p>

<p>The only thing I can think of is that someone DID access her gmail to verify the email address. But that same day, I checked the IPs that gmail was accessed from, there was no access overnight.  There was no access at any time from IP addresses other than our house and her work.  She did not leave herself logged in at work, and besides, this woman was across the country.</p>

<p>A while back, she got one from snapchat, and doing a little digging, I found it appears to be the same woman whose instagram account I hijacked a while back. So, now I&#39;ve hijacked her instagram and her snapchat account by changing the passwords, both are loaded with pics, and my wife never gets the &quot;reset password&quot; emails from when that woman wants to get in later and can&#39;t.  It&#39;s like she sets up the account and then abandons it without a fight. </p>

<p>It&#39;s just a mystery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>lmao, you&#39;re looking too far into this.  I know/work with a guy that provides &quot;shilling&quot; services.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>They have never been paid or used for political campaigns.</p></li>
<li><p>Email is completely unnecessary.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>When they make the accounts, they don&#39;t use email or they buy a domain/mailserver (for accounts that will frequently post) OR they buy aged accounts.</p>

<p>There is absolutely nothing a &quot;shill&quot; could gain from using a fake email address, in fact it would be ridiculously dumb.</p>

<p>I just talked to the guy and he said no testing they&#39;ve done has ever indicated that adding an email address is better/worse for an account, the biggest factors are simply age and karma and generally looking authentic.</p>

<p>If you PM the name I can tell you (ask my friend) if the account is a shill or not.  In all my years I&#39;ve never heard of them doing anything political.  Its always just some blackhat &quot;promotion&quot;, they aren&#39;t some small business either, it brings in serious money.  I can ask more about the political stuff but its something we&#39;ve discussed several times and he&#39;s always laughed it off saying it would be pointless.</p>

<p>I have no doubt there are enough people to <em>legitimately</em> post in support for both parties.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can shoot him a PM, he&#39;s mostly libertarian/anti government in general, so I trust him when he says he hasn&#39;t got any political clients/contracts.</p>

<p>Not sure what I could say though, I mean, while he does tell me a lot about the day to day operations, not sure if he would just give out info that could compromise his business.  </p>

<p>He told me he doesn&#39;t care if I tell anyone the stuff he tells me though cause it &quot;won&#39;t change anything&quot;, lmao guess that&#39;s why he&#39;s never really mentioned anything technical about the bots/shilling, mostly just general stuff.</p>

<p>I will say this, we were having a laugh about the whole &quot;Trump=Russia&quot; conspiracy and he mentioned how reddit is so pressed that there&#39;s Russian shills everywhere, he said while its not good it brings a spotlight to botting/shilling he said he is glad people are so off the mark, saying that the bots ppl see are probably just farming in political subs instead of image subs.</p>

<p>But yea, now I&#39;m a bit more interested.  I do financial/programming stuff for him and he&#39;s a cool but weird dude, gotta figure out how to ask and be transparent but get answers at the same time.  He&#39;s a bit cocky sometimes and likes to &quot;brag&quot; about his bots so maybe he won&#39;t mind lmao</p>

<p>If you have anything specific I could ask lemme know.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Let him know that we are not trying to expose any particular business. Industry insiders are welcome there. It&#39;s just a place to share information for anyone who has an interest. He can censor any identifiable information he wants, and he can even use a throwaway account.</p>

<p>What has worked out really well in the past is the shill will give one of the moderators (only 1 is necessary) some kind of proof of what they do, then the mod will post a sticky comment telling the community that OP is verified. They don&#39;t need to publicly post any proof, just a direct message to at least one mod with something so we know they are legit. </p>

<p>If he is sketched out about proving anything even to a mod, then the thread will just be unverified. We will still allow it though. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>nice, will let him know and see what he thinks.  I don&#39;t really have a dog in that fight but I wonder if it would even be in &quot;their&quot; best interest to dispel any rumors, sending ppl on a wild chase and dis-info seem to be in their favor, lmao but that&#39;s just my two cents</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had this reddit account for over 4 years. Sometime in 2016, I think, I lost my verified email badge. I can&#39;t remember my password or which account I used to set it up. I&#39;m on an old Android, and the redditisfun app keeps me logged in. Idk if I&#39;d want to verify this account anymore. </p>
