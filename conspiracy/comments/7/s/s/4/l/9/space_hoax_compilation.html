       Science isn't an institution, it's a method. State your hypothesis, show your evidence, work up to proof.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the method is followed, it doesn't matter whether it's a scientist in a federally funded lab, or a student in a university, or a guy at home with a pen, paper and some mathematics.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the work is valid, and the conclusion supports the evidence then I trust it.

       I’m not saying all science is bad. Science is not an institution but it is used by institutions to deceive the masses. When Science is used to enforce a political agenda; one should be very cautious in trusting the information it produces.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have all seen this agenda at play. Let us not pretend science has not been used against us.

       That's my point. Regardless of institution, if the evidence is empirical and measurable and the results can be reproduced then it is trustable.

       There is nothing empirical in a quantum reality. Light can exist as a particle and a wave simultaneously. The intent of the scientist can actually skew the results. This is proven in the double split experiment in quantum physics.

       I need to read up on quantum mechanics even though every time I try I just get lost in the weeds. There's so much fundamental science you need to have knowledge of just to be able to get a grasp on the big picture.

       Look at the experiments that suggest what a scientist believes will happen actually affect the results of the experiment.
      </p>

       You are plenty smart enough to understand whatever you want. You already have the truth in your subconscious mind. You just have to unlock it. Don’t get caught in the weeds. try alternative methods.

       Many of the most brilliant minds had “Eureka” moments where the answer they were looking for just came to them in an instant. I find meditation helpful.

       It’s important to use both hemispheres of your mind. It looks like you have a sound scientific mind, but also use your creative side to help unlock the wisdom.

       Nope not proven.  The very fact that the observer effect is a thing means that measurement is implied.  Why the hell wouldnt measuring small systems interfere with the natural state of things.

       So do you believe that light can exist as a particle and a wave simultaneously? Is plasma the aether that the ancient philosophers spoke about? Is our universe driven by Newtonian principles or is it truly quantum and electric in nature. Both? Is there objective reality or is life a quantum dream? What say you good sir?

      <p>
       The double-slit experiment has absolutely nothing to do with intent, the photons in the experiment aren't changing their behavior because of the intent of the observer. It's because in order to take any sort of data about an object you have to physically interact with that object, what the double-slit experiment found was that physically measuring the properties of a photon switches the photon from having the properties of a wave to having the properties of a particle. It isn't intent that changes its behavior, it's having the photon interact with another physical object.

       Again, in order to observe a particle, you have to physically interact with it. Interaction in order to measure quantities is what is being referred to as "observation" in the article you linked and that interaction is what collapses the wave function and makes photons act like particles.

       The brain is a quantum electric computer and DNA acts more like a receiver than a coder. Our brain is like an antenna that picks up consciousness and we are capable of picking up different frequencies that contain higher knowledge. I have experienced this personally and their is scientific evidence that suggests this is the case as well.

       It's not the "intent," or you later claim of "belief". It's the observation. Imagine if the only way you could observe what a beach ball was doing was throw another beachball at it. Obviously this would skew the outcomes since you are throwing beachballs around and messing with the beachballs you're observing. This is the same with photons.

       Basically modern mainstream science, every field, is the same as for profit healthcare, or for profit prisons, or the american cancer society, or the american diabetes association or the mainstream media... the opposite of what they claim to be... flawed, corrupt, for profit, full of lies, twisted by agendas, and has absolutely nothing to do with objective truth or the true practice of the scientific method.

       Look at modern archaeology for example, mainstream archaeologists, have been involved in the active cover up of our true history and origins in ancient Egypt, South America, the whole planet, under the guise of "science".  Shout out to "Wise Up" youtube channel.

       If you're going to seriously claim that every field of modern science is for-profit, corrupt and agenda-driven then I don't think we can have any sort of discussion.

       Forgive me, I've never actually engaged with flat earth arguments before. But what do you think about some of the classical proofs of the circumference of the earth? Have flat earth advocates attempted to recreate these calculations? It seems to me that this whole argument would be far better served by relying on mathematics than anti-NASA conspiracies -- it's almost always possible to accuse NASA of lying, but not so much math.  And I don't see how either of the following can reasonably be denied by someone who hasn't done the work to recreate them and prove they're incorrect.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Abu Rayhan Biruni (973–1048) used a new method to accurately compute the Earth's circumference, by which he arrived at a value that was close to modern values for the Earth's circumference.[59] His estimate of 6,339.6 km for the Earth radius was only 31.4 km less than the modern mean value of 6,371.0 km.[60] In contrast to his predecessors, who measured the Earth's circumference by sighting the Sun simultaneously from two different locations, Biruni developed a new method of using trigonometric calculations based on the angle between a plain and mountain top. This yielded more accurate measurements of the Earth's circumference and made it possible for a single person to measure it from a single location.[61][62] Biruni's method was intended to avoid "walking across hot, dusty deserts," and the idea came to him when he was on top of a tall mountain in India. From the top of the mountain, he sighted the angle to the horizon which, along with the mountain's height (which he calculated beforehand), allowed him to calculate the curvature of the Earth.[63][64] He also made use of algebra to formulate trigonometric equations and used the astrolabe to measure angles.[65]
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       and more famously but less accurately
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Eratosthenes, a Greek astronomer from Hellenistic Libya (276–194 BC), estimated Earth's circumference around 240 BC. He had heard that in Syene the Sun was directly overhead at the summer solstice whereas in Alexandria it still cast a shadow. Using the differing angles the shadows made as the basis of his trigonometric calculations he estimated a circumference of around 250,000 stades. The length of a 'stade' is not precisely known, but Eratosthenes's figure only has an error of around five to fifteen percent.[25][26][27] Eratosthenes used rough estimates and round numbers, but depending on the length of the stadion, his result is within a margin of between 2% and 20% of the actual meridional circumference, 40,008 kilometres (24,860 mi). Note that Eratosthenes could only measure the circumference of the Earth by assuming that the distance to the Sun is so great that the rays of sunlight are practically parallel.[28]

       I mean, I can see the iridium satellites by their glare when the light hits them right, and the ISS passes overhead regularly, so part of this is just not paying attention on your part.
      </p>
      <p>
       For other satellites, I have to wonder what people think they ought to see. Most satellites orbit at anywhere from 200km to a couple thousand kilometers out, and most of them are small, no bigger than a car. I have to wonder if people really imagine they'd be able to see an unlit car from 200-thousands of kilometers away at night, even if it was planted on a flat earth.

       Well, you could make a timelapse of the night sky - you don't even need particularly fancy equipment for that. You'd get something like this:

       Here's a similar one with the specific satellites indicated, so you can look up the publically released orbits and whether their position matches up with the claim.

       Here's amateur astrophotographers making their own pictures of various satellites, including the ISS &amp; various spacecraft. Can't fake something that random people can do in their backyard.

       Can I ask you a question? How do you take a picture of a satellite? It's in low earth orbit. Furthermore, even if it was easy to take a picture of something in low earth orbit, why would you? What's the point? Trying to prove to some uneducated American that satellites are real? Waste of time and money.

       Haha well I just thought there were thousands flying around and that it wouldn't be too much of a task to shut all of us up for all time by producing a simple picture. It wouldn't take much time or money.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do you take a picture of a satellite? Are you saying it would be impossible?

       No not impossible just a waste of money. Besides someone else already linked to some actual pics of satellites from hobby astronomers.

       If you ever had to set up a satellite dish to receive television you would realize that to say they don't exist is absurd.

       The idea NASA and modern space agencies incoporate lies and CGI is distinct from flat earth.  I think the earth is round, for instance, but also am of the experienced and knowledgable opinion that some of the soace footage youve seen is down right comouter generated and/or augmented reality.

       Sure, it's a rabbit hole and I dont expect this is easy to swallow.  Its true though.

       You don’t understand how these things work. The people that work for these agencies are highly compartmentalized and they never see the bigger picture.

       All they need to do to maintain the hoax is to make sure the astronauts who do go into lower earth orbit keep their mouths shut. With NASA, every single astronaut that went into LEO was a Mason. As you should know, the Masons are a secret society and they keep secrets and hide knowledge.

       Well the ones that “went to the moon” are not keeping their mouths shut, they are just lying. Even the most amateur detective can see their lying mannerisms in any interview.

       They are keeping their mouths shut about the fact that we can not get any further than lower earth orbit. They keep their mouths full of lies and shut when it comes to the truth.

       It took me years of researching and more importantly soul searching to come to my conclusions. There is no bullet point I can post that will make you change your mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone takes their own path in this journey to find truth. 9/11 is the event that woke me up. Once I realized they could lie about something so grand in scale; I began to investigate everything. I can now say with utmost confidence that damn near everything we “know” is a lie or half truth.

       I've literally had almost the same argument with someone else in this thread. I think we all (us that can see the truth) used to be in their shoes. They seem to think we do no research at all, as if we are children... yet it likely turns out that we are likely to have dedicated our lives to researching these things to come to such bold conclusions, and they are the ones who have done little to no research, just regurgitating what they were told.

       I gotta ask - how do you know the Van Allen radiation belts exist, exactly? If not for space scientists telling you that they are present, would you have any way of knowing?

       If you believe they can lie about going to the Moon, could they not lie about the presence of dangerous radiation belts?

       Wait, didn't you claim he was revealing the 'biblical truth' of the firmament? Last I checked Christianity does not have the concept of karma, so are you suggesting he believed in two distinct religions simultaneously?

       Also a tombstone is not admitting at the last minute - it's necessarily
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the last minute, since it's placed posthumously.

       The word Karma is not in the Bible, but it’s concepts are definitely part of its teachings.

       In what sense? Karma is the concept that good intent and good deed contribute to good karma and future happiness, while bad intent and bad deed contribute to bad karma and future suffering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Except in Christianity, everyone is a sinner. No amount of good deeds can ever change that. Romans 3:10-12 "None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one.” Similarly doing bad deeds doesn't actually make your fate any worse - the exact same fate awaits the harmless or the mass-murderer.
      </p>
      <p>
       In Christianity, the only thing that matters is whether you believe - that is the determining factor on whether you get to heaven or languish in hell. Ephesians 2:8 "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God." Only Catholics have a somewhat different view on this, and even there it's still half of the equation - no amount of good works can get you salvation there either.
      </p>
      <p>
       And of course, in real life good people can face terrible events, and terrible people can prosper - hence why the afterlife is so often invoked as a final judgement to set right all the injustices of life. Karma is wishful thinking.

       We are getting way off topic. What if Von Braun was trying to clear his conscience by having the “firmament verse” put on his tombstone? Does that sound better than Karma? Let’s not get caught up in semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Von Braun spent his life trying to break beyond the firmament but he failed, and to this day we are stuck in low earth orbit. I believe his tombstone inscription was giving the glory to God and admitting defeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       He put Pslams 19:1 on his grave.

       The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.

       Von Braun became increasingly religious as he got older, and wrote a whole bunch about the meeting of religion and science - he was pretty open about his beliefs. The line you quote is only interpreted to be a literal solid dome by a narrow slice of fundamentalists of which he was not one. It makes way more sense that he'd take it in the usual poetic sense that most Christians do anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's way more credible than cryptic nazi cults trying to fix karma, anyway.

       The Nazis, and Von Braun, were all about the occult. They were trying to use ancient occult knowledge to help them in the war effort. This cannot be refuted.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe Von Braun became closer to God because later in life he began to realize that the occult could not help him achieve his goals and that the only way out of here is through Jesus Christ.

       'This cannot be refuted' is not an argument, it's just a thoughtstopper. You're now agreeing with me that he got more religious as he got older w/ christianity, but earlier you were arguing he was trying to fix some occult karmic debt, which implies he believed in that until his death. Which is it?
      </p>
      <p>
       And do you actually have something about occult beliefs of Von Braun himself, or are you just kinda assuming 'there were believers of occult in the nazis, therefore every nazi believed it'?

       A pretty gosh-darn specific bible passage he decides to put on his tombstone. You really can't make the general argument that he was getting more religious and he just put a random bible quote on his tombstone, seeing as the passage he put on there is directly about the inability of mankind to penetrate the firmament of the earth and his inability to leave earth.

       No, I'm asking you for some reasonable explanation. Are you saying NASA is retarded and willfully said contradictory things for no apparent reason, or that they forgot about what they'd already published, or what?

       The facts are on the table. NASA claims they cant pass the Van Allen belt, yet they supposedly did so with the Apollo moon mission. There is the cutting point and anyone who is an honest person with a critical mind in search of the truth will start questioning NASA...not the person who observed this inconsistency.

       So, are you basing this on actual research, or do you happen to base it on a soundbite? Because I know that NASA claims they went to the Moon. And I know that claiming it's impossible to go to the Moon would be an extremely unlikely position for them to take.
      </p>
      <p>
       Which brings us back to stupid NASA, or forgetful NASA. And in either case, a NASA which for some reason constructed this whole thing in the first place, because without space scientists you wouldn't even know about those belts in the first place...
      </p>
      <p>
       You can whine about 'manipulative discussion' all you want, but you don't actually give an explanation. For some reason you just think that NASA debunked NASA and nobody would consider that claim suspect.

       Do you really think low level pawn Masons are told the truth? Cmon it is a hierarchy. Think!

      <p>
       The math is real, silly, but that doesn’t make what they are saying true. Math can be used to support hypothesis but that does not make it universal law. Science has told us many things that are facts and then later come out and disprove the narrative they once sold us as truth and “fact”.

       The conspiracy is not about money or power. The elite already have all the money and power in the world. The conspiracy is to completely control your mind, body and soul. Full spectrum dominance.

       Ah.  It's the secret club in the secret  club's secret club.

       I meet a lot of people in my occupation. To entertain myself I will do a weird handshake for some. I have had reactions I didn't know what to do with.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also made a tshirt years ago that said
       <strong>
        FUCK MASONS
       </strong>
       in masonic script.

      <p>
       The butcher at the local Safeway ws staring and staring. I get up to the counter and he looks me in the eye and turns and walks away. Had to wait for another dude to serve me.

       Probably was just his break though.

       Why is that so hard to understand? It is a cult that has a hierarchy. They have different degrees 1-33, but I actually think it goes even higher. So yes, it is a club within a club.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, they will allow useful idiots, like the butcher at Safeway, to join, but those people will never actually be initiated even if they reach the 33 degrees.

       I am not a flat earther. NASA is lying, but that is no reason to jump to the conclusion that the earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       But to answer your question... There is some dude named Eric Dubay and he apparently has put together 200 proofs that say the earth is flat. I really have not investigated bc I don’t think the shape of the earth is a pressing issue at this juncture.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the topic is fruitless bc we live in a quantum realm. There are people that think the earth is flat and that is truly their reality and no one can convince them otherwise. The same could be said about those who think we live on a globe. Perception is reality within our quantum universe. To each their own and all that Jazz:)

       The links are to debunk NASA. We need to call them out for their lies. If that leads people to FE then so be it.

       Don’t let your mistrust of FE give you a false sense that NASA is legitimate. In my opinion they are both wrong!

       Has anyone else claimed to have gone to the moon? Why is the US the only one? Why haven't we been back since the 70s? With far greater technology and all the experience of actually having done it, wouldn't it be a relatively easy feat?

       It's hard to discredit an entire thread that's some 400 articles long with 30-hour long videos on most... ? Like the fuck? do you think most people don't have jobs?

       Like the tops post states this is a tactic to try and show support in the rediculous because you can regurgitate fallacies faster than anyone can or has time to show you actual sources and evidence, which of course you won't believe because of your unconscious biases

       Most of us embrace this because we already understand and believe that we are being lied to, especially about science. Of course if you believe the "scientific facts" that you read then this would sound like nonsense. Many of these people believe Einstein was a shill for example, a "mad zany scientist" character...

       He believed the laws of the universe were governed by electromagnetism, and explained things on those grounds rather than gravity in many situations. Obviously that has to do with space. I am being vague because I am not an authority on this subject.

       Tesla was a brilliant man. A true genius but all he did was claim that he had produced a dynamic theory of gravity but he never gave any details on what it was.

       In the absence of any actual theory from him I'll go with the established science up until it is disproved.

       Step2thejep is here to shill (likely his own) content which he posts under John le Bon and charges $20+ per month for his content. He only posts John le bonn videos even though mods told him to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       He believes there are no planets, no space, no atoms, earth is flat, missles can’t fly and nukes don’t exist and hx older than our lifetimes (Tesla through Plato) is fake, and dinasaurs don’t exist, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Most of his ideas are based in a lack of understanding even basic physics and many of his free posts have no substance but shill his paid content.
      </p>
      <p>
       In one video he asserts missiles cannot fly in level flight because he doesn’t understand basic physics, is proven wrong in the comments, makes a video pretending to admit wrong and then concludes he should just keep his material behind a paywall. If you argue with him and show him equations and papers on missle flight/control he calls it drawings and theory. Show him videos of missiles in flight and they are doctored. His own theory is based on drawings, misunderstanding if basic physics and conjecture and it seems like the only proof he might accept is if someone strapped him to a missle and fired him from a fighter jet. Then when he got called out on it made another video where he pretended to retract his first video, then doubled down and decided it best he stay behind his pay wall.

       I'm totally open to the idea that at least some aspects of the space program are faked. Potentially open to more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a huge list, however. Any hero willing to select a very few of the strongest, most evidence-based links as a place to start? No Luciferian influence, no Nazi infiltrators, no alternative physics for now please. Best thing would be some official NASA footage presentefd with ironclad evidence of fakery. Any takers? TIA

       This isnt necessarily about flat earth.  Sure a prerequisite to flat earth is going to be to distrust NASA.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I both distrust NASA and am highly scrutinizing of the evidence released, for solid reasons.  I also dont think the earth is flat, rather that we are intentionally mislead about whats currently (im)possible and where the future of our race is headed.

       "Gish gallop" is a term for a technique used during debating that focuses on overwhelming one's opponent with as many arguments as possible, without regard for accuracy or strength of the arguments.

       You felt overwhelmed by a list of clickable links? If you wish to debunk OP (you’ve called this a debate so I presume that’s what you’d like to do if you weren’t so overwhelmed) then I’d suggest starting with the first one and working through them one by one. It wouldn’t be too hard for a genius like you who knows what fish gallop means.

       Does a random list of links look like a display of expertise to you, that’s your problem. You should think more critically about the information presented to you. If you don’t have time to do so, fine, but don’t cry about it.

       There are 350 hyperlinked parts within that wall of text. If I'm to assume each of those are independent points to be tested, and each of that takes, let's say, 1/2hr to go through on a mediocre level, that's 175hrs of information to sift through. Let's say I work a typical 8-5p and average my sleep to 7hrs, per American standards. The result is 8hrs of free time, assuming I have zero other obligations to attend to, such as commute, or eating. Say I work 5dys/wk, leaving me with 74hrs/wk. If I spent every waking moment dedicated to going through OP's disconnected railroad of links, it would take me 2.36wks to finish, not accounting for any written followup, if I'm to assume the point of this post is to bring discussion to the table. Fuck. That.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, either OP was looking to instigate discussion, in which case this post is a miserable failure by the lack of attention from not only the comments, but OP seems to be absent as well; or, OP was not looking for an open discussion and looking to side-line the opposition with a mountain of links in a quantity&gt;quality fashion with the simple goal of making it difficult to rebut. In other words, either this is a shit post, or a gish gallop. I'll use my "critical thinking" and be as dismissive to this post as gish gallopers are to responses given to individual arguments within the flood. It's only fair.

       Eh, hold on. Nowhere in my comment is there a statement of disbelief to any of the individual links. The point is in my second paragraph, that the structure of a post like this is not
       <em>
        designed
       </em>
       for reasonable discourse. It's a pat on the back to those that already believe in space conspiracies en masse, particularly about NASA, and structured to dismiss criticism by deflecting from one response to an unanswered one. The amount of effort it will take to respond to these is significantly higher than the effort it takes to point in a different direction, and if you have no problem with that, I don't know what to tell you. See comments like
       <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ss4l9/space_hoax_compilation/dt7o15p/">

       . There is no possible way anyone critically went through each and every one of these within the span of 24hrs, and yet people are already taking this list as "ammunition?" Give me a break.

       This structure is like a flood, and treating it like a compilation of droplets is only going to cause me to drown, does that make sense? Here, I'll go through one, since I have a little time on my hands, and I'm fairly confident I can respond to any of these. I'll use an
       <a href="https://www.random.org/integers/">
        RNG
       </a>
       to determine which one, but you'll have to trust me that I used one: the number I pulled was 163, which happens to be this video,

       </a>
       ... not exactly a fan of this one, since it's a 15m video, but here's my response.
      </p>
      <p>
       0:39: I'll assume this is a joke, because I'd like to give him enough credit to salvage my sanity.
      </p>
      <p>
       0:54: Stars are faint, and depending on the location of the Sun stars don't show up well on footage. You can try this yourself at night: go outside and take a photo of the sky and notice how not all the stars end up on the camera. It's the same principle at hand here. I don't really have much else to say about the list he gives here, because he's talking about seeing black holes right near Earth, and... what?
      </p>
      <p>
       1:09 No perfect vacuum exists, but that doesn't mean a) the concept of a vacuum is useless on a macro or micro level, or b) that star dust is fake. The closest we get to vacuums in outer space still retain a few H atoms/m
       <sup>
        3,
       </sup>
       and I'm not really sure what the point of complaining about "no true vacuum" here is, tbqh. Outer space is loosely defined at the

       </a>
       , which has pressure at about 3.2×10−2 Pa, which is classified as "high vacuum."
      </p>
      <p>
       At this point, I'm just wondering when he's going to talk about Skylab, or if he's just going to continuously rant without a central point.

       1:54 Debris is problematic because they're, generally, very small and very fast. Sentinel 1A was struck back in 2016 by debris about the size of a mm and resulted in a

       1:59 He's repeating his statement from about 60s ago, so I'm just going to move on.
      </p>
      <p>
       2:55 He's back to talking about the Earth spinning. So, I went to the source video, and... it's clearly moving, so I don't know what he's on about.
      </p>
      <p>
       3:38 Okay, simply saying it's fake doesn't mean shit. He just sits for a full minute talking about how "retarded" everyone is.
      </p>
      <p>
       4:28 He's still going on and mocking without saying anything... "oh, look it must be real, but nope, it's fake" is all I'm getting right now.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
       5:22 I don't know how to debunk the Skylab vid, he doesn't seem very intent on doing it himself, though... other than sitting there mocking it.
      </p>
      <p>
       5:31 It was never flat...
      </p>
      <p>
       5:44 I agree, that would be fun
      </p>
      <p>
       Holy shit, he's finally talking about Skylab.
      </p>
      <p>
       8:40 Bitter solenoids do not disprove gravity... they overcome it... that's like saying steel isn't strong because I can toss a knife through cardboard. The diametric forces acting upon the frog overcome relatively weaker gravitational forces and push the frog towards the center of the Bitter solenoid.
      </p>
      <p>
       9:50 If you were to supersize that you'd get an image looking nothing like what the video shows... the frog struggles to reach the edges, and the astronauts freely move around them.
      </p>
      <p>
       13:00 He's done nothing to prove that. Also, from here on out he just constantly repeats "it's diamagnetism," so I think we're done here.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last notes: the dates don't match up and the size of the magnet doesn't match up. In 1933 Bitter figured out how to construct what is now known as the Bitter solenoid. In 1973 Skylab was launched for 3 missions over the course of 173 days and 13 hrs. Then, in 2011, a Bitter solenoid was improved upon to increase efficiency by 40% resulting in the

       </a>
       . This is the current record, as far as I'm aware, and that one is not nearly the size of the room they are doing flips in, specifically the power supply is clearly larger and the magnet itself is clearly smaller than the Skylab.
      </p>
      <p>
       That took me about 45m just to sit there, pause the vid when I had something to write about, and pull up a couple links to work with. Do you see the problem now when you list 350 links? It would take far too long to go point by point, and that's the

       Sure, but what does that have to do with OP if you're not debating or arguing against any of the points? If you are feeling overwhelmed, start with debating one point. If you're not going to argue any of the points at all, then your comment is a non sequitur.

       What you're saying is false. The whole point of a Gish Gallop is to force your opponent to waste their time trying to shovel out your pile of bullshit. Of course, you can always heap on more faster than logical, critical thought, and research can dispell it. To those who don't understand the trick, this can make it seem like a position is very well supported, when in actually no convincing arguments or evidence have been put forward to support it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Calling out a Gish Gallop is the proper response, do not jump into the brier patch. What you can do is ask the person you are debating with to provide you with the 3-5 most iron clad and convincing pieces of evidence for their position, and see if they will agree ahead of time to admit that the position likely isn't true if these points can be dispelled. Falsifiability is key.

        compilation,
       </em>
       (see title) which is commonly used on r/conspiracy when there are many proofs of something, sometimes hundreds of proofs for the user to look through at their leisure. Anybody can feel free to refute anything in the OP, one at a time. This isn't a speaking debate where a method like gish gallop would be used to trip the opponent up because he doesn't have time to respond to everything. Gish gallop doesn't work in this format (list on links on a reddit post), because you
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       time to refute each link.

      <p>
       Also, this person claimed OP was using a debate tactic, yet didn't debate a single point, and therefore it wasn't a debate tactic because there was no debate. Complaining that the list is too big, and that there isn't a TL;DR, does not make it gish gallop, and does not add anything to a discussion at all.

       You're wrong. Gish Gallop was coined from debate, but is perfectly accurate in describing behavior in a forum that obscures rather than illuminates.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if someone or a group sat down and critiqued each item on the list thoroughly, no single person would ever be reasonbly expected to make it through that line-by-line critique. We all know it would never happen. That critique would put a dissertation to shame, just by the volume necessitated.
      </p>
      <p>
       By far the better approach with be a genuinely curated list, with links to supplementary information if wanted. What we have here is a completely jumbled grab bag, where each person is gonna reach in and take something out. No one will be on the same page, and no real meaningful discussion of the evidence will be had.

        to some extent
       </strong>
       .  Id hope youre brave enough to investigate yourself with an open mind.  Feel free to ignore this too long list.

       Here's the thing. I'm not saying I trust NASA. Far from it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm saying that this is a fallacious persuasive technique. It doesn't give any accurate representation of reality, because any good information is homogenously mixed in with with all the fluff.
      </p>
      <p>
       The intellectually honest approach would be a truly curated list, one that sought not to overwhelm​ through sheer magnitude of content, but rather to persuade through the unassailability of each item on the list. The list would be reduced by a few orders of magnitude, and more more intellectually honest and ultimately more persuasive for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       We could have an actual meaningful conversation about the entirety of the evidence presented and what it means, with any one individual being able to take in all the data. That's not possible in the current environment.

       Youre on point, good sir.  Remember I left off saying you should feel free to ignore this list.  For someone like me, this list has its utility.  Its utility is NOT what you are wanting it to be.  If you want that, check out my post history for some title like "Does it cast a shadow?  A lesson in NASA fakery."  Got some good conversation going with that thread.
      </p>
      <p>
       Modern fakery aint the easiest to get a grip on to be honest but it's out there!
      </p>
      <p>
       As for "what it means"im actually aaare of dozensof possibilities.  We dont have enough information about secret black budgets / projects by definition, though so this is amother difficulty.  People seem to want answers as to
       <em>
        why
       </em>
       , though.   A necessary start is agreeing there is fakery though.  Then we can push for answers together as a collective.

       You can disagree.  Stated in another way, this list does have value for someone like me; who understands the premise and already knows of certain specific instances of fakery like.  It's terrible for someone who still is just entertaining the idea.

       It is a bad list not because most people reading it aren't ready for the information, but because most of the information on the list is bad or misleading. And because the list is so huge that it is impractical to convincing demonstrate this to anyone. It would take a tremendous effort that would be too large to cast to expect anyone to digest.

       This would be a very good assessment (and I mean that) if in reality people wouldn't get outright ridiculed and shut down from further discussion when they post a flat earth/fake spake thread which
       <strong>
        do
       </strong>
       contain a more compact and easily digestible list of content. We all know how easily the flat earth discussion is shut down everywhere, so you have to recognize that although what you are saying is logical, that in reality we find out that it doesn't matter anyway unfortunately. If that attitude and approach can change, then we would all be better for it.

       In my opinion, the primary goal of flat earth meme is to keep eyes off of the secret space program. Does this by funneling anyone who questions what NASA puts out down a rabbithole that leads no where, while at the same time makes normies less likely to ever question the official story, because look what those crazy conspiracy theorists are talking about. This wedge strategy is fingerprints of a psyop.

       I'd start with researching what Gary McKinnon found and follow your nose from there. I honestly think I'd be doing you a disservice by giving you much more than that; I don't know where you're at and this stuff is so multi-layered that you can easily blind yourself to the truth if you try to walk someone else's path. More and more I believe that the universe opens itself to you like a flower if you open yourself to it in kind. The key is to let the universe lead you to the truth with an open mind and heart, trying to avoid the trap of confirming what you think/want to be true. Feel for the small, quiet voice inside yourself that's almost always right yet you reflexively want to ignore.

       No, Gish Gallop is not only applicable if the entire list is bullshit. The point is that it's functionally impossible to check the whole gallop, so you cannot really accurately judge the point behind the gallop. It obscures reality, rather than illuminating it.

But you've got to admit, there's a lot of real garbage in that list. A whole lot. On the whole, it distracts and lies more than it informs.

       The beauty about this list is all it takes is one mistake on their part while they're in outer space or on the Moon which proves they're lying, and they lose credibility forever. Forget that there may be hundreds of examples of deception. All it takes is one example of faking space, and anybody will realize they've been deceived.

       Because if they really are orbiting closer to the sun than Earth is, then the only time we should be able to see them is if we're facing the sun in other words when it's day out. How can we see it when we're not facing the sun if they're closer to the sun than us? They'd be on the other side of the world any time at night. Or at least that's why I got from it my understanding of most science is utter shit tho. If someone can shed light on that I'd love a reply!

       Because they're on elliptical orbits, not perfectly round ones like in pictures. Also, there are certain times of the year where we can't see those planets. Like literally, we're at a point where we almost can't see Venus anymore.

       There has been an influx of 'Gish gallop' posts lately. Have you noticed? It's a term long-known to the religion debate community but only recently used in r/Conspiracy. I wonder why it's being trotted out so readily at this point.

       Could be a counter move to the SS rule, which is doing wonders for fostering discourse in this sub. Very dangerous.

       I love how often I'm now seeing people here calling out logical fallacies. Critical thinking and conspiracy theorizing are the same thing, not in opposition to each other. Don't let anyone tell you different, and keep calling out the logical fallacies. Every time you do, it's like defanging a snake.

       It is. The idea that it isn't because it isn't arguing against any one person is ridiculous. The post is arguing against the position that NASA is telling us the truth. (I don't think NASA is, but this Gish Gallop does not facilitate the discussion or understanding of this topic. It just tries to overwhelm)

       This is how a Gish Gallop works. It puts an absolutely untenable burden of proof on anyone who wants to counter the Gish Gallop narrative. And trying to do so is a complete waste of, because the Galloper can always pile on more dross faster than you can dispel it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unless there is a deeply compelling reason not to, which you explicitly address and explain why you aren't galloping, the intellectually honest course of action is to restrict yourself to the 3-5 most convincing pieces of evidence/argument.

       Well of course they don't have the moon trip technology anymore. They haven't gone to the moon in decades and they've focused on other ventures since then. The standards at which they keep spacecraft clean, of course they couldn't use any of the old stuff. It's been sent to museums and storage warehouses to get out of the way. They don't use the same type of manufacturing. They don't use the same type of electronics. Nothing is the same as it was when they went to the Moon. So you can't use that data to just rebuild a shuttle for a moon trip. They've had their sights on Mars for years now which would require a completely different type of craft.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just wish more people would ask why when they take these quotes out of context. Go find the entire statement and read into what they are actually trying to get across rather than a context free dictionary approach to one sentence or moment.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just piggybacking on this comment, another one I saw that was hilarious bullshit was this thing about not being able to leave low Earth orbit and how we then couldn't have gone to the Moon. We can't "leave" low Earth orbit in the ISS because we need gravity to keep it orbiting and out of harmful radiation. The Van Allen belt during the Apollo missions was barely any radiation for that short period of time. They didn't have extended time in space, like the ISS or a Mars trip. Plus they had minimal exposure, skipping the internal belt and going through an area that was low radiation. They only received about 0.16 to 1.14 rads of radiation during each trip, which isn't even enough to show effects. A human can be exposed to about 25 rad before you can notice in blood work. It takes 100 rad for acute radiation sickness. It takes 200 rad for a fatal dose. They maybe experienced a single unit of rad. That isn't shit.

       Moon landing conspiracies are the silliest of conspiracies. It was a great achievement, but really the hard part is getting out there. The travel through empty space only requires a little bit of thrust and telemetry.

       That was the whole quote, not taken out of context, he then goes on to talk about Mars.
      </p>
      <p>
       and what about the contradictory statements about whether the stars are visible or not? Which would seemingly be one of the most obvious possible things?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, check this out and look closely, there is a strong argument for the dudes being held up by strings as shown here, and also as a bonus this video points out certain sound clips of hammers being used and things being thrown that should not be able to be heard in the absence of an atmosphere.

       In the lunar day time, the sun hits the highly reflective ground, making the stars hard to see with the naked eye. You would have to look away from the sun, and shield your eyes from the ground light. I don't get what is contradictory here.
      </p>
      <p>
       The movements of astronauts on the moon does not seem suspect at all. In every example in that movie, it looks entirely like what you would expect in a 1/6 g environment. Do you find it suspect that they were able to jump and skip around, as well as get back on their feet the way they do?
      </p>
      <p>
       The sound of the hammer passing through the astronaut's bones to his helmet mike seems plausible. The thrown wire coinciding with a thud in the sound recording is not a strong argument that it was faked. In fact, it makes no sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       And so we could go on and on. I am open to either possibility, so forgive me for erring on the side that the people who demonstrably never ever seem to understand this space science and engineering stuff, either got it wrong or are simply lying.

       Okay, so you explained the science about whether stars are visible or not, but the question is how do you explain the completely contradictory statements by the astronauts. "you can see the stars pretty much all the time, and the planets and the nebula bla bla" and the apollo astronauts "We never ever saw any stars, a black void" It doesn't have to do with math or science.

       Man, i see the guy laying flat on the ground and levitating back to his feet without any push off.
      </p>
      <p>
       You need to offer a plausible alternative to the thrown wire noise then. If it makes no sense, please explain since you can mock the theory so easily.

       I should have emphasized the part where I wrote that stars are hard to see in the bright moon daylight. Both by eye and camera. This is like moon hoax 101 stuff. In a darkened out space ship, turning away from the sun, so you only look at space, your eyes adjust and you see the stars more clearly than on a cloudless night in the country. To film stars in space, you increase the exposure, so your film or sensors can catch the dim light.
      </p>
      <p>
       The film narration is riddled with misinterpretations. The guy you say is levitating seems to be repeatedly pushing with both arms against the ground. This feat would be impossible to pull off with wires, but on the Moon, wires are not needed! The astronaut that is helped and wants a push on the head, is helped up by the other astronauts hand, not by a push on the head like the narrator states.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thrown wire noise I cannot account for - but if it was filmed in a studio, what microphone picked up the noise of it hitting the lander? The only microphones were the astronauts headsets. So there could have been a headset in the lander that was turned on constantly and it picked up the sound, which was then added during production mixdown. But the microphone could not have picked up the sound, since the lander didn't have an airlock, and so was depressurized during EVA. Is that what you are saying indicates fakery?

       You have two astronauts saying they can see stars from what Im assuming is the ISS and then its followed by astronauts saying they couldnt see stars from specifically the lunar surface or the day side of the moon....

       What was just said was essentially the same as a person at night saying they can see stars and another person during the day saying they cant.

       Plato was right and Newton is part of the scam. Newtonian physics loses more credibility each day. The universe is electric and quantum in nature. This is fact and is carefully being disclosed in slow motion.

       You replied to a comment talking about  rockets working in space with "Newtonian Physics is dead", its pretty clear that you think what the commenter is saying is wrong. And you move on to quantum mechanics and some bullshit about electric universe while not citing any sources.

       Ok. But what does this have to do with Quantum Mechanics and Newtonian Physics being wrong. Still moving the goalposts. Try and get the value of Bohr Radius using "Sacred Geometry". See how far that gets you.

       Why don’t you look into Electric universe theory before calling it bullshit? The thunderbolts project is a good start.
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess it was unfair to call Newtonian physics “wrong” but it is not accurate method to study the true nature of our quantum realm.
      </p>
      <p>
       You seem like a smart fellow and what I am saying is damaging to your intelligence and ego. I get that, but you must understand that ego will blind one from the truth. Everything is connected and our egos keep us from experiencing this sacred truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The search for truth is a personal journey. All modern academic institutions have been infiltrated by those who wish to keep us in mental prisons. If you want truth, you must sacrifice your ego and let go of preconceived notions.

       Took your advise and looked at one of the videos from the Thunderbolts Project. It was called Thunderbolt of the gods and honestly it was even worse than I thought. Pure unadulterated bull-crap. No mathematical framework. Just "this ancient thing looks similar to some photos from space so entirety of modern physics is wrong". I cant believe anyone would fall for this crap.

       Uhh, the fact that he said 'look into Electric universe' is pretty much your answer for a 'source'. Seeing as how you can choose your own sources for investigating the electric universe. He pretty much gave you a lead. What do you want more from him? To read his sources out for you while you lay in bed?

       "Research _____" is not a source. It is a lazy cop out.  Just searching it in google leads to hundreds of websites. How am I supposed to know which one is right? Where has the results from QM been derived from "Sacred Geometry"? Even the ThunderBolts Project that she talked about has nearly a hundred videos of 10 to 90 min length.
      </p>
      <p>
       When I ask for a source, I mean where did you get this information or how did you arrive at your conclusion. That way I can understand where you are coming from and we can have a fruitful discussion. Saying "Research _____"  is about as useful as saying Research Geography to someone asking for directions.

       Actually Jesus would agree with you. He said Satan is the god of the earthly realm and the True Gods kingdom is in heaven. Remember we got tricked into coming down into Satan’s world and we were cast out of Eden. Jesus was sent to show us the way out of here and it can’t be done with rockets my friend. I don’t call people sheep, btw.

       I whole heartedly reject the notion of a god in any way. And so help me if I die and find out there is one ill punch it square in its fucking face for what it allows to happen. I will remember the quote until I die "if there is a god he will have to beg my forgiveness"
      </p>

       I have to control myself when getting upset and allow others to hold their own beliefs, so forgive me if I'm being harsh.

       Why are you blaming God? He gave us free will and we have created this world and like I said, the true Gods kingdom is not of this world. We are in Satan’s web yet we could make this realm more enjoyable but we choose to do nothing and maintain status quo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe you should punch yourself in the face? Don’t blame God for your own shortcomings. You can change at any moment and bring light into the darkness.

       Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. 
Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. 
Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? 
Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?

       I am very sorry to hear that and I feel for you and understand the pain you feel. I was sexually abused as a child and that trauma led me to a dark place and I found myself hopeless and hooked on a cocktail of drugs that completely wrecked my life.
      </p>
      <p>
       I wanted to die and I cursed God up and down and got to the point where I felt dead inside and that’s when I reached out to Jesus Christ and gave my sorrows to him and begged for the wisdom and mercy of God. I then had a spiritual epiphany and felt the presence of a loving God in my heart. It was truly a miracle. I died inside and was born again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really can’t explain how much this changed my life and attitude in general. I would be dead if not for the grace of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have my utmost respect and you are truly brave and strong for being able to pull yourself up. I wasn’t that strong and needed help. We all have our own ways of dealing with trauma and I do not judge you at all for the way you feel. I wish you the best for the future and admire your courage. I apologize if I have offended you in anyway. You are solid in my book!

       I can fully understand how you interpreted what you went through the way you did. I will say that you are the strength you felt. The belief simply gave you the courage/confidence to change, in my not so humble opinion anyways.
      </p>

       Regardless of our beliefs we are family in pain. I'm glad you are still here. I love you.

       I'm actually sitting here reading some anon calling Isaac Newton a fool.

      <p>
       But that's not even what gets me. You called him a "Satan worshipping fool". This shows clearly that you don't know a single thing about Newton. The man did not believe in the existence of Satan, the devil or demons and you'd know this if you actually read a book or two instead of just spouting nonsense.

       Like I said the further you go back; the more truth you will find. Newton is part of a Satanic conspiracy to hide God. He put much energy into satanic principles whether he was aware of it or not.

       Unfortunately, we all give energy to the Saturnian control matrix, some more than others, but that is the problem we face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money is the god of our civilization. In god we trust, no? But which god are we trusting? I don’t see any Christian symbols on our money, but I do see Saturnian symbols on our money.
      </p>
      <p>
       One cannot serve two masters. You can’t serve money and God. We are all second hand Satanists and we all are unwittingly giving our time and energy to the dark one.

       The highest form of worship would have to be using the gifts the creator endowed us with in order to understand creation, and thus the creator and ourselves. All the same thing, that's the holy trinity I believe in. Creator, Self, Creation. We're all it, and it's all us.

       You don't particularly seem to be engaging with what I'm saying, and that's fine. I'm no zealot, and believe nothing absolutely. More than anything, I was agreeing with you how silly it is to condemn​ the questioning of god. It is through such questioning and examination of god/creation that I feel closest to them.

       What the actual? Satanism has nothing to do with money. Furthermore your comment has nothing to do with my OP. Yes, Masonic/Pagan symbols are everywhere. But what does that have to do with Isaac Newton? And furthermore, quit assuming every lame-brain on Reddit is Spiritual. Your God rhetoric is meaningless gibberish signifying nothing.

       Do you ever catch the irony of being a religious person on a conspiracy forum? Religion being the oldest and laziest form of psy op that were aware of. One that you've unabashedly bought hook, line, and sinker? It's depressing seeing these threads because I come to this form to find other people are awake. Yet you're here telling woken people to focus on the dreams

       I didn’t find religion my friend. I experienced the raw power of the Prime Creator of all things and it changed my life and brought me peace and wisdom that made me whole.

      <p>
       I thought I was “woke” before I had God in my life, but I was a lost, depressing, asshole. There is higher dimensional power that we all can tap into, and when you do it will change you for good. Everybody’s path is different and some find enlightenment by other means, but Jesus Christ is my personal savior and I highly recommend anyone who is feeling lost to reach out to Him.

       I don't doubt that Nasa has fudged information, and faked bits of evidence to hide the truth among genuine material... But when you got people like OP who post overwhelmingly large disinfo links like this (there's plenty of multiple-hour-long videos in his post - who has the time to watch all those?!) then it's a clear effort to discredit genuine criticism as absolute dismissal.

       That's embarrassing. First off, you refuse to even entertain the thought that OP contains boatloads of disinformation, or at the very least, misleadingly wrong information. Then you fail to argue any point, instead throwing a sort of tantrum, finishing off with an odd assertion that I was alive and being fooled by CIA in 1969.

       I'm saying that those videos do seem very fake, and I'm inclined to believe NASA is faking them for whatever reason. I'm not a 'flat-earther' (I'm not one of those people who gets weirdly pissed off at people who think the Earth is flat though), but bizarre footage is bizarre footage.

       "Seem" being the key word here. Many of those bullshit perspective videos try and claim things they hardly understand. For example, and yes this is but only one example, the ISS footage where buddy is going on about the iss vs plane footage and the rates that things are moving is simply perspective. a plane only ~100 km in the air is so different from the iss, which is literally thousands of times more distant, that they are literaly incomparable when speaking in perspective. lay some objects on your desk and sit almost eye level with the desk and view these items as you would be "coming into land" on the desk. now do so 3 feet above the desk. the objects do not have nearly the same perspectives.

       Many of these videos are done well enough to convince those who think about the piece instead of the whole.

       I mean, yeah, I know to be suspicious of these videos as the claims grow more and more complicated, but the video where the astronaut picks up a non-existent object and puts it on the shelf...what the FUCK is that dude. Or where the 3 astronauts all simultaneously glitch out of the video but the background is fine...

       Ok so heres my take on this video. Its cut to make it seem this way. Watch the full video of these two astronaughts and see how the one fella constantly readjusts his hadns to clasp them together and in the instance of him "faking to use a digital object" is simply letting go to clasp his hands and stoping to grab the bar again because he starts to move. The thought that they are being suspended is thrown away by the one guy doing both a twirl and a back tuck in the full video which is impossibly to simulate zero g with these moves since you would need to be suspended and supported from many different areas. And the guy in back simply has a loose Velcro strap hanging off his back. They all use Velcro to keep things on their person instead floating. I didnt see them glitch in and out of frame though, ill look further later!

       Huh, that's interesting. Even if it's cut, his arm motions are really unnatural/bizarre, wouldn't you say? I don't move my hands/arms like that to clasp my hands or balance on something.
      </p>
      <p>
       The glitching astronauts is a different video:

       Weve also never been in zero g. Or at least I havent. I would think many movements would be unnatural as were used to a certain amount t of upward force to move ourselves anywheres.
      </p>
      <p>
       That glitch in the video happens a lot in older digital technology thats relaying from far away. Ive seen that exact same glitch happen during the live newscasting of the bombing of Afghanistan if memory serves.

       I know I don't sound like I'm being objective, but these are honestly how I see the events as in the realm of occums razor.

       I find it sad that the "moon landing" hoax has transformed into the entirety of "NASA" hoax.
      </p>
      <p>
       In leaving, I would suggest anytime you see a video like these you go back to the original uncut documents to see for yourself and make your own opinion. If the idea is preplanted in your brain first, of course you will see it that way. Thats basic psychology.
      </p>

       I hope I'm not being offensive, and i don't mean to be telling you youre wrong. I'm just giving what I see as a valid explanation that I am comfortable accepting.

       be on one side of the fence or the other regarding things they truly can't know. I find it all very fascinating and my natural inclination is to be skeptical of the skeptics. Obviously, there's been a mountain of weird, shady shit that's happened throughout history that was either successfully covered up or is in the process of being covered up. According to the skeptics, the mainstream narrative is true for literally everything- they might accept that some things are lies in a general sense, but on any individual point, they'll believe the mainstream version. Well...where are the lies then?

       The lies are still all around us. The food pyramid for one is an absolute travesty that was made by selling to the highest bidder, not by whats best for us medically. Thats on the big bruv and the rich elite who lied.
      </p>
      <p>
       For me anyways, there is enough lies elsewhere and around us to keep us enslaved to the system (rent/mortgage, low wages, etc.) They don't need to lie about space. I can however see why one would believe otherwise too.

       People will think you're suffering a fucking psychotic break if you say that corn isn't a health food, or that maybe raw spinach isn't the best thing ever to eat all the time (hello, kidney stones), or that maybe we like fatty meat so much because,

       It fucking terrifies me that the thought leaders/policy leaders will let the world continue down the obesity/diabetes epidemic pathway rather than just come out and say that Cheezits and Velveeta grilled cheese sandwiches are toxic because like a handful of people would lose money. And everyone just goes along with it! People actually convince themselves that dogshit, bland, potato chips mass-fried in the shittiest, most flavorless vegetable oil available is some amazing treat! They'll pay as much per calorie for these awful chips as for a ribeye steak!

       On the other hand, font count carbohydrates out completely! Natural sugar and complex carbohydrates are very good for the body for energy and muscle developement. All natural or homemade pastas, breads, and other such products can be good for you if using non bleached, all natural ingredients. But store bought is like the mcdonalds of food.

       As more and more people in the United States are doubting that the earth is a globe and NASA really goes to space, other countries are focusing on science education. If you Americans really want to b great again you need to stop with focusing on conspiracies and start developing new science and technology.

       Yes, rockets work in space, ffs. Ya'll need to spend more time reading about space. It's fucking cool as hell, and you guys are missing out by not learning anything about it. For thousands of generations, humans wondered what was going on up there, well, now we finally have some really amazing tech that's helping us find out. You're one of the first generations of humans to be able to learn about this stuff, but you're so god damn proud of your ignorance that you're gonna miss it. Sucks to be you guys, living in your paranoid delusion with no understanding of the real universe.

       Reddit has tons of subreddits dedicated to science and space. I urge you to expand your mind by learning something real, instead of assuming that some random tin-foiler on youtube is the keeper of secret truths.

       There is the possibility that you are wrong, and the many critical posts are because most of the list is long debunked bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's try without any help and debunk the link
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/JigvW">
        Equipment Falling As If It's On Earth
       </a>
       showing three gifs of astronauts on the Moon.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        The grainy gif shows two astronauts doing whatever with some tripods, some wire and some stick in the ground.  One of them is careless and a tripod is knocked over, in a way that could resemble it falling in Earth's gravity. So it was filmed in a studio.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Or maybe, just maybe the astronaut simply tripped over some wires and that pulled the tripod. An accident, but not something only explained by them being in a studio.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Again two astronauts (pop quiz: how was this filmed, who operated the zoom?) This time they are running, when what looks like a moon rock falls from a backpack, supposedly like it would in 1g. Hollywood confirmed.
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       Or it could simply be that the rock fell at that speed, because the movement of the astronaut and backpack gave the rock a downwards trajectory.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Getting bored with this link already. But okay the astronaut is helped back on his feet and somehow drops a moon rock. It lands suspisciously faster than you might expect. Two birds with one clip, or just an uncritical mind faced with no better conclusion than the one given in the title?
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       As it turns out, the astronaut has what looks like moon rocks in his backpack. In better quality versions of this scene, you can actually see the rock popping up from the compartment and hitting the shoulder area of the astronaut before getting propelled away, so it was already moving down, and is now heading away to the left and towards us. Do rocks behave this way on Earth? But more importantly, why didn't the astronauts close their bags properly?
      </p>
      <p>
       And it's all like this. Every single 350 items of suspect FE cryto-fascist, pseudo-religious brain-damage-dealing doses, sent straight from someone who probably don't know shit, and don't mean you and me well :)

       Well my question to you is how in the Fuck did we manage to "go to the moon" within a couple years in the 60s after planning it and here we are in 2018 and all NASA has offered us in that time is a fucked up ghetto rigged space station...
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is fucking laughable...after 100s of millions of tax payer money that piece of shit is all they have to offer us?
      </p>
      <p>
       The whole idea of getting to the moon would be a phenomenal feat and by now we should have fucking hotels on the thing by now .
      </p>
      <p>
       But yet...no need to go back and research the thing....been there...done that...
      </p>
      <p>
       And you most definitely believe we sent a rover to mars on the first couple tries. The data being sent back would most definitely be time delayed a significant among of time and the odds of wall-e landing a perfect 10 and has been cruising around with zero problems is insane.
      </p>
      <p>
       And there's the good ole every picture from space of the earth is a composite should tell you something right there along with the fact the shuttle has never had a single problem docking to the ISS at 17,000 mph....
People can barely merge onto a highway at 50mph without crashing but yet we have never had an issue with the whole docking bill shit....
      </p>
      <p>
       It's just my opinion...If you were in charge wouldn't you have explored the moon more than we have?
      </p>
      <p>
       But yet the greatest feat to date is to continue to fly in circles(in low earth orbit)
With a rigged up tin can?
      </p>
      <p>
       Please....

       How about you choose a handful of those 350 links which you think is most believable, and I'll argue that they are 100% bullshit. Does that prove that NASA never lies? No, but it makes you wonder if perhaps, perhaps the entire 350 links are bullshit propaganda lies.

       Your weak retort does not even make sense, not that I expected it to. Why would you need human eyes? Can't you just take a picture of the curve and look at that? I'll stop before having to go into your beliefs about

       If it was heading away, then at a certain point, the boat would disappear. How did you explain those other videos of ships disappearing beyond the horizon I wonder.

       Another question: do you realize how fucking big the Earth is, how high you would need to be to take a picture of the curve? It's higher than I've ever been. But you can put one on a rocket like

       So you occupy yourself with philosophical exercises on the topic of the limits of reason and certainty, but you are uncomfortable about inferring stuff? The level of proof you demand, would involve you somehow getting a seat (two are available) on the coming Falcon Heavy launch. Following release of the cargo, you should be able to see the curve in the rear-view mirror.

       In some of these flat earthers minds, rockets and space literally don't even exist. So if you put one of them on a rocket, they'd claim you drugged them and made their mind hallucinate.

       No space travel is required to prove this.  So we can throw that line of reasoning out the window.  With space, it's a circular argument.  You cannot prove it's real, I cannot prove it is false.  But we both believe either side because of our belief systems.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now to prove this without space travel, we would obviously just need to go to the south pole.  Simple enough, although you must first have approval to do so.  And before you introduce the straw man argument and claim that NASA has armed guards circling Antarctica, that is ridiculously overkill.  With the capabilities of surveillance (everyone has a working mic and GPS in their pockets) that simply wouldn't be needed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So you could prove it's a globe to yourself by flying over the south pole and coming back around the globe.  If it does not wrap back around (seen by missing curvature) then it is not a globe and you've been lied to.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's quite simple to prove.   Yet, no one has attempted to prove the globe with a continuous live stream going around the south pole.  I find this strange as this debate has being going on for centuries.  So if there was proof, shouldn't it be widely disseminated by now?

       If you can't accept the "best judgement" proof of a relatively cheap experiment, like sending a balloon with a camera ~20 miles up and filming a clear curve, then comparing that footage to the calculated expected view obtained from the given height and knowing the Earth's size, I won't try to convince you otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are so many ways you can infer the roundness and rotation of the Earth. I mean people have been circumnavigating the bloody thing for 500 years. There's day and night, seasons, solar eclipse shadows on the Earth, moon eclipse shadows on the Moon, the fact that can calculate the width of it by looking at the suns position and knowing the distance between two places on the surface, like the greek did. These indirect "proofs" are too numerous to mention, but suffice to say, that flat earth or similar pseudo-religious, regressive ideas have yet to manifest any plausible theory or mathematical model that explains the wealth of phenomena related to a round Earth.

       Well, when I see amateurs and "professionals" come back with far different data from the high altitude balloons you speak of.  I know there is an issue.  Do you think the earth changes it's curvature? If not, then one of the two parties has to be deceiving.
      </p>
      <p>
       Circumnavigation is easily done on a flat earth.  Look up the astrolabe.  It's literally how they navigated perfectly before GPS based on the fixed rotating heavens.
      </p>
      <p>
       They inferred the proof when they realized that they couldn't see boats as they went out into the distance.  This was a good guess, but now we can prove that to not be the reason at all.  This is undeniable proof of this fact.  No amount of hand waving can change observable repeatable evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's weird how much misinformation some of you guys get going on about.  Like, I had someone tell me flight paths work better on a globe....
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2015, a flight from Bali, Indonesia to Los Angeles had to emergency land since a women prematurely gave birth 6 hours into the flight.  Look at a globe and tell me where you think they emergency landed.  The truth will set you free.

       You talk a lot of talk, but when it comes to actually explaining in any detail and showing others the reasoning behind these to you evident truths, nothing what so ever is presented.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of answering, you ask the usual funny questions like why an airplane wouldn't always follow the absolute shortest on a globe. Do you know the regulations of commercial flights? It's perfectly reasonable to fly over land and along certain routes, to better survive emergency situations. It seems you failed to understand this, and strangely enough for a flat earther, you have even failed to understand map projections, which would directly show you why flying a northern route to LA would also make sense fuelwise.
      </p>
      <p>
       How on the round Earth does an ancient deprecated device help prove a flat Earth? It's evident that other models of the solar system, like the geocentric, worked just fine for some stuff, but the flat earth idea has no such attraction - no evidence (at least you haven't presented any), no model that accounts for everyday observations or scientific experiments. It's precisely what handwaving looks like - a clear indication of a cult mindset.

       The issue is you've been given excuses for the issues with the globe, but fail to see how scientism's answers for these are illogical.

       You are acting like a religious zealot about something you don't believe in, have you ever asked yourself why flat earth is the only topic that fits that category?

       You are being dishonest at best and deceiving at worst if you believe you have seen evidence for a globe earth. But please, try and explain your "proof" that you've discovered. You would be a famous man if you had actually found the missing curvature.

       In reality, a ball the size of earth would have a drop of 66 feet. At 15 miles, 150 ft.  At 30 miles, 600 ft.  Google long distance photography that shows a flat plane spanning over 100 miles and show me the 6000 feet of curvature that is missing?

       This is verifiable math, that you can proof yourself if you are skeptical.  I was skeptical myself, so I had to check the math, and you should.

       You have given zero evidence and denied that math is real. Why would I find evidence and show it to you? So you can claim it's not real as well? Yeah, that sounds like a really good way to end today's grind. If you want to be taken seriously, you have to at least know what's right and what's not. How do you think they calculate the size of the earth without math anyways? This should be good.

       The question is, what should you not be able to see. And the answer is you shouldn't be able to see anything that has a height of under 6000 ft from ground level.
      </p>
      <p>
       Curvature is the bulge in the water that obscures your vision, at 100 miles, on a globe, anything you can see at that distance has to have 6000 ft of height being obscured by the curvature. So if you can only see the top of a mountain at 100 miles the mountain would be just over 6000 ft high. Keep in mind this is what you should see on a globe. At only 3 miles you are unable to see anyone that is under 6 ft tall.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This sentence is roughly correct, but I would like to emphasize that you correctly mentioned "ground level" in your sentence.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Curvature is the bulge in the water that obscures your vision, at 100 miles, on a globe, anything you can see at that distance has to have 6000 ft of height being obscured by the curvature.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This very similar sentence is now incorrect.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reason is simple : there is no mention of the altitude of the observer in your second sentence. Yes, There will be 6000 feet hidden by the bulge if your eye is exactly at the level of water.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you are only 100 feet over the water, then only 5000 feet should be hidden. If you are 200 feet over water, it's now just 4500 feet that should be hidden. And so on ...
      </p>
      <p>
       That's because the "bulge" is not 6000 feet high. The bulge is usually defined as the maximal distance between the straight line (going through the spherical earth) and the line going on the surface of the Earth. For a 100 miles distance, the bulge is 1667 feet.

       If I am myself standing over water, then I should be able to see completely someone who is 3 miles away. The 6feet tall guy will be hidden by the curvature, only if my eye is exactly at sea level. (Assuming that the water is perfectly calm, no waves)

       A flight from Bali to LA has to emergency land 6 hours into the flight.  Where do they land on a globe and on a flat earth?  Where did they land in reality?

       I don't know, but what I have hears it that images are transferred via digital encoding and have to be decoded to view them, so technically they are all "doctored". But I don't know if that is true, you would have to do some research.

       The article in the link claims that "documents prove he died from cyanide poisoning" yet provides no indication of what or where these alleged documents are.

      <p>
       The article linked actually debunks that claim, the Hebrew word in question is actually pronounced "Nushoh" and the Hebrew spelling for NASA is completely different.

       Those documents weren't "leaked", they were just scientific studies on the Van Allen Belt showing the radiation levels. Yes, technically a person could not survive unshielded. But they
       <em>
        can
       </em>
       get through no problem with proper shielding.

       Lemme summarize the linked video. The Mythbusters go to a giant NASA laser thing and fire a laser at the surface of the moon then the reflector left by an Apollo mission and compare the differences. A scientist who worked on the laser was contacted by a Flat Earth podcast to discuss this episode, and he confirms that shining a laser on the lunar surface won't reflect the laser to Earth, which is exactly what happened. What's the issue over here?

       Those are the only one's I've really examined. It confirms my opinion that most of the rest of these links are probably also just as much BS.

       I watched the one comparing in-flight refuelling to docking with the ISS. Utter tosh. Yes, in-flight refuelling is difficult and dangerous, but that involves two aircraft flying close together, trying to match speeds while one manoeuvres in the dirty air of the one it's refuelling from.
      </p>
      <p>
       Docking with the ISS is obviously performed in a vacuum, and as we all know spacecraft don't fly like aircraft do, so it doesn't matter that they are 'flying' at 17000 mph. It's their speed relative to each other that matters, and docking is performed slowly and carefully.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, the one about 'proving' that rockets can't work in a vacuum because there is no oxygen. That'll be why reaction rocket engines have, as part of their fuel, an oxidant, so combustion can take place.

       This is retarded. All of it. And honestly it just reflects badly on the whole idea of conspiracies that are real that this subject keeps getting propagated when it's not remotely the same as other subjects. You can get yourself a damn telescope and see the ISS. Or is that just a holographic projection?

       So everybody seems to feel very passionately one way or the other on the space hoax. This has always been an interesting debate for me, because I am an aerospace engineering student at a top university. I have worked with multiple professors who have connections all over NASA and various private spaceflight firms. I also have many peers who have worked and work in space systems through NASA or major corporations subcontracted by NASA. Technologies (allegedly) used in space systems often follow from technologies published as far back as the 50s and 60s, when the first spacecraft developments allegedly began.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am genuinely interested in a space denier's response to the question: what is if that you think we're all doing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Are all these people that I personally know, along with myself, just being lied to? Are we just working and collecting salaries for designs that never get implemented? Or, is my whole community conspiring against you all? Are we instead working actively to keep this "hoax" alive? Do you think this very reddit post is part of a psy-op to hide the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think I could argue that this is all real with many of you that have made up your minds. The kinds of sources in the OP go down all sorts of false premises, to draw illogical conclusions stemming from paranoia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, if you disagree with me, at least answer my question

       Work for a large aerospace manufacturer who is a government contractor, and NASA supplier, with a large commercial segment and we employ thousands of engineers of all types (including many aerospace engineers) around the world. What do flat earthers think these people are doing? They're not covering up anything, they're just doing a lot of math and making sure a bunch of electrical systems function properly.

       Hey that's awesome! I'm stuck working retail until I can land a decent internship ha.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ones I've talked to believed that we all genuinely believe in the work we're doing, but "they" take our work and either make something fake, or the stuff we make is fake to begin with and we don't find out before it gets passed along to "them". But as you and I know, with the amount of testing and checking and whatnot it's not that simple.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'd just consider people who think like that ignorant, but not stupid. For people who don't work in the industry, don't live near aerospace facilities, or don't care about aerospace, all they know about NASA comes from the odd rocket launch that makes it onto the news, and stuff from YouTube videos. I can understand their perspective, up to a point. I grew up in Florida, so seeing a rocket go up 3 or 4 times a month was just how life is. But then you have people who live in land-locked-wherever, who literally think rockets don't even exist (I've met people like that). I can sympathize, because in all honesty, it is some pretty unbelievable tech... If you know absolutely nothing about how it works lol

       I don't think 90% of fuckheads here looked at half the links let alone 1/4 of the links. A lot of it so obvious when you break it down. I think people are just afraid to have their world shattered. Sure, a lot of it seems very "wtf" worthy but when you actually analyze pictures and the rover footage (which are probably the most damning evidence we have to show they at least had a set) you can clearly see something else is at work here.

       Until you yourself can somehow break out of our atmosphere and see what is going on out there... We can only take the word of an agency of the executive branch of the United States government to be true...And we know how honest and transparent they are about everything else.

       533 people reached Earth orbit, 24 traveled beyond low Earth orbit and 12 walked on the Moon (supposedly)... but that's it... all the rest of us have no actual clue what is going on out there and we have to realize we're all just trusting our governments for information.

       You do realize that Russia, the UK, France, Iran, Japan, India, Korea, and a few others have all launched satellites, right? Several have sent probes to other planets. The US does not have a monopoly on space. I think of all countries, the religious zealots that run the Islamic Republic of Iran would love to expose the big lie. I guess they're under the control of "the Jews" as well.

       In strange units that are not used outside a few countries, this gives a speed between 65542 mph and 67799 mph.
      </p>
      <p>
       With a range of speed this large, it's not really interesting to point the fact that it contains a certain number that fits certain arbitrary criterion.

       I guess that this refers to the tilt of the Earth compared to the Ecliptic. The tilt is 23.43695°. For an unknown reason, Flat earth people want to compute the complementaray angle of 90°-23.43695 = 66.56305°

       It's 1607 in Jewish gematria, it's 2646 in english gematria and 441 in Simple Gematria which are the standard way of doing gematria. To obtain 666 you have to use the "reverse ordinal" cipher which is a quite obscure way of doing Gematria.

       I actually found a
       <a href="http://www.gematrinator.com/calculator/index.php">
        website
       </a>
       where you can compute the "Gematria" with 27 different ciphers. At some point, people have to understand that this is completely meaningless. With this huge number of possibility, it's not surprising that some expression turns out to give a desired number in one of the 27 different ciphers.

       You felt overwhelmed by a list of clickable links? If you wish to debunk OP (you’ve called this a debate so I presume that’s what you’d like to do if you weren’t so overwhelmed) then I’d suggest starting with the first one and working through them one by one. It wouldn’t be too hard for a genius like you who knows what fish gallop means.

       Sure, but what does that have to do with OP if you're not debating or arguing against any of the points? If you are feeling overwhelmed, start with debating one point. If you're not going to argue any of the points at all, then your comment is a non sequitur.

       You are really not gonna get to me with your manipulative way of discussing things. I'm perfectly aware of what you are doing here, and it's not gonna work on me.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts are on the table. NASA claims they cant pass the Van Allen belt, yet they supposedly did so with the Apollo moon mission. There is the cutting point and anyone who is an honest person with a critical mind in search of the truth will start questioning NASA...not the person who observed this inconsistency. Which is what you are doing here and what you are gonna continue to do here.

       Conversely, the only way to continue to believe in the globe is if you have limited knowledge about human eyesight and basic math. But that's fine if you want to be uneducated, it's your choice.

       Again, in order to observe a particle, you have to physically interact with it. Interaction in order to measure quantities is what is being referred to as "observation" in the article you linked and that interaction is what collapses the wave function and makes photons act like particles.

       The brain controls the entire body, why do you need some sort of "quantum nature" for it to be able to affect how the body works?

       Haha well I just thought there were thousands flying around and that it wouldn't be too much of a task to shut all of us up for all time by producing a simple picture. It wouldn't take much time or money.

       How do you take a picture of a satellite? Are you saying it would be impossible?

       The lies are still all around us. The food pyramid for one is an absolute travesty that was made by selling to the highest bidder, not by whats best for us medically. Thats on the big bruv and the rich elite who lied.

      <p>
       For me anyways, there is enough lies elsewhere and around us to keep us enslaved to the system (rent/mortgage, low wages, etc.) They don't need to lie about space. I can however see why one would believe otherwise too.
