       I agree, calling it a fact is a bit cheeky, but the facts do point to controlled demolition being the likely cause of collapse. Your supposing the number involved would make it impossible to keep secret is a valid point, but science trumps supposition, and the science cannot be ignored. But what of this question of the numbers needed for such an undertaking, realistically what do you suppose they would be? Without throwing random numbers out there, how many do you suppose would be needed and for what actual tasks? It seems to me that those who would have to be in the know might be less than you think. Beyond those who planted the explosives, most others may very well have been working in a compartmented capacity under the assumption that they were dealing with the war games we all know were underway at the time, oblivious to the greater picture unfolding around them, and tongue tied by the official secrets act to speak out about their doubts after the event.

       I was 14 or 15 at the time.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the day was our homeroom class; 15 or so minutes before dismissal, announcements, etc. Whoever came over the mic asked for a moment of silence. Mind you we had been watching or talking about it since my first period study hall at 8:30 that morning.
      </p>
      <p>
       I said for what?
Teacher scolds me.
I said a moment of silence for what? I am sorry people died but this is bullshit. It's all bullshit.
No hesitation she excused me to the disciplinarian, our asst. Principle.
Gladly.
      </p>
      <p>
       I sit outside his office while the teacher and administrator  conduct a phone call, my assumption, with details.
      </p>
      <p>
       Enter small office. Sit in chair. Don't recall the first dialogue; but I do remember my answer: He asks
Are you not a Patriot? Don't you care that America was just attacked?
Attacked by who?, I said. I am a Patriot in so far as I am going to ask questions. Who the fuck just blew up multiple buildings in New York without laying foot in American soil?
Mr. XXxX (not going to give my name out), you do realize this is grounds for expulsion.
(My family in the area was very well known)
Expel me. I've already gotten your state winning football coach fired. I asked a question. A legitimate question everyone should be asking.
You do realize I am a former marine, right?
Then you should know better!
      </p>
      <p>
       With that he dismissed me. I was formally investigate by local authorities within the next few months. Was forced to drop out, continuing investigations my Junior year. Couldn't take it anymore. Social backlash.
      </p>
      <p>
       On my last day of school a couple years later we hadnt spoken since. He was sitting in our cafeteria with the recruiting officers ( I was in ROTC since grade 4, officers training, would bust out 100 pushups for t shirts for my friends daily ) and called me over. Asked if I wanted to say goodbye to anyone, teachers or peers. Make it quick Mr. Xxxxx. I wish you the best. Keep your head up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that he shook my hand and basically said don't doubt yourself to me said he knew I wasn't stupid. Just Naive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe I was stupid. But it's over now and I don't give a fuck. I knew it since day one.

       Yeah, I hear you. I was in Tech School at Lackland air force base in San Antonio, and we were put at defcon 4 after the second plane hit. We were shuffled to the chow hall, then next door to the barracks. I walked into the station to see the towers collapsing. The room was full of airmen crying and talking on phones saying they were OK. The sun shone into the windows. I felt an anger at my country being attacked but it was so foreign so ...forced that I immediately snapped out of it and it seemed like I had woken up. I didn't quite know what it was but I knew that something didn't seem right. It didn't seem real. And not just the surreal nature of the event itself, but the news anchors, the emotion in the air, the buzz...it all felt fake as duck and staged. Like this was what was supposed to happen. Like it had been planned all along. But it had a sterile feeling. As though it was a show.
      </p>
      <p>
       I never forgot that feeling of "waking up," and years later when I started hearing whisperings of the Illuminati and the secret hand behind world affairs, the circuit closed. I knew 9/11 was faked. I know it was fake. And I'm a vet of two branches of the military. I loved the America I grew up in. Now it's a reality TV show past any semblance of entertaining me and now it's just boring. I definitely feel you.

       Thank you for sharing your story.
      </p>
      <p>
       I purposely had my study hall first period. Yay electives. But that while 45 minutes, and of course through the rest of the day, me and a few people were talking about possibilities and the scenario. We were allowed to talk given the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I had been creeping into researching history and dictionaries and word meaning at that time, so I was already building what I would call a skeptic mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do not honestly know how I would react to another happening like that today. I would make more pragmatic choices, that is for sure. More "last straw" drastic.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are multiple merits for our military, our well-being. For defense and advocacy if safety. Subjugation, outright deceit, and bold theft aren't even in the same category. 16 years on and its exactly what they said it would be. I am not surprised or shocked. Dumbfounded would be a most common word to describe it. Gaping jaw and all.

       Exactly. It’s literally just fear-mongering and propaganda.
      </p>
      <p>
       That’s why YouTube and other creative platforms are under heavy fire. It gives the people/citizens/regular civilians the ability to speak to a very large group of people, and practically the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is clearly bad for TPTB, so they push out disinformation on the platform(s) left and right to flood the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       The people hold so much power, but are unable to unify due to division tactics, manipulation and brainwashing.

       It could have been. 
I think it may also be along the lines of subliminal messaging directed towards children.

       If I remember correctly, Didn’t Youtube start to censor with the whole Pewdiepie thing awhile back? It could have been a number of reasons.

       Agreed.  I watched "Art of the Steal" documentary about the Barnes Art Collection and there was a quick part about the families that owned the Big newspapers in the early 1900s being so close to the British Royal family...and I thought wow this has been going media families for a long time.

       I've often pondered this as well, OP.  What would happen if Trump or whoever the current president was came out &amp; admitted there was insider doings that transpired that could be traced back &amp; to whom.  Even if it was the big "I" or a lettered agency that the blame fell squarely on, I wouldn't imagine much would change.
      </p>

       Change will need to come from something closer to home for each of us. When we're quiet, it speaks.  When we speak, it's quiet.

       Apathy and cowardice is how the country and the world ended up the way it is.  To generalize, the average person is not willing to risk anything to oppose corruption, tyranny, and fascism in government.  It's not like they don't know.  They know the 2000 election was illegitimate.  They know the Iraq War was illegal.  They know the 2016 primary was fraudulent.
      </p>
      <p>
       They should be protesting non-stop until there are some sort of results like the Icelanders and the Koreans.  The last check on government corruption when all institutions are compromised is mass civil disobedience.  And it's not for a lack of leadership.  Snowden, Assange, Dennis Kucinich, Ralph Nader and others could be rallying figures but most people seem to be uninterested and dismissive at best, violently vindictive of dissenters at worst.  The masses are failing their own country.

       Pretty tired of people waiting around for some kind of bombshell info that will shock the world. MSM is oversaturating people's brains with way overblown "bombshells". Here's an idea: start getting involved in more ways than prancing down the road with a sign or speculating outcomes on glorified chat rooms. I don't mean to sound so cynical but it's just difficult for me to see everything happening and not feel motivated to take action. I would give examples but I don't believe I'll be alive much longer if I did since the nature of my "hypothetical" methods aren't all that legal.

       I'd be interested to know if Marcus Luttrel (forgot how to spell his last name) believes this. You know, the Navy Seal guy lone survivor from 2005?
