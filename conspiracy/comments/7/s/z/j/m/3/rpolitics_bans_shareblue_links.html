<p>I&#39;m not a Trump guy, but I figure most of/all that downvoting is bots controlled by the establishment powers that be.</p>

<p>If you look at 2015 reddit compared to now. The downvoting intensity is undeniably much more powerful and at typically less popular times of the day.</p>

<p>TPTB probably got caught with their pants down a bit when that Bernie massive rallies across america late 2015 hit &amp; they then invested resources into controlling the online narrative better from 2016 on out.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have an opinion on this ban I don&#39;t know the facts. So I&#39;m not defending this website when I say this. What I know is that ShareBlue was some kind of group formed to manipulate the public, and so I&#39;m just assuming it&#39;s a positive to ban them. </p>

<p>But banning a source because you assume the important stuff with be reported by everyone is a slippery slope. Why do we need anyone but CNN then? If everyone reports everything that is worth reporting anyway, CNN will be enough. </p>

<p>IMO the only reason to ban a source should be if they are purposely misinforming people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Shareblue = DNC = Clinton = NEOliberal (extreme right wing deregulated economics shitty trickle down garbage) and NEOconservative (warmonger foreign policy).</p>

<p>Remember the DNC rigged the primaries against Bernie, ALL corporate media was shitting on Bernie 24/7 (CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, etc. etc. etc.)</p>

<p>Nothing lefty about shareblue, my friends. The (extreme) capitalists (elite central banks, wallstreet, corporations, etc.) controlling our governments have always been extremist right wing maniacs. They want us to believe &quot;Democrat VS Republican&quot; is left vs right when in reality it&#39;s just two slightly different shades of extreme right. </p>

<p>Whatever happened to anti-establishment non-authoritarian versions of: center left, centrist and slightly right wing? Replaced with extremism thanks to the brainwashing MSM.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>True, but I didn&#39;t want to comment on Trump because of the small possibility that
there really is a &quot;4D chess&quot; power struggle of sorts. Not that I buy that theory but just trying to
be catious on who I criticize for now. I don&#39;t want people to blindly worship Trump like
he can do no wrong/&quot;god emperor&quot; bullshit. </p>

<p>But I also don&#39;t want him to be victim of a coup
and replaced with someone even worse like Pence or Clinton. 
But yes, the Trump administration is still NEOliberal and NEOconservative.
Whether that was Trump&#39;s true intention, I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t know his actual pre-campaign leanings
other than he considered himself a &quot;Democrat&quot; (whatever that means anymore).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah man this is basically my Trump judgement journey:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Trump stops TPP (yay, maybe he&#39;ll be half as good as Bernie!)</p></li>
<li><p>later, Trump administration does stupid shit like warmonger crap like the previous administration would have, false flag attack, &quot;fire and fury&quot; shit, etc. and a tax reform that seems to give permanent tax breaks for the super rich. (&quot;Ugh so he was a shill afterall! FUCK THE TWO PARTY SYSTEM!!!&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>Saudi prince and hollywood scandals (&quot;hmm....could it be 4D chess? Are pro-Trump anti-deep state forces involved in this?&quot;)</p></li>
<li><p>Then Trump administration does more stupid shit (removing net neutrality for example). 
When&#39;s he going to get to universal healthcare and ending globalist economics?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So I keep changing my mind but of course I believe there are real paid shills from T_D (plus brainwashed people).
I particularly get skeptical when someone from there repeats here the whole &quot;THIS PLACE IS OVERRUN WITH r/POLITICS 
SHARE EA BLUE! LIBERULIZM IS A MENTAL ILLNESS, MUH LIB vs CON, GET ON THE TRUMP TRAIN LOSERS&quot; like what am I supposed to think with that blatant shilling lol? Those shills can&#39;t even admit the Trump administration is doing dodgy stuff and often they engage in divide and conquer, pro-two party system statements.</p>

<p>r/politics and r/The_Donald are both infested with shills, even at the MOD LEVEL. It&#39;s like saying only Democrats are corrupt when arguably Republicans are even more corrupt (although I don&#39;t play the lesser evil vs greater evil garbage psyop game, both parties are two shades of NEOliberal far right, even the Libertarian party is extreme right).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know much about Q and whether he/she is a genuine non-LARP &quot;white hats&quot; force or just a &quot;black hat&quot; deep state shill trying to stall us and get us to accept shitty things the administration does and think it&#39;s just 4D chess.
You can tell I&#39;m a bit confused and switch back and forth between &quot;wait give Trump a chance&quot; and &quot;wait no, it&#39;s a trick, Trump
is controlled, we have to replace him with someone decent!&quot;</p>

<p>Man if this is a good cop vs bad cop bullshit psyop, I&#39;ll be mad. We can&#39;t let the Trump administration do whatever
it wants regardless of whether we believe Trump is in control or not. I wonder how long it would take to actually
&quot;drain the swamp&quot;. Hypothetically, would a genuine anti-establishment Trump try to undo the blackmail
that links everyone in corrupt circles? &quot;Hey George, I know you want out and they have footage of you money laundering for them, but do this for me and by X date we might take down the top of the pyramid without repercussions&quot;.
Sounds like a movie plot but who really knows what&#39;s going on. Maybe it&#39;s not as black and white as we think.
There are bad people on Trump&#39;s side too, what could it mean? </p>

<p>Is it like gray like Britain&#39;s Brexit? Remaining would
mean staying in the control of the center right to far right corrupt NEOliberal EU (so called &quot;good cop&quot;) but leaving it might land Britain in a Tory/Conservative extremist right wing hell hole (bad cop). Although I suspect there is a better, left wing route for Brexit, somehow keeping
the GOOD EU laws/regulations and trashing the crappy ones and getting a decent government for once! (Like the Jeremy Corbyn fellow, he speaks truth.)</p>

<p>Man, I think it was a bad idea removing net neutrality, because there might be a psyop move
to &quot;bring it back due to high popularity&quot; but actually be a modified corporate trojan horse. If they pull that one,
I think it would be safe to say &quot;if it was so popular, why did you go against the will of the people IN THE FIRST PLACE!&quot; :o 
So I would call bullshit in that case.</p>

<p>Only course of action I have for now, is campaign for getting money out of politics, nationalize the FED, end the treasonous CIA and secret societies, boycott the corporate media, get people to choose more moderate politics instead of the corporate extremists Dem vs Repub near-false dichotomy, maybe Independents like Green party, wake people up about the elite, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Romney is even worse than Obama. IMO, virtually all Republican and most Democrat politicians are too corrupt/controlled and extreme.</p>

<p>Some suggested Tulsi Gabbard (Bernie supporter) but some argued she might be controlled due to being in the Council on Foreign Relations so it&#39;s unclear if she&#39;s trustworthy. Plus the DNC already rigged the primaries against Bernie, what&#39;s to stop them doing it again with another anti-establishment candidate?</p>

<p>I feel that there are a few possible routes that might be better than the corrupt two party system.</p>

<p>Getting money out of politics before 2020, might just give me confidence in voting Dem again if a candidate has zero corporate/banking donors. Repubs have been insane for a long time and usually worse than Dem candidates usually.</p>

<p>Another route would be to campaign for Dr. Jill Stein of the Green party.</p>

<p>And finally, forming a new independent party.</p>

<p>Not sure if there&#39;s any other options but I feel we don&#39;t have much of a chance with corrupt media and parties so getting money out of politics is a big hurdle we NEED to overcome (I believe).
Otherwise rigging will be as easy as last time.</p>

<p>More people demanding the removal of money in politics, will speed up the process.</p>

<p>Nationalizing the federal reserve and ending the CIA might also reduce the power of the elites in terms of interfering with democracy.</p>

<p>We need alternative media channels. The MSM is largely propaganda. </p>

<p>I only really trust people like Bernie, Jill Stein, Ralph Nader, etc. basically the Green party. But it&#39;s almost hopeless unless the conflicts of interests are gone and the people start voting a reasonable candidate.</p>

<p>Sorry I can&#39;t offer more advice, but I definitely don&#39;t trust shills like Zuckerberg, Opera and other Clinton clones. Puppets are usually celebrities or have corporate donations and super PACs, dodgy track record/history, suspicious links, extremist policies, flip flops, lies, adoration from the MSM, etc.</p>

<p>Reddit could really help with campaigning for removing money from politics but shills tend to downvote that stuff unless genuine users outdo them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, fundraising for what? (Maybe I&#39;m out of the loop.)
If you mean the Dem party wasting Bernie supporters&#39; donations by rigging the primaries, yeah that&#39;s unfortunate. But on the bright side, millions have heard Bernie&#39;s message worldwide which wouldn&#39;t have been possible in this rigged system had the people not donated. I hope the remaining unspent money didn&#39;t go to the DNC, that would be like rubbing salt in the wound.</p>

<p>Getting money out of politics before 2020, might make it possible and easier to beat the establishment next time with a real Bernie-like candidate, whether it be an independent or reformed Dem. Without getting money out of politics, I don&#39;t trust the Dems or Repubs, with rigging being just one reason to hate the two party system. Money out of politics or GTFO!
Because who&#39;s to say the rigging won&#39;t happen again? I feel like America got played, in multiple ways. </p>

<p>There’s many reasons, but probably number one is pragmatism. It’s simply cheaper, in the medium and long run, to provide good social services to everyone. It’s way cheaper to run a nice mental health hospital than a jail. Way cheaper to distribute aid than military actions. Way cheaper to build roads and schools than walls.
