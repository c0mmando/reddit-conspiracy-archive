    <div class="md"><p>That guy is a total scam.  He failed years ago in an attempt to drag gun-owners into a trap, an armed march on DC, total setup for his handlers.  Anyone who joined his fake cause would have been open-carrying on Federal Property and you just know they planned to have agent provocateurs to make it a real mess for anyone foolish enough to go.  Luckily he failed to draw any groups, so the fbi worked this new fake candidate horseshit you&#39;re falling for.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If he got pinched for ganja its kinda his own fault . Sure maybe the dog false alerted. But if he had flowers that also could be why the dog alerted. When u are a activist celebrity u know the crosshairs gona be on u, especially in an rv. Weed in texas still draconian af. Plus his papers weren&#39;t in order. Just saying this isn&#39;t as gross of a violation of rights as the op makes it sound. Unless of course these are all trumped up charges such as he had no herb &amp; they made it up. Now if he was trying to get arrested to protest illegal bud or the tyranny of legal vehicle documents, then i can dig it but as its framed i see no disproportionate victimization. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im saying everybody knows dogs give false alerts but if he actually had weed it makes little difference. I think dogs alerting as the basis for suspicion is dubious and should not legal. I also think weed should be legal. It matters little what I think though.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Law enforcement said he has possession of Marijuana. Marijuana is illegal to possess in the state of Texas. He broke the law. They arrested him. Many parts of Texas stopped arresting people on marijuana possession less than one ounce. Obviously the Decatur area hasn&#39;t.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I said I met the man, I didn&#39;t say I was close friends with him. So I&#39;m not going to speak on his behalf. </p>

<p>What I will do is maybe shed some light on how most Libertarians view drugs. Drugs in most cases are what is called a victimless crime. That means if you ask the state to produce a victim they can&#39;t, in most cases that is because the only victim in the court room that day is the accused. </p>

<p>So now we can talk about what happened here and the language of this post. I personally disagree with the language. Adam and many other members of the liberty movement tend to flex there rights to there fullest extent. Now I don&#39;t really feel like investing the full half hour to watch this start to finish but I did skim through it. It appears to me that this is a clear act of civil disobedience. He made the cops pull out all the stops he flexed every right he was legally allowed to. Still he was arrested, this arrest like many of his others and many others by people who feel the way he does is an act of protest. Your right he had drugs on him he was arrested for that, the question isn&#39;t about if this is a crime or not, this is a question of should it be illegal or not. </p>

<p>So to recap, if you don&#39;t believe that pot possession or victimless crime in general is constitutional then this arrest would be unlawful. Again I disagree with that language, I see this detainment and tax money going to charging and possibly jailing this guy as a act of protest. You live in Texas? How do you feel about the tax dollars that where forcibly taken from you being spent to mess with this harmless guy? I honestly hope he goes to jail and forces the state to waste boat load of cash to do it. Only way they will ever listen is if you make it about money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Adan was arrested on drug charges in Texas? He was arrested for possession, which means it was less than two ounces. Many counties in Texas have recently decided to not arrest people for possession anymore. A lot of counties, particularly in the DFW area, won&#39;t even charge you with anything if you have less than an ounce. I&#39;m not speaking from personal experience or anything, I have friends in law enforcement that have informed me of this. Decatur must be more strict. It is way the fuck out there in the middle of nowhere.</p>
