       it's a distinct possibility trump fires mueller. it would seem to be the only way in trump's mind he can end the investigation that more and more seems to be closing in on him. what happens then though? massive street protests that turn ugly? will the republicans finally find a backbone and move to impeach?

       Unlikely.    But it could happen and if it does,  this country would be so close to civil war,   that "to restore order" in "a time of Russian threats"   the military could intervene,  and either eliminate or elevate Trump to interim dictator as we have seen as "temporary measures" in other "democracies".
      </p>
      <p>
       Or Trump himself could try to dissolve Congress at least temporarily on the rationale that they are incapable of functioning,  which is unfortunately,  the case,  all they can do is rubber stamp the occassional steamrollered corporate agenda,  as in tax cuts,  or in military increases,  or giving FISA and NSA powers.     If Trump temporarily dissolved congress and demanded the blessing of the supreme court to schedule new elections,  then Trump would also probably revoke the operating licenses of the FAKE news,   and begin daily briefings directly out of his administration for direct public consumption.    Trump does not have the mayors on his side, be he seems to have the governors on his side.    Does Trump have the county sheriffs on his side,  probably,   and the state troopers and the national guard.
      </p>
      <p>
       I always imagined Trump as a dictator,    but then whats been going on for many decades has also been a dictatorship,  just a more farcical one that should have been enough to wake the people up.   They didn't vote for Jill,   they said yes to the two party dictatorship,  and this is the natural conclusion to that.

       So you're saying you want Trump to be a dictator?  You know there's nothing stopping him from giving daily briefs, right?  Or are you implying he will do this in an empty room and broadcast it on the internet?

       Oh,  god damn,  please stop it.    We are wasting our time with this kind of thing where you make up that I am a Trump supporter because I hate Hillary kind of shit.    I voted for Jill,  and you should have too.

       As far as what a dictator does,   you have had your whole damn life to study one right under your nose,   so tell me,  how the propaganda is dolled out,  you don't need me to tell you.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        During the late afternoon of August 7, 1974, Senators Goldwater and Scott and Representative Rhodes met with Nixon in the Oval Office and told him that his support in Congress had all but disappeared. Rhodes told Nixon that he would face certain impeachment when the articles came up for vote in the full House. Goldwater and Scott told the president that there were not only enough votes in the Senate to convict him, but that no more than 15 or so Senators were willing to vote for acquittal – far fewer than the 34 he needed to avoid removal from office.[106][107] They did not pressure Nixon to resign, but simply made the realities of the situation clear. Goldwater later wrote that as a result of the meeting, Nixon "knew beyond any doubt that one way or another his presidency was finished."[108]

       Immediately you would see a massive public protest - that day or the next day. The senate would almost immediately re-appoint him. You would likely also see massive leaks even more so than we already have. You might see any sealed indictments unsealed. The government would grind to a halt. The DOW and S&amp;P would have a big week drop. Trump would find it difficult to fill the replacement for sessions that he wants (cause this theory means he needs to fire sessions, rosenstein and potentially one or two more senior DOJ officials). If the house has Trump's back he may survive but it would be an avalanche of blue in the midterms. And Trump would be impeached and removed in February of 2019... assuming he hasn't resigned or died by then.

       I don't know, but I can tell you what will happen if he Mueller makes a move against Trump: we've sat back for a long time waiting for you all to tucker yourself out with your little temper tantrum because you didn't win the election but you really really wanted to because
       <em>
        it was her turn.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Well, watching you for the past year has been annoying as shit but harmless, if you move to subvert democracy to your whims with trumped (heh) up charges, thereby destroying the legitimacy of the federal government, the streets will flow with liberal blood.
