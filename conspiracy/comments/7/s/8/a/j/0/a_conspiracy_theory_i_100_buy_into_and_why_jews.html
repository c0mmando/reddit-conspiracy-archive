        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So there is a thread in /askreddit about conspiracy theories.</p>

<p>Many many people on this website don&#39;t believe there are differences between the races, or don&#39;t believe races exists at all. I think the reason for this is intentional, to make people more accepting of multiculturalism in white nations. I think the driving reason for this is that jews feel more comfortable in multicultural societies.</p>

<p>Also Nick Berg was a mossad agent who helped plan 9/11. The Iraq war was for Israels benefit. Saddam had launched SCUDs at Israel and was a very real existential threat for the small nation, so they used their favorite tactic of the false flag to get the world superpower to fight the war for them</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Idk why everyone wants to say Israel is 100% responsible for 9/11..</p>

<p>It was our own US government that probably planned a majority of it. Guys like the bushes, Guiliani and lucky Larry all got a piece of the pie. </p>

<p>9/11 has been most beneficial to the US NWO elites. They made/make tons of money off it. </p>

<p>But people here think that Israel planned the whole thing and the us government fell for it and invaded the Middle East as a result of being tricked.</p>

<p>No, all the major powerful factions got together and planned this shit out. Including the US run military industrial complex.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In any good detective story there are a few classic questions that need answers. The 9/11 attacks are no exception. First question: Who benefits? Second question: Who had motive? Third question: Who had opportunity?
Specifically for 9/11, there are a few questions that need answers. Who had the authority to tell NORAD to stand down? Who had access to the basements of towers 1 and 2? Why did tower 7 fall in place when there was no plane collision and a very small fire? Why have all three tower ben the <strong>only</strong> towers, before or since, ever to have fallen from &quot;fire&quot;? 
Fill in the blanks with truth and the light will appear.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The invasion of Iraq was for Israels benefit and wouldn&#39;t have been possible without public support. That public support came from 9/11. </p>

<p>Yes informed people knew the hijackers weren&#39;t Iraqis but the news media just saying that Saddam was responsible was enough to get the war approved. Afghanistan I&#39;m not too sure about honestly.</p>

<p>Israel 100% NEEDED america to get involved in the middle east. It&#39;s the same reason Qaddafi was killed, and why Obama funded &#39;moderate Syrian rebels&#39; and was an inch away from ordering the military into Syria.</p>

<p>If what I&#39;m saying is wrong, then they are extremely lucky that 9/11 occurred and Saddam somehow took the heat for it. The middle east would be a lot more dangerous for Israel if instead of the chaos it is now America never invaded and Iraq just grew it&#39;s economy, trade relations, military alliances, developed more and better missiles </p>

<p>However, there are elite jews who yield lots of finacial power, and the reason white nations import lots of non white immigrants is because ethnic nationalism is a threat to these jews.

<p>Also, if they felt so comfortable in multicultural societies, why then, would they want to establish an apartheid nation state in the form of Israel that is increasingly for Jewish people only?</p>

<p>You are oversimplifying the geopolitics, Israel did certainly benefit from the Iraq war and from 9/11 and they may have had a hand in it, but don&#39;t believe for a second that they were alone in this, the US Govt, the British and many other Western nations also had a vested interest in what happened in Sept. 2001.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jews want multiculturalism in white nations because they want to prevent Hitlers from being possible again. They don&#39;t want a populist leader saying that the government and the country should exclusively work for the interests of the people of the nation. They don&#39;t want someone coming in and nationalizing a countries central bank.</p>

<p>And sorry I am oversimplifying. There is an inner elite circle of (((international globalists))). Jews I&#39;m sure own the majority of shares in the federal reserve. </p>

<p>Obviously they don&#39;t want multiculturalism in Israel. And lots of just regualr every day jews don&#39;t want to live in multiculral countries</p>

<p>But why is sweden and germany importing millions upon millions of non whites? So that white ethnic nationalism will never again threaten globalism. The small amount of elite jews are powerful enough to make it happen, despite it clearly not being in the best interests of the swedes or germans</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You have a point to an extent, there is a high proportion of Jewish people on the Federal Reserve and as major shareholders in large banks, but what is seldom spoke of is that they are outnumbered, they are outnumbered by whites, and the trouble is, I never hear about the Whites who own the federal reserve.
This talk is one of their (Deep State) tactics of divide and rule. They work across racial diversities, but they work against the 99% in their own interests, this is why I fight against talk dividing us into gender lines, racial lines and so forth. </p>

<p>And the importing of millions of people from other ethnicities is most likely to divide society further, if you see it on a base level, there is nothing at all wrong with multiculturalism, we&#39;re all the same species. However, they need to divide societies so that they can continue implementing their policies without people fighting back, keep people separated and they cannot unite; and they know that importing people from African nations for example will create huge divides in society.</p>

<p>&quot;Tribes and nations across the world and across history have cared for those injured, weaker than themselves, less fortunate. </p>

<p>It is only &quot;human nature&quot; to allow the weak to suffer if you also believe it is &quot;human nature&quot; to be completely selfish and isolationist in all respects. To hunt only for onesself, and to hoard their belongings like a dragon. </p>

<p>If you want to run off and live in the woods like a &quot;predatory man&quot; and die alone in the cold when you fail to succeed in hunting, or you&#39;re injured thus that you cannot hunt and feed yourself, I will still wish to feed you, to heal you, because humankind in its entirety ought to be brothers. </p>

<p>If you want to talk about family units, then speak of them - they help each other to survive. The same altruism extends to friends and friends of friends, and familiarity breeds fondness, which breeds a desire to protect and nurture. And thus, we have a tribal unit. Then tribes make alliances and help each other, and we have nations. </p>

<p>Human nature is to find other humans and protect each other, and provide for each other. To deny the human power of empathy and desire to protect is... well, frankly, ridiculous. We have artefacts and graves and remains of people throughout history showing that humans cared deeply for the &quot;useless&quot; members of their tribe - buried with honors, recorded with fondness, protected and supported even when they could not &#39;provide&#39; for the tribe. </p>

<p>People help those around them, at the cost of themselves. Humans will throw themselves into floods and flames to help a stranger - often killing themselves in the process. Humans will refuse to leave the site of a cave in, refuse to rest in favor of helping to shift the rubble until everyone inside has been taken out. </p>

<p>Maybe the difference is that I believe humans are good, and at their cores DO want to be happy with their fellows, while you think they are inherently selfish and isolationist. </p>

<p>I believe we should provide safety and comfort to those without. </p>

<p>because THAT is human nature.&quot;</p>

<p>Totall disagree, but I love you</p>

Overall though I agree with you entirely and its ridiculous so many people are afraid to speak up about it. Multiculturalism is designed to destabilize the western world. What has increased diversity brought us besides more fear and increased restriction of rights? This is not about hating other races or cultures, its about using common sense and recognizing how insane it is to just dump millions of people from radically different cultures into small nations and expect things to go over smoothly. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The term “race” has many definitions, ranging from a family unit to a species, but in common and medical usage, defining “race” has meant separating Homo sapiens into three to six groups.This division of Homo sapiens into race taxons started in the 18th century, when the sciences of genetics and evolutionary biology were not yet invented. These disciplines have since shown that human race taxonomy has no scientific basis. Race categories are social constructs, that is, concepts created from prevailing social perceptions without scientific evidence. Despite modern proof that race is arbitrary biological fiction, racial taxons are still used widely in medical teaching, practice, and research. Human diversity is inconsistently taught in medical schools and erratically presented in medical texts. Race taxons have been “medicalized”; that is, race groupings have been legitimized by their use in medical literature and practice as acceptable descriptive labels that are integral to the proper diagnosis and treatment of disease in humans. Assumptions about disease that are made because a race has been assigned can result in important negative consequences for individual patients and inaccurate genetic inferences for populations.</p>

<p>The fourth root race, the Atlantean, according to Theosophy arose approximately 4,500,000 years ago in Africa from the fourth subrace of the Lemurians in a part of Africa that had been colonized by that subrace in the area now inhabited by the Ashanti.[11] </p>

<p>According to Theosophists the first Atlantean subrace was the result of the last, or seventh Lemurian subrace Chankshusha Manu which migrated first to the south of the Atlantean continent and, from there, migrated further north. The esoteric name of Atlantis is Kusha.[8] The Atlantean root race had Mongolian features; they began with bronze skin and gradually evolved into the red American Indian, brown Malayan, and yellow Mongolian races, because some Atlanteans eventually migrated to the Americas and Asia. The seven subraces of the Atlantean root race were</p>

<p>the Rmoahal
the Tlavati (Cro-Magnons)
the Toltec (a term which Theosophists use as a synonym for the Atlantean ancestors of the American Indians)
the Turanian
the (original Semites i.e. Phoenicians)
the Akkadians, and
the Mongolian, which migrated to and colonized Central Asia East Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>

Race is an anthropological concept that was used to justify taking land and resources from people of other cultures. The rejection of this concept isn&#39;t a conspiracy. I can&#39;t say the concept of race itself was a conspiracy but the way it was used justified the use of conspiratorial thinking. It made imperialism seem justified.<br/>
Also, race is not culture. 
Also, I&#39;m not sure what nations you mean by &quot;white nations.&quot;<br/>

    <div class="md"><p>Many conspiracy theorists frequent 4Chan, 8Chan, etc., or did when they were young. Groups like Stormfront saw the friendless virgins on there and knew they would be an easy target for recruitment. &quot;Hey, you might be a bottom feeder, but at least you&#39;re not black or one of those evil Jews.&quot; They got to belong to something, the conspiracies were interesting, and made them &quot;woke.&quot; That&#39;s my conspiracy theory for the bigotry we&#39;re seeing. </p>
