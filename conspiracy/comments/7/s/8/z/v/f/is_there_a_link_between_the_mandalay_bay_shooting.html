    <div class="md"><p>It is likely that any large luxury hotel in the United States has some sort of connection to Middle Easter power brokers. The sovereign funds of oil rich states spend incredible amounts buying assets in the US. Norway also does this at similar rates with their oil proceeds. Notable a lack of Norwegian conspiracy theories discussed on here. They would be the last we would expect . . . hmmmmm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Probably not, although that is the most interesting theory. </p>

<p>The man being escorted through Tropicana, which is often theorized as being the Prince, is more likely a hispanic security guard guiding police through the lobby. Likely in response to an erroneous report of shooters there. Often after mass shootings there is panic and false reports made in the confusion. They had to treat every report as bonafide until proven otherwise. </p>

<p>It is weird how one officer sweeps the crowd with his rifle. That is not SOP. </p>

<p>Anyhow, if the Prince was the individual in the video, it beggars belief that they would escort a high value target in the middle of a crowded lobby. Would have used an alternative exit with less exposure. </p>

<p>So, thinking logically, it is exceedingly unlikely that the Tropicana incident is related to a Saudi-Paddock nexus. </p>

<p>I invite responses from those with other viewpoints, glad to discuss further my perspective. </p>

<p>Also, the guys were guns were obviously not escorting anyone given that they had zero coverage at the rear. </p>

<p>The men with guns were acting like dangerous idiots pointing their guns at innocent people, but it was likely because the attack had just happened and no one knew what was going on or if more attacks were to come. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well one of the main owners of the four seasons (where the shooting actually happened) is alaweed bin talal. He is a Saudi billionaire who was recently arrested during the coup. He is rumored to be imprisoned at the four seasons Riyadh. A direct connection has not been shown afaik. But I think it&#39;s an easy conclusion  to draw if you believe paddock was running a honeypot for wahabbis.</p>
