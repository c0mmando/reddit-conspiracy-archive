        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">290</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/cpunk.html">cpunk</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>tldr; Since at least 2012, in order to comply with the Inspector General&#39;s requirements to investigate sexual crimes committed by FBI Agents, the FBI has an internal database that retains all text messages sent or received
from Special Agent&#39;s phone for 25 years. So when the FBI says they &quot;lost&quot; Peter Strzok&#39;s text messages, they are either bald face liars, or their system for compliance with the IG is so broken that there is no way to retain text message evidence for over 343 annual incidents of sexual crimes committed by FBI Agents each year.</p>

<p>First, read this 2015 Inspector General report about Sexual Harassment at the FBI, DEA, ATF and USMS.</p>

<p><a href="https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2015/e1504.pdf">https://oig.justice.gov/reports/2015/e1504.pdf</a></p>

<p>On this page, after being confronted by the IG about how the FBI has no system
to retain the text messages of its Special Agents on their Government issues
cell phones in order to use as evidence in sexual harassment cases, the FBI
reports back that they can now have a system that can archive all text messages
sent or received.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f46.png">http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f46.png</a></p>

<p>On this page, the FBI says it uses an internal database to proactively monitor
the text messages of all 35,000+ of its Special Agents, all of whom hold Top
Secret Clearance. Meaning there is some team within FBI, or some outsourced
Contractor, who&#39;s job is to scan the text messages of FBI Agents looking for
evidence of them breaking the law or violating FBI policies.</p>

<p>Most importantly, note the sentence saying the FBI&#39;s database stores all FBI Agents text
messages for 25 years. And you Uncleared Proles thought you had it bad being illegally spied on
by the NSA, who only &quot;memorialize&quot; all of your text messages for up to 10 years in &quot;offline storage&quot; at Bluffdale. Being a Fed, you have it much worse. :P</p>

<p>By the way, wouldn&#39;t it be a crying shame if the third party contractor running database containing of all
FBI Agent&#39;s text messages got hacked by some Guccifer 3.0, and then dumped on Wikileaks, revealing the entire text message history of the entire FBI to the world? ;)</p>

<p>Assange was prescient when he stated in &quot;Governance by Conspiracy&quot; in 2006 that the Deep State has a game theoretic strong strategic asymmetric disadvantage in InfoWar, because they have more secrets to keep about themselves, and thus more to lose.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f48.png">http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f48.png</a></p>

<p>Why does it matter if the FBI can&#39;t just declare &quot;whoopsie-daisy, we lost our Agent&#39;s text messages, so we can&#39;t give them to you for oversight, so get lost pal.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f4k.png">http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f4k.png</a></p>

<p>On this page is says the FBI has for the first time been compelled by the Court to
turn over their Agent&#39;s text messages in a criminal case, but by failing to turn them
over, the defendant was acquitted by the Jury.</p>

<p>This matters because what does it means if the FBI&#39;s text message database is as stable and reliable as
an Excel spreadsheet emailed around by interns in a DNC office in DC (his name was...)?</p>

<p>It means Obama&#39;s FBI completely lost control over its ability to secure any
chain of evidence, jeapordizing every case they bring for prosecution to the
DOJ, and obliterating their ability to function in doing their job! </p>

<p>It means the FBI no longer exists! </p>

<p>It means now CRIME IS LEGAL!</p>

<p>If the FBI can&#39;t retain evidence, they can&#39;t win convictions, which means
all the crooks they prosecute go free.</p>

<p>&quot;What exactly is it that you do here Bob?&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f4k.png">http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f4k.png</a></p>

<p>What are the consequences of the FBI no longer being capable of investigating its own Agent&#39;s text messages
because &quot;the dog ate my homework&quot;?</p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f4t.png">http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f4t.png</a></p>

<p>That page shows the 343 instances of sexual crimes commited by the 35,344 FBI Special Agents in 2012.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f4v.png">http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f4v.png</a></p>

<p><a href="http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f4x.png">http://i.magaimg.net/img/2f4x.png</a></p>

<p>Those 2 pages show:</p>

<p>56 Agents got busted jacking off in their Government issued vehicle or White Surveillance Van across the street from your house while watching your little daughter take a shower through the walls using some future-tech infrared back scatter porno-scanner camera.  </p>

<p>9  Agents fucked criminals</p>

<p>21 Agents fucked hookers</p>

<p>10 Agents committing rape</p>

<p>11 Agents committing rape of a minor</p>

<p>7  Agents got busted with CP of lil&#39; pizzas</p>

<p>7  Agents fucked their paid Confidential Informants</p>

<p>3  Agents exposed their dicks</p>

<p>3  Agents video taped naked women</p>

<p>1  Agent is a swinger</p>

<p>1  Agent went to a nudie bar on duty</p>

<p>Beyond covering up for Crooked Hillary, beyond covering up for Cuck Comey,
beyond covering up for Cankle Lynch, beyond covering up for Handkerchief-Map
Podesta, beyond covering up a litany of shocking Crimes against the State by
untouchable 7FG Shadow Government plutocrats, if the FBI&#39;s own text message
retention database is this goddamned busted, and can&#39;t even do what it was
designed for, why the hell should the American people extend one lick of trust
to the FBI to be able to police its own in-house sexual predators, kiddie
diddlers, rapists, peeping toms, Johns, upskirters, wife-swappers and otherwise
degenerate perverts who have been entrusted with Top Secret Clearance who are
just one sex crime away from pulling an Aldrich Ames, selling out the Bureau to
the KGB in exchange for a suit case of cash and a clean get away from
prosecution to a new life in Moscow?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually, it is an xpost, but not from where you think. :P</p>

<p>I am banned on t_d, because I come too hard with the real conspiracy shit that would basically force any logical reader to immediately conclude that America is not only beyond saving, but that it no longer exists, because the Deep State has taken over via a silent coup d&#39;etat that has been 71 years in the making, and only accelerating after 9/11, before finally concluding in the total consolidation of power in the MIC after the Praetorian Guard palace coup against Trump.</p>

<p>I had originally posted this to 8ch, but it mysteriously got deleted within about 1 hour. This is not the first time I have had my posts of original conspiracy research with sources and citations of this nature deleted off 8ch. I have even been IP banned off 8ch. And I&#39;m not some shrieking lunatic LARP posting spam or JTRIG-bait.</p>

<p>Make of that what you will about which certain public forums are compromised and subtlety censored in order to produce certain effects in shaping consciousness on a population scale in order to supposedly control the chaos (which in reality only finds another unexpected safety valve to blow.)</p>
