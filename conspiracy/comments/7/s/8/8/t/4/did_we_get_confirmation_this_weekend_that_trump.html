       This is my first ever post to Reddit. To be honest I am more than a little nervous I am going to do something incorrectly. I have read the rules of the forum - and spent time reading threads over the last couple of months even before I wrote out this theory. I think that I am within the paramenters with this post. If that is not the case, please let me know or move/edit/delete the post.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is probably going to be long. Mostly because I'm a blowhard. But also because I'm a Jew. Is it up to the OP (is that still a term?) to write the tl;dr?
      </p>
      <p>
       It is also not going to be sequential - I will jump around a bit. Hopefully it is tied together enough to make sense even though I am positive I will leave stuff out that I meant to include.
      </p>
      <p>
       Disclaimer: I am guessing that I am not the first person to have this theory. I am hopefully the first one to commit it to Reddit and with as much detail and if lucky something resembling circumstantial/analogical/character evidence. Any likeness to another ridiculously too long, sanctimonious, self-aggrandizing theory is purely coincidental. Although I would be happy to know I am not alone in my lunacy, but at the same time sad knowing that someone else has the unfortunate luck to be saddled with a similar mindset to my own. Here we go:
      </p>
      <p>
       My theory is that President Trump, unbeknownst to him, is the president in name only. A giant fiction has been created around him to ensure that he is treated like the president which is all that he is really interested in anyhow imo. This fiction was created once it became apparent that there would be no shift to a presidential demeanor. The senior staff as well as military/intelligence leaders realized that Trump was both clueless and reckless. But they also understood that because he had literally no idea how the government and office of the president worked they could use that to guard against his worst (only?) impulses.
      </p>
      <p>
       A helpful frame of reference for this theory is to think of a guy who started a company 65 years ago. Let's call him the boss. The boss built it a successful business and it is still thriving today. However, about 20 years ago the boss started to show signs of decreasing mental capacities. Eventually his kids took control of the company, but they let the old man keep his office and keep his title of boss. Although almost completely senile he can still physically move around well for his age and still understands he built the company. He comes to the office a couple of times a week and walks the floor and interacts with employees who all play the game with him, well aware of his condition. He still thinks nothing has changed and he's calling the shots, but he thinks its 1996.
      </p>
      <p>
       In this theory replace the boss' senility with Trump's total lack of knowledge of the job as president and even less interest in learning about it. Like the boss, Trump thinks he is in charge. But unlike the boss who has no power in the company, Trump still has all the powers of the presidency only he doesn't know what any of them are. And this fiction has been created to keep it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       My guess is that immediately following his first security briefing as the president-elect the people in that room, already worried, went into panic mode. They saw a man who would be president who had none of the aptitude needed for the position and was unable to sit through an hour long meeting getting acquainted with the major issues facing his incoming administration. He asked ridiculous questions mostly about nuclear weapons, didn't understand basic facts or geography or any protocols and would do what his former advisor Sam Nunberg called "pulling down on his lip and his eyes rolling back in his head" when he tried to walk him through Constitutional amendments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Clapper, Hayden, Brennan, Comey, Rogers, etc were so alarmed they started working on constructing this Truman Show type existence for the president. They were relying on the president's lack of any knowledge and more so on his lack of interest in learning anything related to the nuts and bolts of the government to keep him from doing something catastrophic. But they couldn't control what people told him he could do from behind the Resolute Desk. They needed to put in redundancies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone who had spent time with Trump during the campaign was well aware of his non existent knowledge, but also his tendencies. They were worried too. So when the briefers came to the senior staff of the incoming admin to put their plan into action all were on board. They needed to keep the circle small, they couldn't run the risk of someone on the periphery finding out and telling the president or the media.
      </p>
      <p>
       Note: when we hear about the "Deep State" the people who put this plan into action is who is being referred to. And for lack of a better term and just because it's more fun I will refer to them as such.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Deep State was concerned that Reince, as COS, could handle the lead from inside the WH, but they had little choice. They couldn't strong arm Trump into picking someone they approved. They worried that Reince wouldn't be able to manage the small group of the staffers who were brought inside nor manage the president. Their worries were soon realized when it became clear the president walked all over Reince. His lack of control meant that they had to expand the circle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Initially the circle included just the highest level of aides/staffers: Reince, Pence, Conway, some of the Cabinet (SOS, SecDef, Homeland Security, etc) as well as Mitch (and his wife), Ryan and Hatch in Congress. McCain was involved in the original incarnation of the plan, but since he was soon ill he didn't have much day to day responsibility. Spicer was brought in almost immediately when Reince spilled the beans to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Almost more important than who was in was who was out: Jared, Ivanka, Gorka, Miller, Sessions, Bannon, Flynn, etc. The general rule was that they could only bring in those who weren't related and weren't interested in blowing anything up. The constant battle was keeping those on the outside from educating the president about his new powers. That meant someone inside needed to always be with the president. Especially when he was with someone from the outside.
      </p>
      <p>
       It only took a day or two before the Deep State knew they had to start getting people on the outside who knew how the government worked out of the president's sphere. Bye bye Flynn. Bannon was still a concern. He also lacked institutional knowledge of the government, but he was a weasel and starting to learn a bit more all the time. He was also poisoning Reince, the lead man on the inside, any chance he got with the media and the president. He was going to need to be dealt with soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tangent: Remember when John Kasich said that Don Jr asked him to be Trump’s VP and that he could do whatever he wanted policy wise? Kasich asked Jr what his father would be doing and Jr responded “making American great again.” First of all, of course that is how he responded. Second of all, does anyone doubt that is exactly what happened and that Sr told Jr to make the offer?
      </p>
      <p>
       To jump ahead a bit, Reince and Spicer couldn't take keeping the secret any longer. They were going to spill it to the media so they had to be fired. This was a huge stroke of luck for the Deep State because they had been grooming Reince's replacement for the previous couple of months. They were going to need a man they were familiar with and comfortable with. They needed a general. And they got one.
      </p>
      <p>
       What is the first thing General Kelly did? All papers to the president come through me first. No more crazy ideas from the Gateway Pundit or Breitbart are getting in front of the president. Next, no more walk in privileges for anyone. Including Jared and Ivanka. You want to see the president you ask me first and when I say no you go back to your office immediately. Also, no phone calls unless I am either listening or I approve them. The first person on the no phone call list: Roger Stone. In fact, can we get him indicted somehow? Ok, good.
      </p>
      <p>
       With General Kelly now in control of the fiction the Deep State felt more comfortable expanding the the number of people they brought inside. Anyone the president liked to call late at night was brought in - Icahn, Ruddy, Barrack, Murdoch. Since the Deep State had been recording all of their calls since the first night in the residence it was relatively painless to get everyone to agree to the terms of the deal. They could also remind them of Roger Stone's current predicament if they needed to drop the hammer.
      </p>
      <p>
       As new staff came and went at a record pace it was imperative the Deep State kept tabs on who was in and who was out. Sessions stayed out and his recusal was a happy accident. Rosenstein is in because they need someone to keep an eye on Sessions and the Justice Dept.
      </p>
      <p>
       Miller was out which seems pretty risky because of how much access he has to the president, but then you remember he's Aspergers as fuck and it makes more sense. Huckabee Sanders was out so she could keep plausible deniability and she's such a moron she will try to sell whatever they ask her to without objection.
      </p>
      <p>
       The General couldn't stop Trump from hiring The Mooch, but he sure as hell could fire him and the call to Ryan Lizza at The New Yorker was a good excuse. Remember the president initially liked how that went down. There is no way that the Deep State was going to bring The Mooch in.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trickiest one was Bannon. With his closest allies in the WH, Sessions, Miller, Jared (at one time) all out and everyone in hating his guts and never divulging the secret they didn't fear a leak. But he was starting to show signs he might be catching on. So the removed him from the president's view as much as possible. Reduced his portfolio, removed him from committees, they even put him in the EOEB across the street.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tangent: The reason Jared's portfolio was so broad was to keep him busy and out of the country as much as possible. Jared is going to work on Middle East peace talks - get out of the building and have fun in Israel for a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       My hunch is that Bannon was getting close enough that the General brought him in. But only after he told him he was going to fire him shortly and only after the General was aware of Fire and Fury. Now he had the leverage he needed over Bannon and the chances of Bannon spilling about the fiction were slim to none because who was going to believe such a thing after all of the craziness in the book? After Breitbart and the Mercers dropped him it was further reassurance that he would stay quiet.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last week Bannon was brought in for questions by the House Intelligence Committee. His lawyer was on the phone with the WH throughout the hearing because he wanted to make sure he didn't say anything that would endanger the fiction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of the lawyers, the Deep State was in a tricky position with them. McGahn has been in from the get go. They weren't sure what to do with Cobb and Sekulow who were brought in for the Mueller case. They decided for the benefit of them they would keep them out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now with the General in charge and all of their bases covered, they hoped, the Deep State could breathe a bit easier. However, sometimes shit happens and somebody walks into a room they shouldn't have.
      </p>
      <p>
       Devin Nunes was one of those somebodies. Remember the story of him disappearing in the middle of the night to go look at secret documents? He was being brought in because Trump had somehow gotten to him and was having him go after info the Deep State didn't want Trump to have. The Deep State was very nervous about bringing in Nunes because he is such a dolt, but they had no choice. Their compromise is that they pretty much made him disappear for a few weeks after they brought him in. Recent #releasethememo talk has the Deep State a tad anxious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Jason Chaffetz wandered into the wrong room one day and given the choice decided to resign immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lindsay Graham was brought in because the Deep State was worried he'd figure it out or McCain, post brain surgery, might let it slip. This accounts for Graham's total 180 on how he viewed the president. His anger with the president over the shutdown is actually Graham angry at the General rather than Trump. Although everyone in the inside is in agreement they don't want the world to end they still have their political ideologies and for all intents and purposes Kelly's policies stand in for the president. Which isn't that big of a stretch since the president doesn't have any positions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Corker's recent change of feelings towards the president also happened after he was brought in. He didn't mistakenly walk into something he shouldn't have, instead he was too on the nose with his analysis of the WH and the president and they needed to stop the bleeding before it went to the next level.
      </p>
      <p>
       With the circle of those inside expanded to upwards of 50 people the Deep State can control who the president sees in the WH, what papers the president sees in the WH and anyone he calls on the phone is under their guise. They still have two exposures that they have to account for.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first is Mar-A-Lago. The president's most recent trip happened in the middle of the talk about the president's fitness. Immediately following the trip Chris Ruddy was on TV constantly and quoted in several articles talking about being right next to the president as he shook hands and hobnobbed with the Palm Beach crowd. Ruddy was the one to set up the NYT interview that caught so much flack. This was not an accident. Ruddy was the president's chaperone for the trip on the orders of the Deep State. To control the information flow to the president outside the WH they have determined he needs a minder to both keep Trump from listening to nonsense from the general public and to report back what happened during the trip. Expect similar chaperone stories going forward.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other exposure that makes the Deep State uneasy is the president's Twitter account. They know that they are helpless to his profoundly misinformed tweets. But thanks to a throw-away line of take the president seriously, not literally that had worked its way into the DNA of the public they were able to mitigate this easier than they thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, the president was going to tweet example after example of how dumb he was, but the public has been conditioned to not take his tweets seriously. When those tweets directly contradict the priorities of the party's pending legislation they have Ryan and Mitch inside to handle the Hill.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's go back to the senile boss again for this metaphor.
      </p>
      <p>
       The president tweets can be seen as roughly equivalent to what happens when the senile boss starts telling lower level employees what he wants them to do unbeknownst to the actual executives who are running the place. This leads to massive confusion and the actual executives having to tell the employee that we just keep the old man around to make him happy. Don’t listen to anything he says. He has no idea what he is talking about and he’ll forget what he said to you as soon as he said it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with the current president is that although he might not technically be at a loss with his mental faculties his knowledge of the job is similar to someone who thinks they are still the boss even though they haven’t been to a shareholder’s meeting in 35 years. Instead of walking around the floor and telling employees what they should be doing, the president tweets to the world what his administration is doing or should be doing. Just like the actual executives telling the confused employee to just nod and smile and say OK to the nice, senile old man the White House senior staff tells the world to just smile, nod and say OK to the president’s tweets and pay them no heed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Marc Short (or whomever) can’t have a one on one conversation in private with the employee who started working on some new initiative like the executive can. He has to go on TV, with the president surely watching, and without actually saying the president doesn’t know what he’s talking about, say the president doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the foundation of this exercise is a large group of extremely well informed, for the most part, aides telling the public to disregard what the president says. Senior staff (some more than others) have mastered the art of dismissing his comments or tweets as meaningless without every labeling them as such. Amazingly, they have taught each of us to categorize them the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you ever think we would see the day where the most senior members of the Executive Branch would tell us to not pay attention to what the president says because he’s a moron like the executives tell the employees to not pay attention to the senile boss? The reason the boss can keep showing up each morning to his fake job with his fake duties at his former real business is because it’s a controlled environment and there are only so many employees who need to play their part. The senile boss can’t affect anything outside the walls of the building and doesn’t have the platform to do any damage even if he wanted to.
      </p>
      <p>
       When everyone at the White House and perhaps a certain number of people outside the building knows the president of the United States is just a powerless figurehead except for the president himself it is obviously concerning. But if this is the case it would make so much sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Within the confines of the White House and to some degree outside, the staff can override or quell the president’s lack of knowledge. They can humor him. They can tell him they will look into his senseless initiative with the knowledge that he is going to forget about it the second it leaves his lips. Or they can treat him like Jim treated Michael when he needed to pull him out of one of his trances: sex, Steve Martin, Teri Hatcher. Or in Trump's case: sex, Obama, Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       But when communicating directly to the public via Twitter or in an interview with a non Dobbsian journalist they have less control of the reins. This is why there have been so few press conferences and zero sit downs with any serious journalists after "I fired Comey because of the Russian thing" with Lester Holt and the "I stand by nothing" embarrassment with John Dickerson.
      </p>
      <p>
       They solved the Twitter issue in sublime fashion when the “ignore the president on Twitter” strategy became ingrained. It’s the most direct way the president can exhibit his lack of understanding about the job and they have no power to stop him. Yet somehow they have been able to confirm he’s an idiot, but also condition us to think it doesn’t matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       And most importantly, do so in a way that the president hasn’t been able to figure it out yet.
      </p>
      <p>
       This would also explain the staggering, often comical, lengths they will go to reframe Twitter lunacy when pressed by the media. These surrogates are put into a tough spot. They obviously can’t tell the media they are aware of the president’s lack of a clue of what he’s doing. So they have to spin themselves into what can only be called intellectual oblivion. There are no other options if they want to keep the charade going. Admit the president is a child in the most powerful chair in the world and they treat him like a figurehead with no power to do anything and they are fired. Let it slip that while the president has all of the powers inherent to the office he is too dumb and too incurious to figure that out and we need to keep it that way and the president is now aware of the sham and then there is a possibility of real bombs dropping.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a circus elephant conditioned to think the chain attached to his leg and a small post is sturdy enough to keep him in place, the president is so uniformed he doesn’t know his own power. While the staff has worked to create this fictional world for him to keep his crown, the real world still exists where a president is still endowed with all of his usual powers. The staff seems to be wholly focused on keeping this movie playing. It’s the only way they can control him. If he somehow found out the walls are fake and he can step over them with one step it turns into an elephant escaped from the circus.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing to stop him from firing everyone and rehiring Omarosa as his new policy director, Richard Spencer as communications director, Mike Cernovich as Secretary of State and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible all of these senior staff members are actually trying to save us from the impulses of a man they all considered a petulant, moronic know nothing? Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it possible that even though they did everything they could to get him elected they had a collective oh shit on that Tuesday night in November and realized the gravity of what they had done? Perhaps. Who among them really thought he could win anyhow? Not many. Why do I keep asking myself questions? I am getting punchy.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the past couple of weeks, and even more so in the past couple of days, we have seen evidence that this Truman Show like fiction is a possibility. Everything we have heard from the president's staff is that they are imploring him to stay out of the shutdown talks. He has already tried to fuck that up multiple times because he's an idiot. They can manage him in the residence sending out hilariously misinformed tweets - we know he's an idiot, they know he's an idiot and we know they know. That's safe ground for the Deep State. The president making a secret phone call to Chuck &amp; Nancy takes their control away from them. And Chuck is starting to get an inkling of what is going on it appears. Chuck has always known exactly how to play the president, but now he has figured out he needs to get him alone. Or at least sans General Kelly and Private Aspergers. The president couldn't even be trusted to call Schumer to tell him the deal was off because it wasn't conservative enough.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have also recently learned that the president spends his days in the same fashion as he seemed to before he inhabited the world’s most famous residence. Hours in front of the TV, phone calls to gossip and hobnob with various people, nonsensical tweets based on whatever he saw most recently on TV or whatever the person on the phone had just mentioned to him.
      </p>
      <p>
       When he does amble downstairs he seems to spend a couple of hours at his mostly ceremonial position where he pretends to know what he’s doing. Led by General Kelly, the staff around him is doing the actual work, but when the president is on the floor the stage call goes out "one minute to show time" and everyone get into their costumes to play make believe so the president feels like he is doing the job.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the president really needs is to feel like he's in charge and for those around him to treat him as such, regardless of what is really going on. The president doesn’t care about making the decisions or passing the policies he ran on. He cares about creating the impression he is doing those things and most importantly getting all the credit for them when he thinks they are successful.
      </p>
      <p>
       The staff seems to encourage him to take as much executive time as he wants. The least productive place he can be for his agenda is in the office having input. Remember what Jr told Kasich? That was the actual plan.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember those Cabinet Fluff Meetings where everyone took a turn in the circle jerk? Part of the production. The story about having one of Mattis, McMaster and Kelly in the country at all times? That's so just in case the president gets on a boat and hits the walls of the soundstage like Truman and figures it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       According to this theory, this is our country currently. We are being led by a proud know nothing who is to be ignored because he’s an idiot. His senior aides have confirmed this. Members of his Cabinet have confirmed this. Senior members of Congress who have met with him have confirmed this. The general public, even his sycophants, have reached broad consensus on the topic.
      </p>
      <p>
       To keep the fiction functioning it requires:
-The continued and historically unparalleled intellectual laziness and baffling lack of curiosity that the 45th president of the most powerful country on the face of the earth singularly has.
-The continued mastery from the likes of Mulvaney, Short, Kelly, Conway, etc telling the public and the media that everyone knows the president is an idiot and just ignore his tweets the same as you ignore the homeless guy on the street corner screaming about auditing the Federal Reserve. Short of putting the actual Gorilla Channel on his TV they are doing everything in their power to keep him away from anything to do with his job, but somehow saying and doing all of this without the president catching on.
-Containing the paper and human information that gets to the president so he continues to understand nothing about his job or his presidential powers. If he ever realizes that he could have made one phone call and found out in ten minutes if Obama really did tap his wires at Trump Tower he'd be closer to realizing although he doesn't have a nuclear button he can get the same result by pushing the button he has been told is just for Diet Coke deliveries. 
-The Deep State keeping tabs on those brought inside and those who accidentally get inside and constantly evaluating who needs to be brought in. As well as keeping the threat of indictments and subpoenas very much a reality for those they are concerned might break. 
-General Kelly keeping the bit players of the West Wing performing their part for the president even without them being inside.
-Keep the President away from anything close to a one on one with a reputable journalist with cameras rolling. Could you imagine what would happen if George Stephanopoulos started their interview with the question, “Mr. President could you please tell us how a bill becomes a law?”
      </p>
      <p>
       After about ten seconds of sound coming from his mouth that faintly resembled the English language it would start raining in the room because Kellyanne Conway pulled the fire alarm. If there was no fire alarm handy she would have faked a heart attack. Interview over, never to be continued. In case you were wondering Conway would make a full recovery from her fake heart attack while enjoying her two month recovery (vacation) she earned for her valorous quick thinking.
      </p>

       That's what I got. I have no expectation that all of this or even 50% of this is true, but doesn't it seem possible? Does this conspiracy seem that outlandish? Would it be that difficult to pull off with a minor league acumen like the president possesses? Is the circle confined enough, with the penalties for spilling the beans severe enough to limit leaks? Would it surprise you even a little if the president was given a briefing book that was 240 pages that spelled out all of the powers of the presidency and he can't make it past page one? Have you ever known of a less curious man, less interested in the duties of his job? Maybe more importantly, if true and the president found out, but the general public didn't know, would he care? Is it possible he would be relieved? Would the lack of expectation of doing anything or knowing anything be manna from heaven? A permission for him to wear the crown for everyone to see like he has always wanted without a lick of the work he has never been interested in?
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is true that would mean that people like Kellyanne Conway have been sacrificing their own reputation for the safety of me, you and everyone else in this country from the possible edicts of a man they know to have the same capacity for the job as a random alpaca. Yet shamelessly presented as anything but in order to win the White House only to immediately regret their decision and are living this fiction as some kind of atonement.

       Yes of course. I figured that out long ago, not this weekend. It explains why Trump is following through with Hillary Clinton's plan for Syria. Rex Tillersom just said Assad needs to be ousted, Trump was the guy that was supposed to take us out of "stupid" wars. It also explains why Trump cheerleads the economy numbers. Everyone should know that Stock Market and Unemployment Rate are not accurate measures of how the economy is doing, but Trump touts these things like it's so great for America.

       Trump is aware what's going on. He is a "Reality Show President" for  the military coup inside the Deep State. That's why all the military guys lined up behind him on Inauguration Day--something that's never happened before and never been explained.

       If he is aware how come any of his senior staff that go on the record to tell us he's wildly uninformed he pushes back so hard? I'm far more likely to believe that the military guys are concerned with containing his idiocy than they are for some kind of coup. I guess I can't fathom how some sort of coup would be planned, with at least tacit agreement from the president, with those same executors of the coup telling us how much of a moron the president is any chance they get.

       Don't bother. It's a dumb theory because Trump is a figurehead but not in the way OP describes. OP makes it seem like everyone in government is going along with Trump as a means of tricking Trump into thinking people are actually respecting him as president. Trump isn't that stupid. I hate the guy and don't think he should be president, but he's a figurehead in the exact same way Obama was a figurehead and in the same way Bush was a figurehead. The role of the president as the figurehead is to take all the blame for the bad shit the rest of the government is foisting upon us. When we get mad, we automatically blame the party the president represents, or if you're in that party, you blame the opposing party. Let's not pretend that Trump is something more or less than Bush or Obama. They're all the same product being sold using different marketing techniques.

       I respect that.  I agree that Trump is not stupid - he is very plugged in to the people and how they feel.  Trump may use the same old tactics(sometimes) but you have to agree that he (a lot of the time) is pretty unique in what he does and how he does it. Is it that hard to believe that Trump might actually have America at heart? Maybe he doesn't. Maybe he does.  But it seems like he is just as mad as I am. It seems like he is fulfilling promises made (so he could get elected). It seems like I have more money, business, and opportunity. Maybe  none of it has anything to do with him, maybe it has everything to do with it.  My old man taught me when I was very young: don't fix it unless it's broke. I took this and molded it to: don't change a good thing.  Maybe that's the right thing right now. Let Trump stir the pot. Maybe something great comes from the aftermath in 3 or 7 years from now.
      </p>
      <p>
       Re: OPs post- I don't read based on agreement or disagreement, being open to not just what, but how people think.  Understanding how people come to their own conclusions is more important than what they say (most of the time). The how is what I'm interested in.

       I think a simpler version of this would be that the president has good intentions but isn’t able to enact them without serious help.  This pretty much portrays him exactly as Reagan.  I don’t buy it, but there are some funny bits and it is well fleshed out... enjoyable read.  Almost a “conspiracy-dark comedy” here.  Still better than Hillary, even if true because it means that Gen. Kelly is in charge and I can sleep at night with that thought.

       Again, Trump is that stupid. The fact that he is plugged into how people feel as opposed to what they do or don't know is evidence of that. Initially Trump wasn't interested in the wall idea. But after he said it in a speech he heard a roar of the crowd so that changed his mind on it. Adjusting your ideology based on the feedback you get from an audience of a rally isn't being plugged into how people feel. If you believe that then you have to cite evidence that something he said that the audience didn't give him an overwhelming reaction to he later abandoned.
      </p>
      <p>
       I honestly don't think Trump has anyone's interest at heart other than this own. It's why he's ideologically vacant. He likes the idea that will get him more love from the people in front of him or more hate from the masses. It's why the Republicans have to babysit him anytime he meets with a Democrat, he's gonna leave that meeting trumpeting what they just told him.
      </p>
      <p>
       The platitude of don't fix it if it's not broke, or don't change a good thing is extremely short sighted. Your water pipes are working, but they are rusting. They are going to need to be replaced shortly. They work now though so just ride it out and once they rupture then you should change them. Don't be proactive, always be results oriented, never look to improve something are not ideals to live by.

       It's cool that it's a dumb theory because yours is different. If I passed this along as gospel that wasn't my intention In fact, I am pretty sure I went out of my way to not do that. In the interest of clarity I shall refute a few things you wrote:
1. I never said "everyone in government" was in on the fiction. The reason it is a possibility is that so few people are on the inside.
1A. If you think people in the government have sincere respect for the president I have endless evidence of that not being the case.
2. Trump is that stupid when it comes to anything to do with the government or legislation or the office of the presidency. This can't be in dispute for reasoned debate. 
3. I might disagree with the assertion that all presidents are merely figureheads, but that wasn't a part of the theory. The theory was that this president is a willing figurehead. As long as he thinks nobody knows he's just a figurehead. 
4. You leave no room for your nuance in the argument that when we get upset about bad shit we blame the opposing party. I'd like to think that most people can be objective enough to not blindly support their sides agenda and blindly castigate the other sides. Surely we aren't all this simple. 
5. I find it impossible to believe that you intellectually believe Trump is the same as Obama or Bush. I would guess that you have to write that for the sake of your claim as opposed to a belief in it.

       Trump has been proving all along he not a figure head. Why do think MSM and majority of Reddit are in a hissy fit over him.

       Trump might have brought over some screen writers from his old TV show.    Mix a great screenwriter with someone like Karl Rove,   someone truly Maciavelian,  and you would really have some advantage over the average Washington DC crowd of Podesta and Manafort wannabees,  whose schtick is pretty worn out as exposed in all those lame emails that Julian kindly forwarded to us with some Russian help (no, no,  just kidding about the Russian help,   realy!)
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words,   its not as brilliant as real multilevel chess,  but hell yeah,  its still very Trumpian,  and should evoke at least a smile and a nod to a guy who is about to jam his tiny dick in all our faces on the way to the bank.

       So, your theory is that Trump is Reagan on steroids but luckily we have Gen. Kelly in charge?  If true, I can live with this.  Also 100000000% better than having Hilary.

       Your rant was too long to read and way too biased. Have you ever met the man? How do you he's crazy? Your naivety is dangerously reaching moronic levels. Gross negligence of the conscious mind.

       I didn't read it, but what you say is naive, moronic and negligent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was led to believe there was a higher level of discourse here. I have no expectation that everyone is going to agree with the theory - it wouldn't be a theory if that was the case. But when the first thing you write is that you didn't read it which is then followed by opinions of the writer based on what you admit is nothing, it feels a tiny bit disingenuous.

       Never did I say I didn't read it.  I read the first couple sentences and already knew the crazy conspiracy theories you already got yourself into. You sound just as crazy as the people praising him thinking he is God. There was no reason to read anymore. I don't know where you get your information from but it is obviously biased. Again, have you ever met this crazy man as you like to claim in your "theory"? Theory or not your bias is way off and certainly leaning on one side more than the other. Don't know if your a troll or just moronically naive. You need to broaden your horizons when it comes to research and make sure you get both sides of the story and not just the one that appeals to you the most. If you would have done that, there would be no need for such a idiotic theory. Do you live in the states by any chance?

       I agree with you that Trump is interested in how people feel. This though is a good thing. Is it not? A president that listens to the people, and is not held hostage to political correctness?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm curious though, what is it that Trump could do to say to you that he cares for your well being? More money in your pocket? Cheaper and better Healthcare? More or less Millitary? Reclassification of top secret documents? I'm not asking in jest, I actually want to know what it takes to make you feel like he is on your side.
