       We are one with the earth right? It’s been here billions of years, seen shit we could never imagine. It’s been through ice ages, asteroids, solar flares, you name it — the earth has probably seen it at some point or another.
      </p>
      <p>
       The earth has also had billions of different species that have come and gone. We’re simply just another species that came from the earth right??
      </p>
      <p>
       So isn’t it natural the way we’re heading? Does anyone ever consider that maybe our time here as humans is simply up?
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s not a morality issue but everyone makes it one.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like “oh we’re
       <em>
        humans
       </em>
       , we’re
       <em>
        soooo
       </em>
       special, we don’t
       <em>
        deserve
       </em>
       to die, it’s not fair!” As if fair has anything to do with nature.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously it sucks, but I mean isn’t this just how nature operates? Things change, sometimes drastically and powerful species’ are turned to dust.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know there was already billions of years on this planet where humans could have never survived?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why are human beings so selfish and why do they think they are separate from the planet?

       I totally agree with you! And apparently, cow farts do more damage CO2 wise than cars do... either way, the evidence for me that something is seriously up was the data from the vostok ice cores. We were able to measure CO2 levels throughout history.

       Are you implying that volcanic activity was responsible for the Ozone hole in the 80s/90s? That's not necessarily the case and seems to depend on the concentration of the CFCs in the atmosphere.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Researchers have long known that when concentrations of chlorine from human-produced CFCs are high, ozone depletion will result following a volcanic eruption. When levels of chlorine from CFCs are low, volcanic eruptions can actually increase the thickness of the ozone layer. But exactly when this transition happens — from eruptions that deplete ozone to eruptions that increase ozone layer thickness — has long been uncertain. Previous research has put the window of the transition anywhere between 2015 to 2040.

       I am saying that people think small.  And yes I would attribute the hole then to volcanic activity combined with CFC usage.

       Volcanic eruptions seem to only increase the depletion of ozone though. Without (man-made) CFCs present it wouldn't happen by volcanic activity alone.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Major, explosive volcanic eruptions can inject material directly into the ozone layer. Observations and model calculations show that volcanic particles cannot on their own deplete ozone. It is only the interaction of human-produced chlorine with particle surfaces that enhances ozone depletion in today's atmosphere.

       A million years from now, we'll have had absolutely zero impact on this earth, I agree with you there 100%.
      </p>
      <p>
       But can we impact the earth short-term, in a sense that can hurt the environment, species, and humans?  Maybe.  I'm not sold on global warming or climate change or whatever it is.  And, if its true, I'm not sure how much I believe the studied impacts will be, or if I care about coral reefs or some endangered snake or some island in the Pacific.

       I think the big moral dilemma less about our own demise, although self preservation is obviously a factor, and more about the fact that no other species has caused a mass extinction of other species as well.

       See the problem is AGW doesn't just affect humans, it has an effect on every other species as well.

       But I’m saying isn’t everything humans do, even the shitty stuff part of human nature? Like maybe this was always going to be our end — we become so technologically advanced we end up destroying ourselves and taking others with us.

       We possess the ability to reason, to decide on the morality of something (even if that's just subjective) and to change our actions. These same traits that got us this technology also make it our responsibility to not kill all life on the planet from our own idiocy.

       The solution to global warming has never been to give the government money although fox news wants you to believe that it so. We already give the government hefty amounts of money they use to actively push global warming forward through the large subsidies to oil companies in the form of paying them outright or by buying the largest amounts of fossil fuels in the world. Smaller government is the key to ending global warming, local decisions made to source energy from solar wind water or geothermal will be the key to reducing carbon emissions. You don't understand global warming that is your issue. Our government has never had a posture in which it wanted to end global warming with taxes. Exxon currently runs our state department.

       Global warming is essentially the business of our empire. Once America was taken over by the Railroad/Hydrocarbon magnates there has never been a plan to do anything but extract oil/coal and burn in order to make a massive profit. Now these fuels used to be much more plentiful in our own country and they still could be, but these guys with oil money also saw the opportunity to make money buying and selling weapons during WW1 when the Anglo Empire conquered the Middle East. Since then we have been locked in a battle with the anyone who opposes the Anglo Axis in its drive to deplete the world of all carbon reserves at the highest possible levels of profit. No matter who they have to kill and no matter much they have to tax us to do it. Global warming isn't about science Tillerson knows that he is destroying the world these men are not dumb they understand and see the changes, they have decided the best way to cope with these things is using the vast profits they are making to prepare for the post ice cap melting world. Hence huge build up of naval power in the Arctic Sea by Russia the US and its vassal states. We are merely subjects our fate is death no matter if it due to inhalation of toxic fumes, or wars over natural resources. Ending global warming is how we end the conspiracy that we all search for so drastically on this sub.

       This has never been a suggestion, in fact it's quite the opposite the government taxes and regulates you so that you are inclined to burn more fossil fuels. The taxes and regulations would fall upon the entities responsible for the production of carbon emissions. If the government has the ability to tell me I cannot legal posses or burn Marijuana then it should also have the ability to tell Exxon that it cannot burn fossil fuels without reproach equal to the damage it is doing to our environment. You are not a point source of CO2 emissions we are consumers of the energy that they produce. You would be no more regulated or taxed than you currently are.

       Objective, empirical data is public domain. What you seem to be asking for is anecdotal evidence, which doesn't help much.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if you want localised anecdotes, I've got them. How about rising sea level, significant changes to our seasons, the warming of the seas and a changing ecology as a result. Don't forget the islander refugees we've had as a result of the previously mentioned rising sea levels.
      </p>
      <p>
       But most importantly, when your state has planned and starting putting in action the movement of your capital city to accommodate rising sea level, things have started to get serious.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, I don't really care if you believe in AWG or not. Whether you believe in it or not it will still be a reality and one that is already passed the point of no return. All we can really hope to do at this point is plan and adjust to the changing climate. So what you believe is ultimately irrelevant, those who make the decisions already have you covered and protected.

       Humans have really short vision.  It is like if it did not happen in their lifetime it did not happen.  Look at the ocean levels just 14.000 years ago.  You could walk from England to Europe and not get your feet wet.

       The idea that global warming is entirely down to man is preposterous and ludicrous, we are told that our emissions of CO2 to the environment is causing global warming, although it is seldom mentioned that Turmites contribute to almost half of all CO2 emissions worldwide, nor is it mentioned that as we have discovered through drilling through the permafrost at the poles, the CO2 levels in the past have much surpassed the current CO2 climate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is another thing for man to fear, conjured up by mans puppeteers as a means of control. Mainstream science even admits that the main contribution to global warming and the damaging of the ozone layer is most likely through CH4, Methane gases which are mainly contributed to by cows and the meat industry, so surely, if we truly wanted to fight against Global Warming, wouldn't we cut down on the meat that we are eating? So why are we being told to stop driving cars and pay higher taxes to pay for energy companies to build more structures to energy produce down the avenue of 'green' energy

       Of course, but his beliefs are shared across the 'unpopular' scientific consensus, across thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds even of scientists who are specialists in their field. I specify the amount through a common sense interpretation, as I personally know tens, likely if that is the case across the Western World that is the number I arrive to roughly, if you want specifics.

       And, if anything can be learnt from history, it is usually those who everyone else says is wrong who turn out to be right, and when I have heard the man talk, on numerous occasions, you can tell he understands his field very well, and his predictions on the Weather for his own company are amongst some of the most accurate.

       I recommend you hear him speak before you write him off because he opposes the 'scientific consensus'. Let me remind you that it was also the 'scientific consensus' that the world was flat.

       Yes, I think about this often. Maybe everything we've done is right on par with what the universe has planned.  Makes you feel so small and obsolete, huh?

       Shouldn't we try to correct our path if it leads to our survival?
      </p>
      <p>
       One major aspect of our evolutionary niche is our intellect (arguably the biggest one in fact) so it's also natural for us to recognize a threat to our existence and to try to mitigate that threat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like an antilope fleeing from a lion is natural, it's natural for us to try to survive by not making the planet uninhabitable for us.

       I think you're right but no matter humanity's future the earth remains an excellent resource. I think we'd be foolish not to try to conserve and protect this resource- even from ourselves if need be. That said I definitely think anthropogenic climate change is being over-promoted to cover cyclical climate change.

       what do you mean by "natural"?  is it natural to dump billions of years of accumulated carbon deposits back into the atmosphere over the course of a few decades?
