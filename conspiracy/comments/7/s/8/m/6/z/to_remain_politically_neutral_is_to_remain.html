It hasn’t been any type of step forward and most of the same policies are being kept and expanded...it’s just another switch a roo power shuffle in an attempt to convince the public the power is in the hands of the people. Same shit different decade. The solution to the problem won’t be to follow the same path we do every 8 years. The solution is to put innovate the current system and prove it to be obsolete </p>

    <div class="md"><p>He made those comments after Epstein was discovered. Epstein was a very well-connected wealthy person. Trump was never close to Epstein, however the Clintons were downright buddy-buddy with him. Bill flew on Epsteins jet over a half dozen times WITHOUT his secret service. By contrast, Trump visited Epsteins island in a large group for an outing which was publicly known. Consider this, not everyone who tangentally knew Weinstein knew that he was a creep, but those who repeatedly associated with him should have known Weinstein was a creep. Same was true with Epstein. He put up a great front of normalcy and used his power to keep things quiet. His close associates must have seen through that false veneer. </p>

<p>To say Trump&#39;s tangential connection to Epstein is evidence of pedophilia is incredibly misleading and honestly downright deceptive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Tell me some more.</p>

<p>USA is the worlds largest exporter of electric vehicles and leads in green energy innovation. </p>

<p>Globalization hurt the American worker and made global corporations enormously powerful. America has merely reasserted the primacy of its national interests over the interests of globalization. The results have been clearly positive. </p>

<p>The economy is the best it has been this century. So many superlatives. 2.3 million new jobs, 80 percent of Americans getting a tax cut, hundreds of billions of dollars in new investment, a 30 percent rise in NYSE, a greater than 3% GDP growth. Listen to some Gucci Mane, America just started hustling. </p>

<p>Europe is also enjoying the global benefits of a healthy US economy but is facing strategic threats from Russia, an economic threat to the survival of the EU, and issues with migrant integration. </p>

<p>China is in a scary place economically. They are sitting on the largest GDP-Debt ratio ever seen in China. The entire boom is predicated on continued massive infrastructure spending. That is the whole point of the belt and road initiative. To be able to continue to provide an artificial outlet for the massive production of raw materials by the Chinese mainland economy. It is totally unsustainable long-term. China is also embracing a belligerent nationalist tone on the world stage in a bid to distract the domestic population from the increasingly tenuous financial situation. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say our payroll is about $1M/yr, and our profit is about $150K/yr. (These numbers are not exact, but proportionate to our 2017 financials)</p>

<p>That 5% raise just cost the company $53,825 </p>

<p>After the tax cut, we pay 21%, or $31,500, a savings of $21,000, meaning my company has invested a further $32,825 than saved by the tax bill, not even factoring in the two new employees. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m hoping that Trump cozying up to Israel and the US military right from the get go is just a ploy to buy him some time to allow him to conduct some other needed business like putting domestic criminal politicians in jail. However, I do not believe he would have even gotten to his position at all if the globalists weren&#39;t already ok with him as president. This could all be theater, as of now I&#39;m not convinced he&#39;s the real deal, time will tell.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You voted for a meme, you got a vulgar oligarch whose campaign rhetoric evaporated like his threat to &quot;lock her up&quot;. </p>

<p>In the face of another special interest owned, Israel-cucked puppet the (deviously deliberate) or disenfranchised internet created yet another meme for the slowly waning true believers in the latest left/right Messiah.</p>

<p>Another secret &quot;war&quot; against and undefined enemy that never manifests itself in any significant way in the real world.</p>

<p>I&#39;m surprised Ben Fullford and Corey Goode aren&#39;t there fighting along side the imaginary benevolent white knight Trump with the secret cabals and light bubbles. </p>

<p>Meanwhile the swamp bubbles with squamata and the US is still the primary rogue terror state in the world invading, occupying and destabilizing for corporatism and Zionism. </p>

It’s all over and soon Trump, with the assistance of Pleiadian light forces, and the white hats within USMC are taking all the lefty globalists to Gitmo where they will be sentenced to have their souls exterminated in the Galactic Central Sun! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What If I told you...</p>

<p>There is two sides to the same coin. A face has two sides. </p>

<p>What is hedging one place, is moving in another. </p>

<p>What we see is NeoCons Vs. NeoLibs. yet, they all possess that &#39;Neo-tag&#39;.</p>

<p>That Neo-tag is the indicator of the faceless head existing, the coin without sides. </p>

<p>This is the &#39;Deep-State&#39; in observational process. </p>

<p>Who it is, specifically, is  sebbatian-zionists and Anglo-american hermetic cultists. This is the &#39;made-man&#39; and &#39;willing-warrior&#39; branch of the Shadow-government. </p>

<p>That means, the Shadow-government transcends the deep-state, in that it is globalist. Members of the shadow-government collude within the deep-state for both national and international endeavors. </p>

<p>So, in formula:</p>

<p>The state: party red/ party blue/ ect</p>

<p>*parliament states are the same just fractional into like-alternatives</p>

<p>The Deep-state = above the law and globalist Geo-strategy</p>

<p>Then Shadow-Government = The financiers and power embedded; whose wealth transcends international law and limits.</p>

<p>On top of this, you have multiple Deep-states, just like &#39;states&#39;; if we are to consider these terms and apply them to our thoughts about international relations. So, China and Russia both possess a &#39;deep-state&#39;, and from there, there exists other &#39;shadow-governments&#39;. </p>

<p>The world might not be run by one shadow-government, just because the same policies and systems of finance are in place. That&#39;s like saying, since everyone has rifles, they must all be secretly in league with one another. Fractional reserve banking is a weapons technology of the financial system; not a calling card to broken banking cartels [though, some can be].</p>

<p>With that in mind, it&#39;s well to consider the world&#39;s two spheres, both controlled by a shadow cabal, interacting with another, which creates shadow governments, who undermine actor&#39;s nationalism and deep-state privilege by always offering an escape with loot. </p>

<p>So, with this in mind, where do these oligarchs go once they&#39;re done pillaging? </p>

<p>They all end up in the same havens, with their governments covering for their thefts. </p>

<p>In other-words, there is no good guys and bad guys. </p>

<p>They are all robber-barons, and the system is one of turning-face and transferring all that accumulated wealth, in haste of potential loss, once one side begins to bloat. </p>

<p>See: wealth always leaves before it&#39;s re-distributed. </p>

<p>So, to go deeper, whose particularly running towards the east with their wealth? </p>

<p>There&#39;s the person whose wealth was able to transcendence their nationalist bounds, so their loyalty in gaining it was probably subject to rot as well. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Um no. You are not winning. Ever heard of the continuity of government. Trump is behaving exactly how the puppet masters want him to; else he would be suicided.</p>

<p>Go on and think Trump will make America Great Again. That&#39;s what the globalists want.</p>

<p>The fact that you still worship him after he signed off on continued spying programs shows that you are ignorant of how things really work.</p>

<p>We are slaves my friend, we were born into a debt slavery system.</p>

<p>If Trump was the real hero we needed he would have stopped the intelligence community spying programs, maintained net neutrality, and abolished the Federal Reserve. </p>

<p>We lost the last president willing to stand up to the intelligence communities.</p>

<p>For example, trump says climate change is a hoax (something I agree with, its just another tax on humans), yet he doesn&#39;t stop the military industrial complex from spraying the sky&#39;s with heavy metals (used to be called chemtrails, now they are called Solar Geoengineering or albedo modification)</p>
