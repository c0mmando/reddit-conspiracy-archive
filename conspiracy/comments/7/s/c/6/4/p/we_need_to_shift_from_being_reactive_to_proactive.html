<p>What can we do to take our efforts to the next level. For starters, we can do our best to unite all of the online conspiracy communities under a single cause. Right now, they are trying to confuse us as to who the real common enemy is.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always been the same people; the bastards in charge of issuing the world&#39;s currency, and the global crime syndicate that works on their behalf.</p>

<p>They have some of us trusting political demagogues, others dropping out completely and losing hope. </p>

<p>What do you think we can do, and/or what do you think it will take to finally unite this culture and take our cause of exposing the elites to the masses, to the next step? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Winning the hearts and minds of the people is important.</p>

<p>I think if you have a Facebook page, maybe throw out a little occasional post venting your frustrations with the two party system, and how it seems to be a system to control and divide the population.</p>

<p>People get so worked up about these elections. </p>

<p>When engaging people, we need to remain calm and focused, let other people finish talking and then offer a sound and reasonable rebuttal. It&#39;s a slow incremental process waking people up, but it will be so much easier if we are all united under the same cause. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Imo this is a waste of time. </p>

<p>Any meme or movement you make up will get co-opted. Better to find a small group of able bodied individuals and think of <em>alternative solutions</em></p>

<p>We’ve already been trying the political route. We got Trump. That was a victory. A very, veryyyyyy minor victory. Just a statement really, and who knows it could backfire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree and disagree. I agree with you saying about alternative solutions, one of them I think should be following these news crew vans around, to see if they&#39;re planting stories, exposing the fake news on live news, calling in to radio and news programs, shilling them back basically. The part I disagree with, is about it being a waste of time, maybe if only 20 people do it, but 20 thousand?, even 2,000 those stickers and signs reach alot of eyes. If the great awakening is a prism, wouldn&#39;t you want as many different flashlights from different angles as possible on it? I think our diversity and freedom in this movement gives us a super strength. Are they going to arrest everyone that stands on the steps of these corporations and chain the doors, everyone is pissed at them, everyone. It&#39;s a bit of a rant, I know, but im just trying to say, get creative, put the map on your vehicle, put the hashtag on your window, tell people to look up. </p>

<p>Like you said, we all are angry. We should function like a virus, on a cell by cell basis. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then don&#39;t take it seriously. I&#39;ve been trying to wake people up for years now naively thinking if you show them how things are then they will of course believe you because it&#39;s the truth. I&#39;ve made hundreds of comments on YouTube, started dozens of threads on 4chan and made several posts on Godlike Productions. I came here to r/conspiracy as a final resort, but the same game is playing out again. People simply do not care at all. I&#39;ll find one like minded individual (such as yourself) amongst an infinite amount who think I&#39;m posting complete far-fetched nonsense. So yeah, not much hope left in me. I&#39;ve accepted the fact that only a few are truly receptive to this kind of stuff, the rest won&#39;t break free of their programming until it&#39;s too late. It&#39;s a lot easier for people to fall for psyops and controlled opposition, trust me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Definitely this. To expand, for other readers: don&#39;t focus on changing the world. Focus instead on changing what you can. Look at your own life and see the ways in which you can make it better and do that. Be a better person, reduce your consumption, increase your positive creative output, and <em>encourage others to follow that path</em>.<br/>
When you focus too much on changing the whole world, you make it hard for yourself to change things where it works. And where it works, first and foremost, is in your immediate sphere of influence. Your life. When you focus on your own life you make personal momentum and you get into a flow that works effectively. When you try to change the world, without considering this, it&#39;s like you&#39;re a single drop off water fighting against the current and trying to change the course of the river from where you are. But when you focus on your own life, make it work, and then encourage others to do the same, then it&#39;s like you&#39;re accepting that you&#39;re an inherent part of the rivers flow but instead of trying to change the course upstream you get every other droplet on the same page and then you can <em>collectively</em> change the course of the river over the appropriate and relevant time.<br/>
Do what you can and what you think will genuinely best work for yourself and the world. Promote that mindset. Soon enough those in your immediate sphere of influence will adopt that mindset, and if they follow the pattern then those in the immediate spheres of influences of those individuals will adopt it too, and so forth, and so forth. Make it exponential. It might seem slow at first, but before you know it the change you intend to happen will manifest quicker and quicker and on an ever increasingly larger scale. </p>

Too many sheep who are unwilling to listen to anything other than cable news and who will look at you like you&#39;re a ducking moron for challenging the official story.

Sometimes you get really pissed off or really want to do something proactive but at the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t matter.

    <div class="md"><p>OP, you&#39;ve got a good sentiment going, but let me throw this out there:</p>

<p>What are your victory conditions?</p>

<p>Any action that intends success is like a good book; the ending makes the effort worth the time invested. What I see in your words is passion and an eager desire for success, but ultimately it&#39;s unfocused and aimless. As noble as it may to expose the elite to the masses, the people are already aware of this. The problem isn&#39;t  a lack of awareness.</p>

<p>The problem is they don&#39;t care.</p>

<p>Human beings are creatures of finality; we desire an end, a point by which our work yields results. It&#39;s why the phrase &#39;path of least resistance&#39; is a thing. We&#39;re constantly looking for ways to circumvent old and antiquated methods for far more convenient approaches.</p>

<p>Challenging the status quo does nothing to further this prospect in the eyes of the common man. If anything, it puts the weight of responsibility and decision back in the hands of the people, which is exactly what they <em>don&#39;t</em> want.</p>

<p>People want power without the upkeep needed to maintain it. They want the avarice without the effort needed to attain it. </p>

<p>What are you victory conditions that persuade the common man to forego this notion of convenience and furthermore, how do you prevent your own desire for change from ultimately corrupting itself. After all, would you trust anyone else to push forward with your vision of change? Would you risk all that you&#39;ve accomplished against the chance that someone might see an opportunity for power?</p>
