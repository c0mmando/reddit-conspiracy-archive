       Correct me if I'm wrong or misunderstood anything that I've read from this sub. From what I gather, the whole chemtrails conspiracy involves the use of planes spreading contaminates in the air over cities to intentionally cause harm to the masses, correct?
      </p>
      <p>
       My one big red flag is that why would tptb contaminate the same air they themselves are breathing? From wht I've gathered, these chemtrail planes happen all over the US, including NY. Well, air and wind travel uncontrollably. With that being said, I find it preposterous that anyone would purposefully poison the same air the conspirator would be breathing. I'm sure tptb have families in New York, etc too.
      </p>
      <p>
       You might retort and say that tptb live outside of the contaminated area. But, this goes back to my earlier point about air traveling, and not to mention people moving as well.  It just doesn't make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       What am I missing? I probably will get downvoted for questioning a conspiracy that makes no sense to me, but idgaf. I just want to understand it and have it make some sense to me.

       It’s also referred to as Geo-engineering. The purpose behind it (they say) is to promote cloud seeding to create rain in drought ridden areas. At least to my understanding of it

       Yep it’s a common ploy for Insurance companies to avoid having to pay out to farmers with specific policies related to droughts. In fact I actually ended up looking for property in another part of town as it’s know that this activity goes on near Shadow Hills in Los Angeles

       Its well documented that the US military performed cloud seeding in Vietnam over the Ho Chi Min trail to try and flood it so it could no longer be used to move supplies by the VietCong.

       I agree, it's 100% propaganda.

       However it's propaganda in the same way ALL news sources are. It's propaganda in the same way that the US government handles it's affairs and the same way Russia handles it's affairs. It's one giant fuck over meant to serve multiple purposes.

       No source is better than the other. The only thing that changes is the bias, certainly not the level of truth contained in the publishing.

       It's interesting that you deflected to USA media when you're the first person to mention it.

       It's also interesting that you don't see the difference between government funded propaganda and privately funded media. If you have evidence that CNN, FOX, NBC, etc is funded by the USA government I would love to see it.

       Sun is giving off more energy than ever. Scientists blame mankind for global warming when it's really an interplanetary phenomena and humans only have a small part in it. We are entering a more highly energetic zone of the galaxy and if nasa admitted to this then it would validate prophecies of Ascension and galactic cycles of consciousness. We are awakening as we enter into this higher energetic zone aka age of Aquarius. A lot of stuff ties into this and conspiracies shoot off in multiple directions regarding this.

       I enjoyed the comment! Definitely some good thoughts. It sucks that people will laugh at it due to a lack of knowledge. I honestly think that some shit goin down in space and something way bigger than humans being at play intergalactically (other than superior life forms taking over) would be one of the more beautiful “conspiracies” to come true.

       I would assume heavy metals even in vapor fall pretty quickly so it could be a pretty local thing (avoiding some rich zip codes / counties).  Idk, why put fluoride in the water if its the same water everyone uses could be similar.

       You are making the assumption that the power hungry people behind the various types of spray programs are SANE first of all. People with immense power are often clinical psychopaths. Secondly, they may think that heavy metal chelation and other forms of detoxification would mitigate the effects on their bodies.

       The rich, elite, corporations, politicians, etc didn't have any issues pumping millions of tons of lead in the air even after it the severe health risk it exposed was revealed.  Even after the revelation it was sold on to the public as "safe" for decades.  You have to assume those who knew it was dangerous also let their families buy leaded paints and fuels, breath the air without a care.

       Pretty sure it's admitted to now and not just the US I seen a youtube doc and it was in Italy or something and the film crew managed to record the pilot admitting it started small and he digs into it until he realizes they are recording and filming but says he flips a switch at a certain area and altitude. You'll have to look into it but I think more believe than not believe at this point..all the people who claim your crazy are nowhere to be found once it's declassified. Or when they find out the word conspiracy theorists was pushed to discredit free thinking, open minded people smart enough to connect dots by the cia and people fall right into it. Not everything is true but I mean contrails and chemtrails do look way different. Global warming..ya the sun heats up and cools down every 11 years. It has a solar cycle. The beginning sun spots and activity start at the poles away from us. Over 11 years the activity gets closer to the equator of the sen and more sun spots thus heating us up alot (being closer to us). We just ended our solar maximum and we could be going into a GRAND solar minimum and actually cooling down alot. WE have less sun spots and a later start to the suns solar cycle than the last mini ice age last I checked. It might have changed but we could be looking at a complete weather change from the equator up if the sun doesn't start getting hot again fast. Look into it..solar cycle..solar maximum and solar minimum. All the global warming was at the peak of the 11 year maximum but the sun has been cooling believe it or not with less sun spots. I'm sure the ozone isn't in great shape but I think a lot of it was a guilt trip to make ourselves feel bad and dump money into fighting "global warming" and all that. Ill edit and add a link.

       No,  jet fuel is used to get rid of stuff that is inconvenient to dispose of in more concentrated ways,  that also can be used to leave mist in the skies that filters light and has climate effects.

       The material is highly diluted and the objective is more climate related,   but also like fluoride,   the stuff needs to gotten rid of anyway.

       I was a Royal Navy aircraft engineer working on gas turbine engines. There's some unusual things you can put through them, such as coal dust. But most substances which burn, such as aluminium, are too hot and would melt the turbine blades. Imagine you chuck some random chemical into you vehicle tank.... How do you think it will run? How would you get anything into the fuel anyway? It's not like lead, where a few grams per tankful is all that's needed. You would have to put in enough to create a 200 mile long plume of dense white aerosol that's half a mile wide. How would you do that? Then of course there are other questions, such as "Why does it happen all over the world, even over deserted oceans?" and "How come nobody has ever blown the whistle when every person involved in aircraft operations for the past two decades must be in on the conspiracy?" and my favourite "Who pays for all of this?"

       Thanks for the sincere questions.    Most of the stuff on chemtrails fails,   just like most of the stuff on ufo's.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not ready to write it off.    Climate modification is a thing even if most of the chemtrail stuff is bogus.

       Jobs are very compartmentalized and professionals have often kept information in house.   We do not live in transparent times,  and a lot a programs have been disclosed regarding exposing people to really bad shit,  its now a proven fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am mostly skeptical myself.

       it's for weather manipulation or geoengineering. been in the works since the great war. they used it in vietnam to extend the monsoon season. chemtrails is the word to associate this legit cover up with crazy people so it can be dismissed and laughed at.
