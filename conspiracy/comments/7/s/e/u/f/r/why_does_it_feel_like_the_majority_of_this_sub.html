Is it just because christians in the US technically do not like Judiasm b/c they dont believe in Jesus Christ &amp; Jews think US christians are dumb for believing in Jesus but work together anyway against Islam so the western left aligns with Palestine to spite both even though the majority of the left is non-religious so they just get in the middle to make sure shit keeps getting stirred up?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is silly. Anyone who is not averse to knowing history, in an unbiased manner, knows that the Palestinians got robbed, plain &amp; simple. Anyone who prefers justice as opposed to injustice can see the Palestinians got fucked over, frankly through no fault of their own. The Holocaust was not <em>their</em> fault, why the fuck should they have to suffer because of it? Everything the Palestinians have done since then in retaliation is completely normal &amp; expected human behavior given their situation, not unlike how the Indians reacted when Europeans stole their land.  Nothing biased or political about that. One just has to understand human nature, and it makes sense why an averagely intelligent person, who has no dog-in-the-race &amp; is just watching from afar, would feel sympathy for the Palestinians. As most do for what the Jews had to endure during WWII (I certainly do), but what a shitty thing to do to an unrelated nation and people as a result.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Colonial</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zionism is not tied to a metropole/parent state. It is entirely based on the fact that Jews are returning to their homeland from which they never severed their emotional, religious or even physical ties. Zionism is anti-colonialist in that it fights against outsiders who invaded and colonized it over the centuries during the Diaspora. It is not a colonial movement, it is a national liberation movement.</p>

<p>Jews in Europe were treated as &quot;the other.&quot; There is little nostalgia for the shtetl from the people who actually lived there.</p>

<p>Israel, on the other hand, was always considered home for Jews. Way before Zionism, Jews have made the trip to the Land. The yearning for Zion and Jerusalem has been a fixed part of Judaism and has been part of the daily prayers ever since the destruction of the second Temple.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They were not a free people in a sovereign nation,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Palestine will become a recognized state after the remains of the Oslo accords are dealt with. Israel who hold military control over all the land says its not a country. Nor does not the United States. And Area C will be transferred in whatever part or parts as soon as the Palestinian Authority decides they will actually come to negotiate without preconditions and they will actually negotiate instead of present demands and ultimatums.</p>

<p>Consumer goods to Gaza come by the truckload daily. The Gaza shopping malls are filled with goods. Gaza&#39;s people are eating well.</p>

<p>Palestinians had zero democratic control over the policies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it is partly because Israel is seen as the aggressor, making Palestine the underdog. Plus, Israel is the one that started stealing the land, they are thieves and murderers. And maybe Palestine is guilty of some atrocities too, but as far as I&#39;m concerned they are just defending their homeland.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I used to think this, but it appears Israel and KSA have some sort of wink-nod-mutual back scratching thing going on.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not against the existence of Israel, and I understand why many Jews have concerns about the rest of the world being out to get them. I also know that the Arab world hasn&#39;t been welcoming at all of the Palestinians and uses them as a chess piece to keep their populations anger directed elsewhere. </p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t reduce my sympathy for the Palestinians and wishes that the Israelis would treat them better. </p>

<li><p>Israel Lobbyist calls for False Flag against Iran: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVWSDKfjg48">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVWSDKfjg48</a></p></li>

</ul>

<ol>
<li>The current demands of the Palestinians are reasonable by any logical standard:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>1967 borders: taking Land in war is considered illegal after WWII yet Israel took land in both the 1948 war and the 1967. The UN ordered them to give it back. Through the use of a loophole ( lack of &quot;the&quot;) They claimed that the order only refers to land taken in 1967 not 1948. Now they won&#39;t even give the 1967 land back.</p></li>
<li><p>East Jerusalem: according to 1967 borders it belongs to Palestine  but Israel just voted a couple weeks ago to make it harder for future goverments to give it back</p></li>
<li><p>The right of return: The right of the arabs who fled the war in 1948 to return back to their homes in Israel and live there ( become Israeli citizens) or at least be paid back the price of their homes.I think it&#39;s a fair demand.</p></li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><p>By building new settlements Israel and expanding its illegal territory. Israel is literally breaking internation law.</p></li>
<li><p>Israel was found to be an apartheid state according to a UN report.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>it breaks Palestinians down to 4 gorups:
the report actually spoke about 4 gorups:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The first group identified is the roughly 1.7 million Palestinians who are full citizens of Israel, but who, the report found, live under “martial law” and are subjected to oppression because they are not Jewish.</p></li>
<li><p>The second group highlighted in the report is the estimated 300,000 Palestinians who live in East Jerusalem, a mostly Arab area. The report said these Palestinians “experience discrimination in access to education, health care, employment, residency and building rights.”</p></li>
<li><p>The third group includes the 4.6 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza. In the West Bank, the Jewish residents known as settlers are governed by Israeli civil law, while Palestinians live under military rule.</p>

<p>“This dual legal system, problematic in itself, is indicative of an apartheid regime,” said the authors.</p></li>
<li><p>The last group discussed in the report are the millions of Palestinian refugees who live outside Israeli territory and who are prohibited from returning to their homes in Israel or the occupied Palestinian territory.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you want to read the report for yourself: <a href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/201703_UN_ESCWA-israeli-practices-palestinian-people-apartheid-occupation-english.pdf">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/downloads/201703_UN_ESCWA-israeli-practices-palestinian-people-apartheid-occupation-english.pdf</a></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Israel and Egypt have a Blockade over Gaza and prevents ships and aircrafts from going there thus destroying thier economy.</p></li>
<li><p>Israel prevents Palestinians from getting building permits in their own country (section C) and only gives new building permits to Israelis</p></li>
<li><p>The number of Palestinian casualities are an order of magnitude higher then that of Israel.</p></li>

<li><p>Colonial repression changes the economic calculus individuals make. Selling land while under a violent occupation, I think, qualifies as duress.</p></li>
<li><p>Palestinians had zero democratic control over the policies around land purchases by foreigners. The British pulled out all the stops and allowed unlimited purchase by foreigners when the Palestinians almost certainly would have a collective apprehension to this (see (3))</p></li>
<li><p>Piecemeal changes that seem fine procedurally (such as individual land purchases) can result in undesirable outcomes (the purchasing of the entire country by foreigners and so the indigenous being made landless).
