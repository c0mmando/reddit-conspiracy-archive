    <div class="md"><p>“The minerals found in JSC-1 (lunar regolith simulant), plagioclase, pyroxene, olivine, ilmenite, and chromite, are also characteristic of many lunar basalts and mare soils (Figure 5). The compositional ranges of these lunar minerals generally overlap the ranges of their terrestrial counterparts&quot;<br/>
<a href="http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/HumanExplore/Exploration/EXlibrary/DOCS/EIC050.HTML">http://ares.jsc.nasa.gov/HumanExplore/Exploration/EXlibrary/DOCS/EIC050.HTML</a><br/>
Terrestrial basalts are plentiful, but the advantage of Eucrites is that they show signs of solar and cosmic radiation, which is absent in earth rocks. Things like ‘zap pits’ (micrometeoroid impacts) can be added by firing projectiles from high-speed multi-stage gas guns which existed at the time. To hide the fact that these Eucrites fell through the atmosphere, the first millimetre was chipped away to remove the fusion crust (the outer burned layer due to atmospheric entry).   </p>

<p>Add in the fact that the chinese rover and soviet rover moon soil analysis turned up vastly different ratos and ingredients in the soil compared to Apollo, despite NASA&#39;s clementine probe that said all lunar soil is the same, and the vast differences in water content which prove Apollo&#39;s rocks were from earth and not the moon, and I&#39;d say the page is accurate.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re claiming that they somehow fooled every geologist who has ever studied Moon rocks by using multi-stage gas guns to create zap pits and also managed to chip away all of the fusion crust without anybody who studies this for a living ever noticing.  </p>

<p>Not only that, but they collected more Moon rocks than have ever been found in the history of all Lunar meteorite discoveries without anybody even knowing it!</p>

<p>Amazing jumps in logic required for the fake Moon rock postulation to hold even a drop of water.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You do realize meteorites by definition came from the moon right? There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s illegal to own one. NASA hands out tiny gram samples for study, of which they could send anything they wanted to. You have no idea how much they &quot;collected&quot; as anything they got was locked up in a vault. Most rocks they gave away are missing. Soil samples are tiny amounts. Call up NASA and ask if you can see the room with hundreds of kilo&#39;s of moon rocks and they&#39;ll tell you to fly a kite.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My mom was one of the lead programmers for the shuttle orbiter from the late 70s through the late 80s, and she worked with both Apollo astronauts and engineers. I used to spend a lot of time hanging  around Johnson Space Center in Clear Lake Texas on my summer breaks, and I got to see a lot of &quot;behind the scenes&quot; areas. There was an amazing amount of both facilities/infrastructure and activity going on that nobody really got to see, as well as engineers and former astronauts that didn&#39;t seem like they were all telling falsehoods to my mom, and she never got that impression.</p>

<p>Of course, I&#39;m just a random guy on a conspiracy sub, and might be a bot or a shill, but I&#39;m sharing my personal experienc, which leads me to believe that we sent 7 missions to the moon, 6 of which were successful.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What is the possibility that we pre-recorded  &quot;moon mission&quot; to show the public but performed a different mission? If anything, that would be more plausible than faking the whole thing. That way we would just have to fake the return party if they died in space. The odd thing to me is that they would discard so much original footage of the first mission ever. Seems like you would maintain that forever. Unless the stuff for TV was made up, and they did keep the original footage which occurred in the weeks prior.</p>

<p>Some amateur managed to listen in on some of the transmissions from the moon with a directional antenna. That would mean that a relay would have had to have been sent to the moon at the very least. Add in the other artifacts that are there, and I think the simpler explanation is that man went to the moon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are some known Ham radio operators who attest to having picked up signals from Apollo (Paul Wilson, Richard Knadle, Larry Baysinger, Sven Grahn), but none of them can attest to having tracked these probes all the way to the moon and back. Grahn for example only testifies to having picked up signals from Apollo 17 when it was in earth orbit, when it was on the moon and in lunar orbit. He openly admits to not tracking it the whole way there and back. Baysinger only received communications from Apollo 11 during the alleged moonwalk, again not the way to the moon and back. Wilson &amp; Knadle received signals from a diversity of Apollo missions, but again only when the crafts were in lunar orbit – an exception being Apollo 15 in which they received a handful of signals on the alleged flight home.   </p>

<p>And on the Russian side, for the most part the Soviets had relied heavily on Jodrell Bank just to track their own moon-bound spacecrafts because they lacked the capability to do it themselves (this was discussed in the BBC series, The Planets). Although later in the early 60s they were able to build deep space network tracking facilities with a 100million kilometre range, none of these radio telescopes were tuneable to the 2.3GHz (2300MHz) signals used by Apollo. Only at the last minute in November 1968 did they manage to equip their TNA-400 * facility in Crimea with suitable receiving equipment.<br/>
And even then, because NASA did not supply them with the ballistics data, the Soviets were limited to listening to it during the time Apollos 8, 10, 11 and 12 were supposedly in lunar orbit.  They themselves sent a craft around the moon with tape recorders in the craft, and had they not admitted it, NASA would have thought humans were aboard the ship.  </p>

<p>Only the NASA Manned Space Flight Network can attest to having tracked these vehicles all the way to the moon and back. This Network comprised of Goldstone Tracking Station in California, the Madrid Deep Space Communications Complex, and various facilities in Australia; most notably Parkes Observatory, Honeysuckle Creek and Tidbinbilla. In the case of Parkes, it was (and still is) owned by the Australian government but was under control of and under contract to NASA during the time of the Apollo missions. It was NASA’s very own Robert Taylor who controlled the release of any data from Parkes during the Apollo 11 mission and his team were responsible for the reception, recording and transfer of audio, video and telemetry at Parkes. And on the subsequent flights technicians and engineers from NASA’s Tidbinbilla complex were heavily involved at Parkes. It’s essentially a fox guarding the hen house scenario. And of course the TV signals were transmitted securely, so nobody could just pick them up. Only NASA could decode them. </p>

<p>So, hams got signals from both lunar orbit and lunar landings, but didn&#39;t get them from the journey to the moon.  Is your claim that they teleported to the moon?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No the common belief that NASA was tracked all the way to the moon and back by amatures is incorrect. The fact is they could have pulled a Zond 5 with tape recorders in a tin can or simply transmitted the signals to the lunar surface and bounced them back off the moon and nobody would be the wiser.  </p>

<p>The most obvious proof is the video of Apollo 11 faking being halfway to the moon when they were in Earth orbit by using transparencies over the window to make te earth appear small. Its a smoking gun. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You could have all the HAM radios you want, but there would be no way to tell if NASA was pulling a Zond 5 with tape recorders. You could tell if they were real if you intercepted transmissions of tv and photography data, but of course NASA sends them encrypted so only they can decode them, wouldn&#39;t want anyone to prove the fakery.  </p>

<p>The LRO operates at an altitude of 50km and returns images of resolution 0.5 metres/pixel.  GeoEye-1 satellite for example has perfectly resolved cars and even individual people at 0.5 m/pixel, in colour, through an atmosphere, and from an altitude 14 times higher up than the LRO. If NASA had installed a similar camera we would be seeing a resolution of 3 cm/pixel and this would allow us to see the hardware in great detail – assuming that it’s there. We would also be able to see the landscape in great detail and compare it to the Hasselblad images. Since the landscape had never been photographed at that resolution prior to the Apollo missions, a match between the two sets of images would provide a good test of Apollo’s authenticity. Of course, NASA would never release photo&#39;s of such resolution, because it would prove the missions never happened. They are even outlawing future rovers from the areas of Apollo.  </p>

<p>Another easy way to prove fakery is using the VLT. We know the lunar module is 4 metres across and the moon is 380,000km away. So from this calculation, we know that we need a telescope with an angular resolution of 0.002arc-seconds. The VLT is the only telescope on earth that can resolve down to 0.001 arc seconds, enough to resolve the lunar mission hardware, but despite  Dr. Richard West stated that he would use the VLT-I to try and resolve the Apollo artefacts, he never has done so and the people who run the place wont do it either. ESO have since gone on record to state that the VLT-I “cannot be used to observe the moon”, but offer no explanation as to why it can’t be used. and despite the fact that it HAS been used <a href="http://www.eso.org/public/about-eso/faq/faq-vlt-paranal/#18">http://www.eso.org/public/about-eso/faq/faq-vlt-paranal/#18</a>  </p>

<p>Hell, even Hubble can view the moon<br/>
<a href="http://hubblesite.org/news_release/news/1999-14">http://hubblesite.org/news_release/news/1999-14</a><br/>
Despite people saying it is too bright to photograph with hubble.  NASA themselves even stonewalled people and said it was too bright, until we found out they calibrate the thing pointing it at earths clouds, many times brighter than even the brightest moon. The images released are roughly of the same quality as Clementine  (in other words, not very good). NASA is hiding something and so is the VLT</p>

<p>Dude, wtf?<br/>
The reason why it wasn&#39;t a problem then was because Congress was funding it, and there was a political reason to fund it. As soon as we got to the moon, NASA&#39;s budget plummeted from the 5% of the national budget it was then down to the ~0.4% of the budget that it is today. They are getting less than 1/10th the budget for it, and the Moon isn&#39;t even really the goal anymore.  </p>

<p>How is it not? Can you seriously not comprehend the fact that politics change with time? Could you maybe explain to me why we don&#39;t think the Confederate States of America are a major national security threat now if we did in the past? According to your logic, that makes no sense.    </p>

<p>What? How is that a cover up? If NASA wanted to reconfigure LC39-A to launch STS instead of Apollo, that is not covering it up.   </p>

<blockquote>
<p>they deliberately recored over the moon landing data, &quot;because magnetic tape is expensive&quot;... and &quot;because nobody thought to archive it  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>They recorded over the higher quality version of the original Apollo 11 live feed during a tape shortage. I doubt that they would have done that if someone had noticed. If you think that that footage is required to prove the Apollo landings happened, well then congratulations, because it already exists and you can go watch it on YT.  </p>
