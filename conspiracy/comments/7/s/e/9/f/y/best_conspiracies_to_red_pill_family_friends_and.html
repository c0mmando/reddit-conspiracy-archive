        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Hello to you all.</p>

<p>I apologise if something like this has already been posted I have been searching around social media, YouTube etc but no luck.</p>

<p>Can we try and get a list together of easy to digest and accept &quot;conspiracies&quot; that are 100% true and can be validated by &quot;trusted&quot; sources of information? </p>

<p>Preferably small ones that can be explained and proven within 5-10 mins or so. </p>

<p>The justification for the Iraq war is one I can think of. </p>

<p>I would appreciate any suggestions, for those who want to go the extra mile put the sources and everything.</p>

<p>I want to get this list and help spread the red pills as much as I can. I feel the time is approaching when we need as many people awake as possible. </p>

<p>Thank you. </p>

<p>Edit 2: btw bit disappointed in the downvotes, I&#39;m attempting to spark people&#39;s interest, so they may start down the &quot;rabbit hole&quot; surely even if the list is used to help people who are just getting into these things. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, I did that. It’s not clear what’s wrong though. </p>

<p>Sorry if I seem to be acting dense, I read Reddit exclusively on mobile on an app and the stuff you see on the full-fat web client doesn’t always render the same on these 3rd party clients.</p>

<p>So: I see posts in the non-Reddit archives that are not present in the official Reddit history for this user. Is the implication that Reddit silently pruned this user’s history, while the archives show the true post timeline?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Never apologies for attempting to be more intelligent, in ways you perceave to be lacking.</p>

<p>THough, the phrase: &quot;the wise dont need it, and the fool wont heed it&quot;, comes to mind.</p>

<p>In that, what is your social weight, as an intellectual?</p>

<p>If your the cousin who wears a lamp-shade when they are drunk, or the guy who was wrong about everything-else before, you have to work on your social value in intellectual weight. </p>

<p>This is actually how conspiracy theories stay afloat. Authority of intellectualism and knowledge, THEN authority of argument and logic. </p>

<p>If logic and argument was enough, we would be cracking cases left and right. It&#39;s the authorities and their documents that drive truth. </p>

<p>Authority is then perceptual. So, you must work on your perceptual authority; as this value is ascribed differently based on personal values.  </p>

<p>You have to pace-and-lead intellectual discourse. Ask questions you know the answer to, only to lead the intellectual discourse to the real questions that make/break paradigms of belief.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Belief is a faith. A faith based on a foundation of other senses of knowing.</p>

<p>&quot;A belief without end is not even a belief&quot;</p>

<p>So, then, it&#39;s important to deduce where their belief sits on a hierarchy of ideas, and where that idea hold value in scope of others. No ideas fit perfectly. </p>

<p>Generalizations are lies of the self, or means to assess situations quickly, and specifically supplies an understanding of category and the actual &#39;how&#39;; the process involved in the propositions we make about reality. </p>

<p>You want to pace generalizations till they cant answer a &#39;how&#39;, and then you lead back up the propositional scale of conceptual-scope to make a point.</p>

<p>This is the process.</p>

<p>The attitude must always be Socratic. </p>

<p>&quot;I dont know, hence is why I ask&quot;</p>

<p>you&#39;re not teaching, you&#39;re learning together. </p>

<p>Its not a do-to process, it&#39;s a do-with process.</p>

<p>This makes exploring someones flawed conceptions an adventure, where you&#39;re a guide rather than an antichrist. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree partially. There are a lot of people that will only listen to you if you come across as an expert. Society has been trained to not think for themselves and only listen to specialists of a certain scientific area.</p>

<p>The human being inside us, however, has a fairly good grasp on what comes across as true. So sometimes, your social status doesn&#39;t even matter that much if you come across as sincere. Richie from Boston is a good example. While you might not agree with everything he says and he might be wrong when it comes to quite a few things, he comes across as a genuine person and therefor draws in quite a crowd. I subscribed to him half a year ago and his channel gained 100k subs over that time period, despite Youtube algorithms working against his favour. Honesty and truth maintain their value no matter how pathetic your societal position is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is sound advice.  The red pill is pretty hard to swallow.  Almost everyone will criticize you for speaking out against the mainstream narrative.  I tried the 9/11 thing on a lifelong friend, including the engineering reports proving controlled demolition.  But that friend&#39;s wife lived in New York at the time, and she was absolutely appalled that I would challenge the official narrative after so many heroic rescue workers sacrificed their own well being to help those who were hurt by &quot;the terrorists&quot;.  People just don&#39;t want to listen to reason, or facts.  They think with their guts, and what almost everyone&#39;s gut says is: &quot;trust the MSM, trust the government, trust the NSA, trust mega-corps...&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I do think that, yes.  But at this time, even while awakening is on the up-tick, the mass of sheeple is still much much much larger than the mass of people with even a little suspicion.  TPTB have spent decades assaulting the ability of the general population to think critically, or even consider reflectively their own position in the world power structure.  They&#39;ve done this specifically to slow or entirely prevent the very mass awakening that we&#39;re discussing now.</p>

<p>A good indicator of a person&#39;s readiness might be gauged by their suspicion of the monetary system.  Ask a person what they know about how exactly money is created and enters the economy.  If they&#39;re willing to believe the truth of that (which is, central banks create &quot;money&quot; out of thin air and lend it to governments, businesses, and consumers at interest) then you&#39;ve got a chance that they might actually be willing to listen to other truths.</p>

<p>I drop little bombs, like on the bus, when someone said they saw a picture of me on fb and I was like, <em>no, I don&#39;t upload selfies to CIAfacebook</em> in a very playful manner. It gets people thinking if they want to, but doesn&#39;t push an agenda. </p>

<p>People like their little denial bubbles. It&#39;s safe and validating. If they want out, they&#39;ll ask. </p>

So, a coworker or family member  (or even stranger) could report you to the police, who are not trained in mental health. Or worse than that, you could fall into a public threat/domestic terrorist. I&#39;m not saying that any of those things are true or fair, I&#39;m saying it&#39;s a recent trend to arrest people for even speaking up against the establishment at public forums...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is good advice.</p>

<p>Ask questions, like non-leading questions.</p>

<p>Plant seeds of information.  Real, verifiable, and as much as I hate to say it, from the mainstream media, or &#39;reputable&#39; sites.</p>

<p>Always be calm, do not get excited, agitated or manic.</p>

<p>It&#39;s better to go hmmm than argh.</p>

<p>If they want to think about it, they will.  Don&#39;t be afraid to change the subject to something more mundane and regular, and go back to your point later.</p>

<p>Also make sure you talk to them about other things, not just conspiracy all the time.</p>

<p>And yes, as above always with love.</p>
