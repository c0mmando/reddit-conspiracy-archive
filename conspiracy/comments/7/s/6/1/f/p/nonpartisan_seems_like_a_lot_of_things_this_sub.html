       On a side note, someone made a post about the blue hose on the floor of his hotel room. It has what looks to be a snorkel mouthpiece on the end of it. That was interesting, something I only saw here, and I'm unsure if that went anywhere, despite being fairly clear in pictures.

       No? Look at any popular post. Probably a Trump one although they come out for Syria and Ukraine posts too.

       any comments which don't align with Russian policy positions are heavily downvoted and ridiculed.

       Your own comment suggests the very idea is ridiculous. Because you have been conditioned by years in this type of community and it has eroded your cognitive ability to discern truth from fiction, instead you will automatically align yourself with the non dissenters in a comment chain.

       He did use Russia's troll farm as a template to create his own troll farm and has surpassed them in size and scope. They are more prevalant on US social media than any other.

       I shouldn't have to say this, but I've been here for nine fucking years trying my best to post (mostly) high effort comments. I'm not some fucking Russia bot. I'm a legitimate long-standing member of this community.

       I can't prove much of anything, but I know in my gut that ShareBlue is the primary manipulator on this subreddit and many others. CIA is another possibility, but my gut tells me that their propaganda has taken a back seat to private organizations.

       Well, Media Matters already publicly admitted to manipulating social media through Correct the Record. Then we had supposed leaked documents detailing ShareBlue as a spiritual successor to Correct the Record, with a new goal of removing Trump either through impeachment or at the voting booths in 2020. Throughout 2017 I have seen unusual account activity and apparent vote manipulation which appears to be consistent with that goal, and the techniques resemble those used by Correct the Record in 2016.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I already said, I can't prove this gut instinct, I am merely explaining what I believe to be true based on the reasons above and my own experience here and in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       during the election. I'm certain I'm not the only one who feels this way, so I voiced my opinion to add balance to an extremely slanted thread.

       Thread is being gamed.  I asked for a non-partisan thread and so the "Democrats" are gaming it in a way that provides them plausible deniability by riding hard a "Democratic talking point", which is, "muh Russian collusion".  You and I both know Trump is colluding with a foreign government and it ain't primarily Russia, but a country run by the Ash-ke-nazis of European descent.

       TIL that anything that "aligns with Russian policy positions" or is positive about Trump is automatically Russian propaganda. Anyone that questions this premise in any way is obviously a Russian bot including asking wtf "Russian policy" our why Trump = Russia.

       Isn't it bizarre? I can't get over it, what a strange and terrible idea it is.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean sure, send a few people to keep tabs, gently point out russian media ops and let conspiracyland's natural aversion to that sort of thing do the rest. But it's as if they've challenged themselves to see how much more obvious and obnoxious they can make their own side.

       So weird it is, I'm forced to consider that it's really about the name of the sub and nothing else. No intention to change anyone's mind on the issues, or even change anyone's mind on

       on the issues. Just to cause enough drama to render the place uninhabitable, cause a split, coup the mods and add r/conspiracy to the marketing catalogue. We'll take our heretic ideas and go somewhere else and they won't care, job's a good'un.

       Nice strawman. I was pointing out that the deep state is anti-trump, at least concerning to create division between your only two parties. So thanks for missing the point completely. Also, if you think the deep state cycles between whichever party is in power at the moment you are simply delusional. These aren't Republicans OR democrats. These are the richest people in the world who control everything, why the fuck would they be partisan?

       Not trying to be rude, but what the hell are you doing here if you don't accept the idea of the deep state? This is conspiracy basics. I suggest you read up on this before you start a discussion about something you have literally no knowledge about. But I'll answer your question: the people in charge have nothing to do with trump and are orders of magnitude richer and more powerful. Trump is a puppet.

       I just haven't seen anything that makes me believe it yet. Everyone is simply acting in their own best interest. And for most people with a lot of power, their best interest does not align with ours.

       First of all, that is not a good attitude to have if you truly want to enlighten people.

       Second of all, you should never ask someone to research something they do not believe for your sake. Never works.

       Sorry dude, the topic is too broad for me to spend 2 hours finding sources and typing up a coherent post just for your sake while you can easily find it yourself if you're that interested (which you obviously aren't). If that means you give up on learning something, well, I don't really care, and you don't seem like the type of person who would accept something that challenges your dogmatic views of authority anyway. Good luck with whatever your plan is though.

       Okay then buddy. So far everything I've said about you, you have affirmed to be true. While you just sound like a 14 year old kid who has it all figured out, and also expects other people to literally spend hours of their free time to try to futilely convince you of something you had made your mind up about a long time ago.

       Nice talking points. I hear them

       in this sub. I also notice that neither you, nor any of the other accounts that spread them (with comment histories full of identical claims) ever bother to prove them, or even engage in fact-based discussion. It's always logical fallacies, forum disruption tactics, and unproven or provably wrong claims.

       "The insider was hired in February 2017 to make posts on Reddit, Twitter and 4chan as well as prepare responses for ShareBlue social media bots at an average rate of 2 cents per post. According to the insider, mostly individuals from India, China and Thailand are recruited to ShareBlue even though they directly intervene in U.S. politics."

       All it says is he has some anonymous source that says they worked for Shareblue. Could just be the author made that up himself. Why is it you take this guys word for it with no questions, but are a skeptic when it disagrees with you?

       Oh and even if we take your link as the truth, it in no way shows that Shareblue is more active or has a larger budget than Cambridge Analytica. In fact, in the article it even says that the anonymous source had the opportunity to post for Trump as well.

       Because every post or comment I make gets brigaded by Shareblue employees. You keep denying what everyone here experiences and citing irrelevant, general claims about Cambridge Analytica that no one is disagreeing with. As if proving that Cambridge Analytica were also here would disprove the Shareblue shills that we all see every single day.

       I know you are not a shill? Do you believe the same for me?

      <p>
       Why is it that your downvoted comment had to be because of shills? Why is it impossible that many disagree with you and how you go about yourself on this subreddit? I certainly disagree, does that mean I am a shill?
      </p>
      <p>
       You claim everyone on this sub has the same experiences as you and believes the same things you do. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
       I would be much less likely to downvote and be hostile towards you if you didn't dismiss any thought or opinions other than your own as shills. Could that not be the reason you are downvoted?
      </p>
      <p>
       In my time here, I have never seen you question a right wing narrative. That makes me question your motivations, and makes me more likely to dismiss your comments. I'm sure you would agree if the shoe was on the other foot.

       It's a small minority of conspiracy people that do their own research and look for evidence. Those also happen to be the people most likely to join someplace like r/conspiracy at the ground floor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conspiracy veterans want to hear about things like the conspiracy to create the Federal Reserve or the British Empire's involvement in the US Civil War, because you have to understand the past to understand the present.
      </p>
      <p>
       The new people just want to hear about the latest political happening, and will even attack anything older than a month or two because it's not happening. Happenings give more of a dopamine hit, but they're less likely to be important in the grand scheme of things.

       Seems like a lot of people are building straw men to disparage the conspiracy community. Saying a lot of these things go no deeper than 4chan or twitter is a misleading statement. Twitter users can post videos, articles, infographs, self report, etc. 4chan has users participating there that may not come to this forum. An occasional glance at an interesting conversation over there should always be welcome. If you don't agree with it, downvote and move along. I'm seeing a huge increase in the amount of concern trolling lately, though I admit, this may be because of Rule 13 drying up the amount of posts, and making self posts more visible.
