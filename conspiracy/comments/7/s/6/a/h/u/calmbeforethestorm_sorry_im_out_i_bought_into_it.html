       I honestly think Trump has created a reality show of sorts and is playing the villain to an extent.  Q is a perfect example, They're a mysterious character who drops 1/2 truths or just enough info to keep people latched on.  TCBTS is an underlying theme that can be applied to anything, alsp designed to keep people engaged.  It's reminiscent (for me) of watching the fan fiction/theories for the show The Leftovers.

       IMO trump was put in to get all the conspiracy theorists on his side, only for him to eventually fuck them over somehow. theres nooo way TPTB would put a guy in office for any reason other than their own gain, and if you dont believe the elections are rigged, you just havent done the research.

       It really could go either way imo.  I can see how the establishment and everyone else for that matter, didn't think Trump was going to win.  When he did, the establishment went on the attack to get Trump fully under their control (which I think they have).  However, you make a great point which was trying to get the conspiracy world to get drawn in by people like Alex Jones and other CT's, and that could have been for several different reason.

       Yeah, I'm with you. Trump came out of nowhere and you could tell the system genuinely hated him. I supported him for mainly that reason. after he was elected, he had this flurry of activity trying to fulfill campaign promises.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then all of a sudden he bomb Syria with no good rationalization, and ever since then he's been either floundering on everything or pushing establishment goals.

       Worried.  And to be quite honest with you even as strangers, I was an ardent agnostic until I learned of the validity of all the info regarding ((them)).  I came to a full stop, and I am a passionate Christian again.  I am working on several documents to invigorate those who know these things to come to faith, and to
       <a href="https://pastebin.com/6nTX0dFa">
        fight for truth, reason, and freedom
       </a>
       . I really do belive it will be impossible to fight the depth of this "evil" without believing in a higher power, whether the higher power exists or not.... and so that does take faith... belief without direct evidence.  The evidence is in the spirit of the people.

       You mean the mostly empty airfield in which a few people were killed? I didn‘t like the bombing, but on the scale of things, it was nothing. And now Isis is mostly done. What about that? Or did Putin do that like Obama did this economy?

       How is that possible? We all know how rigged elections are. I was on the trump side for a while and this is gonna sound crazy but honestly what made me switch was looking into all the crazy shit about him involving 666 and it being said in the Bible that the antichrist was a master manipulator who had everyone "of our species" on his side. If everyone ends up being red pilled eventually they will all follow trump.  also I don't believe TPTB let Trump take office without their consent.

       Surely you must admit it's atleast possible? My main "selling point" on why it is possible and most likely even, is the MSM and how their true color sort of showed after Trump, one of the foremost weapons of TPTB working 24/7 on an almost global scale to convince the common man he is Hitler reborn. Ridiculous and very transparent imo.

       If their end goal would be to simply create a political landscape in where tensions rise enough to spark say a civil war in America and Europe, with increasing immigration and the violence that comes with that, then it makes sense. Right now though I see a healthy future in America under Trump, as soon as his nay-sayers see through the BS surrounding him presented by the MSM. Seems to me he really cares for his country. My humble opinion.

       What makes you think it is actually for Trump?  It has the effect of occupying all the minds of the super autistic people who helped comb through the DNC and Podesta emails...  sending them on a rabbit chase and convincing them they are looking for one thing which blinds them from seeing anything else...

       Dude... that is what I was thinking too. I was really caught up in this for a while, but it seems very "anti jewish, anti democrat, anti immigrant"... and while the democratic party def has fucked up recently and I agree with stopping illegal immegration, the fact that nothing negative about trump seems to ever be released and makes him look like some kind of mastermind makes me very skeptical.
      </p>
      <p>
       It seems like this whole narrative has been thought up and released to the public to get us engaged in this "real life drama".... cause the last few months have legit felt like we are living in a TV show, like 24 or something, and we get to read what is going on behind the curtain. It just seems too juicy with all this Satanism stuff and 1000+ people indicted, internal coup and all that. Real life has gotten more interesting then the TV dramas and we are living the reality show.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of it seems to be coming true tho.... even this "10 days of darkness" was called out before hand right? I really don't know how this will all end up.... I just hope it won't end in a biblical flood or Armageddon lol.

       The whole things just seems really contrived and overly produced.  I also don't think it's just for his supporters, I feel like Trump feeds the Trump Hate with his tweet intentionally to pacify the #resist crowd.

       Yea, Q being called the new "Deepthroat" and everything, just the way it has all played out before. Its def something new, and almost like getting the people more engaged in the politics from a social media POV. I can't help but feel like I'm being manipulated by an AI that was designed to stir this stuff up and push a narrative about how "the left was wrong! come join the right side!".
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for trumps tweets.... I can't begin to figure out the point of those, but he def gets people riled up. Plus, aside from the indictments most of his other acts as president I have not seen as positive so I don't get all this support.... its like this "storm is coming" stuff is a distraction while he approves a bunch of unfavorable stuff instead and people tolerate/ignore it waiting for the payout that might not come.

       This is like saying “I used to believe in X, but since these other losers believe it, I’m out - not because the reasons are unsound, I just don’t like these people”.

       When a movement reaches a critical mass, it inevitably attracts folks to the bandwagon who don’t fit the central message of the movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It also attracts agent provocateurs who try to associate the movement with more fringe and extreme thoughts in order to discredit the movement.

       The Trump worship is ridiculous. I liked Obama but I never referred to him as daddy or emporer. Or just completely threw out what evidence and facts are to make what he's saying seem correct. I never would have believed him if he said I had 125 million at my inauguration and then come to find out it's much less and easily checked

       Funny thing is that Al Gore didn't say that- the media did and those that did were forced to make an apology and retraction. In very small print.
      </p>
      <p>
       What Gore did was this :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        As a Senator in the 1980s Gore urged government agencies to consolidate what at the time were several dozen different and unconnected networks into an “Interagency Network.” Working in a bi-partisan manner with officials in Ronald Reagan and George Bush’s administrations, Gore secured the passage of the High Performance Computing and Communications Act in 1991. This “Gore Act” supported the National Research and Education Network (NREN) initiative that became one of the major vehicles for the spread of the Internet beyond the field of computer science.

       I also want to say: why is the media

        so
       </strong>
       <em>
        against
       </em>
       Trump if he is deep state?  I want to make a plea to you, to give it the chances I'm laying out in this comment (above) (and) below.  "deep state", the illuminati "them"... they are called many names. Rothschilds/Soros at top.

       Well a lot of us thought that Trump was a "trick" to fool conspiracy communities into endorsing him as a savior of sorts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The election was rigged, just like all others, but it had more of a convincing "good cop bad cop" narrative with trump and Hillary.
      </p>
      <p>
       So essentially, Q is being used as the spokesperson or the PR guy for trump to string along conspiracy theorists and get them trusting the government. It's a very large scale psy op.

       read the culture of critique, and do some research on current ownership of particular institutions.  Or look at WTC owner, $4.5b, etc.  Qanon may or may not be real.  The rest presented has a mountain of evidence behind it.

       That’s cool and all. If you’ve grown dis-satisfied with it, turn your head and walk away. Instead, you choose to state your issues with it, invite other people to head on over there with your biases already in mind, and see what they think. It might get interpreted as an attempt to brigade.

       There are a hell of a lot of ‘echo-chamber’ subs on Reddit. Tends to happen when like-minded folks want to share/discuss a common interest. Most often than not, the people that go to these subs and accuse them of being ‘fanatical’ or close-minded are just going there to subvert their conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
       From t_d to politics, it happens. The exception tends to be subs like this. “Welcome to r/conspiracy; where the votes don’t matter and everyone thinks everyone else is a shill, regardless of the way you lean.”

       The part of this that always eats at my mind is, how long can a calm possibly be, before a storm arrives?
      </p>
      <p>
       President Trump said this in early October, 2017. Usually a storm is on the horizon when others notice the calm. We are now 3 months out from this comment and no 'storm' is materializing.

       I agree with you that there has been some turmoil. Whether that counts as part of the storm or not is suspect. Is Saudi and Hollywood two different storms? Or both part of the same storm? I personally think that it was an off the cuff remark by POTUS with no real meaning. I haven't even seen any official follow up from Trump on this.

       I think it's all connected. The Saudi purge and the Hollywood players going down that were big into politics like Weinstein were necessary to cut of the support for the corrupt people that are about to go down.

       The Saudi shit is for sure a huge deal. It's cut off the flow of cash from a segment of the royal family that was funding Twitter, Citibank, who knows what other anti-American/"globalist" organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of that trickles down to Hollywood, because a lot of these Hollywood actresses (and actors) are whoring themselves to the Saudis for big paydays. You really think Selena Gomez, Kendell Jenner and Gigi Hadid were just "touring" the Middle East two years ago? They made stops in all the kingdoms. Then they get back and Gomez gets $$$ for TV show (glorifying teen suicide btw), Jenner becomes a top model and spokeswoman (for that ridiculous Pepsi ad) and Hadid is atop all the model gossip pages.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's just one example among many.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Saudi coup was a big deal. Haven't you noticed how little followup there's been that Osama bin Laden's brother (and head of bin Laden Group in KSA) and Prince Bandar "Bush" were among the arrests? Why so little coverage of that, do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
       As for Trump, I think he shot his mouth off when he wasn't supposed to, so the Generals who are really running things told him to STFU.

       Yeah it sucks. Selena Gomez is a little whore, which is very sad. She used to be so adorable. You heard about her "auditioning" for Woody Allen FIVE TIMES before she got that role in his next (and hopefully last) movie, right? On the Hollywood gossip site Crazy Days and Nights, it was claimed all those auditions are naked and on film. :-/

       The Kardashian/Jenner clan are raised to be whores, so that's not that unexpected. Gigi Hadid I know nothing about and actually find her less attractive than the other two, so who the fuck knows what her story is.

       I agree with this. The Mandalay Bay saudi conspiracy plus the Weinstein outing and all these outings. It was alot of CRAZY news at once and the combo of thinking they were all related gets the mind thinking theres an underlying conspiracy.. 
Still the LV thing is crazy regardless.. and the arrest of saudi princes was immediately afterwards..

       Trump made that remark on his way out of a meeting with all his top military leaders.

       Immediately afterward, the US along with its counterparts went deep and hard into the two remaining ISIS strongholds (Mosul &amp; Raqqa) and began annihilating them. That was the storm.

       Mosul was wrapped up in July and Raqqa had only 2 blocs left for capture by the start of October and that was wrapped up 2 weeks later. That's can't possibly be it.

       It's true Gen Mattis announced a move towards an "annihilation" phase in May and heavy military pressure was being applied. Trump's "calm before the storm" statement was in October. Then by Christmas news was being reported of Mousul &amp; Raqqa's liberation from ISIS. I really don't think there was any ulterior meaning to Trump's words.

       I'm not trying to argue the finer points of the timeline or why things take longer for news to report than others. Maybe they (Pentagon) wanted to be sure a large enough percentage of ISIS was damaged enough before touting victories?  I just don't believe the hype of any deeper meaning to the "storm" comment is all I'm saying. I don't even think potus meant to say it, personally.

       Not alone, but he bears a good portion of the responsibility this time.  A bipartisan bill was offered twice and the only thing missing was a fully funded wall.  They were asking 20 billion and I think dems gave 16 billion.  However since Trump listened to people like Miller he shot it down.  It generally seemed like repubs and dems came together and hashed out a good deal for both sides.  Now we are back to partisan bickering about whose fault it is with Trump being the loudest one.

       Both congressional parties agreed until the President torpedoed the deal. You keep saying this can’t be on Trump because it’s Congress’ fault. BIPARTISAN congressional leadership already struck a deal. Then, Trump killed it.

       Right. It could be bipartisan in that enough D’s and R’s supported it to get past the 60 vote threshold of a filibuster, but not enough to override a Trump veto with 66 votes. So if Trump said he’d veto it inthat context, it would absolutely be a deal-killer that was entirely his fault.

       They had a deal worked up that included wall funding and DACA and such.  That one would have passed congress easy.  Trump initially supported it and then Kelly and Miller convinced him not to.  The final bill was the one that didn't have DACA protections and such.  That is the one that failed in congress and led to the shutdown.

         The Obama Administration actively spied on Donald Trump during the election/transition using compromised FBI agents to secure a FISA warrant. The FISA warrant is predicated on hearsay (Papadopoulous) and fabricated/unsubstantiated evidenced paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the DNC (Steele Dossier.)

       <li>
        <p>
         The FBI Agent Peter Strzok referred to an "insurance policy" in case Donald Trump got elected. In texts to another FBI agent, Lisa Page, he refers to a meeting in Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe's office where he and McCabe discussed the "insurance policy." The "insurance policy" they were referring to is probably Mueller's special counsel.

          Attorney General Loretta Lynch knew in advance
         </em>
         that Comey was going to exonerate Hillary Clinton. Their conversation suggests that this is the reason Loretta Lynch demurred to Comey's judgment on the case.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Peter Strzok, was the lead agent on Hillary Clinton's email case, which was very obviously botched.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Both Peter Strzok
         <em>
          and
         </em>
         Lisa page were appointed to Robert Mueller's special counsel.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Peter Strzok's text messages were straight up deleted during the time frame just after the Tarmac meeting with Clinton to when the FBI was appointed a Special Counsel on Russia.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       The FBI is currently engaged in an act of sedition against a sitting President of the United States.
       <em>
        That's
       </em>
       the storm. With Nunes' memo about to drop I don't see how you could possibly be "out" when the evidence is stronger than ever that something very, very wrong is happening.

       My understanding is that all it would take to release the memo to the public would be a vote by the House Intelligence Committee. They already voted to release it to Congress (the full Congress mind you - Republicans and Democrats alike) - what makes you think they won't release it to the public?

       Your sources are both partisan I notice.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's think about this for a second: Devin Nunes and Congress are, according to at least
       <a href="https://twitter.com/RepDaveJoyce/status/954797154282950657">
        one congressional source,
       </a>
       in the process of releasing the memo. They have already released the memo to the full Congress (including Republicans and Democrats,) which afterwards several Congressmen said the memo was damning and painted a clear picture of corruption at the highest levels of the DoJ/FBI. That right there is enough to make me disbelieve what you're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not just that, but in the past few days we've had
       <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/370027-fbi-unable-to-preserve-certain-text-exchanges-from-agent-removed-from-mueller">
        breaking news that the FBI "lost" texts from the agent who referred to an "insurance policy" in a meeting with Andrew McCabe
       </a>
       . Not only that, but recently released messages that they DO have from Strzok seem to suggest
       <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/370019-was-lynch-coordinating-with-comey-in-the-clinton-investigation">
        Loretta Lynch knew in advance
       </a>
       that James Comey was going to exonerate Clinton for the email scandal. I don't know about you (actually yes I do,) but, to me, we have more and more evidence piling up that there was some very serious corruption happening - and still happening - over at the FBI.
      </p>
      <p>
       The weakness in your argument is that it all rests on the assumption that this corruption is just a big "nothingburger," a distraction from the Special Counsel by Nunes. It doesn't hold up to even the most basic scrutiny, in part because Nunes is doing everything in his power to make sure this memo gets released and also because
       <em>
        based on what is public knowledge already
       </em>
       there is some pretty damning evidence of corruption at the highest levels of the FBI/DOJ.
      </p>
      <p>
       We
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       know they spied on Trump
       <em>
        during the election.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       We
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       have very strong evidence that they intentionally botched the Clinton investigation
      </p>
      <p>
       We
       <em>
        already
       </em>
       know that the same corrupt agents that were responsible for the Clinton investigation's outcome were deeply involved in the Trump/Russia narrative that led to the FISA warrant that was used to spy on Trump
       <em>
        and also to get the Special Counsel.
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       My question to you is, just how much smoke does there need to be before you will admit to yourself that there's fire?

       No. Rosenstein became acting AG when Sessions recused himself. Rosenstein was already working for the DOJ and was not appointed by Trump. It's a matter of succession; the Deputy AG becomes the Acting AG in matters which the AG recuses him or herself.

      <blockquote>

        President Donald Trump nominated Rosenstein to serve as Deputy Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice on January 13, 2017.[24] He was one of the 46 United States Attorneys ordered on March 10, 2017 to resign by Attorney General Jeff Sessions; Trump declined his resignation
       </p>

      <p>
       So Trump either appointed and or declined resignation of all those who orchestrated the Mueller investigation but this investigation was already drawn up before that to get rid of Trump?!?

       With all due respect, your article is from almost a year ago, and only cites anonymous sources.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        After a review of the same intelligence reports brought to light by House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes, both Republican and Democratic lawmakers and aides have so far found no evidence that Obama administration officials did anything unusual or illegal, multiple sources in both parties tell CNN.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       "So far" being the operating phrase in that sentence. Keep in mind that Nunes and the House Intel Committee has access to ALL classified documents - not just any "Republican or Democratic lawmaker" can go and review his work.
      </p>
      <p>
       That all changed when he released his memo.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not only that, new evidence (see my sources above) has come to light since....April of last year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems to me like you're being dishonest and intentionally misleading people. Saying "republicans themselves debunked" this stuff isn't even in line with the article from almost a year ago you posted, and certainly isn't in line with the current state of this investigation.

       I'm "freaking out" because OP's statement is ignorant of reality. It's more than obvious to anyone that has paid the least bit of attention to the "Storm" that there is evidence of a major scandal going on that makes Watergate look like a fucking Boy Scout Jamboree.
      </p>

       I find it very interesting that OP would just suddenly say to himself "LOL naaaaahh" when in just the past week we've had major revelations in this case (FBI deleting Strzok's text messages, Nunes' memo.)

       I never bought into the whole thing but I did think it was possible he was referring to the battle against his political enemies.  The Mueller investigation, Democrats, ex-Obama ‘deep state’ appointees inside intelligence community getting ready to move against him, going for the kill.  And Trump and GOP (and allies) armed with things like this FISA memo, numerous lawsuits regarding illegal surveillance, text messages, general plan to go after FBI and Mueller credibility and take down these ‘deep state’ enemies.  I always sort of took it as a saying like “shits about to get real.”  I don’t have any evidence for that but regardless if he meant it that way, things seem like they’re about to come to a head pretty soon.

       But the supposed abuses had been going on for like a decade... Nunes has been on about ‘unmasking’ for like a year.  Trump claimed trump tower was wiretapped a year ago.  I think they perceived their enemies a while ago and both sides have been working on taking the other out.  I don’t think that’s a stretch to say, only connecting it with the phrase calm before the storm is kind of dreamed up

       Can you define what you mean by "religious fanaticism"? Also define what constitutes "irrational nationalism".

       And when have Trump supporters ever not been "fan boys"? That last point is pretty much a given for anyone walking into the Q-Anon realms. How did you not see that when you first encountered CalmBeforeTheStorm?

       We are all waiting for criminal elements within our government to be brought to justice but it just doesn’t seem like it’s ever going to happen. There’s always rumors of a leak, or a memo... but they’re always rumors. Now we’re supposed to decode anons on 4chan for our information... I agree, wake me up when the storm hits.

       What you're seeing here, is yes crazy fanaticism.  I liken it to the scene outside the satellite station in the movie "Contact".   People see a good show, "a good time" for all, celebrate in the possibility of the happening, so everyone got in a car and headed to the middle of the desert.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have your alien Elvis, your guy on a soap box interpreting everything as a completely religious experience, your acapella group singing "HAIL TO Q-NON, HAIL TO Q-NON, HAIL TO Q-NON", and a bunch of guys running around with Anonymous face masks, and some guy on the corner selling Q T shirts, 3 for $10.
      </p>
      <p>
       That doesn't mean that actual work isn't being done inside the satellite compound.  Of course something like this will bring out the crazies lol.   Not all of them are crazy.

       It's just the latest in a line of attempts to muddy the waters in the Russia investigation. They're all the same flavor misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
       First it was "Obama illegally wiretapped Trump!"
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it was "The entire memo is fake and made up only by democrats, Fusion GPS are liberal shills."
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it was "Hillary was the one
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       colluding with Russia, LOOK AT URANIUM ONE."
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it's about some memo that Nunes wrote himself, only shows to his cronies, and tells everyone is A REALLY BIG DEAL, but won't show it to anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know I left out a few stops on this trolley ride of stupidity, but that's the obviously transparent motive from almost all Republican talking points on the Russia investigation in the past year.

       It was made up by a British spy, Christopher Steele, because the British Empire is the major power center of the globalists and Hillary was their preferred candidate. The memo was actually sold to Marco Rubio's campaign before Hillary Clinton's campaign, so your attempts to make this into a partisan issue are a fail.

       I think that one side is definitely more fact based than the other. I do not hide my disdain for people who still support Trump for moral, intellectual, and societal reason. If you still support Trump, you're either stupid, misled, or have no moral character.
      </p>
      <p>
       What I meant by "I wasn't trying to make it a partisan issue" is that I was just repeating the Republican talking point that they've since discarded. Yes, it was inherently partisan, but I didn't make it that way by repeating their talking point in an effort you show you how their story has evolved in the past year.

       Manafort was being tapped before he was a Trump campaign member.
      </p>
      <p>
       It must be some crazy forethought is the FISA courts knew in 2014 that he was going to be a member of the non-extant Trump campaign a year before he announced and two years before Manafort was involved.
      </p>
      <p>
       They didn't tap the Trump campaign, that implies they were purposefully targeting it. They tapped Manafort because he's been a Russian shill for more than a decade and was working for Yanukovych/Russia in Ukraine. Then they renewed it when it looked like he was doing the same dirt in America this time.
      </p>
      <p>
       From the source you linked:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The FBI interest deepened last fall because of intercepted communications between Manafort and suspected Russian operatives, and among the Russians themselves, that reignited their interest in Manafort.

       So, you lied about Trump's campaign being tapped. And then you repeated the lie:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        They didn't tap the Trump campaign
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       after it was brought to your attention. So, this wasn't a mistake where you didn't know what happened, because I just referred you to the article destroying your lies. No, you lied on purpose, with full knowledge of the facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       u/Big_Al_SixtySixtyOne is a proven, deliberate liar. Why are you spending inordinate amounts of your time on reddit lying to people? And why should you be allowed to continue lying to everyone here, when it's obvious that you are trying to mislead the community?

       You’re calling him a liar when he didn’t seem to actually lie. If Manafort was tapped before the campaign and it extended into the campaign, it is not lying to say he wasn’t tapped
       <em>
        for
       </em>
       the purpose of spying on the campaign. If you don’t like that they were spying in the first place stop daddy Trump from signing more FISA bullshit.

       CBTS_stream is a great place for research, and the arrests are happening at the lower level now. Human trafficking moving from the procurers towards the top. Getting people to talk is the key, also while taking out MS-13. It will take a while for major events to go down as this has been happening for a long time. The key thing is understanding the patriots in the government and military are getting on board, and now with Trump there can be moves. Bush, Clinton, Obama were controlled, and part of it. Although Obama was a mere puppet, Bush and Clinton were involved in the drugs, money laundering, corruption at the highest levels. It will be exposed to the larger audience soon. That being said the globalist have been so used to having controlled populations who are asleep, now the great awakening is happening. We don't want to destroy the country in the process so it has to go slowly. Can you imagine if the media started talking about Trump taking out his political opposition? It would demoralize the nation, so a lot of this will be done through military tribunals.

       When reality isn't confirming your opinions and worldview, you seek out fantasy to fill in the gaps.
      </p>
      <p>
       Think of it this way, the Trump base eats this "Q" shit up. Much of that base is also a major consumer of fake news. When Trump actually became president, a dilemma came about: how do you continue to believe in your bizarro world fantasies about Jews running the world, shadowy government entities and ultra corruption evil omni-present borderline totalitarian state..... While also being a diehard supporter of Donald Trump... Who runs the state alongside his like-minded republicans?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean think about it. Trump and the GOP have virtually every aspect of the US government in their pocket right now: the Congress, the Judiciary, the WH, a majority of state and local governments. They own the ENTIRE franchise.
      </p>
      <p>
       They ARE, literally, the whole goddamn government from the bottom to the top.
      </p>
      <p>
       Solution: make up a series of ever-confusing bizarro realities where the strings are being controlled NOT by the people in charge, but by a convenient group of un-elected democrats like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and others who weild power from behind the scenes using some unknown source of leverage or political capital, despite not having any actual office or control. They are the ones to blame for all the chaos, mismanagement and disorder. Not the republicans! The republicans and Trump are doing all the
       <strong>
        good
       </strong>
       things. All the bad things are the democrats fault.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's such hilariously bad logic you'd think a 6 yr old child created it. Yet, there it is. And the republicans absolutely love it. They reproduce it. They engorge on it. It's absolutely amazing. Like watching a cult.

       Woah. Settle down. There are several reasons to think Q is real, and not LARP-ing, but there are enough things he/she has failed on to plant a seed of doubt. The q person also does a lot of copy/pasting from the internet. I think someone on the inside wouldn't need to rely SO MUCH on public info...

       This is not about whether Q is a larp or not, it is about the fact that accounts on this sub are railing

       As a general rule, any conspiracy related material that adopts the 'guys just you wait' narrative is bullshit. Nothing is 'just around the corner', it is obvious pandering to hopefulness in change of the status quo. It is textbook manipulation of the feelings we all have of being fed up with how things are. Campaigns like that are there to foster short term support for these sources and, more importantly, to encourage arguments between ourselves as to the legitimacy of such things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either information will be released, or it won't.  Events will transpire, or they won't. No amount of watching for the bus to come around the corner will make it appear any faster. We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard. It is OK to be interested in sources like qanon and David Wilcock, but their credibility must be rooted in actual disclosures or information releases, not the perpetual promise of such things.

       I think the storm is materializing... Trump made that statement with generals behind him - many took it to mean something domestic, but I happen to believe he was thinking geopolitically. Saudi's House of Cards like-shift towards MBS, American's re-upping of support for Zionism with Jerusalem, and the Project Cassandra story and covert-support for rightist elements in the recent Iran protests are pretty significant.
      </p>
      <p>
       Certain liberal elements of the Deep State might not like Trump and may seek to undermine his authority, but Trump gets along well with the neocons, it appears.

       My opinions are as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        Q is a real insider, the real deal
       </li>
       <li>
        But that doesn't mean he doesn't have an agenda, aka here to stir up a fanatic Trump following, or distract for any of the administrations' criticisms (for instance continued international war mongering).  Therefore it's hard to say what information might be altered for sake of Q's agenda.
       </li>
       <li>
        But regardless of whether Q has a very strong right-side agenda propagandist or not - if his team is here to take down the Deep State and Cabal then I'm all for it.  I'd say better these guys win than the DNC mafia.

       Might  not be talking about FISA reauth, but it does talk a whole lot about how Obama/DNC, after failing to get FISA approval to tap Trump's phones, approved the creation of a bs 'russian collusion' dossier to get the approval they'd failed to get initially.  If your personal scale says that what Obama did was fine, but what Trump did (and lets face it... what whoever else had been elected would have done) was evil... then i dunno if you should be anyone's go-to guy for impartial subreddit commentary.

        /r/CONSPIRACY

       is that people are shitting on literally the biggest conspiracy of our lifetimes.  WTF do people talk about in this subreddit?  Loch Ness Monster and Yeti?  Alien abduction? Reptilians and Flat Earth theory? If your minds are open enough to put faith in blurry sasquatch pics and obviously fake videos of Kim Kardashian shapeshifting from "human" to reptilian and back again, then it is mindboggling that you'd shit on a sub that is dedicated to someone whose tweets (and their content) have at times been in sync with the President of the United States'.  WTF is wrong with you ppl.

       There is still no proof of mass arrests. Not only that CBTS is conducting a pro Trump meme war. Why isn't it an anti Pedo meme war? Simple answer, it's a distraction from the real truth movement.

       the real truth?  what is that, exactly? 1) nobody said there have been mass arrests, despite people making it no secret that it's what they hope has/will happen.  2) It's not surprising that people would be pro-trump in a subreddit that discusses a happening that would definitely
       <strong>
        not be happening
       </strong>
       had he not been elected, and 3) i've seen plenty of pizzagate stuff thrown around on cbts, but had Q focused on elite pedophilia over documented political corruption as a way to start waking the masses, I imagine public response would have been far less predictable/chaotic and they made it clear that they didn't want to raze society to rubble in their process of waking ppl up and bringing about meaningful changes.

       well from what i can tell, the topics being discussed in here are very much in line with what your guy Mark Passio spends 9+ hrs discussing in his "What on Earth is Happening" video, with the addition of hope that something's being done about at least some of it. If the CBTS is 'headcanon', but Mark Passio is enlightened and somehow superior, then i think you may need to rewatch Mark or re-read CBTS and maybe reevaluate.  Just because this Qvolution doesn't seek to press the reset button on civilization and eliminate all the evils of modern society by razing it all to rubble, it doesn't mean that it's not a step in a better direction for the millions of people suddenly realizing that the world's a huge lie.

       Where your CBTS loses credibility is the religious fanaticism, the Trump Fan-boy behavior, and the irrational nationalism. "God Bless the military and our Savior Donald Trump, Patriots" is typical of the idiocy you encounter among the CBTS community.

       But the supposed abuses had been going on for like a decade... Nunes has been on about ‘unmasking’ for like a year.  Trump claimed trump tower was wiretapped a year ago.  I think they perceived their enemies a while ago and both sides have been working on taking the other out.  I don’t think that’s a stretch to say, only connecting it with the phrase calm before the storm is kind of dreamed up

       Both congressional parties agreed until the President torpedoed the deal. You keep saying this can’t be on Trump because it’s Congress’ fault. BIPARTISAN congressional leadership already struck a deal. Then, Trump killed it.
