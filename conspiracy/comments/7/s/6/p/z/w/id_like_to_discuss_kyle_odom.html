        <h3 class="title">I'd like to discuss Kyle Odom...</h3>
        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">29</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2018-01-22 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/KuneKo.html">KuneKo</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>For those who don&#39;t know, Kyle Odom is an ex-marine who spoke confidently about reptilian/martian beings walking among us and influencing this reality. There&#39;s a manifesto out there penned by Kyle that goes into great detail about extraterrestrials living below the Earth&#39;s surface whose technology is millions of years beyond our understanding. They&#39;re said to control the world as we know it. </p>

<p>I know this is a well known subject so i&#39;m not going to bombard you with the whole Kyle Odom saga so here&#39;s the talking points i think need to be discussed:</p>

<p>1) His credibility. I&#39;m team &quot;I WANT TO BELIEVE&quot; but why should we believe him? His conviction in his writing smells of some sort of authenticity but as rational thinking humans it deserves to be picked apart. </p>

<p>2) Has anyone else on this sub ever had any similar experiences through meditation? Under the stipulation that meditation as a conduit for contact with other beings is feasible. </p>

<p>3) The point that sent me down the rabbit hole...the pastor. I mean, if i were shot six times with the final blow being a point blank .45 to the face, I would assume I were not of this world. How in gods name (sans pun) could the pastor have survived that kind of lead assault? Maybe he was right...</p>

<p>Anyway, floors open. Gimme your thoughts. </p>

<p>Force me to choose and I would say Kyle Odom really had the experiences he had. They weren&#39;t just all in his head.  Impossible to know though. </p>
