        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>When I questioned the behavior of Israel I was labeled an &quot;antisemite&quot;.</p>

<p>When I questioned the policies and military interventionism of George W. Bush I was labeled as &quot;unpatriotic&quot; and a &quot;crazy leftist&quot;.</p>

<p>When I questioned the foreign policy/drone assassinations of Obama I was labeled an &quot;extreme right-winger&quot;.</p>

<p>And today, when I question the Russian collusion/bogeyman narrative I&#39;m labeled a pro-POTUS Russian &quot;agent.&quot;</p>

<p>I find it interesting that expressing doubt or concern over the &quot;official&quot; narrative and policies of TPTB/MSM gets one automatically pigeonholed and &quot;classified&quot; by those who parrot and embrace the status quo.</p>

<p>They are attempting to use these issues to turn us against each other, when we should really be setting our sights towards the top of the pyramid.</p>

<p>They&#39;ll continue to pull these labels out of their asses because honestly, at this point, it&#39;s all they have left.</p>

<p>Just remember that if you get attacked by these partisan hacks, then you know you&#39;re doing something right.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly the worst part is how the goalposts have shifted all the way across the field. First it was Trump asked Russia for help in the middle of a debate. Which makes total sense because if your going to collude you totally do it on live TV there&#39;s 0 chance it was a joke...</p>

<p>Then it was &quot;Russia hacked the DNC and therefore election&quot; which again no evidence was released for but they would say, &quot;it&#39;s an investigation the evidence will come out&quot;, it never did... In fact the &quot;election hacking&quot; story about the states that Russia &quot;attempted to attack&quot; was quickly withdrawn after it was revealed to be Fake News... Along the infamous Russian hacking of the power grid...</p>

<p>Now the media has moved the goalposts completely away from the hacking and no one has talked about it it months. The goalposts have completely shifted now so it&#39;s about getting &quot;evidence&quot; of Trump even talking to Russia. Its sickening.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the agenda to make every issue partisan (divide &amp; conquer) and I see it a bunch.  If you don&#39;t write a disclaimer someone will turn the tables to make it as partisan as possible.  For instance, I made <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7n919y/happy_anniversary_its_been_6_years_since_obama/?utm_content=comments&amp;amp;utm_medium=user&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=frontpage">this post</a> on NYE, right before taking a week long break from reddit and enjoying a vacation with my family.  I was suprised when I got back at how someone could take a pretty straightforward statement like it being the anniversary of Obama signing the 2012 NDAA on NYE and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7n919y/happy_anniversary_its_been_6_years_since_obama/ds01xrj/?utm_content=permalink&amp;amp;utm_medium=front&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy">turn it into a partisan issue</a> for not bringing up every other time Heabious Corpus has been suspended.  Doesn&#39;t even address the fact we still love under that law or that Trump has that power, but only marginalized the entire thing by claiming this isn&#39;t anything new.  Blew my mind.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve gotta be fucking kidding me. Dude it&#39;s been like a week since you said you were going to grow up as a mod and stop all these political posts. But you just can&#39;t stop. You&#39;re the one turning people against each other. You&#39;re talking about &quot;us&quot; as if we all agree with you. And you&#39;re posting yet another &quot;nothing to see here&quot; post about Trump and Russia. Jesus Christ dude. If you want to be an active Trump cheerleader on here then you really shouldn&#39;t be a mod. Edit: and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m about to be banned because we can&#39;t diss the holy mods. So catch you guys later.</p>

<p>Completely agree.  Also, I&#39;m getting sick of these posts that claim to be &quot;against those that create a partisan divide!&quot;, but at the same time it&#39;s a thinly veiled defense for their own partisan view on a hot topic.  At one moment, this mod is saying to fight back against the partisan divide.. but then he&#39;s also saying, that he shouldn&#39;t be labelled for questioning the &quot;Russian collusion/bogeyman narrative&quot; - which is an obvious side of a partisan divide.  </p>

If I were to say &quot;if you don&#39;t believe it, you&#39;re a shill&quot;, that&#39;s fucking ridiculous because none of us know for certain.  The same works the other way, &quot;if you believe it, you&#39;re a shill&quot;, that&#39;s shutting down discussion, is partisan hackery, and can fuck off back to r/T_D, just like &quot;if you don&#39;t believe it, you&#39;re a shill&quot; can fuck off back to ... I dunno, the 45 subs that resist 45.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I used to love about this sub, it was people just throwing ideas out in to space and talking about it like none of it really mattered because while we might get 90% of the way there, that last 10% was impossible, for now, and years later when we had that missing 10%, holy shit that was interesting.  I would have loved to have been on here in 2007 witnesses whispers of a housing crisis (like I think we&#39;ll be hearing about later this year or early next, though no where near the scale of 2008).  Shit like that doesn&#39;t happen any more, or it gets buried under 500 dick measuring posts where everyone gets called a shill and it&#39;s a waste of fucking time.</p>

<p>tl:dr; I agree.</p>

<p>What’s not to buy? They already admitted they wanted to collude, admitted that they met with the Russians re: dropping Magnitsky sanctions, and have endlessly lied about the times they met with the Russians re: collusion.</p>

<p>What’s not to “buy”?</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been watching the national and local nightly news push Russiagate almost every night for over a year. Pushing back on a message so oft repeated is a monumental task. Posting opposition to Russiagate conspiracies should be a priority here, and it often is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Russia very likely may have engaged in all the activities of cultivating the current POTUS and influencing our democratic process as accused.  The point of my skepticism is rather that whatever Russia may have done and be responsible for, they are really a weaker power than the US by a very long margin so as not to a credible threat, and that the current Red Scaring is rather a distraction from the domestically driven corruption of our democracy through congressional and regulatory capture by special/corporate interests, etc.  The rejection of HRC (who only promised more of the same) was a popular rejection of this captured system.  The election of Trump is an mini-iconoclasm of sorts, in itself bad for America and humanity, but probably necessary to any potential radical reform of the DNC or US politics at large.  (Got to hit bottom before you can get better, and so on...)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Exactly the worst part is how the goalposts have shifted all the way across the field. First it was Trump asked Russia for help in the middle of a debate. Which makes total sense because if your going to collude you totally do it on live TV there&#39;s 0 chance it was a joke...</p>

<p>Then it was &quot;Russia hacked the DNC and therefore election&quot; which again no evidence was released for but they would say, &quot;it&#39;s an investigation the evidence will come out&quot;, it never did... In fact the &quot;election hacking&quot; story about the states that Russia &quot;attempted to attack&quot; was quickly withdrawn after it was revealed to be Fake News... Along the infamous Russian hacking of the power grid...</p>

<p>Now the media has moved the goalposts completely away from the hacking and no one has talked about it it months. The goalposts have completely shifted now so it&#39;s about getting &quot;evidence&quot; of Trump even talking to Russia. Its sickening.</p>
