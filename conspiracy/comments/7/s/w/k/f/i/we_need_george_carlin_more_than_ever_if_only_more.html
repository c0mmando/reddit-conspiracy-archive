I think a lot of people who saw him just as a comedian are starting to hear things and say wait a minute, I heard Carlin talking about this 20 years ago.

Hos work standa the test of time so his legacy will be spread, shared, and better understood over time. </p>

<p>His work at the end, by the way, is great. There was a sense of urgency, a strong desire to point out how accepting we had been of getting our rights trampled on and thanking the government for taking them. We need more George Carlin types. </p>

<p>This is always quoted, but what does it mean? plenty of people had the same mentality and thoughts but just didn&#39;t have the audience he had. It&#39;s not as if his views of the world were his and his alone. </p>

<p>Not trying to bad mouth Carlin, just I think people who say &quot;Carlin was way before his time&quot; are talking nonsense and just rehashing what somebody else said before that seemed to attract attention. It&#39;s nonsense. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I found Carlin mainstream comedy was terrible.  This is the 70&#39;s, and there was a guy with a bag over his head (the Unknown Comic, I think), and other unimportant and dipshitty comedians.  Richard Pryor and Redd Foxx were also outstanding but at that age (not even a teenager yet) I really had nothing to identify with.  Carlin was like a blast of fresh air, especially after he cleaned up a bit and went from a sloppy always high comedian to the political satirist he became in the early 80&#39;s.  </p>

<p>While people were smashing watermelons to get on TV, and during the perior where Lenny Bruce was a covered up footnote in history that had no exposure, George Carlin led a lot of suburban white kids to question shit they took for granted.  He made a lot of people who believed everything was fine realize there was something very wrong, and he did it by bringing smart political satire to the mainstream.  </p>

<p>But it wasnt until I heard carlin put it into perspective that I understood how powerful a form of control it is.
It&#39;s literally how hitler and his backers eroded free speech in germany.

<p>There&#39;s a pretty big disconnect in what is meant by &#39;politically correct&#39; from one social-political bubble to the next. I think it&#39;s partly the result of a deliberate effort to divide the population, and partly just natural tribalism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s sorta in the name, the devil&#39;s advocate is the one always asking the uncomfortable questions, so of course it is offensive, but question is if offensive in this case is the same as &quot;not allowed to be talked or even thought about&quot;?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s stupid. Beyond &quot;right&quot;, i think it&#39;s <em>important</em> to debate pedophilia. I think being a pedophile is probably one of the worst if not <em>the</em> worst mental state you can develop/be born with. Personally, I fully believe that this is a mental state that develops in super early childhood and that is beyond control. It probably develops around the same time that sexual preference does. </p>

<p>I remember reading a post here (forever ago, I won&#39;t be able to find it) about a self-confessed pedophile on a throwaway. He talked about how he had been fighting his urges his entire life and nothing had worked. He hadn&#39;t touched a child yet, but he knew that eventually the urges would be too much and he would break. He decided to kill himself when the time came, so that he would never hurt a child.</p>

<p>Just imagine that? The pain and inner turmoil that would cause someone. Someone for whatever reason beyond his or her own control, developed incorrectly at an extremely early age. I truly believe these people need <em>help</em> in any way that we can help them, rather than social abandonment and prison sentences.</p>

<p>Now granted, once those impulses are acted upon and you touch a child sexually, all bets are off and you are going to prison. But I feel that there is probably a larger community of non-offending pedophiles out there who have nowhere to go for help and will choose drugs to self medicate and suicide eventually. I feel like it would be a lot easier to keep those people from ever offending in the first place if it were easier for them to come forward about their impulses that they never chose in the first place.</p>

<p>It just seems like common sense to me. I mean, who would willingly decide to be only or primarily attracted to little children? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly, a lot of trans people DO think this way. We hate the games that people are playing right now regarding gender and identity politics. We want to be left alone, accepted as we are, and not have people &#39;standing up&#39; and &#39;fighting for our rights&#39; and shit. We&#39;re just people who want to blend in like everyone else. The ones you hear about are the ridiculous teens on tumblr making a ruckus because they want attention. You don&#39;t hear from the people who share my views very often because, like I said, we just want to be left alone. Rest assured, majority of us aren&#39;t into all that shit.</p>

<p>honestly, having been out before trans-rights and the bathroom bills and all that shit was a thing, my life was way better before all that stuff. Now, everyone wants to talk about it, make sure i&#39;m okay, make sure they don&#39;t offend me, literally bringing attention to the thing i&#39;m trying to have you ignore every day. I don&#39;t want to be seen as a minority, as LGBT, or anything. I&#39;m just a woman. All this handholdy shit doesn&#39;t help anything at all. It&#39;s more damaging than anything.</p>

<p>I think trans people are interesting, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;re all in agreement that a person is a person and should be allowed to do whatever they want, as long as they don&#39;t infringe upon another&#39;s rights. That&#39;s the problem I personally have with gender pronouns. If you want to be called something weird, fine, if it means that much to you I&#39;ll do it. But if I forget or mess it up, you don&#39;t have the right to freak out on me about it or call me some kind of hate word because I forgot you prefer to be called whatever. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in total agreement with you. The constant effort to erode free speech and implement a fully PC society is eerie. And they all masquerade as good things. Like the women&#39;s march. Cool, I love women, do your thing. Except it&#39;s not just about female empowerment, it&#39;s also about hating men and all things male that could possibly infringe upon a woman&#39;s ability to feel safe, equal and in control.</p>

<p>As far as being PC and the difficulties of it..I know it all too well. I&#39;ve got a master&#39;s degree in childhood education. I&#39;ve taught elementary school for 4 years. The PC culture in these climates is stifling. Adult women cried at work when Hillary lost. Some called out sick the day after the election. A 6 year old boy was given detention for starting a hilarious &quot;Trump&quot; chant during lunch that whipped the entire cafeteria into a frenzy. </p>

<p>What bothers me about the PC culture is that it&#39;s inauthentic. These people are like the Christians who constantly attend church for appearances and then call people horrible things behind their backs. A lot of the most PC teachers that I&#39;ve interacted with have been the type to kick back at happy hour and talk shit about what pieces of trash their students are. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes. Good question. Wish I could tell you. I listed some experiences above. Usually, teachers and admin treat the students/parents like the enemy. I like kids and I like having fun, so I treat them like little people. Teachers get mad at me because I won&#39;t come to the faculty room to shit talk a group of 6 year-olds. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to be in the field much longer. I like teaching and I love my students, but the workplace environment is absolutely toxic and heavily political. Tons of backstabbing, no one is ever honest, etc. I just wanted to tell kids about the cool things in life and help them get good grades. I&#39;m not machiavellian enough for elementary school. Go figure.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I do not understand why the administration would be against you. Is it because you have the wrong genitals for elementary teaching? Or just because you actually tried to help the kids?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I honestly think there is some sexism involved. I&#39;m usually one of the only men on staff besides the gym teacher, and sometimes the only one. It&#39;s a big &quot;women&#39;s club.&quot; This is why I have kind of a different view of the current &quot;girl power&quot; climate in America. Nothing against women, they absolutely deserve 100% equal rights, but I think people who don&#39;t work in female dominated environments don&#39;t realize that women can be just as sexist, exclusive, cruel and shitty to work with. And the backstabbing and shit talk is <em>much worse</em> in my experience.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been told that I don&#39;t &quot;fit in with the school culture&quot; in the past. They never expanded upon that explanation but I assume it&#39;s because I typically put the kids first before my co-workers and nurture a cooperative relationship with them and their parents as opposed to an antagonistic one. I&#39;m sure it makes me sound bitter, but I honestly haven&#39;t done anything too out of the ordinary to explain it otherwise.</p>

<p>I think some of the older teachers also resent my popularity with the students. At my most recent school, there were two third grade classes--mine and my mentor teacher&#39;s. The kids in her class would frequently talk about (sometimes in front of her) how they wished they were in my class. This got back to the parents who voiced their concerns. </p>

<p>I could see how this would upset her..but it wasn&#39;t my fault. She was cruel and aggressive toward her students. What I thought was unnecessarily strict. For example: She only allowed them 5 minutes for snack time and would scream at them if they hadn&#39;t finished and cleaned up in time. I gave my kids 10 minutes and was lenient if they were still finishing an apple or something when the time was up. She had them sit in silence during snack time. I used my smartboard and computer to play educational age appropriate cartoons for them. Older, strict, set in their way teachers often resent my more relaxed and friendly approach to interacting with my students and their parents, and they would stretch the truth when complaining to administration, who usually had established relationships with them and were older and set in their ways. Shocking admin would take their side. The kids and parents lose out, but that&#39;s education for you. It isn&#39;t about the kids. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My experience has been somewhat similar with female supervisors. They did things that males would have been fired for, and got away with it. They would talk about sex and have sexual images in the room where they would have meetings and joke about it to the other women. Needless to say, if a man tried the same, they would be canned. </p>

<p>I think that there is something in the dynamic that women use to interact with each other, where they like to have a prima donna and talk shit about everybody who is not in the group. It leads to poor workplace leadership in my opinion. </p>

<p>The threat of the new generation against the old is very real everywhere, and has nothing to do with gender. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m in agreement. A few people on other forums around here have accused me of being sexist (unfairly, i felt). I have a lot of exes and I&#39;ve had my share of relationships that have ended badly, but that&#39;s what I feel is normal while growing up. Shit happens. I have healthy relationships with the women in my life. My mom, sister and my cousins are amazing people. My grandmother was one of the biggest influences on my entire life, God rest her soul. I find it really frustrating that in the current cultural climate, I have to defend every single potentially offensive comment against an onslaught of hate name calling. </p>

<p>That said, working with predominantly women <em>has</em> shifted my viewpoint on a certain subset of the gender. It was just an eye-opening experience. Now I know that women can be just as shitty as men when they dominate the workplace--in a different kind of way. There wasn&#39;t much of an issue with talking about sex (elementary school atmosphere), but a tonnnnnn of backstabbing and politicking. I didn&#39;t realize 30-60 year old women had so much interest in being so machiavellian. There&#39;s also a veneer of politically correct (fakeness) interaction that I just can&#39;t stand. There was so much formality in their interactions--asking about weekends and vacations and kids and husbands---and then trashing that person behind their back and under their breath. After a while I tended to just stay in my classroom for lunch rather than deal with the pit of despair and misery that was the faculty room. I think they found that offensive. </p>

<p>Honestly, it&#39;s the main reason I want out of the education field. I get super jealous of my friends who work in car sales and construction, who have good friends they can shoot the shit with at work. The only time I&#39;ve ever had that it was with the gym teacher or maybe one other regular teacher and it was more of the friendship I imagine a couple of gazelles would develop while being surrounded by a pride of lions. Like &quot;well, fuck..we may as well link up since we&#39;re alone in this.&quot; </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was never really accused of being a sexist per se, but I did get in trouble for saying that the lesson of a new female teacher &quot;sucked&quot;, which for me is just normal English language, but for the ladies, well, it sucked....</p>

<p>I have never been super-popular with the ladies, but I do not feel that I am so abnormal either. I really do feel that women do have a different manner of interaction than men do, especially in the work place, and I do feel that their way of organization/human relations is worse than men in some ways. I guess that when they are great they are great just like men, but when they are shitty, the backstabbing and the formation of cliches to get their way is just awful. </p>

<p>You can run into male assholes as well in any field I am quite sure, but there is something to be said for driving a truck alone across the state or country...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>not all of us whom reject existing religion are fools who leap to another ideology. It has social consequences for being an outlier and an extremist, but people such as this do exist.</p>

<p>I think <em>some</em> of religion is semi-true, but a great majority of it was compromised before people even had access to the materials at all. often time in ancient history, few could read and people were born into social classes -- priesthood was one of these things.</p>

<p>there were many times in history where great knowledge and culture were lost to the ages, some mysteries in construction of ancient monuments still have not been rediscovered.</p>

<p>I would argue some religious groups existed as a backup form of governance, preserving intelligence and information for themselves, helping to alter language and control the populace in more devolved and arduous times (dark ages)</p>

<p>it wasn&#39;t until the enlightenment they started lifting the hammer. and it wasn&#39;t until Martin Luther when the popes tried to clean it up on all the gang-bang orgies, lying about the bible and thieving from people on sin insurance, and assassinating people in church.</p>

<p>that&#39;s not to mention the anti-science, excommunications, etc.</p>

<p>a lot of sketchy things happened around the origins of the ancient church as well, including the murder of <em>specific groups</em> of Christians and also a governmental authority deciding what legally constituted the religion for both east and west.</p>

<p>we know what they say happen, but a little reading between the lines offers a view of possibly extreme corruption on their end, selecting and sanitizing information much like the modern government does -- however back then, being able to read or access the first hand documents anyways was extremely unlikely unless you were already in on the truth.</p>

<p>so no, I reject a lot of the stories in the bible. The true end times story could never be told, because it will express how the controllers of the world are banished and exiled, and the world seized back from them.</p>

<p>the whole point of subverting whatever underlying spiritual reality exists was simply because they believed by controlling people&#39;s hearts and minds, they could alter or stop this eventuality from occurring.</p>

<p>but it will occur, one way or the other, the truth is this world is merely in a fleeting state, and one day, it will end. It cannot stay this way, change is the only constant, and the longer this gets delayed, the more extreme the reaction is going to become.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the end he missed the big picture if he was indeed an atheist who promoted atheism. The global elite are luciferians and this is a spiritual war for our souls. The only protection is Jesus. Anyone who tells most of the truth but then promotes a big lie can either be mislead or intending to mislead. He could have been illuminati still -even if he told the truth about most of it. They try to address every demographic -even those who reject mainstream media’s narrative. Guys like joe Rogan and Carlin could be trying to capture the outsiders in a different net. It’s all the same endgame whether you push someone to atheism if new age religion or Buddhism. At the end of the day it’s still leading people away from the only protection from hell (accepting Jesus as Lord and savior, repenting fir sins and rebuilding evil spirits.) Decades of research as an agnostic led me to this conclusion. Rogan and Carlin both mocked Christianity. Only Christianity. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You’re regurgitating propaganda I used to regurgitate. Dig further. It’s not that simple. Even science hasnt ruled out the possibility of the supernatural. If you investigate this you’ll see that alien visitations, sleep paralysis, spiritual beings encountered tripping and the beings contacted by Aliester crowley and l Ron Hubbard (who was in a satanic cult) are all demonic in origin. All these pedo rings are created for devil worship rituals. Open your eyes. The luciferian symbolism is all over every show and movie and song in mainstream media. Most of not all the conspiracy theories are tied to this/born from this. </p>

<p>You’re premise that Christianity is a false religion is based on a deep trust in mainstream media. All your favorite celebs that you hear say the things that you repeat are under control of the elite. Mk ultra rules Hollywood. Don’t take things celebs say at face value. It’s all propaganda. Mass psychology is used throughout mainstream media and it doesn’t stop when public figures walk off set. </p>

<p>Don’t confuse Christianity with corrupt church leaders who hijacked the Christian identity to gain power. Jesus wasn’t begging for handouts. He pushed fir people to seek the truth and called out hypocrites. If you reject Christ while alive you don’t just get punished after death and end up in heaven eventually. You send eternity in hell. It’s not the joke that mainstream media brainwashed you to see it as from birth. You don’t realize how influenced you are by it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re creating a false conclusion here.</p>

<p>Yes, the Global Elite worship Lucifer, Moloch, etc. However, you&#39;re making a false assumption that any of those entities exists, and an equally false assumption that Jesus exists/can protect you.</p>

<p>The only thing that matters is that TPTB <em>believe</em> those entities to be real, and they act accordingly, attempting to create a timeline that is pleasing to their gods. It doesn&#39;t mean that any of the supernatural is real, or that belief in one supernatural entity will protect you from humans that believe in another. </p>

<p>But if praising Jesus makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, go for it. Just maybe keep in mind that it&#39;s going to be up to us to save ourselves from those who seek to do us harm. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ll cut and paste what I’ve shared before. It was taken in traffic and I had to brighten it to see more clearly but below I added different versions of the same photo from unedited to brightened and cropped to illustrated guides of what I see in the grainy photo:</p>

<p>Okey dokie. I cut and pasted my glitch in the matrix story below:</p>

<p>Do you see a  <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7i9qdkhq5zph04e/2015-05-08%2002.39.05.jpg?dl=0">face </a>  in the rear view of the brightened/cropped photo I took near an air force base and Masonic lodge? <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/56ey1s8pqmpuhl5/Photo%20Oct%2009%2C%209%2043%2038%20PM.jpg?dl=0">This is what I see </a> which looks like a reptilian which people think is an alien but I think is a demon. </p>

<p>I took the photo because the 666 monster decal (it’s a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/7yoexs7mjtx9bgu/IMG_20150411_212301.jpg?dl=0">Hebrew 666</a>) and later saw the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0jssa8d3287m1rc/IMG_20150203_171855021.jpg?dl=0">licence plate </a> was symbolic of 666 as well. (6+3+6+3=666 in numerology. 666 it is literally telling you to “make it evil”  by adding 666 to it like the monster logo does.) So the driver was likely luciferian. Luciferians channel demons so I might have been taking a photo of a person who shape-shifted into the form of a demon momentarily or possibly the camera captured what the naked eye can’t. So this is why I would consider it a demon rather than a monster. Because it looks exactly like the depiction of a reptilian. You can even see the<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/qpct05nww5m1vc6/IMG_20150630_193511.jpg?dl=0"> back of its head.</a>. Here’s a <a href="http://i1.wp.com/www.antifeministtech.info/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/reptoid.jpg">model of a reptilian. </a> that show up on google. That’s what I see in that rear view and the same headshape. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vu4iba2mgjmt5s0/2016-04-12%2023.42.29.png?dl=0"> Here’s an illustration of a reptilian. </a></p>

<p>After posting my pic to mufon.com (or .org) I was in three near car accidents even though I’d never been in one in my 20 years of driving. One was a puppy appearing in a bridge at night on New Year’s Eve right in front of my car, then a woman with a scarf around her head like she was from the Middle East drove in my lane in the wrong direction until I stopped (11 pm at night /no car behind me), and another where a car hid behind a truck not taking their right of way until right before I pulled out onto the highway. That last one happened an day an article about the demon photo was published online. </p>

<p>Another strange occurrence was around the same time my hard drive with the photo disappeared for a month then reappeared in a laptop bag I checked many times. A black cat was waiting outside my door in my hallway and hissed as it ran when I came home. It can’t come in without someone letting it in and no one owned it. Weird. Never saw it before or since. A cross turned upside down in my condo as my cat put a paw on the wall under it as I was looking at it. Two articles cane out about my reptilian photo and on the day of one being published was when I almost got into the third car accident and then I stopped driving. That day I got a grilled cheese sandwich at a drive through and a commenter on the article about my photo mentioned wanting a grilled cheese the same day. I’ve never bought one in public before but had I had one in years before that. The commentors avatar looked like my cat that had died a couple of months before the photo was taken. </p>

<p>All weird experiences and timing. Could be a coincidence I guess. But knowing what I know know about the global elite being luciferians who use witchcraft on the masses due to demon worship, it makes sense that their minions would make it a priority to stop the public from knowing that demons are either physically walking the earth or are making brief appearances when in a perfectly possessed person. It occurred just as I started to believe in God due to my research in the occult practices of world leaders. The Bible said that you get harassed by demons when you first turn to God. </p>

<p>I saw that face in my photo right after taking it and thought it looked like an alien. I blew it off for months but only revisited it after praying to Jesus for the truth as I tried to entertain the idea that there was a God after decades as an agnostic. I immediately got waves of shivers all over my body and soon after saw a gargoyle movie that led me to check that photo again and realize it was a demon and not just in my imagination. I looked like a reptile rather than a gray alien so that’s why I first dismissed it. I had not seen a reptilian since I watched the V tv series many years ago and that gargoyle movie jogged my memory. A few commenters on the article on my photo testified to having seen reptilians in cars as well. </p>

<p>Comments in the article about the demon photo I took by people who claim they saw a similar face in a driver of cars they were near:</p>

<p>I call it a mess because it is a mess. A badly fragmented, formatted, mess. The rambling personal experiences doesn&#39;t make it better. Nor does the &quot;I went onto some forums with my reptilian (the thing is a god damn reptoid from a segment on speculative evolution in a documentary) experience and had a grilled cheese&quot; in any way shape or form.

<p>Some people (those who have researched) tend to agree with me. There’s usually a few upvotes to cancel out a few downvotes. It’s not a theory I created. Millions believe this theory. So “everyone” is not wrong as far as I’m concerned.  You pulled that one out your ass. You pretended to correct your rude behavior and were just leading into another dishonest insult. </p>

My sons are growing up in a Carlin Cultured home and my mother gets credit for it often (although I think she would prefer that not be part of her future eulogy, but I’ll do it anyway). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Every news article about him on his last tours was &quot;he&#39;s bitter, not funny.&quot;  I remember him coming to Idaho and asking my dad about him and him basically responding with what the news shit said.  REALLY?  Maybe seven words was wicked funny at the time, but those last three specials are the best thing he ever did.</p>

<p>Get thee to a Doug Stanhope-ery!! He&#39;s alive and the best, except people shut down instantly because of the tranny hookers and the gay man rape of NFL players but he&#39;s ever bit as good as Carlin. </p>

<p>Hicks amazing as well for making sure he got his message out...only unfortunately that mans all of his specials have the same shit in them and if you read the book it like lists his dialogue from different nights and all still the same.  That shit about Jay Leno was awesome...would have been great to hear him on more topics.  And call more ladies cunts.</p>

<p>Really though, if you&#39;re not following Doug Stanhope right now, it&#39;s just as or more tragic than missing out on George Carlin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was thinking about Carlin the other day, after watching Dave Chappell&#39;s 2 latest Netflix specials - made me think of Carlin.   Thoughtful, profound/bold, intelligent and hilarious.  Especially the parts about why he left the industry and his thoughts on all the sexual harassment in Hollywood.  To me, it feels bigger/more important than just a comedy act, much like Carlin did.</p>

<p>I think in terms of stand up comedy, Chappelle has to be the greatest <em>living</em> comedian right now on Earth. </p>

<p>I&#39;m loving this comeback that he&#39;s doing, because he&#39;s doing it on his own terms.</p>

<p>By just going away the way that he did at the height of his fame, he created such a demand for his content that when he finally came back to the table, it was on his own terms. </p>

<p>Honestly Bird Revelation might be my favorite one out of all of his specials but to be fair I&#39;d have to go back and watch <em>Killin&#39; Them Softly</em> and <em>For What Its Worth</em> again. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you seen the 2009 comic strip thing on youtube?  That&#39;s my ultimate Chappelle thing:  4 hours of him hanging out..bumming smokes off the crowd for three hours then later pulling out his own and sharing &#39;em.  Keeps saying he&#39;s leaving.  Talking about conspiracy stuff...so great.  That&#39;s why I was scratching my head a bit when he was saying he voted for Hillary and shit...that seemed forced, but then yeah, the Bird Revelation seemed to be explaining a lot of things so I do love that too.  I love the first two comeback specials as well, just parts of Equanimity made me cringe for him.</p>

<p>He found that a comedy show has a patter and compares it to other comedy shows.  Next, are you telling me Saturday Night Live also makes use of comedy tropes?  What madness!</p>

<p>Oliver&#39;s show goes after targets like big agriculture, the military-industrial complex, prison-industrial complex, political corruption, and shady corporate practices.  But I guess suggesting that the audience are hypnotized mouth breathers makes it easier to avoid having to challenge the actual content of the show.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think those daily show shows are far more insidious because of the content and why people watch them. you have a large demographic who doesn&#39;t trust mainstream news or online news and get a large portion of their news and understand of the world through shows like this. The bias is the least of the issue. The problem is that they pose segments like they are critically thought about, and in fact that&#39;s the approach, to rip shreds on what someone said, the problem is that it&#39;s not done objectively, its enormously liberal and bias, but leaves viewers thinking &#39;oh i know what&#39;s going on&#39;. that&#39;s criminal. </p>

They watch Marlboro commercials or Chesterfield or something and they say &#39;Boy I&#39;m a man, I think for myself&#39;. But! Thinking for yourself does not make you an individual. No. No, sir. In order to be an individual you must not only think for yourself, you must plan for yourself. And you must plan ahead. And you must live up to these plans. You must know exactly what you want to do.&quot; -George Carlin, 1957</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think we need more discourse driven by comedians. Comedians boil down issues to simplistic forms and poke fun at them, while ignoring important context or counter-arguments - sounds like we do plenty of this already. I think most comedians agree that they shouldn&#39;t be taken very seriously when it comes to politics - they go for quick and easy commentary.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying comedians don&#39;t have a place in public discourse, but what we&#39;re sorely lacking is rational debate with the goal of finding truth regardless of ones personal opinions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People remember exactly where they were when certain moments occur.  Well I remember exactly where I was when I heard ole Georgie had passed.</p>

<p>I was returning to work from my lunch break, driving down a local road when the radio person broke the news.  I couldn&#39;t believe it because while I had heard his early stuff in the late 70s, early 80s, I hadn&#39;t really followed his comedy since.  But in the early 00s all that changed when he had some hysterical and insightful HBO specials.</p>

<p>I miss him quite a bit.  </p>

<p>However there are some other really insightful comedians out there.<br/>
Doug Stanhope - is one that comes to mind.  </p>

<p>Katt Williams is another - this dude is hysterical and fully woke on the whole conspiracy front.  His last stand up show was/is called Conspiracy Theory. It was launched in 2015 so I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the same one he&#39;s touring with now but don&#39;t miss this guy&#39;s show if possible.  </p>

<p>Joe Rogan is another comedian that&#39;s very insightful but he&#39;s kind of backed away from the harder line he used to take on conspiracies.  It kinda sounds like he&#39;s been &quot;talked to&quot; by TPTB so his comedy seems to have softened a bit.</p>

<p>and don&#39;t forget Dave Chappelle - always brilliant, hysterical and insightful and not afraid to discuss conspiracies.</p>

<p>Oh almost forgot Bill Burr - he&#39;s a self professed conspiracy theorist and super funny dude also.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>George was ahead of his time by eons. Those that listened and actually took his comic value out and really listened to his message learned from him. </p>

<p>Those that can see the social changes and identify it and call out all the bs while poking fun of it all.. are in my opinion the best. Carlin, &amp; Chappelle are in my opinion decades ahead of us. Listening to Chappelle talk on his last special about the book pimp and why it made him just leave.. man that was some super deep stuff. Chappelle in my eyes was saying I am tired of being the hoe, so I&#39;ll come back on my own terms when I want to and he isn&#39;t about to be used up by corporations just for another season. They both call things out whether its religion or transgender they are the unfiltered members of the media society needs to hear out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Men like Carlin would get think-pieced to death. Guys like Chappelle have put out specials questioning norms and are met with righteous anger and tepid approval. Tom segura just put out a special containing a bit about the word retarded and the way society treats this word, and now there&#39;s a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/netflix-take-it-down-netflix">petition</a> that over 60,000 ppl have signed to get his special taken down. I know comics can&#39;t just be offensive to be offensive and expect to get away with it, but even smart, hilarious people are being ridiculed for jokes in today&#39;s social climate. Carlin would be called a racist libertarian leftist homophobic racist by people on both sides of the political spectrum, just because the man spoke his hilarious truth. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>George was a funny guy but he didn&#39;t participate in the political process. Everything that is happening in the world today is our responsibility--each and every one of us, without exception.</p>

<p>Not everyone who is active in politics is Totally Enlightened, that&#39;s for sure, but all those who are truly Totally Enlightened are most definitely active in politics.</p>

<p>Politics is Life. It touches the full field of living. That includes art, philosophy, science, and spirituality.</p>

<p>From what we eat to what we drink, from what society deems acceptable behavior to what it considers a criminal offense, from who we interact with to how we interact with them, politics decides if we are free or if we live as slaves in bondage.</p>

<p>Politics determines what our children are taught in school, how we treat the ecosystem, what theories scientists investigate, how art is perceived, what version of history we recall, and how the future will remember us.</p>

<p>The dynastic plutocratic families, the corporate oligarchs, the international banksters, many of whom are zionists (like the neocons and members of AIPAC) and/or members of secret societies, who dominate the politicians and the legal system and the financial system and the mainstream media and the corporations and the police and the military, are wreaking havoc upon the People and upon our beloved Mother Earth.</p>

<p>They who are willfully ignorant and shamelessly apathetic about what they are doing in the world today are complicit in their crimes against humanity and Gaia Mother Earth.</p>

<p>They who are not giving their time, energy, talents and resources to the political process, to make sure that only the most Loving/most Wise individuals become our public servants, have blood on their hands and they can never ever dare speak of Love, Peace, Joy or Creativity.</p>

I will keep looking over the next few days and let you know if I find it. Carlin was mostly &quot;anti everyone&quot; but there was a brief time during the aftermath of 9-11 or the Iraq War that he bought into the American pride, anti islam sentiment, and said Bush was doing a pretty good job during one of his routines. I don&#39;t hold it against him, but it did happen.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While George Carlin and Bill Hicks were both great, they both failed to grasp all of the religious aspects of what is actually happening in the world. They truly have shut out the teachings of Jesus Christ and The Holy Bible in our world, and having these guys make jokes about them isn&#39;t helping. I used to laugh at jokes such as those, but now that I have truly realized the importance of Christianity, some of their anti-religious statements just seem very pretentious and ignorant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think those daily show shows are far more insidious because of the content and why people watch them. you have a large demographic who doesn&#39;t trust mainstream news or online news and get a large portion of their news and understand of the world through shows like this. The bias is the least of the issue. The problem is that they pose segments like they are critically thought about, and in fact that&#39;s the approach, to rip shreds on what someone said, the problem is that it&#39;s not done objectively, its enormously liberal and bias, but leaves viewers thinking &#39;oh i know what&#39;s going on&#39;. that&#39;s criminal. </p>
