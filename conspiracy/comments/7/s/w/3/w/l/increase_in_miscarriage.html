<p>I’ve also noticed this in women over 30 as well, but it seems that every person I know personally or as an acquaintance has suffered from miscarriage. </p>

<p>The younger you are, the less likely you are to have complications, but that doesn’t seem to matter anymore. </p>

<p>The conspiracy: the water, contaminated with all the pharmaceutical products, combined with low-nutrient food is starting to decrease the population by sterilization.</p>

<p>Edit: it’s not really sterilization if you can conceive. I guess it’s more being unable to carry to term. </p>

This  a pretty good paper explaining that education and early detection are key to increase in self reporting of miscarriages.  I don&#39;t necessarily think miscarriages themselves have increased just the self reporting. I was born in mexico to a very conservative family and just barely  a few years ago i found out my mom miscarried twice way before i was born.  No one knew. Things like that were just not talked about in that time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Part of that is women waiting until post-30 to have children. </p>

<p>And for real, every sexual partner you have unprotected sex with ladies causes DNA changes to your cervix. Every mofo you let skeet in your scooter stays with you for lyfe. </p>

<p>I&#39;m old enough to remember the AIDS epidemic and when birth control was something women over 18 got, not teen girls when they began puberty. STIs are on the rise and morphing because so many people are having unprotected sex. Hell, do a search on Tinder pregnancies. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Birth control.</p>

<p>Not surprising that taking something to prevent you from getting pregnant ends up preventing you from getting pregnant after going off it. It messes with women&#39;s natural cycles. I don&#39;t know why people think it&#39;s okay to not have their periods for extended periods of time and then think they can all of a sudden get pregnant as soon as they stop taking it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Having monthly periods is a very modern thing, though, because women used to spend a significant portion of their fertile years either pregnant or breastfeeding. That&#39;s why birth control helps reduce certain diseases like ovarian cancer; women are naturally meant to go for long periods of time without having menstrual cycles. You will have reduced fertility for at least a few months after stopping, but most couples understand and plan for this when trying to conceive.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think they always have happened. Now, people just share about it more. A girl I know was 6 weeks pregnant and lost the baby and shared about it on Facebook.  At 6 weeks, you have only known you were pregnant for 2 weeks.  No one knew she was pregnant so I&#39;m not sure why she publicly talked about it.  &quot;rainbow babies&quot; have also become a thing that people share about now, so you learn there was a previous miscarriage. </p>
