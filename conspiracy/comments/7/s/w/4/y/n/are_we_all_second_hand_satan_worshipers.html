       Unfortunately, we all give energy to the Saturnian control matrix, some more than others, but that is the problem we face.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money is the god of our civilization. In god we trust, no? But which god are we trusting? I don’t see any Christian symbols on our money, but I do see Saturnian symbols on our money.
      </p>
      <p>
       One cannot serve two masters. You can’t serve money and God. We are all second hand Satanists and we all are unwittingly giving our time and energy to the dark one.
      </p>
      <p>
       We love to point our fingers at the elite and blame them for all our troubles, but we never look within and realize just how much we contribute to the evil in our world.
      </p>
      <p>
       We all assume that we can have a revolution, arrest the evil elite and then the system would be finally be just and fair, but would it? Does it matter who is in control of a system that is inherently evil?
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe we need to have a spiritual revolution before we can have a successful political one. We must work on ourselves and find ways to thrive outside of the system that wishes to control our minds, bodies, and even our souls. Change comes from within and perhaps the system is just a reflection of our collective mind. Therefore we must change ourselves before we can expect to see any differences in the world we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many people are waking up to the evils of this system and are looking for a true hero and leader to fix things. I believe that is why Trump is so popular among his fan base. They are good people and they want change, but they don’t see why there is a problem in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR: Be the change you want to see in this world!

       It doesn’t matter what you believe. The elite are full blown Saturn worshiping devils and you use their money and live in their system. You give energy to their gods whether you believe or not.
      </p>
      <p>
       America is no different than the pagan Roman or Babylonian system. The only difference is we are not aware of the gods we give energy to unlike the ancient pagans.

       Which i do agree with you on but i just don't believe in the  "spiritual " sense of it. We csn and should better ourselves and love one another for sure. For me personally that is not spiritual but human to want love and peace.

       It’s technically the same thing. The Luciferian motto is, “Do what thy wilt, is the whole of the law”

       All of western civilization is built upon pride, ego, and self service. It’s every man for themselves and a rat race where dog eats dog.

       Light dispels dark. If a person finds themselves in the light, it's because the light came to them. People in darkness love the dark, it is only when the darkness is pierced by the light that our true condition is made known, and it is never the persons own effort that got them there.

       Jesus Christ is weird? He was the ultimate conspiracy theorist. He took on the man like nobody ever in the history of mankind. He called out the bullshit and died for his beliefs.
      </p>
      <p>
       He should be a role model for this community. Just because the church did awful things in his name doesn’t mean the teachings of the man himself are wrong. He truly had it figured out and was trying to red pill the world with a message of love, peace, forgiveness and redemption.

       As a matter of truth, His words are all I read when I have chosen to read the Bible. The rest is a piss poor condensing of some histories from multiple sources that contradict one another. You don't need a citation for that. It's in the book.

       If you have read the entire KJV scriptures you will see how they are all interconnected.  Anytime you see "Thus saith the Lord GOD" or anything like that it is also Jesus talking.  He was a boss because he was God manifest in the flesh who died for all of our sins.

       Repent and believe this and you will be saved and be able to understand all the scriptures:

1Co 15:2  By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain. 
1Co 15:3  For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; 
1Co 15:4  And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:

       No, he wasn't trying to "red pill" anyone. The red and blue pill are nothing more than dualistic gnostic freemasonry. What he was doing was bringing the actual truth to people so I'd like to believe.

       I agree, and I am not promoting religion. I am promoting the Gospel of Christ that was hijacked by the Church for political purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Christ taught that the body is the temple of God and that nature was the true house of God. I find the teachings of Christ to be an excellent guideline for morality. There really is nothing deceptive about Christ’s teachings. It’s good advice no matter what you believe in.

       Christianity is about the teachings of Christ, but I will say that shrooms provide a window into what Jesus was preaching. They are sacred and given to us by God, but man created the mushroom cults way before Jesus came along.

       Why argue over the this? The important thing is the teachings of Christ. It’s about loving and forgiving one another. That’s what we need to heal the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       The older religions had positive teachings but in many cases they also called for human sacrifice. I believe God sent his only Son to be sacrificed so that humans no longer felt they had to sacrifice others to please God.

       Evangelicals are the most deceived of any Christian group. It’s insane the mental gymnastics they use to defend their positions on Trump and Zionism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump is not a Christian. He lives on the 66th floor on the 666ft trump tower, in a modern day shrine to Apollo. Trump tower is full of the black cube of Saturn and he even has the black cube clock outside of the tower with 666 encoded right on it. He supports the synagogue of Satan in Israel and he is the opposite of a good Christian leader.
      </p>
      <p>
       I try to reach out to these folks, but they think I am evil for talking bad about their god emperor. Trump and the Zionists have their followers under a dark spell and then reinforce the magic with top of the line data analytics to maximize their message. It’s some powerful stuff and it has become a serious cult of personality. They are in a deep trance. Very alarming.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am not your typical Christian. Don’t lump me in with those that fall for the political trap.

       One of the main goals of the TPTB is to destroy christianity in its entirety. Erase it completely from this world. They believe christianity had its chance for the past 2000 years, and it failed. It's now time for us all to accept their religion...

       If there's anything these christian goys inherited from their pseudo-jewish religion, it's the eternal victimhood complex.
      </p>
      <p>
       These same people who gave "jews" their religion gave you yours.  And they'll give another one to the next generation.  So far, Sciencism looks like it's poised to be the successor.  They think they're free thinking, but they follow priests in white lab-robes the same as all the others.  How else will they understand the will of Science, unless their priesthood dictates it to them?

       Odd isn’t it. Jesus Christ is the most mocked religious figure of all time and many elite academics don’t even acknowledge his existence. The elite worship Satan and they have much more knowledge than us, so perhaps getting to know Jesus is not really falling for the religious psy op, but rather resisting against it.

       Crazy times drive people to religion. I've begun following Jesus in the past two months. As a counter to the evil. I'm not Christian but I think living like Jesus would do the world good. Most Christians don't even live like him.

       I am new to this my friend, but I am glad you are looking out for me and are concerned about my behavior on a anon message board. Like I said I am no saint and I, like many, do a little venting and use hyperbole around here. Some of my posts are 100% satire, but I’m sure you know my intentions from studying my post history:)

       Even in my days of drug and alcohol abuse I don’t ever remember being “full of hate” against all kinds of groups and people. I am not a fan of the Zionists, but honestly who is?

       Humans have operated on a belief in invisible pink unicorn for since the evolution of the neocortex and is hardwired into the brain? There's been evidence of a belief in a pink unicorn for at least 100,000 years?

       It doesn't say anywhere that factors like environment, social structure, and culture has no effect. If you were raised outside of modern western culture and the relatively new phenomenon of atheism wasn't mainstream, then those genetic factors would have likely played out.

       I had this thought a few weeks ago. We need a medium of exchange, but don't need abuses of money (predatory interest, manipulated stock markets, illegal federal reserve system, etc.  A world without money is just too radical a change (it would take a few generations IMO).

       I agree that we need to have personal revolutions, but I'll expand on it, especially for me- we need to have growth asking four domains.
First we need to have growth as the rulers of our lives. Developing our skills as effective managers who have systems to bring order around the things we do, like how to create and manage money or how to run our households.
       <br/>
       Second, yes, we need a strong spiritual life. A personal philosophy that helps us cope with the hard times, see through the bs, and grow as pillars of strength in our families and communities.
       <br/>
       Third, we need to have a strong physical life. That means knowing how to exercise,  having some self defense training, and understanding some basic information on how the human body works.
       <br/>
       Fourth, we need a creative and social outlet. Both a strong community around us that we can grow through our lives and a way to be creative in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The problem with western culture, as I  see it, is that our school system is stuck teaching our kids how kids needed to be taught during the first industrial revolution, we'll over 100 years ago. It's so outdated a system that it's producing kids who are completely mistrained and at a severe disadvantage with the reality of today.

So much evil gets done on our dime, and even if you don’t think is satanic, it’s still fucked up and must stop.

       So you want us to throwdown money?
You realise that the whole system is built around money and we have to participate in order to survive the modern world?
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree with you that we should not worship money. Money should not be an objective, like it is now for most companies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Money should be used as a tool. A tool to achieve something. In my opinion is should be used in a way that humanity evolves.
      </p>
      <p>
       My religious view of the world is that we are here to learn from a dualistic world. In this 3D world evil is needed in order to get the experience. Thus, in my opinion, there will always be evil in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the Bible is a great book, which teaches us valuable lessons &amp; guidelines. So do many other religious texts. Why wouldnt there be truth in all of those texts? In my opinion we shouldnt be fighting over which religion is the best.

       Seeing as how Satan and worship are extremely subjective terms with hundreds of separate meanings and uses, it's safe to say we are all worshipping (buying) [eating] Satan (capitalism) [cheeseburgers] somehow.

       That's fine, but you can have morality without religion. I'd argue religion is the biggest psyop in this planet's history.

       As a matter of truth, His words are all I read when I have chosen to read the Bible. The rest is a piss poor condensing of some histories from multiple sources that contradict one another. You don't need a citation for that. It's in the book.

       So you have no proof then. Neither do I, and that's why I'm an atheist. Gods exist only in peoples imaginations, they're not real.
