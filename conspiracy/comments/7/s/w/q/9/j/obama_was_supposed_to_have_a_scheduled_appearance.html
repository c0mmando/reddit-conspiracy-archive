       SS: Q posted yesterday that Obama retained legal counsel. He was supposed to show up
       <a href="http://emanuelstreickernyc.org/events/an-evening-with-president-barack-obama/">
        here
       </a>
       for an appearance last night.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you google "obama jewish temple 1/24/2018", the first hit will show the proof that he WAS scheduled. But if you click on the website, nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now if you go on facebook and search for Streicker Center, you can see many people posting about it but i can't find a single comment from anyone after the appearance. No pictures, nothing.  I'd link you but apparently that's also not allowed here anymore for some reason.

       I searched on FB and could only find one person who snapped a pic from the event but that's it. Really odd there isn't more than 1 photo on FB but I'll have to dig on Twatter and IG some more...

       Can you verify it was taken last night?  Seems odd only 1 pic would be out there....especially since he's been posting pics to IG and stuff that are months/years old anyway.

       They think everyone they hate (Obama, Clintons, Soros, Trudeau, etc.) is secretly being held at Guantanamo Bay, on a plate to Guantanamo Bay, or being arrested tomorrow to be sent to Guantanamo Bay.
      </p>
      <p>
       They've thought this for months, now. It's always happening TOMORROW! But it never happens.

       It answers nothing. You told him to "do more digging" which leads me to believe you have no concrete answer. People who do have concrete answers don't deflect and avoid questions by telling others to "do more digging". Imagine if a teacher or doctor did that when you asked them a question. Would that satisfy your question?

       So rather than have a doctor explain your illness/treatment plan, you’d rather look it up yourself. Or have a teacher during a lecture just say, look into it yourself rather than explain the lecture and references.

       The president can unilaterally declassify it tomorrow if he wants. Nunes' republicans have a majority on the committee and a majority in the Senate. A Senator like Ron Johnson can read it on the Senate floor, a la the Pentagon Papers.

       Trump could unilaterally order it released tomorrow. He can do that. He's the president. The fact that he hasn't leads me to believe that even the GOP knows it's horseshit - effective as a tool they can use to drum up outrage, but easily debunked when released.

       That's an interesting conclusion. That would be very disappointing! However we do know it's legitimate from many who have read it and spoken out about it.

       It's not silly or promotional. It's news suppressed by most networks that needs to be shared another way.

       Sure I do. It's Devin Nunes' SOP to a T:
      </p>
      <p>
       1) Invent crisis based on cherrypicked or distorted facts.
       <br/>
       2) Spread crisis through Trump's lapdogs in Congress and his Pravda, Fox News. Really hype it up. Make it look like groundbreaking stuff.
       <br/>
       3) The facts come out and oops, this was way overhyped and the people involved barely did anything wrong, if at all.
       <br/>
       4) People only remember the first part where it was this huge thing, not it being disproven.
       <br/>
       5) Rinse and repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, remember "unmasking" and the crisis over Susan Rice? And then it turned out that everything she did was completely properly done? Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's the same shit. Devin Nunes can release his fanfiction whenever he wants, and it's going to be cherrypicked, distorted nonsense that will soon be easily disproven, because that's what Nunes does.
