<p>January 3, 2018: East Olive Elementary School, St. Johns, MI
A 31-year-old man committed suicide by gun in the parking lot of East Olive Elementary School January 3 after hours of negotiations with local police, according to The Lansing State Journal. The school was been closed since June, so no children or staff were at the school, and no one else was hurt in the shooting.</p>

<p>Jan. 6: School bus in Forest City, Iowa</p>

<p>A 32-year-old man fired a pellet gun at a school bus, shattering one of the windows. No students were injured.</p>

<p>Pretty sure when someone hears &quot;SCHOOL SHOOTING&quot; they are thinking of a deranged gunman shooting multiple students. To group the above 2 events into the same category is a little misleading IMO</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No I feel ya, sometimes a simple question gets misconstrued as an attack around here. </p>

<p>It would indeed cause the false flag agenda to be raised more, but in my opinion, its raised far too much as is. The major point in not giving the shooter credit or a name is thats the entire point of what &quot;most&quot; are doing. They want the limelight and for the story to be told. Even if their the villain. </p>

<p>Indeed it is.  Sometimes I think it&#39;s not totally unwarranted though.</p>

<p>If news agencies were to not release names, I would be ok with it so long as that information could be found in a reasonably easy manner, say a police report database or such.  Those who would want such info would have to actively seek it out. Would you be opposed to something like that?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not attacking guns or your priviledge to carry them. I&#39;m attacking the basis of what the shooter wants. They want to be known, to have a story, to be significant even if its in a bad way. Removi g the person from the tragedy takes away that gratification. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>lighten up there Francis. </p>

<p>when you blame something, you say that IT caused the act. the GUN didn&#39;t do this act. a deranged criminal did. don&#39;t lessen his crime by saying an inanimate object committed it.</p>

<p>the ONLY reason you would put the blame on the gun (or knife, or spoon, or what the fuck ever) would be to call for restrictions on that item. you don&#39;t agree? give me another reason why you&#39;d blame the gun for it?</p>

<p>we&#39;re sensitive about it because we hear calls for more restrictions and more bans all the fucking time from people who are in the middle of an emotional knee jerk and don&#39;t know anything about the actual law that exists, and how their emotional overreactions (like you just did) will not do anything at all to solve the problem. </p>

<p>Who&#39;s ignoring it?  As I understand it there is a full on investigation, the 15 yr old gunman is being held and they are deciding whether to charge him as an adult.</p>

<p>IOW, the proper authorities are handling it, and since we aren&#39;t talking about a cop or politician being charged, justice will likely be meted out.</p>

<p>I have to wonder if this is a two-fer for conservatives. I mean, the public stops demanding that we get gun control because of the outrage fatigue (so the NRA wins),  and schools get shot up so much that people stop sending their kids to schools (so public schools receive less funding and die off so more money can be sent to private schools).</p>

<p>Bailey Holt wasn&#39;t in a gang. </p>

<p>Shootings like these may be statistically rare... <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-mass-shootings-20171120-story.html">but they&#39;re becoming more and more common.</a> And yet every time we see one of these, we get the usual suspects arguing over <em>semantics</em> and whether &quot;this one&quot; actually counts.

<p>See above. 26 children being murdered was not enough to get people to support gun control. The largest mass shooting in history was not enough to get people to support gun control.</p>

<p>In short, it doesn&#39;t matter how many people you shoot, or how many children you murder, Americans want to keep their guns, and they refuse to believe that guns lead to gun deaths.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>How many are killed is exactly the point. It&#39;s not anywhere near enough to justify sacrificing one of our foundational rights and most Americans don&#39;t fall for this fear mongering when the numbers are widely available.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at those numbers:</p>

<p>There are around 13k shot and killed each year in the US, most of which are directly related to other crime such as gangs or drugs. </p>

<p>There are around 320m people in the US and an estimated 300m+ legally owned guns. </p>

<p>That comes up to a death percentage of around 0.004% each year. Not very frightening or impressive, is it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Americans want to keep their guns, and they refuse to believe that guns lead to gun deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a bit of a dishonest statement, but I&#39;m sure that was intentional on your part. </p>

<p>Most people are smart enough to recognize there is more to the equation than just guns. </p>

<p>The simplest way to show this is by pointing out the steady <em>decline</em> in gun violence over the last few decades. A decline accompanied by a steady <em>increase</em> in gun ownership.</p>

<p>If it was simple as &quot;guns lead to gun deaths&quot; wouldn&#39;t you expect to see continually increasing gun violence? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What the media calls mass shootings includes gang shootings and cop shootouts, which aren&#39;t even remotely similar to mass shootings. If you count those with other countries, the numbers reveal clearly that the higher US shootings are due to the media turning them into Gods and not the availability of guns. It becomes even more clear when you take into account the places where the mass shootings that the availability of guns isn&#39;t the factor. More crimes involving guns happen in the places with the most gun laws. Most of what the media calls mass shootings are done with illegally obtained fully automatic guns in places with more gun laws.</p>

<p>I have to disagree strongly with this part. I do agree its not very helpful and should be avoided. But this is where we are at. This country elected a xenophobe who wants to build a ridiculous wall to protect us from people he has profiled. To me this is why it gets pointed out when these crimes are commited by white males.

<p>But the fact is, it is actually inaccurate to say that these crimes are committed by white males. If you look at the Mother Jones data on mass killings (<a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/">https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/</a>), which includes race, you can see a lot of the word &#39;white&#39; in there, but it&#39;s only around 55/95 to my count. Mother Jones isn&#39;t the greatest definition of &#39;mass killing&#39;, but it&#39;s a much better definition than most others I have seen.</p>

<p>If we&#39;re talking simply majority, sure, I will grant 55/95 is a simple definition of majority, but even in those simple terms, 55/95 is hardly justification to pretty much blame white males for mass killings. And if you&#39;re being honest, you have to take population dynamics into account.</p>

<p>All of this isn&#39;t to say we should be blaming some other race for mass killings. It&#39;s simply to raise the question of why it&#39;s OK to specifically blame one race for mass killings, even though the data doesn&#39;t support it, when it is generally considered bad form to use race to explain just about anything else.</p>

<p>I do not know what is really happening during all these shootings, wether people are dying or if it really a hoax. However I lean toward thinking that either way it is a manipulation being generated in some way by the satanic overlords called politicians. </p>

<p>Personally I have a theory about online social contact manipulation combined with psychotropic drug dosing in food and water. These shooters may be being controlled in some way through technology hidden in plain sight.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I was trying find a connection to the KY shooting and gang violence. 
I’ll admit I haven’t done much research on the 2018 school shootings, but from what I did catch in a news blurb last night about KY, it was one kid as the suspect. </p>

<p>Maybe I’m not expressing it properly. But if these shootings were false flag  events planned to push the agenda then the stories would be all over the news and in our face with the “we need better control”.<br/>
(Another user claimed these were FF events in another thread / comment) 
That’s what sparked my initial question and I’ve seen a few comments regarding gang violence and now I’m even more confused. I’m going back to work. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You act like this is something new, but it&#39;s not. A very quick search shows documented incidents of school shootings far back as the 1890s in the US (10 year old shot a classmate in the face) and an example from the 1500s in Scotland where a gang of 14 year olds took over the school with pistols and swords, killing an adult. </p>

<p>One of the worst attacks was in 1927 where a farmer used dynamite to blow up a school, killing 45 people. Of those 38 were children. </p>

<p>Extreme violence is old as humanity. It&#39;s significantly less common now than ever, just covered more widely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>2 dead and 18 wounded... that sounds like an actual mass shooting by a single individual. Kill rate should be around 5-25%, depending on many factors. If you see more dead than wounded, IT IS SUSPICIOUS.</p>

<p>18 actual wounded victims in Kentucky will be mostly pro-gun, so they can&#39;t have a spotlight shone on them.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>In short, it doesn&#39;t matter how many people you shoot, or how many children you murder</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How many are killed is exactly the point. It&#39;s not anywhere near enough to justify sacrificing one of our foundational rights and most Americans don&#39;t fall for this fear mongering when the numbers are widely available.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s look at those numbers:</p>

<p>There are around 13k shot and killed each year in the US, most of which are directly related to other crime such as gangs or drugs. </p>

<p>There are around 320m people in the US and an estimated 300m+ legally owned guns. </p>

<p>That comes up to a death percentage of around 0.004% each year. Not very frightening or impressive, is it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Americans want to keep their guns, and they refuse to believe that guns lead to gun deaths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a bit of a dishonest statement, but I&#39;m sure that was intentional on your part. </p>

<p>Most people are smart enough to recognize there is more to the equation than just guns. </p>

<p>The simplest way to show this is by pointing out the steady <em>decline</em> in gun violence over the last few decades. A decline accompanied by a steady <em>increase</em> in gun ownership.</p>

<p>If it was simple as &quot;guns lead to gun deaths&quot; wouldn&#39;t you expect to see continually increasing gun violence? </p>
