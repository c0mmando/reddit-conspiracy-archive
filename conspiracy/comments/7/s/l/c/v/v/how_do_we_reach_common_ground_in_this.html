        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>We are living in a hyper-partisan environment, where the answers are less important than the &quot;victory&quot; over a political rival. Politics have become weaponized.  </p>

<p>Instead of seeking out evidence, groups have looked towards anything that will substantiate their beliefs.  Groups are unwilling to listen, and they are unwilling to compromise.</p>

<p>How do we get past this? </p>

<p>Is there a way to present information in a way that is more palatable to opposing groups?  Is there a way to make people listen instead of reacting?  </p>

<p>IMO, these are crucial questions for our society. </p>

<p>What happens if one political party is right?  When one side yells, &quot;I WAS RIGHT, SUCK IT,&quot; how will that change anything?  Does it make you think that the opposing side will reach an &quot;Ah Ha&quot; moment, a moment where &quot;your rightness&quot; will clarify and change their beliefs&quot;?  </p>

<p>How will this solve their ingrained and deeply entrenched distrust of the opposing party?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay, I absolutely agree with you.  The concentration of narrative-givers is unquestionably against the interests of this country. </p>

<p>I thought you were stating it was &quot;tightly controlled&quot; because of regulation. </p>

<p>I do see a bright light in the explosion of &quot;people reporters&quot;/grass-root reporting, people/groups who entered the realm of journalism because they saw a lack of coverage.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a lot of these reporters are perpetrating the exact thing you criticize against, &quot;dividing and conquering&quot;.  They perpetuate the ideas of one side, while failing to report on the other side. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suspect that Washington&#39;s growth fuels partisanship.  The more power is concentrated, the more important it is to hold the reigns to that power.  If this is true, then the antidote to partisanship would be to reduce the stakes, so that people&#39;s lives are less impacted by changes in leadership.</p>

<p>Trump recently made a change allowing the states impose work requirements for welfare, <em>if they chose to do so</em>.  This move was controversial, but far less controversial than it would have been if Trump had imposed this change against every state, forcing them to adopt his changes without regard to their own opinions on the subject.</p>

<p>This approach could be applied to all sorts of domestic issues: medical care, social security, minimum wage, industry regulations, drug criminalization, &amp;c.  We are a big country with a huge population in varied terrain, and with diverse cultures and values.  </p>

<p>Why should coastal democrats be running Midwesterners lives?  Why should Texans control how the people of Hawaii live?  If the population of state A wants to adopt single-payer healthcare, then why not let them spend their tax money the way that they want?  If it works out, then other states can join in.  If it fails, then the citizens of the other states can pat themselves on the back for being more prudent.  </p>

<p>Either way, allowing the different states to control their share of domestic expenditures and policies would dramatically reduce national tensions and partisanship.  We would be far more sanguine about national elections if they didn&#39;t cause policy changes that we don&#39;t want.  </p>
