       We are living in a hyper-partisan environment, where the answers are less important than the "victory" over a political rival. Politics have become weaponized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Instead of seeking out evidence, groups have looked towards anything that will substantiate their beliefs.  Groups are unwilling to listen, and they are unwilling to compromise.
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we get past this?
      </p>
      <p>
       Is there a way to present information in a way that is more palatable to opposing groups?  Is there a way to make people listen instead of reacting?
      </p>
      <p>
       IMO, these are crucial questions for our society.
      </p>
      <p>
       What happens if one political party is right?  When one side yells, "I WAS RIGHT, SUCK IT," how will that change anything?  Does it make you think that the opposing side will reach an "Ah Ha" moment, a moment where "your rightness" will clarify and change their beliefs"?
      </p>
      <p>
       How will this solve their ingrained and deeply entrenched distrust of the opposing party?

       All of these questions are open for answers.  Sometimes I become pessimistic about them being solved.

       It is almost like a disease, where it becomes more impairing over time.  Sometimes I feel like we are running out of time.

       US media is tightly controlled.  You cannot have a true democracy under these conditions.  Partisanship is just part of their usual divide and conquer.

       Because only 6 Corporations control 90% of all US media. The Free Press doesn't exist in this country anymore. Instead, what we have is Corporate Propaganda, filled with talking heads who peddle lies with the jobs they are patronized with by their corporate masters.

       Okay, I absolutely agree with you.  The concentration of narrative-givers is unquestionably against the interests of this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       I thought you were stating it was "tightly controlled" because of regulation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I do see a bright light in the explosion of "people reporters"/grass-root reporting, people/groups who entered the realm of journalism because they saw a lack of coverage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Unfortunately, a lot of these reporters are perpetrating the exact thing you criticize against, "dividing and conquering".  They perpetuate the ideas of one side, while failing to report on the other side.

       As a progressive who has done political activism/organizing for most his adult life in red states, I don't understand why people think the environment
       <em>
        suddenly

       got hyper-partisan.  It's been this way basically since Bill Clinton.

       Also, there are just some issues that can't be compromised on.  Take immigration, there's not a simple "let's work together" middle-ground position between the progressive position and the Trumpist one.

       I don't know if weaponized is the word.  I think it is more we are just so used to watching sports/wrestling so we draw a line in the sand a pick a team. Then we support that team at all costs.  Maybe everything else has programmed us to view politics this way.

       I suspect that Washington's growth fuels partisanship.  The more power is concentrated, the more important it is to hold the reigns to that power.  If this is true, then the antidote to partisanship would be to reduce the stakes, so that people's lives are less impacted by changes in leadership.

       Why should coastal democrats be running Midwesterners lives?  Why should Texans control how the people of Hawaii live?  If the population of state A wants to adopt single-payer healthcare, then why not let them spend their tax money the way that they want?  If it works out, then other states can join in.  If it fails, then the citizens of the other states can pat themselves on the back for being more prudent.

      <p>
       Either way, allowing the different states to control their share of domestic expenditures and policies would dramatically reduce national tensions and partisanship.  We would be far more sanguine about national elections if they didn't cause policy changes that we don't want.

       They are all chess pieces. Is there two people playing though? Remember when Mel Gibson said "do you have a dog in this fight?" to that news reporter? Do you think his side has political sway anymore?

       Dude they are just stupid people. The only way you can help a stupid person is to show them. But you can't show them the truth if they are stupid and Brain washed. The best way to approach this would have been in primary school. Just teach real history.
