       This is a question I come up against often when I'm discussing the Oct 1st shooting, and my own doubts about the official story.
      </p>
      <p>
       Whoever I'm talking with, whether in person or online, they usually come up with some kind of variation of "Why are you, or anyone else not involved in the investigation, automatically entitled to evidence in a mass murder case?  Do you think you're some kind of investigator?  Can you think of reasons that this information needs to be shared with the public?"
      </p>
      <p>
       It should be a no-brainer, but if I'm honest, I've never really had an articulate, succinct rebuttal for this line of thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hopefully,
       <a href="/r/conspiracy">
        /r/conspiracy
       </a>
       can help here.  Whether it's Sandy Hook, or 9/11, or Vegas, why should footage of the event be released to the general public?

       K. Remove morbid from my statement if that is offensive and assumptive. There is no real need to satisfy your curiosity at this time. Better?

       p.s. It's funny you used the term gaslighting because I'm wearing a gasllight anthem t-shirt right now. Coincidence or connection?!?1

       Investigations aren't public...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not sure what the protocol is when the suspect is dead, but normally evidence doesn't come out until during or after the trial.
      </p>
      <p>
       Obviously this is by design... You can't have a fair trial if every potential juror in your state/country has seen the investigation evidence on TV or the Internet with people adding their own commentary and speculations.

       The public has the right to know. Yes, this right must be balanced against the government's legitimate interest in mounting an investigation that brings culpable individuals to justice. But the idea that the government's interests in prosecuting a dead man outweigh the public's right to know the facts about the largest mass shooting in United States history is ludicrous. Anyone who would defend this would always defend totalitarianism.

       I would make the argument if the government is going to provide a narrative, often times within a day or two of these tragic events they are responsible for meeting a certain burden of proof for their citizens.  It should not be enough to say this is how it happened because that is what we are telling you.

       If that's what you want to tell yourself okay, but if the government wont show you one of the hundreds of surveillance cameras that apparently show a a plane hitting the pentagon, why do you think they are going to present any evidence in this case?

       A mass shooting that involved hundreds of people in a public place is a matter of public interest, especially in the city where it occurred.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's tons of precedent for a larger swath of information coming out well before it was "case closed", so to speak, to the point where we could say that Las Vegas is the exception, not the rule, even if the particulars of any one case when compared to Vegas varies.
      </p>
      <p>
       Given that the official theory is that Paddock acted alone, and he's dead, there's no reason to be so secretive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, using their own words from earlier this month, they consider the investigation to be at the "pre-indictment" stage, which suggests that there is someone alive who may be indicted, as it's not legally possible to indict and try deceased person.
      </p>
      <p>
       From:

      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        The response also states that ongoing privacy is necessary “during the pre-indictment stage of an investigation,” without saying if an indictment is pending.

       Includes full legal response to lawsuit launched by media against LVMPD re: level of secrecy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course, using the "pre-indictment" term only raises more questions, as do some of the items that HAVE been released recently. I'd humbly suggest that the unsealed documents may in fact be a backstopping tactic, but that might suggest I don't believe the crazy lone gunman theory.

       Unfortunately we are speaking of a private company that is in the midst of multiple law suits so expecting footage right now is truely magical thinking. It would be litigating suicide at this point for the legal team of the hotel and I highly doubt that these firms are getting paid the big bucks to make a move like this.

       If the man is dead (sole shooter - as claimed), then why not? If they say, it's an on going investigation, say: "Why did they release the video/photos of the Tsarnaev brothers to the public, while an active man hunt/investigation was in progress?". If they say: "Well, they were looking for the public's help in finding them/who they were". Then say: "The older brother was already in prior contact with the FBI, and they knew  exactly who he was".

       With the Boston Bombers, sure, they knew
       <em>
        who
       </em>
       they were, but that doesn't help the FBI find them or stop them from doing something else... So they give the public photos hoping someone sees them and calls it in.

      <p>
       In the case of las Vegas... The guy is dead, yeah, but if there's more to the story and they're investigating - and if others are involved - it's better to keep it secret.

       It's impossible to have a fair trial when all potential jurors have seen evidence alongside shitty commentary on TV or online. If the evidence is out there before trial, jurors will be biased, and it could hurt the prosecution.

       there is not a drop of blood on the fenders or bumpers or anyfuckingwhere on a vehicle that allegedly hit over 500 people, 86 dead and something like 450 injured.

       Now examine any photo of the truck alleged to have made the Nice attack. A VEHICLE THAT ALLEGEDLY STRUCK OVER 500 PEOPLE !

       I don't know what a truck that size should look like after it struck a bunch of people to say you are right or wrong. It just seems strange that they are able to get all of these random people to play along with these fake attacks.

       But do you really believe that police should be forced to release all the information about ongoing criminal investigations?  It makes complete sense to me that they don't release that information - if only to try to prevent witnesses from having their stories contaminated by reading an "official" story in the paper.

       Not sure what you want. A sign listing potential dangers when you enter the city limits? Pickpocket, bad drugs, robbery, murder, a snek in yr boot! I feel most places do a good job of trying to remind people to be aware or their surroundings and report suspicious activity.

      </p>
      <p>
       When people go to stay at a casino, it is reasonable for them to be assured that the bozo in the next room does not have an arsenal.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public has a right to know how the arsenal was brought up to the room undetected, especially since casinos have state of the art security.
      </p>
      <p>
       The public also has a right to know if any member of the U.S. Government was involved in the shooting or the coverup.
      </p>

       I am suremyou are familiar with the JFK assassination.

       Do you have a law degree? I agree that the public has the right to assume a certain level of safety when visiting an establishment. I'm also guessing that the hotel/casino will argue that they were unaware of the threat Paddock possessed. I'm guessing arguments regarding this will come up in court proceedings. I'm not sure what that has to do with the public's rights in viewing the collected evidence in an ongoing criminal investigation, though. Like I've said in previous comments, if you or anyone knows of laws that do guarantee the public's ability to view evidence in ongoing criminal investigations, please share. I'm not trying to argue this as I'm the end all know all of how things work.

       People reasonable expect a casino to have a security system in place to prevent someone from bringing an arsenal into their room and murdering 58 people with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       My position is that the casinos should be forced to shut down until they explain why their security system failed.

       Interesting. Could the casino make the argument that knowledge and protection of a mass shooter falls beyond the reasonable expectation of safety? I guess what I'm asking is if the casino could be like, that was a fucking crazy anomaly and you can't expect us to be prepared for every crazy anomaly.

       To answer your question, yes they could argue that-it was just an anomaly.  I am not sure what else they could argue.
      </p>
      <p>
       My position is that the CIA/FBI was involved in the shooting and coverup.  That is why they are not releasing any tapes.  Of course, this is speculation, but it is consistent with past events.

       No I don't think gun ownership is a crime.  You are the one that is worried about what is happening in someone else's hotel room.  There is no way any hotel can prevent something like this without making all windows bulletproof or something crazy like that.  Crazies gonna crazy, if you know what I mean.

       We're talking about Paddock right? You literally need to read only 1 or 2 articles to see that he "illegally" obtained a large amount of guns, that's illegal. Explsoives, illegal. I disagree with the official narriatve so I will stop there and let you do your own research. But the type of ammo found, amount of guns, etc... he broke quite a few laws if you are to bleieve the story.

       No, this article claiming only some of them were bought legally that they can see, some of the legal guns he purchased from bass pro have not been located anywhere, some of these guns "may" have been purchased at gun shows... so no.

       Well, you see, hotels really won't look twice if you bring this box called a suitcase with you, even if you bring 5,6, even 10.  Lots of their employees will even help you carry these boxes to your room if you are willing to tip them.  So if you put the bang-bang stick in the box, the hotel doesn't know what exactly it is.  Unless you want them to X-ray everyone's luggage in and out of the hotel.  That sounds fun.

       The general public always has the right to know whatever its government knows. Yes, there can sometimes be competing interests that trump this right in certain exceptional cases such as any situation in which there is a high probability that public safety would be severely compromised by the dissemination of certain information.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the general public still always has the right to know whatever its government knows in general. That is the rule, not the exception. What the hell is so controversial about this basic pillar of democracy? The Founding Fathers found such truths to be self-evident. Why don't we?

       Go down to the local police station and tell them that is the reason they have to give you open access to their ongoing criminal investigations. i'm sure they will be happy to let you see whatever you want. Probably check to see if they can get you a coffee and a doughnut, too.

       I'm not here to argue your self perceived noble ideals. I'm talking strictly about the legality as it currently stands of the public's right to view documents in an ongoing criminal investigation. It appears a tv station in Vegas has petitioned the court to access to the vegas police department's investigation file.

       In your totalitarian opinion, can the public's right to know, a right that our Founding Fathers felt was self-evident and one of the basic pillars of a functioning democracy, ever legally trump the government's "right to withhold" information that the public has a legitimate interest in knowing?
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine that you are the lawyer tasked with arguing the public interest is better served by withholding everything the government has found out about the most deadly mass shooting in United States history in this specific case. Because that's what this legal argument comes down to in the end: the public interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       The default is that the public has the right to know whatever its government knows unless this can compromise another important public interest. So what is your legal argument? What more important public interest is served by withholding information in this specific case considering that according to the very government whose secrecy you are defending, there is no living criminal to mount a case against?

       The majority for citizens do not have to actively demand information for those citizens who want to know information to have the right to know whatever their government knows. The public has the right to know whatever the government knows unless the government can successfully argue that it is withholding this information in the public's interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       How is public interest being served by withholding this information from the public? The public has the right to know unless you can explain why keeping this information secret is in the interests of the public. So tell us why. Why? What is your rationale for keeping the details of this specific investigation secret?

       There is a God damned on going investigation. Go ahead and drop by your local pd and ask to see the file on your local drug dealers. They'll rush you to the file cabinet and even get you coffee as you page through those files. Why wouldn't they? You wanted to know something and you seem to think they are there to personally serve you.

       No, I think they are there to serve the interests of the general public. Thus if they want to keep important information about the largest mass shooting in US history that they have obtained from the general public, they need to have a good reason for withholding this information. In this case, what is that good reason?

       I'm not following you. What has no legal merit? The argument I said that I'm guessinng they are presenting? I dunno if that is their actual argument. It is just a guess. I haven't read the department's response to the tv channel's petition to ve granted access to the case file.

       So, I guess I'm not going to answer this question directly. First, to me it seems like I see the question 'Why haven't we seen video of Paddock' posts and very few answers like the one you've posted. But, since there are, inevitably, posts like that...
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to lie, I
       <em>
        want
       </em>
       to see video of Paddock. And, I think we have every right to see him on the streets in and around Vegas. The city has full control of that footage and has no reason not to let us see it. However, just being realistic, I respond to all posts questioning video (or lack thereof) simply because whether it's in police custody or not, it's part of the ligation against Mandalay Bay and probably LVMPD. Not that it's right. But, honestly, this is why we haven't, won't for a long time, or ever see it.
      </p>
      <p>
       BUT, I think it's quite ridiculous the city of Vegas hasn't released one of the 500+ images they claim to have around the Vegas area.

       My own pet theory of why no footage has been released is because he's not alone in the footage.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have no proof of this, obviously, but it's my guess that is why 
TPTB don't want footage released because it'll fly in the face of the "he acted alone" narrative.

       Do you think the general public has the right to know what its government knows when it is in the public's interest to have such knowledge? Because this right has been generally recognized in all free societies for hundreds of years now and is part of the doctrine of the freedom of the press.

       The first amendment doesn't say very much, and doesn't explicitly guarantee access to all that the government knows about.
      </p>
      <p>
       "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."
      </p>
      <p>
       I've always seen this amendment as protecting freedom of conscience and voicing ones opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       I just think if the government wants our consent they need to make available information to make an informed decision on key issues.  It is a natural outgrowth from natural rights and the idea of self determination that we need to have quality information to make decisions.  But I don't see it as explicitly granted in the constitution

       Soon as you said Oct 1st shooting and not the las vegas massacre. ..makes me wonder if you are either a easily fooled person or a shill. They pushed the name "1st October" for 3 days and your already calling it that? It's that easy huh? So you agree to let ppl forget to horror in vegas and mass coverup so revenue isn't affected as much..disassociate las vegas with massacre or shooting..bc that's bad four money and tourism. MGM might have a position for you.

       It's called a free press.
      </p>
      <p>
       The freedom of the press, protected by the First Amendment, is critical to a democracy in which the government is accountable to the people. A free media functions as a watchdog that can investigate and report on government wrongdoing.
      </p>
      <p>
       “The press was to serve the governed, not the governors.”
      </p>
      <p>
       —U.S. Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black in New York Times Co. v. United States (1971)
      </p>
      <p>
       As James Madison wrote: "A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or, perhaps both. Knowledge will forever
govern ignorance: And a people who mean to be their own Governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives."

       Thanks. We have been so conditioned to the supposed "rights" of our government institutions to control us and the supposed "rights" of corporations to do whatever results in the highest corporate earnings that we have seemingly forgotten that, at least according to the Constitution, the government is allowed such "rights" only when they ultimately serve the public interest and corporations are allowed such rights only when they do not conflict with the public interest.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course the public always has the right to know whatever the government knows. The government governs only at the will of the public it serves. Thus, to withhold information it has from the public, the government must always successfully argue that it is serving the overall interest of the public in doing so. That has always been the legal argument for government's withholding certain "sensitive" information from the public in ongoing criminal investigations whenever the dissemination of that information has chance of interfering with the apprehension (or more controversially prosecution) of the culpable criminals. Since there are no living criminals to apprehend or prosecute in this case, the government has no legal argument for withholding what it knows from the public it serves and the public has every right to this information. Hence, the court cases that media outlets have filed to obtain this withheld information have all the legal merit in the world. The government would have to repeal the First Amendment to prevail in these cases, at least at the SCOTUS level.

       No I don't think gun ownership is a crime.  You are the one that is worried about what is happening in someone else's hotel room.  There is no way any hotel can prevent something like this without making all windows bulletproof or something crazy like that.  Crazies gonna crazy, if you know what I mean.
