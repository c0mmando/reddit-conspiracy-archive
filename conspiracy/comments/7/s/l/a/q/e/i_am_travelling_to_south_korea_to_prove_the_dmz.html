        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have been doing a lot of research these past few months and it has become clear that the DMZ in South Korea is nothing more than an elaborate set for global tourism. The &quot;soldiers&quot; are obvious actors. Today I decided to move to South Korea to blow the lid of this. For those who want to follow this let me know.</p>

<p>TL:DR; I&#39;m moving to Korea to show the world how fake the DMZ is</p>

<p>Edit:  After reading these comments. It seems that many of you think I am travelling to North Korea, or you simply don&#39;t know Korea is divided into two very different countries. The title is clear, I am travelling to South Korea, home of K-Pop and Samsung. North Korea won&#39;t be arresting me there, nor could they. I do not plan on visiting North Korea EVER. I simply plan on going on one of the many DMZ tours offered by one of the many tourist companies in Seoul. If you find it suspicous that the US government as well as South Korea&#39;s government just lets you walk around around the border between two countries that could easily continue conflict you&#39;re not paying attention. The DMZ that people take photos of and is shown on the television is nothing more than a tourist attraction that is used to shape peoples opinions on global politics. Look at the satelite images in comparison with the buildings &quot;on site&quot; many of them aren&#39;t matching dimension or shape. Look at the soldiers who are clear actors, some of the footage we see plays out like a crappy b movie action film.  </p>

<p>Edit 2:  Imagine the government allowing daily tours of Area 51, letting people from all around the world take pictures and pose with guards.  Would you honestly walk around thinking &quot;oh this definitely real and not complete bs&quot;.</p>

<p>Edit 3:  Sorry I can&#39;t reply to your individual comments, the mods won&#39;t let me respond to comments for some reason.</p>

I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re American it not, but if NK catches you, you&#39;ll be labeled a spy and sentenced to life. Regardless if what the President says, they do not have a working relationship. There is little guarantee that you will come back in a decent timeline, or ever.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>because as an American you are allowed to see the Chinese side, the South Korean side, the Russian side, the Japanese side, everyone who lives around and deals with them are all just following the American line?  There’s probably a lot our government knows and doesn’t tell us.  There is also a lot our government doesn’t know and openly wishes it did.  NK gets called secretive bc they are.  We aren’t scared of what the Kim family will do, we’re scared of a new leader we know even less about taking power.</p>

<p>The truth about NK is that it’s a humanitarian nightmare that no one wants to deal with.  SK doesn’t want those people, china doesn’t want those people, Japan sure as shit doesn’t want to clean up that mess.  </p>

<p>It’s not even like the  world fucked up not enforcing regime change before they went nuclear.  Seoul has been in the crosshairs of conventional arms since the armistice.  15 minutes into war being declared, Seoul turns to rubble from artillery built in the 50s and 60s and there’s not a goddamned thing any super power can do about it.  </p>
