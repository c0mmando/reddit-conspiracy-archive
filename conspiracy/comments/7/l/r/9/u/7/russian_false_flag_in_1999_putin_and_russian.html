<p>The autonomous republic of Chechnya declared independence from Russia, following break up of Soviet Union. Russia wasn&#39;t going to let it go. Russia wanted to sent troops to quell rebellion, but was afraid it would look like an aggressor.</p>

<p>So it faked a series of apartment bombings to make it look like Chechen terrorists were attacking Russia, then used it as a reason to invade and quell the rebellion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These newly arrived Russian Jewish Mafia members were able to forge ties between the Jewish Mafia in Russia and the organised crime world in the USA, and they were thus in place and prepared when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991 and a new era of oligarchs, corruption to the highest levels (including President Yeltsin and his prime minsters) and wholesale looting of the post-Soviet Russian economy.</p>

<p>The Russian Jewish Mafia needed to find a way of laundering the vast wealth they were stealing from Russia so they went looking for partners in the US criminal underworld. They found him in the shape of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>But people said the same thing about Assad and what do you know, like 88.7% voted for him.</p>

<p>What percentage of Crimeans voted to join Russia?</p>

<p>Putin threw out the Jewish oligarchs who were bleeding Russia dry and raised GDP. That&#39;s the source of his popularity. Just like Assad stood up to the ISIS trash the West brought to Syria (they&#39;re all foreigners). And guess what now the ISIS trash is back in the West, one intel agency estimated there are 50,000 ISIS sleepers in Europe.</p>

<p>That&#39;s how you get unpopular and why someone like Putin will become the new future of the West. Trump is too much of a fucking retarded child to pull off a Mussolini act but someone like Jesse Ventura could do it.</p>

Lying and creating false events to blame some people or country that you want to conquer, plunder or annex and extend your own control over and exact some for of tribute from has been a common practice used by the ancient Greeks, Romans, and all who followed in their wake.

    <div class="md"><p>This was a nuclear attack. See VT:</p>

<p>This was another similar bomb, a truck bomb used to attack a Moscow apartment complex.  The year was 1999.</p>

<p>This time, the truth got out, for a while at least, picked up by CNN but quickly suppressed.  This is what the authorities in Russia said:</p>

<pre><code>“The force of the blast was equivalent to about 100-300 tons of TNT, it said.”
</code></pre>

<p>The link to the CNN video has been disabled, but we have the description as given to CNN by Russian officials:</p>

<pre><code>“At least 17 people were killed and more than 115 injured when explosives hidden in a truck or an underground pipe blew off the front of a nine-story apartment block in Volgodonsk, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) south of Moscow, Russian security officials said.”
</code></pre>

<p>A truck can carry 2 or 3 tons of the explosives described, no more, certainly not 100 tons or 300 tons.  However a rail car holds 60 tons of fertilizer, a common way of transporting this material.  The problem is, there are no railroad tracks in the area and no one saw a train explode.</p>

<p>This explosion could have been nothing but a nuke.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>How much explosives in terms of weight is needed for an explosive force of 300 tonnes? let&#39;s say it is c4 they used.</p>

<p>&quot;The RE factor is the relative mass of TNT to which an explosive is equivalent&quot;</p>

<p>RE factor for c4 is 1.34</p>

<p>so 300/1.34=220 tonnes.</p>

<p>How do you fit 220 tonnes of c-4 in one truck? :)</p>

<p>so the only reason you say lol is because you&#39;re lack expertise in explosives, unlike the war veterans who write for VT.</p>

<p>Russia did the same thing the usa did on 7 december 1941: false flag to manipulate the public opinion.
the end justifies the means: to keep Russia as one State, FSB needed to crush the djihadist rebellion. did they need the apartment bombings? no. that was criminal, State&#39; terrorism. no doubt.</p>

<p>1999 Russia false flag is no way the same than the nuclear false flag attack on september 11, 2001.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I want to believe this conspiracy as its seems so widely accepted yet it makes little sense with the timeline of Putin&#39;s rise to Power.</p>

<p>Putin&#39;s reach at the time and his command of ex kgb or FSB was limited; despite this the claim is that it (the bombing) makes perfect sense - at that time Putin&#39;s fate was still partially leveraged by one of two Oligarchs that Putin had recently destabilised. Putin was accused of a conspiracy in 93&#39; in St Petersburg of defrauding the city of Food supplies arranged by Putin in exchange with international companies who wanted to buy property in St petersburg. When I looked into these accusations against Putin they appeared tenuous and politically motivated. </p>

<p>There were considerable motivations from literally all opponents of Putin at the time to spread the idea that Putin masterminded these bombings. There is much complexity around this however including the spurious elements that have always been related to Putin, elements that biographers and those in the know (ex. kgb agents etc) who have since relocated overseas claim that agents who frequently acted on their own behalf/accord claimed retrospectively that they were acting on behalf of Putin. 
This is not say Putin has never been directly involved in many horrendous crimes and even assassination (as it appears from history that he has been) however the mythology that Putin has a micro and macroscopic control of Russia (the largest land mass in the world) is preposterous. However it something that modern propaganda relies on.</p>

Trump is president, Putin respects the United States again, and we will move forward as partners instead of adversaries.  Putin wouldn&#39;t even think about crossing Trump.  Trust me.</p>

<p>Also, there was absolutely no connection between Russia and the Trump family or the Trump campaign.  It&#39;s all FAKE NEWS.  Especially that Steele Dossier by that FAKE career British &quot;intelligence&quot; agent.</p>
