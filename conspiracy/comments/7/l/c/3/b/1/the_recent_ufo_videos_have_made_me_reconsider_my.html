        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Sorry if this has all been said before, but I just had to share some of my thoughts somewhere.</p>

<p><a href="https://coi.tothestarsacademy.com/gimbal/">With the newly released UFO videos,</a> I&#39;ve really had a complete change in my perspective on UFOs.  I used to dismiss any video/story as some sort of editing trick, or an unknown behavior of weather/asteroids/etc.  But this video, to me, is hard proof that there is some sort of ET life that visits Earth.  This made me relook at the history of UFOs back to Roswell, and, wow, it all seems so believable now.   </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjApDnCvh2c">The interview with Bob Lazar</a> (a physician who worked at the secret area 51 base with the crashed saucer) in particular was very fascinating.  If you take for granted he&#39;s telling the truth, which he certainly seems to be, then it has absolutely massive implications.  </p>

<p>Having my paradigm shift because of this one conspiracy makes me realize that there is also more truth out there about certain things that get dismissed as conspiracy, things that just don&#39;t have that hard evidence of proof yet.  Anything is possible now.</p>

<p>I also believe that the government must be intentionally drip feeding information very strategically, which makes sense.  Full disclosure of everything related to ET/Alien life will have massive impacts on society, and they have (almost) full control over how much/what gets released to the public.  They can strategically release information at their discretion.  If they ever were to come out and say that yes aliens are real to the public, it would be the biggest event in human history, and I&#39;m sure people in power do not want to squander such an opportunity.  So I&#39;m sure this latest UFO video was released intentionally, I just wonder why.</p>

<p>After 70 years of staunch denial, suddenly this rock star while his team of former super spooks and the likes get full approval to release this.</p>

<p>Only the bad guys use MSM and morning talk shows to roll out stuff.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s important to note that Tom Delonge&#39;s site is taking <a href="https://i.gyazo.com/cdd174ba27f5a142755bdddd6ddf9191.png">&quot;investments&quot;</a> with different tiers for &quot;member status&quot; and getting &quot;shares&quot;.

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, this is very important.</p>

<p>All those people would be the very same people to actually have had access to and have worked on UFO related stuff.</p>

<p>They would also be the same people the puppet masters who have been keeping this secret from would use to roll out a carefully planned disclosure that keeps any and all of their past devious deeds a secret.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, that what all the hoopla is about.</p>

<p>Tom DeLonge announced a while back that he created this To The Stars Academy and pulled in all these super top tier scientists, CIA, top Lockheed people and other top government folks to finally lift the veil on UFO secrecy and then use all their talents to develop super tech like antigravity and brain computer interfaces.</p>

<p>He said the disclosure would start with some UFO videos from the DoD.</p>

<p>Everyone pretty much laughed. </p>

<p>Then on Saturday the NYTimes ran the article with the video, confirmed the secret Pentagon program, and the former head of the program went around on morning talk shows.</p>

<p>Full on MSM roll out.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agree, but for the first time ever it was aknowledged by the government and MSM, and not debunked/ignored as swamp gas etc, a 180 from previous history where people were almost mocked for seeing them. That itself is kinda huge, I think anyway.</p>

<p>And not alien ET evidence, but unidentifiable craft doing things physics has issues with at our level of understanding. Could be us, or aliens, inter dimensional beings or Putin.

    <div class="md"><p>Great post. I think it&#39;s important to remember as this bubbles up into the mainstream just how many people have been ridiculed and slandered, even laughed out of politics (Dennis Kucinich) for even suggesting we should look into UFOs in the recent past. Hopefully it causes others to question some other unsavory truths which have historically been &quot;unquestionable&quot;.</p>

<p>I think its silly to say, well if there were aliens we would know, but we dont so therefore there are no aliens. When the reality is there has been a systematic effort to erase humanity&#39;s origin. And many unanswered questions about where we come from and what purpose we serve.</p>

<p>I think its believable that microchips and transistor chips were born from ET technology.
Think about it, humans are barely lighting up filaments of metal and using punch-cards, and all of sudden they have these advances electronics, im not saying it is the case. </p>

<p>But it kinda makes sense. Ive always wondered if tesla&#39;s delusions were him communicating with the black sat or some other intelligent entity. </p>

<p>One example off the top of my head.</p>

<p>&quot;Reference to ancient Indian flying vehicles comes from ancient Indian sources, many are the well known ancient Indian Epics, and there are literally hundreds of them. Most of them have not even been translated into English yet from the old sanskrit.&quot; literally hundreds if not thousands of examples that say we may not be alone as we thought. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is an interesting timeframe between the Rosewell incident and the unprecedented rate of technological advancement afterwards.  it would be easy to say that a lot of it comes from some form of alien.  </p>

<p>one point I have against people saying: &quot;the lack of solid photographic/sigint evidence of aliens is further proof that they&#39;re bogus&quot;;  if these aliens had the type of technology needed for that type of maneuvering; then it is fair to say that they would also have technology that would prohibit our methods of intelligence gathering.  but if that were true then that would mean that they selectively choose when to let people observe them.  </p>

<p>that leads back to the possibility that this particular UFO video recently was just man made technology that is top secret.  if somebody had that technology back in 2004 then my next question is what they hell are they doing with it now.  the behavior of the aircraft in the video seemed similar to other reported UFO sightings dating back dozens of years.  that means that same top secret man made technology recorded in 2004 is the same technology people have reported seeing since Roswell.  I think we can all agree that the only way that level of technological advancement in aircraft maneuvering would be possible in the 70s or earlier would be from some sort of alien back engineering.</p>

<p>They could just have easily reverse engineered human technology as early as the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s which had less to do with aliens, and more to do with conquering space covertly; and using the American military industrial complex to accomplish all these goals. </p>

<p>I was wondering, if this is true, would not a superior being be able to design nanosensors that would allow for detection of observation - a computer which tells you when you’re being watched? If an ET had this, they could disappear before you really form a notion of what you’d just saw, which seems to fit many witness statements. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I too have researched this more than most people, in addition to a formal education in AE. </p>

<p>One important distinction is this: I “believe“ in Santa Claus. When I visit my dear grandma I “believe” in Jesus being a magical white dude. But I don’t “believe” in visitation, I know of it. I don’t know all of it, but I know that it’s essentially the stereotype realized. Saucers and all. I also strongly believe they (greys) are DNA based and that DNA is one of many of the Milky Way’s molecular methods for genetic transmission. </p>

<p>I believe that many planets were seeded with DNA around the same time, perhaps naturally or perhaps artificially. This both explains the genetics of the Hybrid Skull (that was deemed the “Starchild Skull” to delegitimization it) and their interest in Earth life. If we sent a probe to another planet and found there to be DNA based life there, we would be all over it, no matter the budget bottom line. Is it really so ridiculous to think that that scenario happened the other way around? That somewhere life outpaced us and now regards our development with great interest?</p>

<p>I’ve never gone much into biology, but I know the steps of cellular division and the basics of how DNA, RNA, and how odd proteins like helicase work to translate the DNA out of the nucleus of a cell and into the genetic expression for that cell’s purpose. I’m not biologically illiterate, so if you or someone other than Jim could help shed some light on where my confusion has resulted from in regards to the Starchild Skull, I would greatly appreciate it. :)</p>

<p>Part of me wants to think that Tesla was a rogue time traveler. It would make sense that any future advanced civilization capable of time travel would be non-interventionalist, seeing that changing the past could damage their existence. But maybe Tesla decided that he could improve humanity or something. He could have also been out for personal gain, but this doesn&#39;t make sense, he wasn&#39;t concerned about money and died broke. Had he been interested in traveling to the past and getting rich, he would have just bet on various events and purchased stock in companies that would later succeed.</p>

<p>The optimist in me says those who have held the keys to this kingdom are beginning to realize the disservice they were doing by hoarding it and allowing society to run rampant in the absence of truth.</p>

<p>The realist in me says this kind of thing used to happen <em>a lot</em> (public disclosure, insiders &quot;leaking&quot; what they knew), with credible evidence and ultimately we still never got any explicit questions answered, nor did any <strong>concrete</strong> evidence get released to the public.  </p>

<p>These new videos are interesting, but let&#39;s not kid ourselves:</p>

<p>We&#39;re not experts on fabricated video, so ultimately we don&#39;t have the capability to judge these releases as authentic or not.</p>

<p>We&#39;re ultimately at the whims of any groups that do hold &quot;the keys to the kingdom&quot; and we shouldn&#39;t let that distract us or prevent us from continuing to think critically and trying to prevent egregious conspiracies against our fellow man from continuing unchecked.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good for you, believers are cool and all, but I gotta say I am a tad upset at how a lot of people are taking this. Why do you, or anyone &quot;royal you&quot;, need a government source to confirm aliens &quot;might&quot; exist. In a infinite universe, intelligent life should be assumed. Plus with like, roswell, kecksberg, phoniex lights, Its not like all those people were lying. Its not like there aren&#39;t hundreds of credible ufo vids on youtube. Its not even the first federal government to say ufos are real. Its not even the first u.s.a declassified UFO program.</p>

<p>Basically I think I&#39;m just mad cuz most people will only truly confirm something if they are told it is so. Usually by gov or media, the &quot;authority&quot; Not a lot of people can reach a conclusion on their own and stick with it. But yea good its sparking your thinker.</p>

I was not attributing the authenticity to somebody just saying so but rather the context involved with the incident, the quality of the footage, and the fact that the footage went through the proper channels involved with declassifying the footage (scrutiny to integrity of footage).  this is much more solid grounds for evidence than a random youtube video.

The government officials working with him want him to make basically pro government propaganda for youth (see his emails with Podesta). Then the ex-govt people want to make UFO technology as public domain.

    <div class="md"><p>1st became interested after I saw my 1st &quot;UFO&quot; I had seen tv shows before then but didn&#39;t have a real opinion either way as I was just a kid. Most of my info was from books on the subject before youtube and most of todays internet. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t consider most of my knowledge of the subject as coming from the msm. </p>

<p>It is good that this new stuff has got you interested in the subject but as others have pointed out, why now?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I have to offer is to say, Good for you for being able to readjust your opinions in light of new evidence. That bein said. Don&#39;t lose a critical eye regarding everything much less conspiracies. There&#39;s a reason it&#39;s coming out now, what that reason is I have no idea. My opinion, which I&#39;m not telling you to take as truth, just pieces I&#39;ve out together, is that tptb don&#39;t allow any disclosure without agenda. So I am maintaining a healthy skepticism about the recent UFO video release. I tend to fall into the camp that admits in the reality of alien life and ufo&#39;s in general. However I feel that the majority of sightings are our own people with massively advanced tech. That has been suppressed from public knowledge. </p>

<p>I recommend a youtube video with a gentleman discussing a craft called the flux liner. Built in the 50s and called an alien reproduction vehicle by the MIC. Hopefully one of my fellow theorists can chime in with the title of the video. I haven&#39;t seen it in a year or so. </p>

<p>But this video, to me, is hard proof that there is some sort of ET life that visits Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How did you come to this conclusion? Even assuming the video footage you&#39;ve seen isn&#39;t doctored, there are other plausible explanations. The aircraft could easily be man-made instead, and part of some secret government program. It&#39;s possible they belong to another government and the US doesn&#39;t know it. We don&#39;t know what the government knows, we don&#39;t really know anything about what the videos show, and considering the source is literal spies in our own government with a history of lying to us, there&#39;s good reason to think it&#39;s all made-up anyway. </p>

<p>You say this stuff has made you consider the possibilities, but you&#39;re not. You&#39;re accepting it blindly while ignoring plausible explanations. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>it is an interesting timeframe between the Rosewell incident and the unprecedented rate of technological advancement afterwards.  it would be easy to say that a lot of it comes from some form of alien.  </p>

<p>one point I have against people saying: &quot;the lack of solid photographic/sigint evidence of aliens is further proof that they&#39;re bogus&quot;;  if these aliens had the type of technology needed for that type of maneuvering; then it is fair to say that they would also have technology that would prohibit our methods of intelligence gathering.  but if that were true then that would mean that they selectively choose when to let people observe them.  </p>

<p>that leads back to the possibility that this particular UFO video recently was just man made technology that is top secret.  if somebody had that technology back in 2004 then my next question is what they hell are they doing with it now.  the behavior of the aircraft in the video seemed similar to other reported UFO sightings dating back dozens of years.  that means that same top secret man made technology recorded in 2004 is the same technology people have reported seeing since Roswell.  I think we can all agree that the only way that level of technological advancement in aircraft maneuvering would be possible in the 70s or earlier would be from some sort of alien back engineering.</p>

For example he claimed that when His mother died thousands of miles away, I bright light enveloped His being and came to him as an entity representing maternity at the moment she passed. It consoled him.</p>

<p>His imaginative abilities were so grand that every invention he created was first drafted in 3d in his mind. He said that from a young age he would have nightmares and visions about the future which could not be explained and this pushed him to &quot;envelop the world in light&quot;. He wanted everyone to have access to the unlimited energy potential that our planet is capable of harboring. He sought to better humanity in the best way possible and cared only for the betterment of humanity as a whole. This was his life mission and he was deeply saddened that he could not accomplish his goal. I highly recommend looking into his letters, interviews and articles on him. I guarantee it will blow your mind. The man was able to so effectively control his imagination that he could control his dreams to the point that he would only need to sleep for 4 hours working from 3am to 11pm every day since his youth. During his dreams he would solve issues regarding his inventions. He is But the tip of the ice berg so to speak and his inventions revolutionized the world beyond our comprehension since we can imagine no technology not reliant on his inventions</p>
