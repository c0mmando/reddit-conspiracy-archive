<p>I&#39;m constantly being told or observing others being told that 
this sub is shot now because it has been overrun by God Emperor sycophants from T_D.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;m being told...</p>

<p>And yet...I constantly see posts such as this one on the front page of the sub that clearly show me a completely different reality when I look at the upvotes and downvotes in the comment section.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7laxt6/senator_rand_paul_on_twitter_time_to_investigate/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7laxt6/senator_rand_paul_on_twitter_time_to_investigate/</a></p>

<p>So...what is the truth?</p>

<p>Should I believe what I&#39;m being told?</p>

<p>Or should I believe what I&#39;m seeing with my own eyes?</p>

<p>Gaslighting is a manipulation technique that can be observed in many narcissistic relationships.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also a technique used widely in all spectrums of the mainstream media.</p>

<p>I highly recommend researching the topic if you are not familiar with it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a decent article for starters...</p>

<p>Edit: tons of downvotes..yet no discussion. I&#39;m thinking this is gonna go well on &quot;controversial - 1 hour&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the context of the internet and anonymous people, there is 
&quot;Astro-turfing&quot; which is basically like gas-lighting, but on a large scale with the purpose of shaping public opinion. </p>

<p>It basically means paid trolls who gaslight.</p>

<p><a href="https://experiencelife.com/article/turf-wars/">https://experiencelife.com/article/turf-wars/</a>    </p>

<p>There are tons of trolls/bots/gaslighters/astroturfers on this sub. I don&#39;t know how it used to be before because I&#39;m fairly new to the conspiracy sub. I came around right around the same time that Pizzagate was starting, and there is definitely a lot more Trump/hillary banter than there was back then. It&#39;s like all the trolls came from politics and are stuck in 2016. I personally think that the Pizzagate researchers were probably too on the nose with some of the stuff they put together and it freaked out whoever has enough money to pay for a crap ton of bots. </p>

<p>It&#39;s super weird how people will bash theories or use mainstream sources to validate their bashing.  It is for sure gaslighting. They want people to think their own critical thoughts are stupid and invalid.</p>

<p>I think there are actual paid bots, and then the even sadder people who have been unknowingly programmed by msm and basically society.  Gaslighting is how we got to where we are as far as our backwards society (think about gender relations, race relations, economic relations) and it&#39;s been exciting to see people starting to wake up. Once you realize everything is a lie, you become more confident in yourself because you realize that no one is trying to fix any problems so you&#39;re already ahead of the game by being smart enough to realize that there are major problems and they are fixable. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gaslighting isn&#39;t the term you&#39;re looking for.</p>

<p>The term gets used wrong really often but OP&#39;s link does give a better understanding.</p>

<p>Say you start dating someone and they&#39;re all into you. Then one day, they just get cold and you feel like you did something wrong. They don&#39;t tell you what you did, so you get insecure and try to please them, and they take advantage of that.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a form of psychological manipulation but not really the same as what OP is talking about.</p>

<p>Read up on the Overton Window.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window</a></p>

<p>The window of discourse is the range of topics people can talk about.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also the selective exposure theory.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t conveniently leave out the mentality behind some of the tactics used to destabilize a situation. That mentality is 100% trying to control the situation, control perceptions and control discourse. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s not gaslighting. </p>

<p>Gaslighting would be if you wore a blue shirt at your wedding, and years later your wife tells you it&#39;s red. You disagree. She spends the next year insiting it was red. She gets her maid of honor to tell you it&#39;s red. She photoshopped the wedding pics and puts them in a frame so you can see it&#39;s red. She knows it was blue. You start to doubt your own perceptions and memories.  You begin going through stress and doubt and other abuse victim type changes. You eventually cave, and begin to rely on her as the ultimate arbiter of truth, even if what she tells you contradicts your knowledge, memory,  vision,  and reality.</p>

<p>She has gaslighted you.</p>

<p>Frankly I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re right or not, but what I do know is that for me to believe either side I&#39;d like to be presented with some sort of evidence.</p>

<p>After all, isn&#39;t that what it&#39;s meant to be about? Otherwise you are doing exactly what you are accusing others of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>What you need to know is that as someone who has frequented the SandersSub, TrumpSub, Politics, and here for well over a year now, I can tell you that this is still the most level-headed group in existence. Honestly, it&#39;s kind of a balanced grab bag of Trump Supporters, Sanders Supporters, Paranoids, Schiozos, Skeptics, Conspiracy Theorists, New Agers, and Truthseekers. Some subs like T_D are the way they are bc if they let in anyone that questioned anything Trump does, they could be seen as Gaslighting, so it&#39;s a way to keep out the baddies. With that said, I think you are in good hands here - just realize that all subs have a few shitdick Mods who like to vote shift, so be sure to sort by New every so often and contribute to content that is relevant to you. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Serious question. How can you be a conspiracy theorist, and be a leftist? You want to give the state more control? Isn&#39;t that antithesis to what you should want as someone who has studied conspiricies.

Only on the internet do I find leftists that are into conspiricies. </p>

<p>Just some thoughts, would like to get your point of view. I&#39;m intrigued. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m far from a leftist but I’d presume that they don’t dislike government but are conspiracy theorists because they think our government (past and current included) has been engaged in shadowy and shady actions and constantly lies to us. They want a government that doesn’t do those things, and think such a government is possible. The difference is that libertarians (like myself) think that such opaque behavior is an intrinsic aspect of government power and thus we should be skeptical of all government, period. </p>

<p>That’s just my speculation.</p>
