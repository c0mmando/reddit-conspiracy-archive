<p>They are <strong>borrowing</strong> $1.5 trillion. Of that, for the first few years, a few percent go to the middle class. The lion&#39;s share goes to the wealthiest Americans and corporation.</p>

<p>Why don&#39;t you check with everyone at work, my mother, my Old man and ask them how their salaries are doing? I just came back from a visit with my grandparent who were millionars when I was a kid. Thanks to the rising stock market, their wealth has <strong>doubled</strong> in the past few years. Has your old man done that well?</p>

<p>So let me ask you? Should we be borrowing money to give people like my grandparents an even larger tax cut? Are they the ones that need it?</p>

<p>Why did dodge this question with a deflection to the stock market? You just repeated what I said about the stock market doing well, but ignored <strong>the fact that this primarily benefits the wealthy</strong>. </p>

<p>So one more time. How have their wages done in the past 8 years?</p>

<p>Better call your reps to find the missing $21 Trillion in the Pentagon (enough to be $60k for every U.S. Citizen) get the M.I.C. to pull out of the Middle East (where trillions in tax payer dollars a year are spent), get the Super Pac&#39;s out politics (where Billions are Spent), Get the Billions going to Israel each year to come back here, Pull pout the 22% of funding going to U.N. Financing, etc.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why do you think it matters what you think?</p>

<p>All of the major media corporations have already bought off the votes they need to pass it. All they are doing on the tv box is paying lip service to the people who&#39;s votes, petitions and protests don&#39;t amount to shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The majority of media being controlled by massive corporations doesn&#39;t mean they are foolish enough to take an authoritarian stance against the public.</p>

<p>Obviously all of the major media companies in the U.S. benefit from the tax bill, but they are smart enough to oppose it publicly.</p>

<p>Remember Hillary telling Goldman Sachs about having a public opinion and a private one?  This is just that.</p>

<p>And any middle or lower class people that seem to be benefitting from this should really take a look at if any of these new benefits expire for them in the next 8 years.  Only corporate cuts are permanent.  Hearing that phrase really should be all you need to know that the people who designed these changes know something you don&#39;t. </p>

<p>Also, this bill disproportionately affects upper middle class people in states with high state taxes and high home values, as we now lose the ability to write that off state taxes on our federal returns and deductions related to home ownership are also being gutted.  </p>

<p>Most of the states with said higher state taxes end up being blue states, but it&#39;s mainly geared at funneling a bunch of money from successful but not wealthy elite people in California, New York, and a few other specific economic areas regardless of political affiliation.  The elite have been stealing from the poor for a long time.  This tax move is geared to take a whole lot from upper middle class folks who can&#39;t or don&#39;t hide money in businesses.  People making $300k a year on payroll are the kinds getting the worst of it.</p>

<p>Not all areas are affected the same and I am willing to bet that regular people gaining money from the new tax code will see it spent on higher prices all around as the markets adjust, especially in health care.</p>

<p>It&#39;s great that some regular folks look like they are getting economic relief, but I guarantee it isn&#39;t the lasting stimulus we want it to be.   </p>

<p>I jut checked it and everyone at work, my mother, my Old man who is a welder, will be getting an extra $1k or more on their checks</p>

<p>Almost no mention that the only tax bracket cut, is the top tax bracket.</p>

<p>I like how whenever anything doesnt match up with a conspiracy theory its all &quot;manufactured&quot;</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>If  wanted to giant tax cut for the rich the best thing if they can do is to convince everybody it was good. It&#39;s clearly not what they did. So maybe it&#39;s your conspiracy theory that needs some  work</p>

<p><strong>more than 80 percent of the plan’s benefits go to the top 1 percent.</strong> As Dylan Matthews points out, this is even worse than a previous iteration of the bill.</p>

<p>With stagnate wages and the wealthy having done so well over the past 8 years, should the cuts have been as they were promised, for the working class?</p>
