    <div class="md"><p>Consider this: John Podesta has been one of the most outspoken and active proponents of UFO disclosure that has ever existed in a powerful position. In the past year, there has been a concerted effort to discredit him by way of tenuous connections and out-of-context statements. Now that some disclosure is actually happening, the discreding of Podesta is used a convenient target <em>within</em> the very community that in the past was most pro disclosure, to discredit any disclosure that is now happening.  </p>

<p>Take away: the initial seeds of Podesta&#39;s discrediting were planted by people who wanted people in the conspiracy community to immediately discount any UFO disclosure that was upcoming. And it has worked 100%. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’m just blown away that Tom DeLonge was actually telling the truth.</p>

<p>After watching his Rogan interview I was convinced he was a cokehead bullshit artist. Especially after he showed that video of the supposed TR3B in Iraq. That video is fake as shit. The guy needs to work on his presentation skills.</p>

<p>But looking at that list of people in that &quot;academy&quot; had me wondering for a while now what they were up to.</p>

<p>I guess know we know. A nice, proper, planned, and in no way incriminating, disclosure of the reality of the UFO phenomenon.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m finding it odd how few people seem to be shocked by these disclosures. They said there are UFOs that perform physics defying manoeuvres and containing never before seen compounds and it&#39;s like no big deal to people. I don&#39;t get it, what do they think it means? The people I&#39;ve talked to about it have just responded with &#39;yeah but they closed that program cos they didn&#39;t find anything.&#39; So weird, cos that&#39;s not what the news was as I understood it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I guess they&#39;re trying to play it casual. Just put out a little bit in a very non-shocking way.</p>

<p>Then gauge the reaction and make the next steps accordingly.</p>

<p>This way at least they don&#39;t cause a big panic or anything disruptive like would probably happen if they did like a special announcement from the president or some biz like we&#39;d expect in the movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Are you under the impression that the majority of so called conspiracy theorists believe in aliens and UFOs? I&#39;m not sure. I know that human/political conspiracies get thrown together with the more implausible alien/supernatural theories but I feel that this is often done deliberately to discredit anyone questioning official narratives and label them as crazy tinfoil hatters. </p>

<p>There may well be aliens out there but at this point my gut instincts are telling it&#39;s far more probable that the government is up to some kind of psychological fukery than actually disclosing genuine alien discoveries.</p>

<p>Right now it just been confirmed that there is indeed a UFO phenomenon. What the phenomenon is, aliens or otherwise, we&#39;ll have to wait until they the us :)</p>
