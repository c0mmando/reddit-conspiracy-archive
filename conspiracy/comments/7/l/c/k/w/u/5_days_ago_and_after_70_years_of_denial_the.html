       It seems like no one, not even this sub, gives that big a shit. I feel like I can’t find much discussion on this and I remember even a few months back when people where going crazy talking about a picture of a super fake looking alien. The pentagon releases this and starts a real convo (bs or not) and this sub is like “yawn”.

       One of the weirdest things I've ever heard, honestly, was that all of the Dead Sea scrolls (which are themselves very disruptive) were released without issue and today live inside the British museum , save for
       <em>
        one
       </em>
       . CIA was down there with Mossad when they were finding these things.
      </p>

       What was so earth shattering inside that  redacted document that was so much more inflammatory than what was allowed to see the light of day?

       Not going to happen the Trump-right is so poisoned on this well. 
This technology disclosure does not fit within shadows and the caves we inhabit.  They will fight it until the bombs are falling out of bay doors and falling away from the torsion fields.

       That does happen often, but what does the Trump-right have to do with this particular story regarding the potential disclosure of advanced technologies/ extraterrestrial life. It didn't seem particularly relevant to this thread that's discussing UFO disclosure tied to a nongovernmental organization pioneered in part by John Podesta, who couldn't be further removed from the Trump-right.

       I'm not at all criticizing your observation so much as I am wondering why you opened up the floor for partisan squabbling on what should be a nonpartisan issue.

       Consider this: John Podesta has been one of the most outspoken and active proponents of UFO disclosure that has ever existed in a powerful position. In the past year, there has been a concerted effort to discredit him by way of tenuous connections and out-of-context statements. Now that some disclosure is actually happening, the discreding of Podesta is used a convenient target
       <em>
        within
       </em>
       the very community that in the past was most pro disclosure, to discredit any disclosure that is now happening.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take away: the initial seeds of Podesta's discrediting were planted by people who wanted people in the conspiracy community to immediately discount any UFO disclosure that was upcoming. And it has worked 100%.

       I'm finding it odd how few people seem to be shocked by these disclosures. They said there are UFOs that perform physics defying manoeuvres and containing never before seen compounds and it's like no big deal to people. I don't get it, what do they think it means? The people I've talked to about it have just responded with 'yeah but they closed that program cos they didn't find anything.' So weird, cos that's not what the news was as I understood it.

       I guess they're trying to play it casual. Just put out a little bit in a very non-shocking way.

       Then gauge the reaction and make the next steps accordingly.

       This way at least they don't cause a big panic or anything disruptive like would probably happen if they did like a special announcement from the president or some biz like we'd expect in the movies.

       Are you under the impression that the majority of so called conspiracy theorists believe in aliens and UFOs? I'm not sure. I know that human/political conspiracies get thrown together with the more implausible alien/supernatural theories but I feel that this is often done deliberately to discredit anyone questioning official narratives and label them as crazy tinfoil hatters.
      </p>
      <p>
       There may well be aliens out there but at this point my gut instincts are telling it's far more probable that the government is up to some kind of psychological fukery than actually disclosing genuine alien discoveries.
