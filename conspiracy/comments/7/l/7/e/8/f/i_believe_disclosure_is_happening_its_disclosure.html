    <div class="md"><p>I think that we&#39;re showing &quot;our hand&quot; a little.  The vids released from the Pentagon will eventually be conditioning for tech that we already have.  It&#39;ll probably be explained as training, although the pilots had no clue what they were looking at.  The TR-3B exists, and has for awhile.  It&#39;s been expanded on.  The problem is, the general public can&#39;t grasp how the science works and so they&#39;re trying to slowly explain it.</p>

<p>The federal government sponsored his research and retained the right to use the technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh...I think it&#39;s a bit misleading to say his tech &quot;threatened&quot; the government agenda. His reasearch was LITERALLY funded by the government, and they liked it so much they basically said &quot;we&#39;re going to use that and make it so that others cannot easily use it because it&#39;s so good&quot;</p>

<p>The quote should be &quot;If it furthers our agenda, we&#39;re taking it&quot; and as for the shutting the fuck up part? Maybe he shouldn&#39;t have asked the DOD to fund his research...</p>

<p>As for others mentioned in the article, it mostly sounds like radar and communications technology that they don&#39;t want other nations to have. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s such a bad thing but then I know many of my colleagues on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> believe the federal government shouldn&#39;t be doing anything that isn&#39;t publicly announced and officially sanctioned by an elected representative....a somewhat naive take on foreign policy IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Oh geez, can&#39;t you imagine?</p>

<p>If you could develop a low power antigrav, vehicle weight could be reduced, flight time increased, and stealth ability improved. Also, manipulation of gravity has implications regarding inertia and acceleration. There&#39;d be a decent chance of creating a very highly maneuverable vehicle.</p>

<p>And if anti-grav tech was somehow more efficient/smaller/simpler than conventional propulsion, you could create miniature vehicles, drones, even personal flight devices. All great things to have in an arsenal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But this makes no sense.  Really.  If the technology is vastly different than what we have, we don&#39;t need to introduce UFO programs as some round about way of saying &quot;look we invented a new propulsion system&quot;.  Its perfectly acceptable to say &quot;Our smart scientists discovered a new form of whatever...&quot;.  Now if the implication here is that we obtained the technology from non-terrestrial beings, then thats an entirely different situation.  But I personally find that to be highly unlikely.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with OP. I felt that his delivery was way off - he seemed to have an idea in his head about how the conversation was supposed to unfold, but when it went differently he wasn&#39;t able to adapt.</p>

<p>With that being said, I didn&#39;t hear anything that made me disbelieve him, but he also didn&#39;t convince me of anything new. There isn&#39;t much reason to disprove him though, because he&#39;s pretty clear that the information he has is forthcoming. As such, he&#39;ll either produce the evidence or become irrelevant.</p>

<p>No matter your opinion on Tom, however, the podcast was pretty interesting, even if the entire story he spun was fiction.</p>

<p>Care to elaborate what his agenda is?</p>

<p>Being a PR figure for the government to help spin a positive image of them for &quot;being honest&quot; about UFOs/aliens while making fuckin bank off of it in the meantime. </p>

<p>All you need to know is that Tom&#39;s department is the entertainment department where they will make fictional and non-fictional films - so the propaganda department.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was obtained from UFO Crash Retrievals going back to the 1800&#39;s. President Eisenhower agreed to a treaty with the Aliens in 1954. In exchange for very advanced tech, the u.s.a. would allow Alien Abductions. The treaty was a farce, and the Aliens soon had control over all the Deep Underground Bases. They are still there, and have been seen by many whistleblowers.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The federal government sponsored his research and retained the right to use the technology.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Uh...I think it&#39;s a bit misleading to say his tech &quot;threatened&quot; the government agenda. His reasearch was LITERALLY funded by the government, and they liked it so much they basically said &quot;we&#39;re going to use that and make it so that others cannot easily use it because it&#39;s so good&quot;</p>

<p>The quote should be &quot;If it furthers our agenda, we&#39;re taking it&quot; and as for the shutting the fuck up part? Maybe he shouldn&#39;t have asked the DOD to fund his research...</p>

<p>As for others mentioned in the article, it mostly sounds like radar and communications technology that they don&#39;t want other nations to have. I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s such a bad thing but then I know many of my colleagues on <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> believe the federal government shouldn&#39;t be doing anything that isn&#39;t publicly announced and officially sanctioned by an elected representative....a somewhat naive take on foreign policy IMO.</p>
