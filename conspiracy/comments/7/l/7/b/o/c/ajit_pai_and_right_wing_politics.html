    <div class="md"><p>You sound like someone who really wants to debunk this....which CEO of which big ISP are you?
1) Why should he fire Ajit Pai if Ajit tells him he is on his side ( which he might not be )? Why? Why will he fire Ajit for nothing? He is giving Ajit a chance now Ajit is doing a shitty job...</p>

<p>2) I said it before, I don&#39;t like to repeat myself. The atorney general was changed this year but trump kept the previous one ( who was appinted by barack obama) only changed her when they would not agree with the muslim country ban. </p>

<p>here is proof : <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16777500/ajit-pai-net-neutrality-republican-politics-whoops">https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16777500/ajit-pai-net-neutrality-republican-politics-whoops</a></p>

<p>It says &quot;REpublican Ajit Pai&quot; ... He isn&#39;t republican he is Democrat and he is messing the Republican Party up good time!!As it says in the Article THis coming election will be very hard for them. Very Hard!! </p>

<p>I also just wanted to say: I said it first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Two things:
1, He was appointed by Obama. This is a fact. Yes, he was promoted to Chairman by Trump, but that doesn&#39;t negate the first part.
2, I wasn&#39;t trying to make a point about Obama, Trump, NN, or T_D anyway. I just wanted OP to present evidence if they had any. Thus, I thought I might as well beat OP to the punch by presenting the one well-known but tenuous point they could use.</p>
