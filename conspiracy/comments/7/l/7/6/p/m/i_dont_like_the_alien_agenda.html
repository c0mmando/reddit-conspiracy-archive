        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>This is designed to separate people because they (powers that be, whatever, government) know what is coming. Their interest is in the status quo, to keep us trapped here. Read Egyptian texts if you want to learn more- look up the story of IsIs, Osiris, and Set. We are in this state, not by accident. Somebody designed this coffin. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t read in to names but come on...the lunar probe mission was called G.R.A.I.L. as in holy grail, the Vatican telescope is called L.U.C.I.F.E.R. These fucks are either really oblivious or right on point.</p>

<p>How about the ones they call aliens, were the original humans- and somebody screwed it up at some point? But God left a remnant to fix things. But the remnant will be hunted down and killed.</p>

<p>King James Bible
They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.</p>

<p>They are going to make it seem like your neighbor is a threat. And anyone that experiences reality different than you is a threat. Don&#39;t fall for it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to define the terms, you will know if it is you, but anyone experiencing AP or OBE&#39;s- you are a target. Congrats, you are the &quot;aliens&quot; targeted even though you were here at the creation of the world. The world won&#39;t see it that way...that&#39;s why I included the depressing scripture of us being hunted down. it won&#39;t be your Sunday school preacher that&#39;s for sure. </p>

<p>Hold steady.</p>

<p>Matthew 16 18</p>

<p>18 So I now say to you: You are Peter(FYI he is the First Pope) and on this rock I will build my community( the church). And the gates of the underworld can never overpower it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>John 6:71 Jesus answered them: Have not I chosen you twelve; and one of you is adevil? John 6:72 Now he meant Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon: for this same was about to betray him, whereas he was one of the twelve.</p>

<p>There are many Judases within the Vatican itself and in every religion and denominations. There will always be a black sheep as there will be always a devil lurking within. </p>

<p>They already do that. Remember how just 10-15 years ago, people looked out for their neighbor and didn&#39;t trust the government? Now people trust the government and distrust their neighbor. How many decorations are out every holiday season lately? How many kids trick or treat past dark? Barely any, even though this is statistically the safest time period in history.</p>

<p>Just look at the social media &quot;shame culture&quot; we have now, where people are willing to snitch on, harrass, bully, or even have people fired just for what they say or think. We&#39;ve created a culture where we&#39;ll &quot;expose&quot; our own friends online for likes from random nobodies, just to seem &quot;savage&quot;. This whole expose, snitch and shame culture is just a way to get us to start spying on and policing ourselves theough fear and guilt. </p>
