<p>Even if the Apple slowdown is an intentional act, that does not rpove the claim being checked:</p>

<p>&quot;<strong>A Harvard study proved</strong> that Apple purposely slows down its older model iPhones to coincide with device releases and to boost sales of new models.&quot;</p>

<p>The bold section is what they fact-checked and found to be false - there was no &quot;Harvard study&quot;, and what there was did not <em>prove</em> anything. That specific claim is false.</p>

<p>Other information has since proved the idea behind it to be accurate, but the claim itself is still false.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Snopes being unreliable is one of those memes that gets repeated so often people start accepting it as true without knowing why. People here would have you believe that almost everything they publish is heavily biased, skewed, or made up but you ask them for examples and they can&#39;t provide any. Or they find one five year old article and squabble over whether it should have been &quot;true&quot; instead of &quot;mostly true&quot;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to claim they&#39;re perfect of course, I&#39;m sure there are a handful of genuine cases where they&#39;ve got things wrong. But I&#39;ve not seen enough to warrant dismissing them entirely. It&#39;s frustrating when you post a Snopes link that seems well cited and reasoned, and the person you&#39;re responding to just replies &quot;Snopes lol&quot; and refuses to actually discuss or refute any of the points in the article. Like mocking Snopes is some sort of &quot;get out of jail free&quot; card to dismiss any facts that they don&#39;t agree with.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I think articles should be taken on their own merits and not discarded because of the source. If you think a Snopes verdict is wrong, find some counter evidence and refute it. Don&#39;t just reply &quot;Snopes lol&quot; and refuse to continue debating, it&#39;s just lazy and stifles the discussion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A good example is the article OP linked to.</p>

<p>It discusses a claim that a &quot;Harvard study proved that Apple purposely slows down its older model iPhones &quot;.</p>

<p>Snopes declares this claim to be false, which seems to be wrong given recent events. But it actually isn&#39;t. There <em>wasn&#39;t</em> a Harvard study that <em>proved</em> Apple slows down old phones. Other evidence (and admissions from Apple) proved it, but not this mythical study.</p>

<p>The actual claim made was false, even if the overall idea behind the claim is true.</p>

<p>If you want to deny Snopes&#39; articles in general, it&#39;s easy to find one like this and spin it into being something it is not.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fact checkers do the opposite of what they claim to do.  Fact checking is when you personally corroborate information that you read, using unbiased source documentation. It is not simply going to a website and accepting their claims of &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; as gospel. This only further defers the appeal to authority by another degree, as now you are assuming the inerrancy of snopes, a company whose chief election editor last year was someone with a fashion degree in their 20s.
