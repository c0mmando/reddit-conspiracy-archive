       I thought it was a site that used facts and evidence to verify things as true or false? Unlike Wikipedia, which has shown to have biased moderators and is easily edited by anyone wishing to do so?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, if anyone linked to this sub as a legitemate, truthful, unbiased source, I'd laugh because it's clearly an anti-science, pro-Trump, pro-guns, pro-harassment and anti-truth, only believing things if it follows the narrative of some company or businessman being a Satan-worshipping paedophile who sacrifices animals and performs the Illuminati sign of clapping their hands, to show their demonic control over soundwaves.

       Not really. The apple slow down isn't connected to the sale of new iPhones so snopes is correct.

       The iPhone is slowed down when the battery degrades. That's the difference.

       That's still wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if the Apple slowdown is an intentional act, that does not rpove the claim being checked:
      </p>
      <p>
       "
       <strong>
        A Harvard study proved
       </strong>
       that Apple purposely slows down its older model iPhones to coincide with device releases and to boost sales of new models."
      </p>
      <p>
       The bold section is what they fact-checked and found to be false - there was no "Harvard study", and what there was did not
       <em>
        prove
       </em>
       anything. That specific claim is false.
      </p>
      <p>
       Other information has since proved the idea behind it to be accurate, but the claim itself is still false.

       Snopes is legitimate maybe 25% of the time, but mostly in regards to meaningless stuff. When it comes to potentially incriminating or conspiracy related themes, scopes is basically a cover up machine and is very left wing.

       I've given up trying to convince people that any one source is better than the other. Everyone is addicted to applying MSM brands to their own identity, then get offended personally if you criticize their source.

       Snoelpes is propoganda as much as all media is. It's now all for an agenda. Snopes especially. If it's factual link it, stop focusing on the source. Make a decision based on the information.

       You'd be hard to come by any source that reports on current events which meets these criteria. Everyone's trying to either get clicks, influence opinions, and/or sell their products.

      <p>
       In my opinion, you should apply an equal amount of skepticism to everything you read. There shouldn't be a consensus regarding any source one you accept all of them as flawed.

       Snopes being unreliable is one of those memes that gets repeated so often people start accepting it as true without knowing why. People here would have you believe that almost everything they publish is heavily biased, skewed, or made up but you ask them for examples and they can't provide any. Or they find one five year old article and squabble over whether it should have been "true" instead of "mostly true".
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not going to claim they're perfect of course, I'm sure there are a handful of genuine cases where they've got things wrong. But I've not seen enough to warrant dismissing them entirely. It's frustrating when you post a Snopes link that seems well cited and reasoned, and the person you're responding to just replies "Snopes lol" and refuses to actually discuss or refute any of the points in the article. Like mocking Snopes is some sort of "get out of jail free" card to dismiss any facts that they don't agree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ultimately, I think articles should be taken on their own merits and not discarded because of the source. If you think a Snopes verdict is wrong, find some counter evidence and refute it. Don't just reply "Snopes lol" and refuse to continue debating, it's just lazy and stifles the discussion.

       A good example is the article OP linked to.
      </p>
      <p>
       It discusses a claim that a "Harvard study proved that Apple purposely slows down its older model iPhones ".
      </p>
      <p>
       Snopes declares this claim to be false, which seems to be wrong given recent events. But it actually isn't. There
       <em>
        wasn't
       </em>
       a Harvard study that
       <em>
        proved
       </em>
       Apple slows down old phones. Other evidence (and admissions from Apple) proved it, but not this mythical study.
      </p>
      <p>
       The actual claim made was false, even if the overall idea behind the claim is true.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to deny Snopes' articles in general, it's easy to find one like this and spin it into being something it is not.

       Fact checkers do the opposite of what they claim to do.  Fact checking is when you personally corroborate information that you read, using unbiased source documentation. It is not simply going to a website and accepting their claims of "true" or "false" as gospel. This only further defers the appeal to authority by another degree, as now you are assuming the inerrancy of snopes, a company whose chief election editor last year was someone with a fashion degree in their 20s. Literally.
