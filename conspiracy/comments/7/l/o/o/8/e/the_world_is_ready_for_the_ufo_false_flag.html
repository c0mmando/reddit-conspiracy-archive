       It wouldn't be all that difficult.  If they projected a giant Jesus standing over earth commanding his followers to swim as far out in the ocean as possible with no boat, they would.  Cognitive warfare would weed out the religious masses quickly.

       As evidenced by the following relevant excerpts from the description of a patented invention, the technology
       <em>
        already exists
       </em>
       to create a "lens" in the upper atmosphere using plumes of particles.

       <p>
        "Weather modification is possible by, for example, altering upper atmosphere wind patterns or altering solar absorption patterns by constructing one or more
        <strong>
         plumes of atmospheric particles
        </strong>
        which will
        <strong>
         act as a lens

        <strong>
         a properly positioned plume will provide a reflecting surface
        </strong>
        for VHF [very high frequency] waves and can be used to enhance, interfere with, or otherwise modify communication transmissions."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I encourage everyone to read more about that invention, by the way, because it details how the weather can be modified and how all of the communication systems on Earth can be blacked-out or disrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
       So,
       <strong>
        in summary
       </strong>
       , whether using actual mirrors, aluminum-coated plastic film, or particles in the upper atmosphere, it is possible that not only could sunlight be focused on the Earth or reflected back into space, but
       <strong>
        three-dimensional, holographic images could be displayed on Earth using these reflective devices.
       </strong>
       The fact of the matter is that the means to carry out such an operation are being explored, and considering the time that has passed since these ideas were first discussed in newspapers, it seems likely that such technology is already completed or being refined and tested to be used to deceive the masses.

       The religious are the easiest to get to go along with your NWO though, I definitely think they’ll want to keep those groups around and pivot them into some singular religion worshipping the elite.

       I don't think you and a lot of people realize how often they generalize about "the religious".  I'm not a particularly spiritual person.  It would be fair to call me an atheist, although I don't really consider myself one.  But I dated a religious person, and it turned out that it was I who was the bigot.  Assuming so much about someone based solely on their religion is short-sighted.  There are many religious people who are skeptical of authority, themselves, and their own religion.

       I might have a skewed perspective. I’m not an atheist but I’m quite anti-religious after being raised in a fundamentalist Christian cult for 22 years. I’m actually more spiritual after leaving that behind, but unfortunately that also meant leaving my family and my entire community behind as well.

       Having being raised among Christians my whole life I have found that most of them aren't very Christ like.  They cherry pick parts of the bible to live by, by also ignore the parts that don't fit in their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like my cousin who constantly quotes the bible on how gays are going to burn in hell, but also ignores the part of the bible that says if you are not a virgin you will also be stoned and burn in hell.

       My cousin was so not a virgin before she got married.  So yeah.

       Many of them will, but a minority of them will see the deception for what it is. Some Muslims and Christians are very much anticipating the arrival of the False Messiah—a person who will portray himself as a deity, wowing the world with magic and illusion.
       <strong>
        Muslims and Christians believe that most people on Earth will fall for the deception, including a great deal of people who claim to believe in God.
       </strong>
       The majority of Muslims and Christians, despite being warned of the False Messiah, will still end up worshipping him!
      </p>
      <p>
       This is why there is an agenda to water down all of the world's religions to make them all seem more similar than they are different. Co-existing and treating each other with justice and equality and living in peace and harmony together sounds great and all...but this idea of uniting the people of Earth under a common cause has a much more sinister underlying reason. The False Messiah will act like he is going to creat Paradise on Earth, but he is a deceiver, and everyone who follows him will meet a terrible end.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        Let's not forget that most millennials have rejected the three Abrahamic, monotheistic religions in favor of "New Age" beliefs. People are identifying as Satanists, Wiccans, neo-pagans, "Plebeian Starseeds", and Atheists and Agnostics with leanings towards occultism.
       </strong>
       They will totally embrace the staged alien invasion. Think of all the sci-fi buffs who will completely buy into the staged invasion and obediently follow our "alien overlord".
      </p>
      <p>
       There are people who don't believe in God who believe in astrology and tarot card readings. There are unbelieving people who hold the belief that we can alter "the universe" in our favorl they think we can bend the laws of the universe to our own will to produce our own desired results, and in their minds, this is just science rather than magic. There are people who don't believe in God, but who think that humanity can continue to "evolve" and become like gods on the Earth—super humans who transcended to a higher level of consciousness through "spiritual alchemy".
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is, many different types of people will go along with the impending NWO. Many religious and irreligious people will lap it up. The minority who do not, however, will be those believing people who remember that the Messiah will come
       <em>
        after
       </em>
       the False Messiah and utterly destroy him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Check out this link describing what is so obviously the Antichrist/False Messiah as a figure called "
       <strong>
        Maitreya
       </strong>
       ":
       <a href="http://www.share-international.org/maitreya/ma_main.htm">
        http://www.share-international.org/maitreya/ma_main.htm
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       That article, by the way, incorrectly says that Muslims believe the Mahdi is the Messiah or like the Messiah. That is false. Muslims believe a man known as the Mahdi will be leading a group of believing Muslims during the time that the False Messiah/ad-Dajjal is misleading nearly everyone on Earth. Muslims, like Christians, believe Jesus, upon whom there is peace is the Messiah.
      </p>
      <p>
       The idea that "Maitreya" is the religious figure awaited by all world religions is an idea promoted by the
       <strong>
        Theosophical Society
       </strong>
       . Spend any amount of time reading about their views and the agenda becomes abundantly clear.

       don't be ridiculous. Jesus already tells his supposed "followers" to do plenty of things, plenty of things much more convenient than committing suicide in the ocean for that matter, and these followers aren't doing practically any of them. American Christians aren't full of shit because they follow Jesus, they're full of shit because they don't follow Jesus.

       Why would that be pointless. I can think of one very clearly defined point in doing so... Seeing if it is real or a mirage. I'm not advocating to shoot in the sky but it's not "pointless."

       Becuase if it was really aliens, we have no clue how their craft would react to man made objects. They could have technology to simply have objects phase through them. I would think if you ended up hitting a craft, it would be more likely to be made from the government rather then aliens.

       I thought the Russians claimed a failed missile test. The crazy story about that is (haven't seen any evidence other than timing) Obama was flying in the vicinity to receive his Nobel Peace prize . It's the Norway spiral.
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit add.... because Obama may have been in the air at the time, I couldn't buy the missile idea at the time because I thought it would have caused a slightly bigger international incident if it were a missile/rocket while af1 was in the area.

       Why a false flag?  We can see ufos are real with Nightvision goggles.  They are real.  Our governments are probably realizing they can't hide our visitors any longer, so are opting for a soft, slow disclosure process to bring the public up to speed.

       Yeah I don't get why people are now saying that any disclosure about ETs and UFOs is fake. I thought most conspiracy theorists were at least very open to the possibility that there has been a cover up around such things, now all of a sudden just because this stuff is going mainstream it's all a lie? I guess I can see why, if there is a sudden alien invasion scary scenario, we shouldn't buy into it immediately, because ;et's face it, if these beings have been around for decades then they'd have already invaded by now. But so far, there's not been any invasion or anything, just disclosure about there being tech from outside Earth. Honestly I can't even believe this has been disclosed, on the news, and everyone is acting like it's nothing. Everyone meaning the masses. The government has basically admitted ETs have visited our planet and it's this crazy amazing news that has been received in such a weird anticlimactic way. I don't get it at all.

       Thank you for this post. I got a feeling anyone who is skeptical of this disclosure is going to have their hands full in the coming months/years warning eager believers.
      </p>
      <p>
       UFOs are real and there already has been legitimate disclosure by reputable individuals for years. It is the fact that CNN and FOX are taking the subject seriously once John Podesta decides he is Mr. Disclosure that should trigger all of our suspicion.

       Only because some people have seen UFOs or can watch them with night sight equipment at certain places doesn't make the amount of people a critical mass to motivate the government to release any informations now. There is no critical mass for that to happen.

       They spent so long saying conspiracy theorist are nuts that when they come out and say aliens exist, the masses still write it off as crazy. That combined with the mainstream media's failing credibility, people ignore this stuff.
I personally find almost anything the news reports on as suspect and even as a conspiracy theorist, Ive never really felt threatened by aliens or even cared to really look into it. They are in the same category as ghosts to me.

       No they are deciding now is the time for reasons unknown and with the absolute worst possible person on the Earth to disclose it in John Podesta.

       You
       <em>
        should

       by all that is good and true be skeptical of this disclosure. They did nothing but ridicule legitimate researchers and military/intelligence officials for decades yet now they decide to take it seriously. It is absolutely suspicious.

       John Podesta isn't involved anymore, he was only in it during Obama's presidency and because of his personal interest in UFOs dating back to the 90s. It's possible for someone to have multiple interests, even if those interests are little boys and UFOs.

       It's all about their agenda, from WWI to WWII and they wanted a WWIII but that's not happening.  They got their war on terror with the 9/11 false flag. This is just the next stage in all that, alien false flag, get the world under NWO, make sure the people are instilled with fear so you can control them.

       Close, they are real just not in the format theybare presented. They are not races from far away places, the ufo tech is ancient in design and could be engineered by the govt. No advanced beings are coming to help us, the entities if theu exist are not your friend. They could also fake a ufo event to scare people regardless of wether ufos/aliens are even real. They dont care about the public, they arent worried about how we react, they want pandmonioum. This is just like a religion for them, they know how much you want to believe so they will pimp you if your not careful.

       And you are all led astray by your false Babylonian-Abrahamic monotheistic money based religions. It's not too late to save your soul, however. Turn to the true and real gods who can help you. Give up your false idols and gods and turn towards the light.

       God, be He glorified in the highest, is God. Jesus, upon whom there is peace, is a prophet of God and the Messiah who will defeat the Antichrist/False Messiah. Aliens do not exist. "Demons" are jinn; Satan is a jinn, not a "fallen angel", because angels do not have free will. Jinn are beings with free will, like humans, but they see us from where we cannot see them, and they will never manifest to us in this world. The staged alien invasion will be completely and utterly falsified, and merely used as a means to get the masses to accept the one-eyed False Messiah.

       "When God says, 'Jesus, son of Mary, did you say to people, "Take me and my mother as two gods alongside God"?' he will say, 'May You be exalted! I would never say what I had no right to say—if I had said such a thing You would have known it: You know all that is within me, though I do not know what is within You; You alone have full knowledge of things unseen.
       <strong>
        I told them only what You commanded me to: "Worship God, my Lord and your Lord."
       </strong>
       I was a witness over them during my time among them. Ever since You took my soul, You alone have been the watcher over them: You are witness to all things, and if You punish them, they are Your servants; if You forgive them, You are the Almighty, the Wise.'"

       John 1King James Version (KJV)
1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
      </p>
      <p>
       2 The same was in the beginning with God.
      </p>
      <p>
       3 All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.
      </p>
      <p>
       4 In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
      </p>
      <p>
       5 And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.
      </p>
      <p>
       6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
      </p>
      <p>
       7 The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe.
      </p>
      <p>
       8 He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light.
      </p>
      <p>
       9 That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.

       A staged alien invasion will be used to establish a united world government led by the Antichrist/False Messiah/ad-Dajjal.

       Check out this compilation of
       <strong>
        Ronald Reagan
       </strong>
       saying on three different occasions that an outside threat by aliens would unite the world:

       <p>

        <strong>
         we need some outside universal threat to make us recognize this common bond
        </strong>
        . I occasionally think how quickly
        <strong>
         our differences worldwide would vanish
        </strong>
        if we were
        <strong>
         facing an alien threat

      <p>
       Now watch this clip of
       <strong>
        Bill Clinton
       </strong>
       regurgitating that same narrative:

        <strong>
         the only way to unite this increasing divided world of ours
        </strong>
        . They're out there, we've had our—think of how all
        <strong>
         the differences among people on Earth would seem small

        if we felt

      <p>
       So...he hopes that if it happens it's not like "Independence Day"...but at the same time, if it was, it would be good because it would unite the world? Interesting...

       The "Childhood's End" series is based on the 1953 science fiction novel by the British author
       <strong>
        Arthur C. Clarke
       </strong>
       who once said:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "Any sufficiently
        <strong>
         advanced technology
        </strong>
        is
        <strong>
         indistinguishable from magic
        </strong>
        ."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Ad-Dajjal/the False Messiah/the Antichrist will be a
       <strong>
        sorcerer who uses magic to deceive
       </strong>
       the masses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Clarke wrote the 1968 sci-fi novel "2001: A Space Odyssey". In the novel, as summarized by Wikipedia (
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001:_A_Space_Odyssey_(novel)
       </a>
       ):
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "[...] an ancient and unseen alien race uses a device with the appearance of a large crystalline monolith to investigate worlds all across the galaxy and, if possible, to encourage the development of intelligent life."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       As if to suggest that aliens made humans "evolve" and a therefore responsible for all advances humans have made. This is also the idea pushed by
       <strong>
        "Ancient Aliens"
       </strong>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Long story short, the novel's protagonist, Dr. David "Dave" Bowman, "is transported via the monolith to an unknown star system..."
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "He is brought to what appears a pleasant hotel suite, carefully designed to make him feel at ease, and falls asleep, whereupon he becomes an immortal 'Star Child' that can live and travel in space. The Star Child then returns to Earth, where he detonates an orbiting nuclear warhead."

       <strong>
        The video suggests that regular people trying to expose the existence of aliens are being stifled by government agents
       </strong>
       , as demonstrated by one official-looking guy who says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "If this gets out, there will be mass panic; shut it down."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       This public reaction was already tested by
       <strong>
        Orson Welles
       </strong>
       's reading of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel
       <strong>
        "The War of the Worlds"
       </strong>
       over the radio.
      </p>
      <p>
       The message that is "decoded" from the satellite "Black Knight" says:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "We came to you many thousands of years ago when your civilization was young. You have grown quickly and efficiently, but you still have so much to learn.
        <strong>

        , on the night of your next full moon,
        <strong>
         the people of Earth must show us that they are ready
        </strong>
        ; we will be watching."
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       The beginning of the video says:

        "In 1899,

        </strong>
        , in Manhattan, raising the question of whether enemy agents might have had a chance to learn some of his secrets before the body was found. (One fear was that Tesla was working on a 'death ray.') As Margaret Cheney and Robert Uth recount in 'Tesla, Master of Lightning,'
        <strong>
         Professor Trump examined Tesla’s papers and equipment
        </strong>
        , and, in a written report, told the F.B.I. not to worry: Tesla’s 'thoughts and efforts during at least the past 15 years were primarily of a speculative, philosophical, and somewhat promotional character,' but 'did not include new, sound, workable principles or methods for realizing such results.'"

       Personally, before discovering Islam and converting about two years ago, I was an Agnostic for 10 years, and during the last couple of years of that, I got really into
       <strong>
        "Ancient Aliens"
       </strong>
       , and I truly started to think that it made sense that an intelligent race of extraterrestrials that has been around longer than us influenced human civilization. I have come to realize,
       <strong>
        thank God
       </strong>
       , that this is part of a great deception to cause us disbelieve in our Creator, to believe that there is a superior race of alien beings watching us, and to accept the introduction of a single world government led by a deceptive HUMAN individual who does not have our interests at heart!
      </p>
      <p>
       We are living in a time when believing in God is seen as foolish, while there are disbelieving people who are literally convinced that they are

       </strong>
       /"Nordic Aliens".

       People refuse to worship our Creator and disbelieve in the angels, the Prophets and Messengers, the Messiah, the Antichrist, the jinn, Satan, the Day of Resurrection and the Afterlife...but they willingly believe other mystical ideas. People disbelieve in miracles, but will easily fall for magic and illusion.

       This

        False Messiah
       </strong>
       , with his
       <strong>
        united world government
       </strong>
       and his
       <strong>
        unified world religion
       </strong>
       ? How many more generations need to be born in order for this
       <strong>
        Great Deception
       </strong>
       to reach its final stage? In the eyes of occultist elitists, humanity is nearly ready to accept this! That is why we see all of these increasingly, overtly ritualistic award shows and sporting event performances; they're celebrating the upcoming arrival of this world leader. We're on the edge, yet only a minority of people can see it for what it really is.
      </p>
      <p>
       <strong>
        To conclude
       </strong>
       , all of this information seems to suggest that a staged alien invasion will indeed be used to unite humanity under a single world government, and the leader of that world government will be the one Christians and Muslims know to be the Antichrist. Anyone with any sense at all will not fall for this deception when it happens.

       You can just use PBUH, dude, you don't have to impress the born Muslim with your shiny, newly learned Arabic with how hardcore of a convert you are. I'll bet you were an Evangelical Christian before and you'll be a mormon for a couple years, and then a Buddhist, and then a self proclaimed prophet and seer/wannabe cult leader after that.

       The abbreviation for "subhanahu wa ta'ala"—meaning "the most glorified and the most high"—would be "s.w.t.".
      </p>
      <p>
       "P.b.u.h." stands for the English phrase "peace be upon him" and is used when speaking about the Prophet Muhammad, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam (s.a.w.s.). I prefer to use s.a.w.s., which means "upon whom are peace and blessings from Allah". At the very least, I prefer to say, "upon whom there is peace" instead of "peace be upon him". I just think that, grammatically, it makes more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allah, s.w.t., knows my intention in glorifying Him with this phrase is not to impress born Muslims and make others think I'm "hardcore".
      </p>
      <p>
       Your assumption about what my beliefs used to be and what they will be in the future are completely off-base and, if you have any faith in your Creator at all, you will refrain from making assumptions of this nature in the future. If you want to know something about someone, you can ask them.
      </p>
      <p>
       My family are Protestant Christians but they are totally non-practicing and the only time we ever went to church was on Easter to please my great-grandmother when she was in good enough health to still go. I identified as Atheist at 13 or 14, and then as Agnostic from around 15 to 23. During that time I did indeed look into all other major world religions, including Buddhism briefly, but I never believed in any other them or embraced any of them; I just wanted to know what they were all about.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reverted to Islam at 23, and I am now 26. I am married to a Muslim man and left the U.S. to live in a Muslim-majority country. In shaa Allah, by God's will, I will never fall back into what He once took me out of; I will never leave Islam now that I have accepted it as my faith. I will certainly never proclaim myself as a prophet or lead a cult! What a mighty accusation...

       I'm not surprised. when I was a kid, I imagined being a Final Fantasy level villain who became a false god and resurrected ancient demons to torment the people of earth, they would have to unite to fight against me and save themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm pretty sure its a common idea in the universal subconscious, that a greater outside threat could cause us all to forget the little differences so we could struggle against the demon-monsters.

       Well I saw it up close last night and know people who live close enough to it that their house shook during lift off. This literally happens all the time. VAFB is the west coast launch point for the US so this is normal. I've seen it literally at least half a dozen times. Pretty routine launch. I'll happy show you my pics if you'd like. I was out walking when it happened so I got some nice pics with my terrible burner phone camera.

       Once that happens, the removal of god from the media will be complete imo. It then allows comics, pundits, media figures to criticize people for believing in "god"(even more than they already do). Kinda like the way people talk about the Amish.

       Seems more likely that aliens will be co-opted into religion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Hindu gods literally went between earth and heaven in
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/undefined.jpg">
        UFO like vehicles

       . Krishn was said to be one of those gods born in human form and had a very similar story to Christ. What if Christ was made to be born by aliens from the virgin Mary?
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't neccesarily believe any of the above but it's fun to speculate on the relationship between religion and UFOs.

       No they aren't. In Genesis 6 the sons of God (angels) took wives of men, they fucked had kids and the giants were created. Giants are fallen angel x human offspring and demons are the spirits of these dead giants looking for another body to host. They aren't the same at all, just do a little research and you'll find the same thing

       Here's what it boils down to: I have no doubt in my mind that aliens exist, and visit here frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
       But I am absolutely suspicious of every, single, thing that comes from the talking heads on tv. I don't trust any of them. Ever.

       The question we should be asking ourselves here is, why now, and what do they have to gain.

       Frankly I think it's meant to serve as a distraction. "Who cares if this senator was a child molester. The government needs to do something about the aliens!"

       Do you guys really think they would do a UFO false flag? Do you understand what they would need to do to pull that off? That means they have to make up and imaginary alien species that is attacking us and update the story on a daily basis. I mean, cut the crap. If anything, all this UFO disclosure stuff is a money grab or some kind of misdirection. .

       Start with an event, have a good population witness a small portion of it, small enough for them not to know what it is but can b explained by the media later.
      </p>
      <p>
       Grab some explosives and blow up a building, have it stormed by little green men and have them leave. Then panic the public by what they 'took'.

       All it takes is authority to talk about it and the media to parrot it and those idiots out there will believe it.

       UFOs means Unidentifed flying object. Aliens means a race or species that is not born on this planet.

      <p>
       Ufos can easily be advanced military craft. Aliens can not. Please use the correct terms to avoid confusion.
