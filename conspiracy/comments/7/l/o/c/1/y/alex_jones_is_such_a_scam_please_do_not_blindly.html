        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Alex Jones was created by the CIA to discredit legitimate conspiracies. He rarely talks about the Federal Reserve, or how Israel is taking over Pakistan. He sometimes yells or gets unnecessarily angry during a show. These are the only segments used by mainstream media (such as the John Oliver Show). These enraged clips are featured on purpose to make Alex Jones out to be the mascot of conspiracy theorists. If Alex was really against corporate America, then why would he sell overpriced and deceivingly safe muscle growth powder on the official
InfoWars website? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hijacking top comment because a lot of people are asking for evidence. Google &quot;Alex Jones Stratfor,&quot; and &quot;Alex Jones family ties to CIA.&quot; There&#39;s plenty of evidence to support the claim that he has deep ties to the IC. If you ask me, AJ was initially a coordinated attempt to discredit all conspiracy theories just like we&#39;re seeing flat earth do currently. Funny how he was always fairly anti-authority until Trump ran for office. My theory is that his handlers ordered him to start grandstanding for Trump because too many people had started waking up. Many people who&#39;s eyes had been open for years went back to sleep because they trusted Jones and thus saw Trump as &quot;one of us.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look Alex has to be controlled to some extent or he would cease to be alive or on air. However, like Q, regardless of if Larping or not, he is getting people to recognize and talk about important things. I agree he is definitely pro Israel, but he shits on the Fed all the time. Also, his products aren&#39;t bullshit as you say. You can find all of the same products at any health store in America. There was actually an expose a while back on his products and they ended up finding out they were actually more potent than much of the competitors, so fuck off with that shit. You rather he sell ad space? You realize he sells things like books, survival equipment, water purifiers, and American flags too, right? Sorry, but you don&#39;t have any idea what you are talking about.</p>

<p>They list all the ingredients that’s in the supplement (like every other manufacturer of supplements is required to do). So you can research if the ingredients are actually scientifically viable. If we’re specifically talking about super male vitality, they use similar ingredients as other vitality products. Look for yourself <a href="https://www.infowarsstore.com/super-male-vitality.html">https://www.infowarsstore.com/super-male-vitality.html</a></p>

<p>His stuff sells because 1. It seems to work for people who buy it, and people like it (good reviews). And 2. There is actually science behind what’s in the supplements and research into what t does</p>

<p>Yeah like, reptilians and inter-dimensional child molesters lol.</p>

<p>You realize this guy sells views and supplements to make a living, that right there should tell you that this guy will say or do anything for those sweet sweet views and bone broth orders. </p>

<p>Just FYI most supplements on the market are sold with no testing done, also the ones that are tested have data cherry picked for the reports. The guy is a charlatan and doesn&#39;t give a fuck about anything apart from selling man pills and eating greasy burritos.</p>

<p>Just to note, if his supplements are that great why does he look like a fat sack of unhealthy shit all the time?</p>

<p>The shit he sells is his own. That right there should put him a notch above all MSM that exists mostly to collect viewers as a commodity to sell to advertisers. That is a far more nefarious and hollow endeavor, one that Jones avoids.</p>

He would buy it bulk from a chinese manufacturer like everyone else and he would slap his own brand on it and sell it to people who lap it up, his is no different then all of &quot;the best&quot; supplements on the market. </p>

<p>There is a big difference in selling a product to make people healthier compared to selling a product just to make money. Jones is the latter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You never heard about Alex Jones&#39; infamous Y2k broadcast?</p>

<p>He claimed Russia was started a war in Europe and it was happening as he was speaking in air:</p>

<p>&quot;Cash machines are failing in Britain and now other European countries. They’re finding large amounts of explosives in France. Vladimir Putin, who is known as Vladimir the Ruthless, using all his profanity on national TV, you name it. We won’t read the profanity here but we’ve got it — this person is on an unbelievable power trip and resembles a demon. He is a creature of the IMF and the World Bank and International Communism. He is a former KGB head and this information is vital ladies and gentleman.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We’re seeing the New World Order really come out in full force. More wars than have been in the past 50 years are going on right now. The war in Chechnya is raging in Rosney with reports of hundreds to thousands dying.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Twenty to forty thousand civilians trapped in the city. Russian hinds are being shot down, tanks are being blown to bits. Massive grod unguided rocket attacks are being launched from the city indiscriminately right now. Air and artillery bombardments as well. It’s absolutely out of control, it is pandemic ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p>He claimed Texas was running out of gasoline, water, and radio went down in Minneapolis:</p>

<p>&quot;And the things happening here in Austin, Texas. The shelves are empty of water and some gas stations are running out of fuel. Here in central Texas and in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the shortwave is basically down, ladies and gentlemen. It went off right as I went on the air.&quot;</p>

<p>He claimed US military was out in the streets of America searching for terrorists:</p>

<p>&quot;The occupational government in Washington, D.C. has setup a huge $50 million dollar command bunker hooked into all the FEMA boxes that can take over all the shortwave broadcast and commercial AM and FM stations, as well as television broadcast stations. And we hope they do not activate that, ladies and gentlemen.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Police and military are on high alert, running around, looking for supposed boogie men and terrorists under every rock. Military are highly visible now. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, there are trains of military equipment moving into Austin. Two nights ago, on Wednesday night, Fox News reported that the airport will be used as a massive holding facility for troublemakers or rioters here in Austin — that has no history of riots.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Americans standing up as Russia threatens to attack us with nuclear weapons, as nuclear power plants — at least one — are being shut down. And the military runs around with the police and the FBI, saying terrorism is eminent.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the best quote from it:</p>

<p>&quot;And some would characterize us as dangerous because we report the facts.&quot;</p>

<p>Alex Jones is a fraud and con man that&#39;s made MILLIONS off of gullible people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>He didn&#39;t get Y2K &quot;wrong&quot;, all of these quotes a came from a LIVE broadcast on 12/31/1999. These weren&#39;t predictions he made prior to 12/31/1999 this was Alex Jones lying and making up a bunch of bullshit live on air to scare people. </p>

<p>It seems your lacking the context of this situation, did you even read the quotes I posted?</p>

<p>This man was live on air claiming Vladimir Putin started a war in which THOUSANDS of people had already died, he claimed Putin had planted bombs all over France, he claimed that Chechens were actively engaged in battles with Russian forces and he also claimed Russia was preparing for a nuclear strike on the United States.</p>

<p>He was live on air claiming terrorist attacks were imminent all over the USA and that the FBI and US military were out in the streets actively searching for armed terrorists which he was obviously insinuating to be Russian military.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like I said before you can keep listening to him but this dude was sitting on his fat ass claiming WW3 had started live on air when not a single one of those things was happening.</p>

<p>The last thing I just want to inform you of is when Alex and his wife were getting divorced his wife cited his insane on air behavior as a reason to no allow him custody of their children. In turn Alex Jones and his lawyer admitted he&#39;s simply playing a character on air and it&#39;s all just an act.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a liar, a con artist, and snake oil salesman spouting off conspiracy theories while selling bone broth and vitamins.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From the video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...it caused males to turn into females, to develop eggs</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is my problem with all these people saying “See, Alex was right, it really does turn them gay!” The researcher makes clear in the clip that the main effect observed was the flipping of male frogs’ <em>sex</em> rather than their <em>sexuality</em> (as in, they developed female sex organs and started growing eggs). This is not what most people would describe as “turning gay”—it’s equivalent to if gay men, in addition to being attracted to other men, started growing vaginas and ovaries. Frogs are also naturally predisposed to this kind of sex flipping (think Jurassic Park). </p>

<p>TLDR, the chemicals didn’t “turn the frogs gay”, they turned male frogs into female frogs.</p>

There are a lot of resources used by the media and internet that discredited him and makes him look like a crazy person.

Certainly interesting, it’s almost as if someone out there really wants to make a mockery of him. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is from a comment I posted awhile back:</p>

<p>I think he knows how he carries himself across on the radio and the various shows he&#39;s been with. In 1999 during the whole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7jJMYJbAKc">y2k</a> scare he sensationalized the whole thing in an over the top scare mongering tactic to all the &quot;get yer canned foods and shoot the Russians!&quot; crowd.  Essentially not helping the situation at all and feeding on people&#39;s ignorance and fear.</p>

<p>He&#39;s afraid of being labeled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ge8BpFI0RPA">Anti-Semitic</a> to tell the truth. Ashkenazi Jews and alike elites of the state of Israel working under Zionism are a HUGE player in this messed up chess game for globalism and our problems in the Middle East and he chooses to ignore, avoid, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52fm6zAHa-w">talk</a> over anyone trying to have a say about it.  I understand it&#39;s a touchy subject and there are other elite players, but using everything that he has &quot;in the know&quot; I think he could explain himself about the Zionist grand involvement in Israel and their relationship with the Middle East and their deep relationship with the USA.   </p>

<p>Here is a good example of Project Mockingbird/COINTELPRO in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhOKXT7D6oc">action</a> from Alex Jones. What exactly is he trying to do here at this rally that he didn&#39;t start?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntXlgYnJ_xc">Full clip without edits</a> </p>

<p>Just those few points to start.  I can put more and you can also find all kinds of sources on your own as well. I don&#39;t want to be the one to accidentally force a narrative on how you see things. I don&#39;t want to fight either. I just want truth and clarity and I don&#39;t think Alex Jones is helping with that especially when he&#39;s somehow the forced spokesman for more level headed people in the ways of <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2015-02-23/1967-he-cia-created-phrase-conspiracy-theorists-and-ways-attack-anyone-who-challenge">CONSPIRACY THEORIES.</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why are you apologizing? I mean it&#39;s possible that he is just needlessly being a total ass to a public gathering of people talking about gun laws and such? But why?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t you think it would have been in his best interest to help assist in their cause or at least not trying to drown them out with his megaphone? This was only causing chaos and disarray and totally undermining their gathering. You could argue a different reason for his actions like I stated before, but he has a history far longer that seems to suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>Edit: To add in the COINTELPRO direction this type of behavior and strategy has been used before by undercover agents from police/FBI/etc for protest groups and usually with violence added.  His actions (not just that video example) mirror the strategy of muddying the waters around critical issues through all his media platforms.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The rest of the quote: &quot;If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.” </p>

<p>This was a universal proverb at the time and Sun Tzu paraphrased it.  Just taking the core concept of &quot;knowing your enemy and knowing thyself&quot; there wouldn&#39;t have been any reason to write further in the art of war.  </p>

<p>Most of his writings were about understanding the environment through clear eyes by knowing how you experience the world around you and how it pertains or is affected by your enemy. Sun Tzu also talked about spies considerably and their usefulness in knowing the enemy.</p>

<p>Knowing thyself you should first understand how the outside world affects your perception in how the world really works.</p>

<p>I do believe in using the same tactics, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as easy as exposing a part and it falling like dominoes.  It&#39;s more like an onion or an artichoke where you peel one layer away it&#39;s only covering another layer ad infinitum.  Misinformation and disinformation mixed with a little bit of truth all the way. Something has to cut through.  Can truth be a knife?  We&#39;ll see..</p>

<p>Bill Cooper was the real deal in the 1980s + 1990s and died for what he believed in.
Alex copied him and his 9/11 theory and makes tons of cash from marketing to conspiracy theorists.</p>

<p>That said, OP has no proof he was created by CIA and obviously has personal beef with Israel. OP is wrong: Alex talks about the Fed when Ron Paul and others are on. Occam&#39;s Razor: Jones is a performance artist, not a disinfo agent.</p>

<p>Jones is an open Christian libertarian capitalist, so selling muscle growth powder and being pro-Israel is not against his belief system.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Jones was compromised a while ago. But. Alex was legit at one time. It scares me to think how big he has gotten. The picture he paints of conspiracy theorists - truly scary. Not that anyone big in the research is that great.</p>

<p>Hopefully someone like James Corbett takes the place of Alex Jones. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I completely understand why people don&#39;t trust/ understand alex jones. (Even if you think you do understand, I doubt it.) I&#39;m not saying he doesn&#39;t talk out of his ass or he&#39;s THE REALEST NEWS ever. The best way I&#39;ve ever heard it put was a long time ago &quot;be able to chew the meat and spit out the bones&quot; of what he says. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s CIA he&#39;s just going with what works. Obviously I, like most of us I&#39;m pretty sure on this sub, are even ourselves today, because of him. He was one of the first to help spark this &quot;conspiracy&quot; obsession a lot of people on here probably have. </p>

<p>However, I have a bit of my own theory, with no real evidence, but not an unlikely scenario. I think AJ sold out for a while, and became straight BS. But when he saw Trump, he realized &quot;holy shit, I can make a shitload of money, and do what I love at the same time.&quot; Now that there was a real opportunity for him to be himself and have a new large target audience, he took it and hoped for the best. And I think he did it, at least for a bit. Need a little less ads, but I get it. Now he can make bank, while pursuing his real passion, his way. Not somebody else&#39;s. That&#39;s honestly what I believe.</p>
