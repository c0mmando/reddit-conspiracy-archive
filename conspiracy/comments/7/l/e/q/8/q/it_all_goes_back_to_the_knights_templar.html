        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I have a BA in History. It&#39;s my greatest strength and my most temptatious vice. Having knowledge is power. Ask Hitler. </p>

<p>History, before the crusades, is objectively hazy. I mean really, they have <em>done a number on us</em> </p>

<p>I&#39;m not even sure the Julian Calendar has the correct amount of years in place if you know what I mean.</p>

<p>In 1118 when the Knights Templar was founded the knowledge of the Priory of Sion became known outside of that original circle. The idea that Jesus and Mary Magdelene had children is one of the most controversial claims ever made. </p>

<p>The Knights Templar spent 9 years digging in Jerusalem before packing up their bags for France. What did they find? The spear of destiny. Maybe. The holy grail? Likely. A huge, insurmountable amount of gold and silver? Absolutely. </p>

<p>What did they use this money for? </p>

<p>Well, founding the <em>original banks</em> of course. </p>

<p>They lended money to the kings of Europe and controlled the finances of the entire continent. When Phillip IV had them massacred the survivors simply fled to Scotland to found the, you guessed it, Freemasons. </p>

<p>For 400 years they controlled the finances from the shadows until a champion emerged. Adam Weishauppt. Who founded the illuminati, which <em>only actually existed for 8 years</em> yet JayZ is somehow still in it. </p>

<p>*rolls eyes </p>

<p>The fact is there isn&#39;t just one Luciferian cult running the show. There are competitiors. Even within the freemasons themselves. </p>

<p>The illuminati was &quot;destroyed&quot; when their plan to start the French Revolution was found out but a serendipitous Swiss policeman in 1784. </p>

<p>That didn&#39;t stop the event from taking place. </p>

<p>Their goal of creating a world communist government without religions or nation states is still in effect, 233 years later. </p>

<p>The rest is history. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>All roads lead to Rome. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta (modern Knights Templar) and the Jesuits control Free Masonry (and most other secret societies - whether directly or indirectly). </p>

<p>The Templar&#39;s banking HQ is in Switzerland, which is where the true banking power is, controlled by Black Nobility bloodlines, who are ancient Papal and Pharaonic dynasties. They are Swiss, Venetian, and Roman, who use Court &quot;Jews&quot; (ie. Khazars - fake Jews) as front men in banking and other industries, such as the media. This shields them, allowing them to rule in the shadows. This why you know of families like the Rothschild (and some others), and not bloodlines, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Farnese</li>
<li>Borghese</li>
<li>Aldobrandini</li>
<li>Orsini</li>
<li>Medici</li>
<li>Breakspear</li>
<li>Sforza</li>
<li>Barbernini</li>
<li>Conti</li>
<li>Colonna</li>
<li>Este-Welf</li>
<li>Chigi</li>
<li>Somaglia</li>
<li>Gaetani</li>
<li>Pamphili</li>
<li>Schiaratura</li>
</ul>

<p>...and those are just a few &quot;known&quot; ones. You have to do some serious research to find them, which is why most people have never heard of them, as compared to Rothschild, which is basically a household name. Rothschild married into the House of Aldobrandini.</p>

<p>Because people are ignorant. Calling someone crazy is the easiest way to avoid/protect your whole world view from completely shattering. It&#39;s cognitive dissonance. It&#39;s the easiest way to completely dismiss what someone is saying. Simply say: &quot;You&#39;re crazy&quot;, then move on. Existential crisis averted. As the saying goes: &quot;Ignorance is bliss&quot;.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t forget them (thanks for bringing them up, though), that&#39;s why I said: &quot;...and those are just a few &quot;known&quot; ones. &quot;. There are many others, and even more branches off of them (ie. minor and major bloodlines). </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Absolutely, and no worries, they need to be mentioned. But, like most of these royal bloodlines, they inter-marry and hide in plain sight. You&#39;d be surprised.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What do you know about Hitler and the Spear of Destiny? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Eh, I don&#39;t put too much into the &quot;spear of destiny&quot;. I think it&#39;s more of a metaphor (ie. I do not believe the &quot;official&quot; story of Jesus. I think he was most likely Caesarion - for more, look into: Ceasar&#39;s messiah theory). </p>

<p>As for Hitler? <a href="http://www.spirituallysmart.com/nazi.html">I&#39;m pretty convinced he was a pawn of the Jesuits and Rome (ie. Black Nobility).</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think these blood lines really do have some forms of supernatural power over us? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, and no. I believe <em>some</em> of the top bloodlines are trained in the dark occult/esoteric teachings of ancient mystery schools, and some practice possession of lower inter-dimensional beings. </p>

<p>That said, I believe that they take orders from a hidden cabal, of ancients who are survivors of the Great Deluge. These &quot;people&quot; do have ancient &quot;powers&quot;, that are beyond our modern comprehension (ie. think about the pyramids and what/why they were created for and how).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Who gave them this right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implied consent. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you think it goes back as far as Egypt, Babylon and beyond? As many claim. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, as I said above, I think I think the true ruling elite predate the Great Deluge. They are the true hidden cabal, imo.</p>

<p>We all are (we all have a purpose in the physical realm and the Astral realm), but we have no real idea (amnesia, each &quot;experience&quot;), for sure, <em>and maybe that is the point</em>.

A) if they maybe found the holy grail, does that mean it was an actual physical object? 
B) when you say got into a lot of trouble back in the day, do you mean with summonings, rituals, etc. ? I maybe had a similar experience. 
C) been trying to find shit on pre deluge magocrats to no avail, please link me somewhere to read about. 
D) so are the Templars efforts limited to just this planet? If no, can you elaborate just a little on how you think that works? would these pre flood fucks look human? Basically, if say Lorenzo medici imprisoned a demon in his ring or something, how does that relate to aliens? are they one and the same? are they completely separate? I love this stuff

    <div class="md"><p>The Holy Grail is one of the biggest mysteries in the world. If you ask me, it&#39;s symbolic and not a physical object; it is a certain awareness. </p>

<p>The ancient Celtic tradition is where it originated (although there are some mentionings in Babylon that possibly pre-date the celts). Essentially there are 3 parts of human consciousness: The Chalice (the personality or self) The Cauldron (The subconsciousness or mind) and The Holy Grail (the soul). </p>

<p>A human being can at any time be operating under only one of these 3 modes. I think the holy grail is just knowledge of our own divine, magical nature. </p>

<p>As far as the Templars go, no they are limited to Earth no doubt. There are groups of humans who may not be, but the Templars are just footsoldiers or errand boys for a much larger game. </p>

<p>Demons and aliens are intrinsically intertwined. I would say it&#39;s a spectrum. We live in a multiverse, where anything is possible. We&#39;re likely dealing with humans from the past, humans from the future, humans from alternate dimensions, aliens from other star systems, AND demonic entities from lower dimensions; at once. That&#39;s most likely why we are so confused. </p>

<p>Out of curiosity how do you reconcile the difficulties of keeping something secret, yet passed on to the new generation, for so many millennia?  All it would take is one person to break ranks and teach someone else what they know and then it&#39;s public knowledge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Jesuit Superior General controls the Jesuits. The pope owns many sites in Jerusalem, and the Vatican plan for Jerusalem has been to make it an international city owned by the Vatican and policed by NATO. Unfortunately even supposed right wing Israelis are being duped into the Vatican&#39;s plan. Netanyahu for example wanted to give the pope Mt. Zion in 2014. The Roman Catholic Church controlled by the Jesuits is most influential in the USA and Israel. The masons were heavily infiltrated by the Jesuits. See for example how the Jesuits influenced the emporer of Russia to restore the freemasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took Salvia once and it felt like I almost broke through. It was an extremely intense experience. I literally saw the world &quot;unzip&quot; in front of me and ended up in a room of white light, holding the room I was physically sitting in, in my hands. There were beings there who informed me that my psyche or self had split into its constituent parts, and that they all had to &quot;solve&quot; something in order to get to wherever this &quot;core self&quot; was. I also couldn&#39;t help those parts, I was warned that if I tried to aid them in whatever they were solving, I would go insane.</p>

<p>Was pretty intense to say the least.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wish I could tell you. I&#39;m going to go with beings of light, but they were more like humanoid silhouettes and they were sitting around a table. </p>

<p>The strange thing is my roommates tell me I stood up from the couch, took a mug of water off of the coffee table, and then walked towards and stood in front of a Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas poster. I appeared to turn a door knob and open it with the mug, and spilled some water. I then am told I looked at the water and said &quot;creation&quot;. Then I wandered out of the apartment into the hallway and came back to my senses.</p>

<p>But in the trip world, I never really wandered around, and in fact the way it ended was that the room itself started to rumble and collapse, with the floor opening up under me, and me falling back into myself.</p>

<p>It was the most intense mental experience I&#39;ve ever had.</p>

Otherwise this is a great post and thread, thankyou.  I just started looking into this, myself, and got stuck on the swiss connection. I started watching this guy who really really hates those effing Swiss, kind of hidden in plain sight style but not as well put together and super biased. Still interesting.

    <div class="md"><p>How do you think the destruction will play out? It seemingly won&#39;t be a sudden apocalyptic experience like most people think. Will civilization get to space and destroy itself through technology? Or has the matrix lied to us about the nature of space? Does it even exist? Or can we actually go there? </p>

<p>How do the creators or the stewards survive every time? Underground bunkers would eventually be discovered. For example in this cycle you and I are talking about them, we have centuries to find them before tje destruction is complete. </p>

<p>Do you think by destruction it means more devolution? Are we simply rejecting the savior and turning into amoral creatures, slowly eating away at the planet until it kills us? </p>

<p>Falling back into the matrix is all too easy, a little false dichotomy and bam here we are facing the illusion again and blaming the other or denying the credibility of your arguments just because of one little polarizing word. </p>

<p>Anyway, it&#39;s definitely up to debate as communists by and large desire the dictatorship of the proletariat, whereas the two-caste system the elite is preparing for us will be ruled by, well, not the prole.</p>

<p>On an different note, I had a deep, honest talk with an ex-employee and trader for Goldman Sachs and in his drunk talk he revealed something interesting all the while laughing &quot;But these people, they actually LIKE us. Why do you think we&#39;re still alive and multiplying? It&#39;s because they let us do so.

    <div class="md"><p>Well, eternity for sure would be a bit boring without a good story, and what&#39;s a good story without duality M&#39;I&#39;right?</p>

<p>I for one associate quite a few theories together and enjoy playing around with them. I read and reread <a href="http://www.truthcontest.com/">the present</a> where the idea is that it&#39;s impossible not to be, and we &quot;are&quot;, therefore we&#39;ve &quot;been&quot; forever. </p>

<p>We were there way before this life, just saying.
And we mighta messed up some shit some thirteen thousand years ago and have had to deal with the consequences since then, literally &quot;falling&quot; in consciousness and into a state of amnesia, being born, suffering through life, remembering at times the source of all things, our cosmic home, and then dying and starting all over again. Ideas such as original sin and penitence filtered down to our culture through our subconscious minds or something, popping every now and then a renewed prophet or influential person to rekindle that flame that used to be ours before we forgot. But it should soon all be over. We&#39;re going home friends!</p>

<p>Well, tis just a theory xD </p>

<p>I like also seeing life as some form of virtual reality, like a video game, with clues about the name of the game and the rules appearing everywhere in religions, culture, science and in the human experience as a whole. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, we can&#39;t do much but wait and see and tell good stories... </p>

<p>Edit: about original sin, imagine the following thought experiment: what if someone committed the worst crime ever. Like, the murder-rape-holocaust++ deluxe of the universe, the ultimate  and worst thing imaginable. What would be a fit enough punishment for such a crime? </p>

<p>Well I figured that FORGETTING what we did, and then suffering the full measure of the punishment without even remembering what it is we did, is worse than suffering in the knowledge of our crime. We literally suffer, don&#39;t know why and cry our innocence. So following this idea, what we ought to do is attain extreme humility by openly accepting our fault (for something we do not know we did! that&#39;s the catch) and begging for forgiveness all the while accepting the pains and tribulations of this life we live. And that might just be the hardest thing to do. Remember that sense of injustice when you were a kid, and when you were framed for something you honestly didn&#39;t do and no one believed you or something? Well we have to somehow get over it and accept, like a certain Jesus, to suffer for everyone&#39;s sins. </p>

<p>Fun thought experiment it is xD</p>

<p>The cross, the Star of David, the Swastika all transcend time and cultures and when we gaze at them intensely enough we might receive the vibes passed down with them through the ages. 
It&#39;s not even that controversial a topic, look at a word like &quot;terrorism&quot; or &quot;communist&quot;, they immediately inspire something whether good or negative (rarely neutral...) because we&#39;ve been hearing them all our lives in heavily politicized shows, books or media.

Pretty soon they will own everything, and people will rent homes from the banks.  Same with cars.   I suspect this is why they are pushing so hard for self-driving vehicles.   Communism does away with property ownership.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah I mean I&#39;m not a Freemason myself so we can only indulge ourselves in educated guesses. If you read Morals and Dogma, Albert Pike&#39;s manifesto and their bible basically, it will towards the end admit that yes they worship Lucifer above all other deities. </p>

<p>It&#39;s weird though because they out on the cloak of Christianity or sometimes even Islam or Buddhism. They support moral relativism and want the planet to be conformed by one religious order. </p>

<p>The truth is that <em>all the religions are half truths</em> that they themselves tainted and mistranslated purposefully. But they think they did it for the right reasons. </p>

<p>There are darker spiritual forces who control &quot;the matrix&quot; and in the event of us coming into actual physical contact with these demons/aliens/gods they would be <em>the enemy of my enemy is my friend types</em> I think </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is there is no actual evidence for the Freemasons claim that they are directly successors to the Knights Templar whereas we know the Knights of Malta are directly linked with the Knights Hospitaller. </p>

<p>You are quite correct that there are dozens of competing organizations that all essentially serve the same purpose. Many of them go back thousands of years or at least claim to. Throughout history a few bunches of them get a run on top running everything in one sector or another and then get backstabbed by other groups they worked with, deposed and replaced by a few other groups and the cycle continues. </p>

<p>That is what I see happening now. Whoever Trump really represent, which I don’t even think has become apparent yet to its fullest extent, is hijacking the showrunning duties for their piece of the pyramid from the previous group which has been in place on top of the political element of the agenda since JFK was assassinated. </p>

<p>I believe Trump represents either A) an upstart American secret society we don&#39;t know about B) the Jesuits and Israel or C) is actually a folk hero. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The Templars are still in operation.. I&#39;ve been in one of their lodges..like a little Chapel. There was a stained glass window with an image of what looked like a phoenix, an altar, pews either side with ornate carved wooden surrounds. There was also a strange triangular table with three wooden legs with cloven hooves.. Quite odd. There are many, many secret societies. Being a grandmaster Mason is just a basic entry requirement to even allow you to be invited to join some of the higher orders. Freemasonry is the boyscouts of secret societies. To be a Templar you must come from a lineage of Knights and obviously you must be Christian.. It&#39;s a closed club, invitation only.. What they actually do, I don&#39;t know.. I assume they still have some active role in society</p>
