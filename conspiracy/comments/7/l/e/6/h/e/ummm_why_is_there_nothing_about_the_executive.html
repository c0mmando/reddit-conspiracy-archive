       In all fairness, I know why rule 10 exist. Without it, "shill" would be thrown all over the comment sections of r/conspiracy.   But let's call it what it is this time.  Shills (and that includes paid off mods) run those subs and this cancer is spreading all over reddit.

       Yes, and the little darlings look into your post history and if they find out you are not the right flavor, they restrict your ability to post more than every ten minutes....when you ask about it, they give you some line about not having enough Karma or enough posts, or enough time online, or the right

       This is automated, and can be due to downvoting or anti-flooding measures. Have seen people on subs of all flavours say it is happening to them and its always been due to downvoting. It happened to me when I posted too many short comments within a very short space of time, on a general subreddit.

       I'm a mod. This isn't possible with the mod tools currently available. It's a spam prevention feature built into reddit that only applies to people who are new to the subreddit. They were telling you the truth. If they want to keep you from posting, they will ban you.
      </p>

       Don't believe me? Make a test subreddit and look for yourself. Anyone can make one.

       Who is pursuing justice? Who issued the order? Who comes out looking good from this situation? That's how those people turn it into a partisan issue. If trump did a good thing, then it's "pro trump propaganda" and goes in the downvote bin. If trump did a bad thing, (or something that can be spun as bad) then it's "LOOK WHAT HE DID!" And goes into the upvote folder.

       45 is signing a nearly exact copy of an EO by 44. This really isn't OMG IS IT HAPPENING news.
      </p>
      <p>
       I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations, such as those listed in the Annex to this order, have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems.  Such organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic markets.  These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous persons.  I therefore determine that significant transnational criminal organizations constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.

       Okay so lets say the boots are gps trackers. Why hide this from the public? Hillary is out doing speeches in Canada. Surely they wouldn't let her out of the USA if they were seriously going after her. Look what Trump said in his acceptance speech. He's a liar.

       Those were crowd chants. Plus why wouldn't he thank his opponent in his acceptance speech?

       Trump said he was going to get his AG to do a special investigation on Hillary. All Trump can do is pressure Sessions, because it's impeachable if he gets caught telling Sessions to investigate her

       The great irony is that the Fortune 500 designed the high corporate tax rate of 40% precisely to drive business away from the US, in an attempt to homogenize the great American middle class with the rest of the 3rd world. To create two classes: an elite ultra-rich, and a permanent class of poor with no social mobility.

       It's go glaringly obvious to anyone who bothers to actually look. What is Trump's business? Casinos, luxury hotels and luxury resorts. His entire wealth is built on serving the needs of the ultra rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Every weekend he goes golfing with his buddies at his resort which costs $400,000 to sign up to and tens of thousands in yearly membership fees. Now I don't know about you, but people who can afford to drop half a million on golfing are generally not the people with the working class's best interests in mind.

       Off the top of my head:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Putting Betsy DeVos in charge of public education, she is almost certainly going to make public education worse, ruining one of the primary methods for upward economic mobility.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Passing a tax cut that disproportionately benefits the rich, the top 1% pay around 40% of the country's taxes, but they are expected to get 60+% of the tax cuts that will add $1.5T to the deficit. They are cutting up the pie everyone bought and giving the richest more than they paid for.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          During the senate vote on the tax bill Bernie Sanders proposed an amendment that would require a super-majority to make cuts to welfare and healthcare spending. This was struck down by the Senate Republicans, clearly telegraphing the next stage of their plan. Any money the working class get from the tax cut is likely going to be cancelled out by reduced welfare subsidies and increased healthcare costs in the near future.
         </li>
         <li>
          They tried to pass new policies that treat tuition wavers as income, which would result in PhD becoming completely affordable for anyone in the middle class. Once again trying to kill upward mobility.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Cutting regulations left and right, a lot of these just hurt the environment, but some hurt workers.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Around 4 million people lost overtime because of Trump.
         </li>
         <li>
          A lot of miners and other workers in hazardous environments are going to be working in less safe conditions because of cut regulations.
         </li>
        </ul>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gutting healthcare, during his campaign he promised in the first 100 days to repeal and replace the ACA with something cheaper and better. Instead his party proposed some awful plan so everyone "has the right to buy healthcare". They switched gear to try and "repeal and replace later", meaning let tens of millions of working class Americans lose healthcare for an unspecified amount of time.
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          Let's not forget that Republicans have tried to repeal ACA over 60 times, they played political chicken with Obama knowing he would veto their craptastic plans. Now that they have to power to enact any of their 60 or so plans apparently not a single one of them are any good. So I wouldn't hold my breathe to see if any of the next 60 are any good.
         </li>
         <li>
          As we speak they are continuously cutting subsidies that the ACA relies on, hoping to get it to "implode". This has real consequences on the working class, whose coverage is going down while their premiums are going up. The government is the working class for a political game.

      </p>

       Trump wanted taxes done before healthcare so companies/families would have more money and HC would be easier to sort out.  But blame him for congress' fuck up.
      </p>
      <p>
       The ACA was imploding before Trump set foot in the WH.  It was written by health insurers for health insurers, and even
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       aren't happy with it.  Btw, where's your bitching about "keep your doctor/plan" and premiums skyrocketing?  Somehow those are Trump's fault too?

       estimated by 2027 would see 62.1% of the tax savings go to the top 1%. The amended plan that Trump signed off on
       <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/full">

       Try doing some research and stop taking your talking points from the mainstream media.  Many of the "rich" will pay more because of deduction limits, and EVERY bracket is going down.  Yes, that means the working class.

       I totally agree with you.  Listen to every news report or debate point from the media concerning the tax breaks.  All the opposition (meaning Democrats) say the same thing.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Average household gets a $1500 tax break, but the top 1%, they're getting a (insert some trillion dollar amount here)!  It's outrageous!
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       There's two tricks they are using here to mislead the sheeples.  First, they state middle class tax reductions per household while lumping the high income people in to one groups.  People hear $1500 vs $1.5 trillion and they're like, whoa, that's not fair.
      </p>
      <p>
       The second trick is that 1% tax reduction from high earners are far larger in actual dollar amounts as compared to a 4% tax break on the lower-mid income group.  If you make $1 million a year, 1% tax reduction means $10,000 less taxes you have to pay.  But if you make $50,000, 4% tax break only gets you $2,000 tax reduction.  Even tho the middle/lower class are getting a  bigger break in tax rates, when you compare absolute amounts, the upper class will get bigger amounts of tax relief.   They completely ignore the fact that, percentage wise, the middle class gets more cuts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/tax-brackets-trump-tax-plan-chart-2017-9">

       </a>
       Here were the proposed rates by house and senate.  The final version is also linked in the article.
      </p>
      <p>
       And all this is before you consider how increased standard deductions affect middle class families 100x more than top earners.  To top earners, standard deduction means very little.  Their mortgage deductions being taken away, however, is a big freaking deal.

       No, and anyone young wouldn't understand unless they saw earlier periods: the government passes laws like this all the time but in reality all it does is affect normal citizens. The government thugs do this so THEY can have a monopoly on that action.
      </p>

       As of 6 hours ago Trump just posted an executive order that prevents US assets from leaving the country, new immigrants from applying, and a banming trade between any United States citizen and long list of companies and people.

       No, and anyone young wouldn't understand unless they saw earlier periods: the government passes laws like this all the time but in reality all it does is affect normal citizens. The government thugs do this so THEY can have a monopoly on that action.

       Think about it - there's laws against laundering, yet HSBC has been caught doing it multiple times and nothing happened to anyone besides a week's worth of income as a fine.

       I guess I just mean that it's not controversial. It's pretty clear who wouldn't want this to have happened. I don't like Trump very much, but this is something I can get behind (as of right now; maybe there are unintended consequences that I'm not seeing).

       No wonder you cant mentally absorb any of this. For you to truly comprehend this you would have to come to terms with the fact that Trump is going to go down as the greatest president in history, and you are going to go down as a traitor who attempted to put criminals in power.

       That's a hell of a broad definition though.. one that screams 'anyone who we say'. Plus I noticed this tidbit:
      </p>
      <p>
       "..because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to this order."
      </p>
      <p>
       It would be great to think this is focused on criminal government elements (Hillary &amp; the gang for instance) but I'm not sure I trust people like Sessions. Very interesting &amp; pretty troubling until we see some of the people they are actually targeting with this.

       Let me be explicit.  You asked a question, so I will answer it.  Sometimes people make posts like yours that are really meant to suggest "mods are suppressing information!" or "everyone else is asleep, look at how woke I/we are!" but I take your post on good faith, so here's a quick explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
       There are a lot of people in the world taking a lot of actions, and if we were flooded with a torrent of all of the actions, both important and unimportant we'd be unable to process any information.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trump has signed
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_executive_actions_by_Donald_Trump#Executive_orders">
        <del>
         35
        </del>
       </a>
       36 executive orders, 11 determinations, 114 proclimations, 22 notices, 7 national security memoranda and 1 sequestration order.  Regardless of their content, each one of these
       <em>
        can't
       </em>
       be on the front page of
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       .  There's simply no space, it'd suck the air out of other, potentially more important matters.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now, this order was signed today.  It's an order directly affecting only a handful of people, and who those people are isn't even immediately apparent as you need to reference the Annex.  Also, the wider effects of the order are unknown until legal experts have been made aware and consulted, and subsequent news stories written.  This takes time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at the "mission statements" for
       <a href="/r/news">
        /r/news
       </a>
       and
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       , and take a look at the front pages.  In the grandest schemes of things, is a link to an executive order really so much more newsworthy to the common person than the stories posted? In addition, would the common person even care? It's honestly very much like linking to the full text of the tax bill; there's just not a whole lot of valuable insight the common reader can glean.
      </p>
      <p>
       Current events are fluid and the biggest stories are determined by the attention they receive, not necessarily their actual impact to the world.  The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was, at the time, likely a curious side piece, if anything, in any U.S.-based newspaper until the full extent of the effects, socially and geopolitically, could be sussed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       In other words, it's not on those subreddits because people are paying attention to other, arguably just as equally important pieces of news.  If you think this should be rectified, wait for or find a well-researched article on the subject, submit it and discuss it there.  As other commenters have pointed out, it was submitted but there wasn't much interest in the full text of the most recent of 36 executive orders.

       It's not very complex.  The narrative is Trump and anyone he is associated with is an evil shitstain that colluded with Russians and he must be impeached now and everyone on his team tried for treason.  It is impossible for him to do good so if he does something that appears to be good it must actually be bad.  Anything posted that suggests otherwise will get buried there.

       Meanwhile banks and other massive corporations get billions. Sounds like something to celebrate, eh? Why not cut personal taxes for the middle class? Allow some upward mobility instead of legislating deals for the wealthy? With well sourced evidence that an overwhelming majority of americans have no savings or retirement, why give the bounty to corporations who are already reaping their largest profits ever?

       Don't put words in my mouth. I don't "hate tax cuts".
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporations are already well off, and are in their best financial position literally ever. They have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders, not to their employees. This results in stock buy backs, not "hey we have all this money, let's hire people we don't need".
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, its a shortsighted approach, because these rates would be reasonable if necessary for a stimulus. When the market crashes in 3 months, 6 months, a year - what sort of taxation based stimulus will the fed be able to do? There's no room to maneuver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last, as i've said several times, why would you want the super wealthy corporations who hold monopolies over everything to get more money, rather than the people? For one, there's more velocity when middle class or poor get a cut. How many threads do we have a month about "working all day just to scrape by, its by design" and then we turn around and support a tax cut which doles out the lion's share to the super wealthy?

       Stock buy backs have been caused by record low interest rates, and the massive fed cash injections into the market which have distorted every aspect of the financial system. The QE unwind and rate rises will be interesting to say the least, if they can actually pull it off. Personally I'm skeptical. We are following in the same path as Japan which is technically bust with their 200+ % debt to gdp ratio.

       ok fair enough, but with that much cash on hand (I mean pfizer is getting an expected 39 BILLION cut) why not buy back?

      <p>
       What if the middle class got 39 billion? And then took Apple's 47 billion, and funded CHIP + expanded medicare?

       There is nothing wrong with stock buy backs per se. But what has actually been happening is companies have been borrowing the money (because rates have been so low) to do it. Really like a snake eating its own tail.

       Sorry, I don't mean to conflate stock buy backs with something inappropriate. My primary argument is:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        Corporations don't need a tax cut right now, they are already making obscene all-time high profits
       </li>
       <li>
        Cutting corp tax rate during a boom leaves no room to maneuver during a bust
       </li>
       <li>
        Trading billions to large corps with no revenue, literally just putting a tax cut on a credit card is dumb
       </li>
       <li>
        A tax cut for middle class would impact more people and have a stronger impact on the economy (not the market)
       </li>
       <li>
        Putting so much on the federal credit card intentionally makes it more difficult to pass chip, expand medicare, and other social programs for the needy
       </li>
       <li>
        The whole "passing a tax bill with amendments that intentionally benefit senators and the president" thing is really gross
       </li>
       <li>
        I'd fully support a much smaller (in terms of cost) but larger (in terms of middle class impact) tax cut, and specifically designed to impact small businesses of 50ee's or less. THAT would create jobs and impact those who need it most

       Because the benefit is clear. You just seem to be desperately spamming talking points to try and persuade me that omg reducing tax is bad, including the ridiculous one that senators and the president rewrote the entire tax system to just benefit themselves. That is a special kind of craziness. Reducing tax may be bad for the deficit, but it's good for everyone else. Potentially it could even be good for the deficit if the economy grows as a result.

       When you erode trust it takes time to rebuild that trust.  Trump has taken trust out back and worked it over with a baseball bat.   Forgiven is anyone who doesn’t immediately look at the first executive order that Trump has signed, that doesn’t directly benefit him, his family, or associates, as gift from god or a sign Trump has turned over a new leaf.

       i love that word "narrative". we need to repeat it early and often. i actually learned the word narrative by listening to sean hannity, dont recall if he was talking about developing his own narrative or if he was complaining about the left developing their own narrative. in any case, the word caught my attention, because of the implications by context. i remember it was one of those "ah ha!" moments in life, like "oh thats what you are doing sean hannity... controlling the narrative..."

       I said arguably precisely because what they care about is different than what you care about, and since it's subjective there's no right answer as to what should be in front of everyone's eyes.  I think income inequality and anti-intellectual and deceptive propaganda are our biggest concerns in society today, but does that mean sexual harassment and #MeToo should take a backseat just because I think it should*? Hell no.  We vote with our attention.

       Have an upvote.  Cannot find any part of that statement I disagree with.  Well said.

       I just had to say something because a lot of the hot topics in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       are not even close to what I would consider important.  But like you said what is important is subjective.

       I agree,

        /r/politics

       is almost hilariously off-topic to the things that I truly care about as well.  But that's why I frustratingly can't help but spend my time wading through the comments on many subs, correcting misunderstandings, trying to socratically spur learning and trying to be more informed myself*.

       We have to have honest, in-depth discussions so we can all decide what the most important issues to tackle are.
      </p>
      <p>
       On a side note, that's why disinformation campaigns are so insidious... it interrupts that natural process of people coming together to decide what's important, and prolongs the agony of structural societal issues.

       As a person who is a real live CPA and deals with the intricacies of the code on a daily basis, the entire MSM appears to lack a basic understanding of taxes.  CNN is telling me I will owe money basedo n changes while my own calculation (using expensive industry software of course) indicates my tax liability will decrease by close to $2,000 unless I strike it rich somehow.

       Jesus. This thread is a perfect example of why we’re not taken seriously.

       Debating if trump is an elite? He is a massive Hillary donor and billionaire. He is the definition of elite. Can’t get to the office if your not. And you know billionaire. Jesus

      <p>
       People seeing there posting ability is being slowed and then they’re spawning a theory about mods who look at every users post history and if they disagree with the ideology then they limit your ability to share the truuuuuthhhhh. Fucking nothing to do with the algo reddit has used forever limiting low scoring commenters and those heavily downvoted recently. It’s literally troll prevention measure....glad to see it’s working against idiots.

       The fuck is there is no way two people in their 70’s have a leg injury. There is noooooo way that could ever happen. They must be hiding gps trackers! Even tho congressional charges are public and they could jut not fucking cover it with a boot and then go on tv over and over.

       In 30 messages I’ve read the most uneducated and without even brief forthought ,statements said as fact and saw then people accepting that bullshit with no evidence or independent research. YOUR SUPPOSED TO BE CRITICAL THIBKERS AND MAINTAIN OBJECTIVITY AND SCEPTASISM NOT BLINDLY ACCEPT BULLSHIT SPEWED FROM HUMAN YAK-baks stuck of retard mode.
      </p>
      <p>
       God I’m embarassed to call myself a conspiracy theorist because of this shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your successfully being a hypocrite while illustrating why you voted for trump (os see see he is a shillary fag) no you fuck wad. You bring trump into everything, my responding to it in a manner different than yours is not indicative of my political leaning. In fact if it happens a lot to you your trump boner is to hard and you can’t- not bring him up all the time so compensated for that deep little feeling you have that he is doing terribly. But you can’t be wrong. Owe no.

       Is there anyway to look up if the 10 minute ban between posts is something that is widespread in reddit or just one sub?  I have only ever experience the 10 minute penalty in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics
       </a>
       and I have posted in other anti-right, anti-trump, anti-conservative subs and never experienced it anywhere else.  It may be because there isn't such a concentrated effort to downvote like there is in
       <a href="/r/politics">
        /r/politics

       though.  Can't say for sure.

       This EO could very easily be spun as fascist and dictatorial. It is interesting it isn't covered widely in the news. I mean, Trump declared a national emergency. I don't think r/politics is interested because the only available news articles are pretty bland and don't appeal to the subs current culture. Highly editorialized or bombastic news that inflates their own positions or mocks Trump are the only items that will get many upvotes. It's a shame that a political faction assumed defacto control of a supposedly neutral politics sub. There is also so much paid influence and interference that attempting to talk outside of certain narratives is not really possible.
      </p>
      <p>
       As others have said, there has been many EO of Trump that have not really been covered. It just takes one brave journalist to spin it into something scandalous for it to get any traction.

       I don't disagree necessarily. But imo it's more of an entire Reddit problem about editorialized headlines than just that sub. Hell the blatently false ones that get upvoted on this sub show that.

       That's true - it is pretty common on most of Reddit. I think why most people love to centre r/politics out is because of the elitist attitude the sub seems to convey. The sub presents itself in a way that is unrepresentative of how it actually is. I know others will point out r/the_donald, but it can't really be held to the same standard because the sub never claimed to be anything but a sub for Trump supporters.

       I agree 100%.  I'm a small govt advocate though I can often be hypocritical about that.  But this to me is easily spun as dictatorial because it is.  It's EXTREMELY odd this is not all over r/politics - makes me wonder.

       has completely degenerated. I don't even dare question the herd because it's so obnoxious and tedious. Now they're in this sub attacking anything questioning government officials. The votes and comments are manipulated, there is a blacklist for news sources, shills, bots, etc. People believe they are still having intelligent discourse without any real understanding of how their "opponents" think.

       Nobody is talking about the Alphabet (Google parent company) CEO resignation?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's kind of weird. In 2015, Google's last CEO stepped down. In 2017 Alphabet's CEO resigns. Is this common, especially when it comes to such massive corporations? Seems odd that someone would give up such a powerful position so quickly.

       I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the activities of significant transnational criminal organizations, such as those listed in the Annex to this order, have reached such scope and gravity that they threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. Such organizations are becoming increasingly sophisticated and dangerous to the United States; they are increasingly entrenched in the operations of foreign governments and the international financial system, thereby weakening democratic institutions, degrading the rule of law, and undermining economic markets. These organizations facilitate and aggravate violent civil conflicts and increasingly facilitate the activities of other dangerous persons. I therefore determine that significant transnational criminal organizations constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, and hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat."

       That's the lie that has been fed to you by "progressives".

       The great irony is that the Fortune 500 designed the high corporate tax rate of 40% precisely to drive business away from the US, in an attempt to homogenize the great American middle class with the rest of the 3rd world. To create two classes: an elite ultra-rich, and a permanent class of poor with no social mobility.

       There is not one, all-encompassing "elite". There might actually be a group working for humanity in the upper echelons.

       Don't put words in my mouth. I don't "hate tax cuts".
      </p>
      <p>
       Corporations are already well off, and are in their best financial position literally ever. They have a fiduciary responsibility to their shareholders, not to their employees. This results in stock buy backs, not "hey we have all this money, let's hire people we don't need".
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, its a shortsighted approach, because these rates would be reasonable if necessary for a stimulus. When the market crashes in 3 months, 6 months, a year - what sort of taxation based stimulus will the fed be able to do? There's no room to maneuver.
      </p>
      <p>
       Last, as i've said several times, why would you want the super wealthy corporations who hold monopolies over everything to get more money, rather than the people? For one, there's more velocity when middle class or poor get a cut. How many threads do we have a month about "working all day just to scrape by, its by design" and then we turn around and support a tax cut which doles out the lion's share to the super wealthy?

       There is nothing wrong with stock buy backs per se. But what has actually been happening is companies have been borrowing the money (because rates have been so low) to do it. Really like a snake eating its own tail.
