    <div class="md"><p>1) They tell us for decades there&#39;s nothing to UFOs it&#39;s all made up or swamp gas or whatever.  </p>

<p>2) The Dept of Defense then comes out and says, &quot;Not only are UFOs real, we&#39;ve been studying them. Oh yeah and here&#39;s some official videos captured by our F-16 jets.&quot;  </p>

<p>Analysis of the videos is quite interesting because:<br/>
1) The UFO is flying up wind   </p>

<p>2) The pilot says &quot;Look there&#39;s a whole fleet of them&quot;  </p>

<p>3) It&#39;s an infrared camera but you can&#39;t see any exhaust jets nor can you see any downwash from a helicopter rotor.  So how is it getting thrust?  Don&#39;t know.  </p>

<p>4) It&#39;s starts to rotate then stops, then rotates some more all while &quot;flying&quot;.  I put flying in quotes because of the next point.  </p>

<p>5) There are no visible flight surfaces, like wings, to give it lift.  But it&#39;s at 25,000 feet up so how is it maintaining altitude.  </p>

<p>6) Back to the rotation, this is not something we see any known aircraft on planet earth do.  They (the DOD) know the inventory of every government on earth and this doesn&#39;t match any of them.  They never come out and say it&#39;s aliens or an ET craft but one has to wonder where it fucking comes from.  </p>

<p>7) It speeds up and slows down in ways that you can&#39;t really see on the vids but there have been engineers studying the video and they say that it stops so quickly that it&#39;s equivalent to something like a 280g stop, then starts up again with the same level of g force and seems unaffected by it.  </p>

<p>NOW if that isn&#39;t enough....</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t some whistleblower where no officials will confirm what&#39;s being said.  No this is an official Department of Defense release directly to main stream media, with video, names of the pilots and chain of custody records for the films (so everyone else in the govt can double check if it&#39;s possibly hoaxed) AND you have a Senator Harry Reid confirming that he was involved in getting this funded.  ALL of that shit....has never happened before.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more video because these clips were tied to in incident that was recorded over many hours (IIRC it was like 4 hours or something), by many pilots and the aircraft carrier Nimitz.  There are reports that the craft was hovering then shot up to 25,000 feet then came back down to within 18&quot; of the ocean and just hovered again....and it did all that in a matter of seconds.  Nothing we know of does that.</p>

<p>Oh and there&#39;s the cryptic reference to some material that they don&#39;t know what it is, being housed in some warehouse that was converted to study it.  But that&#39;s all it says.....so no one knows what the fuck that&#39;s all about, where it came from, what it can do or any of that.</p>

<p>Tom DeLonge has said that this first dump was simply one of 20 that will be coming very soon.  </p>

<p>Exciting times</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why? From what I know, they could easily wipe us out. Beyond that, we’re a very recent species, the earth has been very susceptible at certain points in time, why not take over then? Additionally, I’ve heard they are more prone to inspecting nukes than arming them. </p>

<p>Plus, there’s a lot of talk about the possibility of nuclear explosions in Mars’ past. I’ll copy a comment I made from a previous post: </p>

<p><a href="http://spsr.utsi.edu/articles/EvidenceforaLargeAnomalousNuclearExplosionsinMarsPast.pdf">Nuclear Explosions in Mars’ Past</a></p>

<p>Imagine, for a moment, a different timeline of the solar system. </p>

<p>In the timeline I propose, life developed on mars, became intelligent like us, and outgrew their planet. They terraformed earth and used it as an away point. But then things went wrong - the home planet destroyed in automated nuclear war. The only remaining of their species survived on earth, in the mantle and in the sky. </p>

<p>Aliens didn&#39;t know we existed until we made it known by doing two things. One being Hitlers inauguration of the olympics(see the movie &quot;Contact&quot; for concept) being the first radio broadcast to be strong enough to escape our solar system(the heliosphere would prevent weak signals). But also the crazy amount of nukes tested during 50&#39;s-80&#39;s, giving off alarms on various sensors &quot;they&quot; have in space which then helped them triangulate which star system to look in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s true, I don&#39;t put much weight on ancient aliens hypothesis. Most of the stuff can be explained by other stuff, and there&#39;s to much blanks in prehistory to draw any solid conclusions about it. </p>

<p>I mean, we&#39;ve managed to build some pretty amazing mega-structures, like WTC towers, Space needle, etc, requiring much more know how then the pyramids, which lets be honest, a pyramid is a pretty basic design. The only thing that would point to ancient aliens would be getting the building blocks up as you build, but I&#39;ve seen some pretty convincing explanations to how you could do it with their tech level. Can&#39;t comment the Mayan stuff though. </p>

<p>But I&#39;ve got people in my family that has had experiences, and far to many whistle blowers to discount modern day visitors. That said though, I&#39;m not thoroughly convinced in alien visitors either, may just be the government making smoke to cover another fire. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Totally on board with it being a mystery which we have no definite answer.

<p>Don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to say with the wikipedia article, as it claims that the geographical center is just made up and Giza chosen because of the landmark, it doesn&#39;t seem to claim Egyptians built it there for that reason?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Yeah but what exactly is the &quot;geographical center&quot;? From what I can tell it&#39;s just a symbolic place calculated in the 1800&#39;s to make coordinates make sense, so they might as well have put it somewhere in China, or further west in North Africa. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Right. I like this better than it being Aliens. But we&#39;ve gotta talk about how advanced they&#39;d be. I&#39;ve heard some say that most of the early history we used to assume was the same kingdom actually belongs to another ancient kingdom which the Egyptians either conquered or just grew out of after it collapsed. And with all the technology that disappeared and were forgotten after the Romans collapsed, it&#39;s not an out there thought that they were sufficiently more advanced to build something which the later Egyptians would marvel at. </p>

<p>They don&#39;t even have to come close to our level of tech to be able to build something like the pyramids. Which again, is a pretty simple design for a big building. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Also, you are mistaken regarding “the simple design”. It has corridors and rooms. All of it is built with millimeter precision. Here is one of my previous comments about this; and I’ll thud conclude my contribution to this thread (I suggest you look into it if you’re genuinely interested).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most obvious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-place_artifact">out-of-place artifact</a> is literally in plain sight. I mean the Great Pyramid of Kheops at Giza. We could not practically build it today.</p>

<p>Naysayers may like to imagine it would be an easy achievement - because humans built the Suez canal, the Gothard base tunnel, and excavated lots of dirt to do so, or because we build skyscrapers to good precision. I think that&#39;s very typical of the 21st-century arrogance afflicting so many of the armchair academics/experts (in actuality people educated beyond their intelligence, that&#39;s what the socialisation of higher education does). </p>

<p>(Btw modern luminaries also think one can create wealth by creating money, that aluminum planes may pulverize steel buildings, that wars are good for the economy, that a man who says is a woman becomes one by definition, etc.)</p>

<p>Our ancestors weren&#39;t so arrogant. They realized the great pyramid to be truly amazing and mysterious. And please don&#39;t forget they built the gothic cathedrals (another mystery for another day). </p>

<p>Our civilization is at peak-hubris.</p>

<p>The truth is, even with modern apparatus, it would be extremely difficult (practically impossible) to build (in stone) something as big and precise as the great pyramid. </p>

<p>The passages inside the pyramid are all extremely straight and precise, such that the longest of them, referred to as the descending passage, which is 350&#39; 0.25&quot; long deviates from being truly straight by less than 0.25 inches, while one of the shorter passages with a length of just over 150 feet deviates from being truly straight by a mere 0.020 inches. This goes beyond the precision of modern skyscrapers. The fact is The Great Pyramid is the most accurately aligned structure in existence today (and faces true north with only 3/60th of a degree of error).</p>

<p>Perhaps with infinite money, and lots of time, and perfect organization, there is no technical hurdle that couldn&#39;t be theoretically overcome. That is, until the problem becomes building it at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographical_centre_of_Earth">exact center</a> of Earth&#39;s emerged landmass (I forgot Egyptians had observation satellites) AND so it lasts 5000 years (if it&#39;s not older).</p>

<p>That last part is the part you should keep in mind. The capacity of ancient Egyptian pyramids, temples, tombs, obelisks, collossi, mummies, frescoes and inscriptions to withstand the passage of time is utterly mysterious. As for the great pyramid, it has resisted erosion, earthquakes, hurricanes and tornadoes over the millenia. None of our modern architectural achievments could even come close.</p>

<p>TLDR: a dishonest contractor might tell you &quot;yes for a couple of billion dollars I could replicate the great pyramid&quot;. The end-result would be a project that ran over budget, over time, and that wouldn&#39;t come close to the sustainability, precision and hermetic beauty of the original edifice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue with all this though is that we have no way of telling how long it took to build or its budget. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a mason and it&#39;s not difficult to get extremely aligned walls etc, it&#39;s a piece of cake if youve got the time. </p>

<p>It having corridors and rooms is also not making it more complex, load-bearing walls are easy to plan and distribution of weight is not hard. The Pyramid is a simple design, but the craftsmanship is top notch(as evident in it still standing). </p>

<p>Still not convinced the &quot;center of the earth&quot; thing has ahnhhy meaning as it&#39;s a 1800&#39;s concept with an arbitrary mid point which could&#39;ve been put anywhere as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>I don’t have a religious background, but I’ve always considered the notion that Humans are in God’s image to be very compelling. For example, dolphins are quite smart, and studies have shown they can even do basic math. But you can’t really start a society without hands. </p>

<p>I also think that form directly follows function in nature, so that if an alien were to have a similar function to humans (society, Engineering, art) it must also probably have a similar form - in the “image of God”. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It is scary but only because it&#39;s natural to fear what we don&#39;t understand.</p>

<p>Tom DeLonge&#39;s story is quite interesting.  He&#39;s been studying UFOs all his life and through a series of events he became connected to people in the government where he pitched an idea to them and they seemed to like it.</p>

<p>I thought it was all a bunch of BS.  Washed up rock start just looking for his next gig....until the WikiLeaks Podesta email release and he was actually communicating with Obama&#39;s <del>then Chief of Staff.</del> CORRECTION Advisor  HOLY SHIT - now say what you will about Podesta and the charges of pedophilia that people are leveling against him....it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the <del>White House Chief of Staff</del> CORRECTION Advisor to the President is an incredibly plugged in person and here was proof that Tom was in communication with him.  </p>

<p>From then on, I knew something was up but had my doubts along the way, for sure.  I still do.</p>

<p>But here&#39;s the thing, nothing in my original write up is Tom DeLonge reporting.  This is official DOD release and it happens to coincide with those working directly with Tom now.</p>

<p>His story is interesting and there have been a lot of reporting on it.  There&#39;s some vids on YT and this <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/inside-tom-delonges-ufo-obsession-blink-182-turmoil-20160427">Rolling Stone piece</a> which help shed more light on how it all went down for him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Slight corrections:</p>

<p>1) The object was originally detected by a cruiser over a period of several hours.  They couldn&#39;t identify it and contacted planes from the Nimitz which was conducting routine training nearby.</p>

<p>2) Supposedly the object was hovering over the water causing quite a churn in the water before flying further.</p>

<p>3) The planes involved were F/A 18 SuperHornets from the Nimitz.  Cruiser asked if they were armed and they said only with non-firing dummy missles [which I think are used to simulate the weight factor of real missiles for keeping flight profiles the same as combat].</p>

<p>Other than that, good summary.  The video is pretty curious, and the fact that it&#39;s all bonafide FLIR imagery makes it more real to me.</p>

<p>My possible explanations in no specific order:</p>

<p>1) Actual aliens</p>

<p>2) Super-secret off the books experimental craft flown deliberately near US coastal Navy training to see if could get detected.  &quot;They&quot; knew Navy wouldn&#39;t immediately blow away something with real weapons close to the US and in a area where training was being done.  I think the fact that this was seen near the US coast and within reasonable flight range of Groom Lake, JPL, Edwards AFB and other places where experimental aircraft come from is kind of telling.</p>

<p>Whatever the explanation, it&#39;s quite compelling and supposedly it&#39;s only the start of what&#39;s to come.</p>

<p>I&#39;m super excited by this because I&#39;ve had so many questions by friends and family about it.

<p>1) guy says its going against the wind, the wind is 120 knots to the west.  That would be a Category 4 hurricane.   If he really meant its travelling at 120 knots airspeed, thats slower than a cessna 172.</p>

<p>2) guy says &quot;its a !! drone bro&quot;, and in fact it does look like a drone.
It looks exactly like a MKV built by Lockeed.  So it is not actually doing anything that would be surprising with today&#39;s tech.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great love the skepticism and I think everyone should analyze it critically and continue to ask questions.</p>

<p>RE: #1 - I&#39;m not entirely sure what your point is because it can be interpreted many ways.  </p>

<p>If you&#39;re suggesting that it&#39;s unlikely the winds were blowing that hard then I would say that the Jet Stream winds are often above 100 knots and they were traveling at 25,000 ft.  Not sure if they were in the JS or not but it seems quite possible.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re suggesting that it&#39;s unlikely for any aircraft to buck that wind then I actually agree.  That&#39;s pretty amazing but that only deepens the mysteries.</p>

<p>2) The guy saying &quot;It&#39;s a drone bro&quot; is easily just a first reaction.  It doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s the truth - it&#39;s simply a natural human reaction that we all make.  Whenever we see something and it doesn&#39;t immediately register in our brains, we start to search for possible explanations as to what it could be.  So him calling it a drone seems very natural to me.</p>

<p>However keep in mind that right after that the other pilot says &quot;There&#39;s a whole fleet of them&quot; and instructs him to check the radar.  He does and says &quot;whoa&quot;.  </p>

<p>You mention an MKV drone.  If you&#39;re talking about something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kfvRDn1uVI">this</a> then that&#39;s easily rebutted by pointing out that you&#39;re seeing an Infrared targeting camera video which will show changes in heat....yet there is no visible downwash or exhaust plumes.</p>

<p>Is it possible it&#39;s a drone?  YES but it&#39;s a drone that doesn&#39;t match anything in any government&#39;s known inventory so the next questions are:  Where did it come from and who&#39;s piloting it and how does it get it lift and how does it perform 280g accelerations and decelerations seemingly without damaging the pilot or the aircraft....and so many more.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Under Mr. Bigelow’s direction, the company modified buildings in Las Vegas for the storage of metal alloys and other materials that Mr. Elizondo and program contractors said had been recovered from unidentified aerial phenomena. Researchers also studied people who said they had experienced physical effects from encounters with the objects and examined them for any physiological changes. In addition, researchers spoke to military service members who had reported sightings of strange aircraft.</p>

<p>“We’re sort of in the position of what would happen if you gave Leonardo da Vinci a garage-door opener,” said Harold E. Puthoff, an engineer who has conducted research on extrasensory perception for the C.I.A. and later worked as a contractor for the program. “First of all, he’d try to figure out what is this plastic stuff. He wouldn’t know anything about the electromagnetic signals involved or its function.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And 2 days before the NY Times article drops you have <a href="https://twitter.com/tomdelonge/status/941410192486424577">this tweet from Tom DeLonge</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>what do you get when you zap a layered piece of Bismuth and Magnesium with Terahertz energy? The dissolution of mass. Or, at least the effect of which. We are working on an experiment for you all. #KindOfLikeAntiGravity.</p>

<p>They say they have UFO metal and have no clue what it is or what it does.</p>

<p>Who knows though, there’s always reason for releasing shit and I’m betting on it’s so we don’t revolt when high tech the elites have been hoarding for over half a century is eventually released.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Short version:</p>

<p>For 70+ years the US government has had a firm stance of denial on the existence of the UFO phenomenon and that stance finally changed as of last Saturday. I never thought I&#39;d see the day, but it actually happened.</p>

<p>As for why its not being treated as a big deal, well that&#39;s more complicated.</p>

<p>Basically, I think your looking at a very carefully planned disclosure that will keep the powers that be still in control of the information, technologies and the discussions while also keeping them out of trouble and furthering their agendas.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m fairly convinced that most alien-like UFO sightings are early drone tests, being tested either by governments or military units or whatever. Drones perfectly explain a lot of the unfamiliar movements of the craft. Calculations of speed and g forces and everything of these crafts could easily be miscalculated if you&#39;ve already miscalculated the distance/size of the objects. Basically our perception can easily deceive us, especially in poor video footage.</p>
