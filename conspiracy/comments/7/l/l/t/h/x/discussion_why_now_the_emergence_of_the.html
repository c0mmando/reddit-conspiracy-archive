        <p><span class="badge badge-primary">121</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;2017-12-23 by <a class="author" href="../../../../../../../../user/Tillazack.html">Tillazack</a></p>
        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I want to put forward a modest but long theory about the recent UFO videos, the people involved, and the seemingly popular questions of timing.  While this proposal will not pretend to answer virtually any of the questions we all have, it nonetheless entails the end of all of space-time.  So hear me out.</p>

<p>Here is the short version: A revolution is underway in physics that could outstrip the significance of Einstein developing relativity.  The concepts are not new, but they have long been unpopular as people pursued a unified theory of gravity by crashing stuff.  Many of these unpopular kids were the same people researching parapsychology, UFOs, and other more exotic research.  Some of these unpopular people are working with Tom Delonge.  Why now?  At least in part, to move first in the market,  and to say I told you so while the world rediscovers theories that are forty years old. </p>

<p>My brain was set on fire by the UFO footage, and as I researched away I also checked in on what science has been up to while I have been a working stiff.  Turns out a lot.  So much, I feel confident saying that our world is about to be revolutionized, regardless of whether Bigelow is hoarding any alloys.  </p>

<p>First, in 2013, to <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/physicists-discover-geometry-underlying-particle-physics-20130917/">little fanfare in the general public!</a>, Nima Arkani-Hameda (from the Institute for Advance Study, I might add) and Jaroslav Trnka (CIT), published a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.2007.pdf">paper!</a> about the amplithuedron, a geometric shape that greatly simplified solving quantum equations. <strong>Like, really, really simplified.</strong>
What do I mean? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Interactions that were previously calculated with mathematical formulas <strong>thousands of terms</strong> long can now be described by computing the volume of the corresponding jewel-like “amplituhedron,” which yields an equivalent <strong>one-term expression</strong>.&quot;
“The degree of efficiency is mind-boggling,” said Jacob Bourjaily, a theoretical physicist at Harvard University and one of the researchers who developed the new idea. “You can easily do, on paper, computations that were infeasible even with a computer before.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it&#39;s not just a really cool calculator-it also seems probably that it, or a similar approach, can provide a <strong>quantum theory of gravity.</strong>
Well how does it do that?  By keeping it simple stupid.  Simpler than even the fundamental fabric of your perceived experience.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The new geometric version of quantum field theory could also facilitate the search for a theory of quantum gravity that would seamlessly connect the large- and small-scale pictures of the universe...The amplituhedron, or a similar geometric object, could help by removing two deeply rooted principles of physics: locality and unitarity...<strong>The amplituhedron is not built out of space-time and probabilities; these properties merely arise as consequences of the jewel’s geometry. The usual picture of space and time, and particles moving around in them, is a construct.</strong></p>

<p>Beyond making calculations easier or possibly leading the way to quantum gravity, the discovery of the amplituhedron could cause an even more profound shift, Arkani-Hamed said. That is, giving up space and time as fundamental constituents of nature and figuring out how the Big Bang and cosmological evolution of the universe arose out of <strong>pure geometry.</strong>“In a sense, we would see that change arises from the structure of the object,” he said. “But it’s not from the object changing. <strong>The object is basically timeless.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Guys, this is a really, really, really, big deal.  Scientists seem jazzed, but of course people who didn&#39;t read their Plato growing up seemed somewhat dismissive:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Alleged astrophysicist <a href="https://futurism.com/what-if-our-universe-hologram/">Paul Matt Sutter said!</a>, it was “a convenient mathematical tool because some questions in physics are super hard.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All of sudden senses are reliable or something! Now a lot has happened since  even 2013, but lets back up a bit. Did I mention this was a REALLY big deal?  </p>

<p>By removing space and time, this geometry removes the requirement that things be in one place, at one time, and at one time, at one time, in a certain order of times.  It renders particles nonlocal and nonunitary.  Space and time are not fundamental, but likely emerge through some kind of quantum entanglement.  All information pre-exists space time and is contained within this eternal geometry.  </p>

<p>And a likely suspect for this sorcery is the holographic universe theory.
Now one nice gentlemen recommended looking into this circa 1980.  His name was <a href="https://futurism.com/david-bohm-and-the-holographic-universe/">David Bohm!</a>.  This is a guy who was not let on the Manhattan project because he had affiliated with some communists. </p>

<p>So after not getting picked for the team he went back to work on his PhD in Berkley when he casually discovered “the scattering calculations of collisions of protons and deuterons” which was promptly seized by the Manhattan Project and immediately classified.  Dude had to back to school with the old &quot;government ate my homework&quot; excuse and wasn&#39;t allowed to continue any work on his dissertation.  After J. Robert Oppenheimer became death, he was nice enough to drop by and tell the school: &quot;Davy really did do the research.  Trust me. World destroying, let me tell you.&quot;  </p>

<p>The point here is that Bohd is not just smart, he is one of the smartest physicists around.  He takes a job at Princeton and is pal-ing around with Einstein.  In just a few years though, McCarthy calls him to the UAAC, Bohm pleads the 5th and won&#39;t drop names.  He is acquitted but even Einstein can&#39;t get him hired back.  So he goes off to South America, writes a conventional book on quantum physics but is already thinking a lot...about things.  </p>

<p>Bohm decides quantum physics would make a lot more sense if there some other kind of hidden reality that made it make sense.  He starts to think everything is really part of some other undivided thing.  He terms this the Implicate Order, and it is extreme.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.scienceandnonduality.com/david-bohm-implicate-order-and-holomovement/">Science and Nonduality!</a>: &quot;The theory of the Implicate Order contains an ultra-holistic cosmic view; it connects everything with everything else. In principle, any individual element could reveal “detailed information about every other element in the universe.” The central underlying theme of Bohm’s theory is the “unbroken wholeness of the totality of existence as an undivided flowing movement without borders.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then starts thinking about Dennis Gabors new toy, the hologram.  He goes, &quot;Well, it would make sense that there&#39;s a deeper, more real reality if this reality is just a hologram. (does some math). &quot;Checks out.&quot;  Our hologram is the explicate order.  He publishes a book called, Wholeness and the Implicate Order.  This is already extremely far out. </p>

<p>But Bohm is irrepressible and starts thinking about how he&#39;s able to think about the Implicate Order and the hologram and whether these thoughts are holograms thinking about themselves etc. He starts to ponder the nature of consciousness. So he gets together with Karl Pribram from Stanford to see is there is a model of consciousness in the universe Bohm just finished remaking.  Turns out, nonlocality is not an issue for a hologram because the entirety is contained in every part.  They develop the Holonomic Model of the brain.  This wasn&#39;t just navel gazing new age nonsense.  It was premised on the notion that &quot;neural holograms were formed by the diffraction patterns of oscillating electric waves within the cortex&quot; and accounts for weird features of memory. </p>

<p>So he revolutionized the field right? Of course not. This <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/03/radical-vision-universe-returns-electrify-physics/">2017 article from Wired!</a> didn&#39;t even mention him when discussing the resurgence of the theory.
The problem is that almost everyone disagreed with this statement: &gt;There is no reason why an extraphysical general principle is necessarily to be avoided, since such principles could conceivably serve as useful working hypotheses. For the history of scientific research is full of examples in which it was very fruitful indeed to assume that certain objects or elements might be real, long before any procedures were known which would permit them to be observed directly.&quot;-David Bohm (1952)</p>

<p>They also just did not get it when the guy would say and things like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The theory of the Implicate Order contains an ultra-holistic cosmic view; it connects everything with everything else. In principle, any individual element could reveal “detailed information about every other element in the universe.” </p>

<p>“The actual order (the Implicate Order) itself has been recorded in the complex movement of electromagnetic fields, in the form of light waves. Such movement of light waves is present everywhere and in principle enfolds the entire universe of space and time in each region. This enfoldment and unfoldment takes place not only in the movement of the electromagnetic field but also in that of other fields (electronic, protonic, etc.). These fields obey quantum-mechanical laws, implying the properties of discontinuity and non-locality. The totality of the movement of enfoldment and unfoldment may go immensely beyond what has revealed itself to our observations. We call this totality by the name holomovement.”</p>

<p>The layers of the Implicate Order can go deeper and deeper to the ultimately unknown. It is this “unknown and undescribable totality” that Bohm calls the holomovement. The holomovement is the “fundamental ground of all matter.”</p>

<p>Bohm considers the human individual to be an “intrinsic feature of the universe, which would be incomplete,in some fundamental sense” if the person did not exist. He believes that individuals participate in the whole and consequently give it meaning. Because of human participation, the “Implicate Order is getting to know itself better.”</p>

<p>Bohm also senses a new development. The individual is in total contact with the Implicate Order, the individual is part of the whole of mankind, and he is the “focus for something beyond mankind.” <strong>Using the analogy of the transformation of the atom ultimately into a power and chain reaction, Bohm believes that the individual who uses inner energy and intelligence can transform mankind. The collectivity of individuals have reached the “principle of the consciousness of mankind,” but they have not quite the “energy to reach the whole, to put it all on fire.</strong>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, we know that a few other people were pretty into this far-out stuff.  Seems like all of the were working for the CIA, something Bohm may have missed out on in light of the McCarthy skirmish. One of these doctors was Hal Puthoff. 
If you have not seen the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf">Project Stargate report!</a> explaining the potential physics behind remote viewing look at it. Like now.  In addition to drawing heavily on Bohm&#39;s theories, it relies a lot on an interesting guy named Itzhak Bentov. Look on page 18 of the pdf.  Bentov drew that picture. It is his theory of the shape of the holographic universe.  No big bang.  No past, present, or future.  Eternal.  </p>

<p>Now, setting aside the absolutely <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2017/03/did_the_cia_really_astrally_project_to_mars_in_1984.html">wild stories!</a> about <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001900760001-9.pdf">remote viewing!</a> on Mars in a program that seemed <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/2015/11/20/meet-former-pentagon-scientist-who-says-psychics-can-help-american-spies-393004.html">well-defended by Congress!</a>, and has people <a href="https://www.nexusmagazine.com/articles/doc_view/296-remote-viewing-ancient-aliens-on-mars">discussing consciousness!</a> that aligns with Bohm&#39;s theories, and that we can&#39;t even ask about that <a href="http://www.thelivingmoon.com/47john_lear/02files/Buzz_Aldrin_Monolith.html">pesky obelisk!</a> without being laughed at by enlightened folk, and don&#39;t worry right now that <a href="http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/i-team-ufo-study-focused-on-us-military-encounters/885013955">Senator Reid is suggesting!</a> that the treatment of the topic in government is at times animated by something as mundane as religious extremism and fear.  Don&#39;t worry about any of this.  </p>

<p>Bohm dies in 1992, Puthoff is laughed at and treated as a crank for 20 years.  </p>

<p>But in 2013 they found the amplituhedron.  Okay.  So what does that mean?  Well if the holographic theory is correct, and they have not yet linked this tool to holograms in our universe, the universe is likely cyclic, it&#39;s not expanding.  It might like that photo I told you to look at in the report on page 18.  It circles into the blackhole, comes out the white hole and does it all again. 
It means the big bang theory is wrong.  But we feel good about that I thought? There&#39;s a tv show!  What? <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/bmjv8d/black-holes-explode-into-white-holes-keep-the-universes-information-safe">Someone started flirting with white hole ideas in 2013?!</a>
And <a href="https://phys.org/news/2015-02-big-quantum-equation-universe.html">in 2015 they modeled an equation that says the universe has always existed, there was no big bang, and it does it without the mysterious dark matter and all the singularities?!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The universe may have existed forever, according to a new model that applies quantum correction terms to complement Einstein&#39;s theory of general relativity. The model may also account for dark matter and dark energy, resolving multiple problems at once.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well that does sound really elegant but just more proof of a paper tiger.  We have the red shift! Things are slowing down! Shit what? What happened? <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.4691v1.pdf">A static system can appear to change?!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;A static, entangled state between a clock system and the rest of the universe is perceived as evolving by internal observers that test the correlations between the two subsystems.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-01-reveals-substantial-evidence-holographic-universe.html">In 2017 they found the quantum theories answer basically all cosomological questions based on telescopic measurements, and again, without dividing by zero!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>They found that some of the simplest quantum field theories could explain nearly all cosmological observations of the early universe.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And man that neat little tauros model looks awfully good when these <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/earliest-black-hole-gives-rare-glimpse-of-ancient-universe/">baffling monster black holes and quasars show up and should be impossible.!</a>. Well not attractive to everyone.  Let&#39;s check back in on our <a href="https://www.space.com/35763-dark-energy-lights-out-on-the-universe.html">flippant friend Mr. Sutter!</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>You may also be wondering how I can talk so confidently about the nature of dark energy, since we don&#39;t seem to understand it at all. You&#39;re right: We don&#39;t understand dark energy. At all. We know it exists, because we directly observe the accelerated expansion of the universe, and a half-dozen other lines of evidence all point to its existence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Okay. Sure. Way better than eternal elegance.<br/>
But I do know some people who might have heard the universe subtly throwing out the welcome mat again: people like Dr. Puthoff, and others, who have been ignored for considering that there is even a slight possibility that existence was not deterministic, not singular, and not local.  They&#39;re coming out because instruments have gotten to the point that &quot;hidden realities&quot; can be measured more effectively. There&#39;s just no stopping things from getting wacky.  <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/zmzmpa/emdrive-nasa-impossible-propulsion-system-explained">Shit NASA built an EM drive already.!</a>.  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/briankoberlein/2016/11/28/nasas-emdrive-and-the-quantum-theory-of-pilot-waves/#654d43b44d2b">Oh man what a coincidence that this one guy was talking about fucking pilot waves in the 80s!</a> that NASA said were impossible  just 2 years ago. The mad scientists  need to get in and make a comeback while the getting is good. </p>

<p>Now that said, plenty of other motivations are possible.  But thought I&#39;d raise the point that a scientific revolution appears to be underway, and it would resonate with certain scientists who used to be ostracized.  </p>

<p>Oh yeah, did I mention that &quot;Bohm considers our separateness an illusion and argues that at a deeper level of reality, we, as well as all the particles that make up all matter, are one and indivisible. For Bohm, the “empty space” is <strong>full of energy and information. It’s a hidden world of the implicate order, also known as the “Zero Point Field” or the “Akasha”.</strong> Might just be that people ready to roll the dice on his 40 year old theories since they bothered to remember the guy existed. </p>

<p>Also fucking a that CIA report.  I leave you with this again:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bohm considers the human individual to be an “intrinsic feature of the universe, which would be incomplete,in some fundamental sense” if the person did not exist. He believes that individuals participate in the whole and consequently give it meaning. Because of human participation, the “Implicate Order is getting to know itself better.”</p>

<p>Bohm also senses a new development. The individual is in total contact with the Implicate Order, the individual is part of the whole of mankind, and he is the “focus for something beyond mankind.” Using the analogy of the transformation of the atom ultimately into a power and chain reaction, Bohm believes that the individual who uses inner energy and intelligence can transform mankind. The collectivity of individuals have reached the “principle of the consciousness of mankind,” but they have not quite the “energy to reach the whole, to put it all on fire.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>e: sorry for all the edits. 99% formatting and typos. All the spacing/quotes were a mess
e2:  To reinforce my point that scientific advancement is getting momentum that will only continue to accelerate consider a few things:</p>

<p>1) Our existing physics had been stretched to such extremes that they were turning into Rube Goldberg machines, which renders them expensive AND inaccessible.  Problems too complex for a computer can now be solved by hand.  The genius in Einstein&#39;s original paper was the intuition, the insight, not the calculations.  By seeing a way forward to simpler calculations, there is likely way forward for more people engage with problems.  </p>

<p>2) Take the example of the EM drive. In the Forbes article about the pilot wave dispute, they link to <a href="https://briankoberlein.com/2014/02/28/free-willy/">this piece from 2014</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Now the standard interpretation of this experiment is that it shows that fundamentally things are quantum mechanical.  The experiments we’ve done have pretty much eliminated any possibility for things like hidden variables or faster than light communication.  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is what is so incredible about this, not only is he wrong, but the freaking EM drive was already built and tested.  They knew it worked, everyone said it can&#39;t, and then focused torturing their existing framework rather than accepting Nasa&#39;s inexplicable physics for inexplicable behavior. But here&#39;s the best part.  <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nasa-says-emdrive-does-work-it-may-have-also-created-star-trek-warp-drive-1499098">This wasn&#39;t even the first time it got built and worked</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It was thought up and developed by a British scientist called Roger Shawyer, who spent years having his technology ridiculed by the international space community even though Boeing licensed it and the UK government was satisfied it worked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nasa-says-emdrive-does-work-it-may-have-also-created-star-trek-warp-drive-1499098">Mr. Shawyer started a small company, built it by 2010 and announced it.</a>. He was scorned. </p>

<p>So first, stop and think about that.  Government&#39;s weren&#39;t even bothering and some dude built one in less than 10 years, and they didn&#39;t even cop to a construct a test that might have something &quot;anomalous&quot; going on until <a href="https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.2014-4029">four years later</a>, then they built a working one and people still claimed it was impossible. </p>

<p>That dude earlier who said no &quot;hidden forces&quot;? They think it has to do with pilot waves traveling backwards in time.  Yeah that doesn&#39;t sound very hidden.  Think about the impossibility of measuring that directly while trapped in 4D space time. </p>

<p>That kind of friction would have killed this tech 50 years ago.  Instead, someone built it first, and built it faster, and people don&#39;t even listen to themselves anymore about whether something isn&#39;t possible.   Oh and you feel like you&#39;re missing out? <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2505612">Print yourself one.</a>.  </p>

<p>The internet, the democratization of the resources (don&#39;t need jet fuel or fissile material), and distrust in authority are why we will be able to make it to Mars in <strong>2-3 months</strong> and send a ship to Alpha Centauri at <a href="http://ssi.org/today-at-nasa-niac-2017/">40% the speed of light in 25 years</a> very soon.  </p>

<p>3) If that&#39;s not fast enough for you, <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d73bdv/that-physicist-in-omaha-is-still-working-on-a-warp-drive-in-his-garage">this dude is attempting to build a genuine warp drive in his garage.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The theoretical physicists all believed that you couldn&#39;t make a warp bubble unless you had the exotic energy of antimatter, or dark matter,&quot; Pares says. &quot;If I would have believed those guys, I&#39;d have put down my Etch-a-Sketch, walked away and drank a beer.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The availability to unlock energy from the very fabric of zero-point space in some way using waves has enormous implications. Here&#39;s the origin of the design:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Adding more strain to credulity. following his gig as an Air Force meteorologist, Pares became fascinated by the experience of pilot Bruce Gernon. In 1970, Gernon reported flying his small airplane through a swirling hole in a thunderstorm, zipping over a hundred miles in the span of a few seconds. The story is something you&#39;d hear on late-night radio programs dedicated to the paranormal, a man flying into a naturally occurring warp bubble generated by the intense electrical forces in the heart of a tropical thunderstorm.  To Pares, though, the story is anything but ridiculous. <strong>In fact, he says the tri-pole electrical fields created between thunderclouds and the earth are key to recreating the phenomena Bruce Gernon encountered at laboratory scale.</strong>As a meteorologist, Pares is confident in the power of thunderstorms.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I haven&#39;t read it but <a href="http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/0679fd_dd21000f5ee84cfdba56682275465bef.pdf">here is their latest research</a>.  Check it out.  Seize the means of production.  Become a consumer (of knowledge) and producer (of fucking spaceships).  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Denis Gabor was the antichrist. Source: <a href="http://infinitesummer.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;amp;t=130">Hal Incandenza</a></p>

<p>Not trying to get too weird b/c i tried to keep my post mostly about high level science news/history, but many gnostics believe that the snake in the garden of Eden was god, whereas as &quot;god&quot; was the demiurge playing some classic OT mindgames.  I am not a gnostic, but if you&#39;re bringing up the anti-christ i&#39;m bringing up the demi-urge. Things are not always what they seem. In this story, Gabor handed us the apple.  Just gotta take a bite. </p>

<p>It&#39;s very interesting to see characters like Hal beside fat-headed ex-talented ex-Blink guy. </p>

<p>As you pointed out, they all knew Davy got the math right. </p>

<p>I think that opinion was further validated when they scooped up their new European best friends after the war. </p>

<p>Walther Wüst is a good name to look into. Why did they expend so much time + energy on that particular line of investigation... ?</p>
