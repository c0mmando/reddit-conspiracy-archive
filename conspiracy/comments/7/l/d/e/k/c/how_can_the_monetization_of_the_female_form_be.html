<p>Pornography is the symbolic destruction of the female spiritual archetype and it&#39;s enslavement to the graven image on the screen, all set up by a satanic exchanged of money. I&#39;m very confused by this materialistic component of modern feminism.</p>

<p>Even if it&#39;s on one particular women&#39;s terms that doesn&#39;t take away form what pornography does for women as a whole. Any monetization of the female form is destructive to the true nature of women.</p>

<p>Unless you think women are just holes to be filled...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have an answer for the spirituality part, but I don&#39;t think pornography has to be spiritually damaging, if you&#39;re a sex-positive person. There are Sex-negative feminists, and sex-positive feminists. Sex-Worker positive feminists and Sex-worker negative feminists. But sexuality as a bad thing is a very patriarchal religious thing, it&#39;s always about how much control a man has over a woman and her desires for sex (I think).</p>

    <div class="md"><p><em>This</em> is the problem I have with modern feminism, and it&#39;s not what you think. </p>

<p>When you challenge any feminist on the true nature of the modern twist on feminist ideology, they&#39;ll insist up and down that feminism is just about equality. </p>

<p>Ok then, why can&#39;t a woman be <em>free</em> to sell her sexuality in the open market? Why do modern feminists feel the need to be the thought police for an entire gender? </p>

<p>Because modern feminism is no longer about equality of opportunity, it&#39;s about equality of outcome, and those are two very different things. Modern feminists want to force their own brand of subjective social-justice-oriented &quot;equality&quot; on everyone, by using the legislative might of the state. That is <em>not</em> ok and it&#39;s why that entire ideology needs to die. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok fine. I&#39;ll accept that. </p>

<p>So why do we even need feminism then? Don&#39;t women have equality of opportunity now, if not perhaps equality of outcome? Equality of outcome takes time, and it will come if we continue to treat all people the same, not try to force it prematurely by using those exact same oppression tactics on classes of people deemed &quot;privileged&quot; by the mob of popular opinion.</p>

<p>Feminism is the only ideology I&#39;m aware of that uses a specific classification of a person in its name, while claiming to be for equality. For example, racism, masculinism, sexism - these are all bad things. We don&#39;t have blackists, or gingerists. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t call people who <em>aren&#39;t</em> racist caucasianists because that would be silly. Being not racist is just being normal. It doesn&#39;t need a word, and the same should be true of people that believe in equality for the sexes. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well, we still need it because misogyny still exists. Although affirmative action-type laws can have effects that aren’t intended, they still are necessary to jump-start the transition to equality of outcome. Without that kind of thing, people are <em>remarkably</em> slow to change their actual opinions, and people’s actual opinions are the biases that we would need to actually change.</p>

<p>I mean, we’re talking about giving opportunities to people that wouldn’t likely live long enough for those opportunities to come naturally as society at large changes. I’m not convinced affirmative action does much of anything to oppress those who are privileged, and even if it does, a long-view of the topic still sees diversity as a benefit to society as a whole.</p>

<p>That kind of folds into my view on these topics; that diversity is efficient and effective. I’ll try to find it again, but I read a study that basically laid out how diverse groups of people solved problems quicker and more permanently that less diverse groups. The efficacy of diversity was actually <em>enhanced</em> by including people who would generally be perceived as less helpful to solving problems too, somewhat paradoxically. Something to do with intra-group communications.</p>

<p>So the point is that even if we have to force it, diversity is best for society at large. It isn’t about women being better at stuff than men or anything, like some extremist feminists might believe, it is about diversity in general improving our odds.</p>

<p>I mean, we do have black-supremacy groups. We have a supremacy group for almost every group that exists.</p>

<p>See, the problem is that <em>not</em> being racist <em>isn’t</em> normal. Nowhere near normal. Racism comes from tribal othering, a deeply ingrained psychological process that evolved for good reasons. It appears in pretty much every social group that exists out there, and is still a major problem. Just because America had a black president doesn’t mean racism is over. I personally heard men saying they couldn’t vote for Clinton because she’d be too emtional as a leader, because women are just “like that” apparently.</p>

<p>So the necessity of these affirmative words and groups is because there still exists a distinct undercurrent of bias <em>against</em> the things those words represent. They have to exist to counteract, and eventually overpower, the negative and unconscious forces they’re trying to change in the first place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well you didn&#39;t really address the core logic of what I&#39;m saying.</p>

<p>I never said there wasn&#39;t racism, what I said is we don&#39;t call <em>non</em> racists &quot;caucasianists&quot; or &quot;blackists&quot;, because that would be stupid. And let me rephrase, perhaps being racist isn&#39;t normal in your approximation, but it <em>should</em> be, from a legal and societal standpoint, which is why it doesn&#39;t need a word.</p>

<p>There is very little evidence that society wouldn&#39;t progress towards equality without affirmative action. You&#39;re making a massive assumption there that is completely baseless. My opinion, of course, is that affirmative action accomplishes the exact opposite, because it tries to use our differences to eliminate the consequences of our differences. It&#39;s self-defeating circular logic.</p>

<p>Sexism exists. I haven&#39;t argued it doesn&#39;t. My argument is that modern feminism, in it&#39;s current pursuits to shoehorn equality of outcome onto the population, either, at best, is ineffective, or at worst, is accomplishing the exact opposite.</p>

<p>All sex grounds out to biological reproduction, one way or another. At a minimum, God or evolution installed the sex drive to make sure babies would continue to be, not only conceived, but cared for while dependent (a frighteningly long period for humans).</p>
