       I have posted this twice in the past, yet people have continually brushed me off. I understand why, too. But I think it's interesting to see how people feel about this, especially with our United States - North Korea relations intensifying. These may all just be coincidences, but I think they could be something more.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everyone knows about the Titanic, right? Yes, but not everyone knows about her two sister ships, the Britannic, and the Olympic. You may just think of the Titanic as a horrible disaster that killed two-thirds of those on board -- and only know about it to that extent. But there is much more to the story than that.
      </p>
      <p>
       There were to be three grand ships, the most luxurious ships ever built : First, the Olympic, then the Titanic, and finally, the Britannic. The owner of the ships was the White Star Line, which was owned by IMM, headed by the eponymous J.P. Morgan, born April 17, 1837, died March 31, 1913, March 31 the 4 year anniversary of the beginning of the building of the Titanic and April 17 being the EXACT DATE, if everything went according to plan, the Titanic's safe arrival in New York City in 1912. It was said that he wanted to make money off of insurance policies by switching the two ships and deliberately sinking the "Titanic," because the Olympic had been significantly damaged in a collision September 20, 1911 with the HMS Hawke, and was beyond its moneymaking stage. There are numerous pieces of evidence to support this, including the fact that he pulled out of the voyage at the very last minute, along with 55 other people who said they 'had a bad feeling.'
      </p>
      <p>
       Let's look at Olympic : she had her maiden voyage on June 14, 1911. She was almost identical to what Titanic would be, except for a few minor differences, most unnoticeable to the naked eye. If, in fact, a switch and insurance scam took place --  which would not only have saved the company, but also killed many opponents of J.P. Morgan -- then the ship that hit the fateful iceberg on April 14, 1912, and sunk on April 15, 1912, would have been the Olympic, which also means that the ship found by Dr. Robert Ballard in 1985 was the Olympic as well. Which means that :
      </p>
      <p>
       The day of the Olympic's maiden voyage was to share its date with the birth day of Donald Trump; the sinking date was the VERY DAY notorious leader Kim Jong Il, father of current radical North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, was born; and the day that its wreck was discovered? -- the 46th anniversary of the beginning of World War II.
      </p>
      <p>
       One ship associated with mass killing, World War, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong Un.
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition to this, the week of April 13-20 is widely considered the deadliest and most tragic week throughout history, featuring the Titanic sinking, Lincoln's assassination, Virginia Tech and Columbine shootings, Boston Marathon bombing, the huge Texas ware house fire, and the massive oil spill as well as other less significant, but still tragic events.
      </p>
      <p>
       TLDR; The Titanic and its sister ship could have been switched for money and political advancement, and some of the dates align with World War, Kim Jong Un, and Donald Trump. 55 people suspiciously opted out of traveling on the greatest ship in the world for its maiden voyage, including the man who would've made all of the money, and gained all of the political advancement from the deaths of certain passengers.

       It’s just dates that align, coincidence doesn’t equal cause and effect.  If you were a mastermind what would be the reasoning behind making the dates line up?  It would be like leaving your calling card at the sign of a murder.  Plus how could “they” know when those people were born IOT sink ships on the correct dates?  I just don’t understand the correlation between the titanic and WWIII.

       It just seems to be an interesting correlation. The sinking causing WWIII isn't necessarily the conspiracy; it's more of the switch theory plus other intriguing coincidences

       Yes, that is basically what it is. Basically all of these dates are connected to the switch theory conspiracy, and if it's true, they would all lend themselves directly to Donald Trump, Kim Jong Un, and World War.

       Aside from the ludicrous leap from Olympic to WWIII, it helps if you know the ships were only part-insured for a fraction of their cost, so the insurance swap theory holds no water (hue hue).
      </p>
      <p>
       The differences between the ships were also far from minor - the interior decor and even some entire rooms were changed. You couldn't switch the two without a lot of manpower, materials and equipment, and you'd have to do it at a dockyard. There are no dockyards that aren't in plain view and the ships were
       <em>
        kind of hard to hide

       !

       Except the only supposed differences were the promenade deck that was enclosed and the French restaurant, neither of which have been proven to have been there. Secondly, in March 1912, both ships were side by side, and Titanic underwent major redecorating and some changes to the superstructure. It has never been definitively, without a doubt, indisputably proven that it wasn't the Olympic. As for the insurance, the Olympic had been severely damaged by the Hawke, and her owners believed that lots of money would be lost. As for J.P. Morgan, many of his political rivals were aboard, including JJ Astor and J Bruce Ismay. He expected both to perish, but only Astor did. I'd say I slightly believe that it was the Titanic, but I wanted to present the other side of the argument.

       Olympic had been steaming across the Atlantic for a year before Titanic, passengers already knew her well so they could easily see the differences. The deck plans for both ships are in the public domain, as are numerous maps that were on display for passengers to find their ways around. There are countless written records - journals, memoirs, and testimonies which mention the vet places y claim may not exist. How do you even go about hiding a restaurant? Remember in these days the restaurants and lounges were all the entertainment passengers got.
      </p>
      <p>
       Docking two ships side by side is not hard. What's quite a bit harder is switching them without anybody noticing them! As I did earlier, they were in plain view of the general public. You can't just swap the name plates and expect nobody to notice, in the same way you couldn't just swap the signs on two buildings. These ships were enormous, and moving them required people, tugboats, and time, and would draw the general public to watch.

       Were you alive in 1912? How can you verify these sources? If you say there were 'countless' documents, then may I have a primary  source affirming the existence of the small French café? If this was a conspiracy, you'd have to believe they'd go to some extent to cover it up. All of the original plans were destroyed in an air raid during WWII, so only unoriginal ones still exist. I can find no pictures of that French café. Is it present in the wreck? When Dr. Ballard first explored the ship, he noted unusual things, including the fact that nowhere except the starboard bow did the name appear.

       As with most conspiracies you're relying on  a lack of evidence to the contrary without even looking for sources rather than common sense. If they idea was even remotely possible it would have been brought up at one of the national enquiries. No ship in history has been scrutinised as much as Titanic and there is still not a shred of evidence to suggest they were ever swapped.

       Again, I believe that the ship that sunk was in fact the Titanic. But firstly, the references list are all from one book, less the reference to a Web page that starts off by saying 'there isn't much known about the Cafe'. There are many shreds of evidence. You are telling me to look at sources, have you gone to any websites presenting the evidence that they were switched?
