        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Distilled water does leach minerals from the body. However it only leaches INORGANIC minerals that the body can not use, which exist throughout the body as deposits that cause disease and aging. Why is it that there has been a massive campaign to spread the idea that only drinking distilled water is FATAL? Why do they always say that it &quot;leaches minerals from the body&quot; and use this as evidence it will cause massive failure of organs when distilled water cannot leach the ORGANIC minerals and in fact INCREASES ABSORPTION RATES. </p>

<p>Think i&#39;m crazy because of what google populates the search results with when you look up distilled water? Allow me to appeal to authority then, since that seems to be roughly your logic.</p>

<p>“Water hardness (inorganic minerals in solution) is the underlying cause of many, if not all, of the diseases resulting from poisons in the intestinal tract. These (hard minerals) pass from the intestinal walls and get into the lymphatic system, which delivers all of its products to the blood, which in turn, distributes to all parts of the body. This is the cause of much human disease.” —Dr. Charles Mayo of the Mayo Clinic</p>

<p>&quot;People who say that Distilled Water leaches minerals out of the body are, therefore, correct only in this respect. This is only 50% of the truth. It is virtually impossible for Distilled Water to separate minerals, which have become an integral part of the cells and tissues of the body. Distilled water collects ONLY the minerals which remain in the body, minerals discarded from natural water AND from the cells, the minerals which the natural water originally collected from its contact with the earth and the rocks. Such minerals, having been rejected by the cells of the body are of no constructive value. On the contrary, they are debris which distilled water is capable of picking up and eliminating from the system.&quot; —Dr. Norman W. Walker, from “Water Can Undermine Your Health”</p>

<p>“Used as a drink, distilled water is absorbed directly into the blood, the solvent properties of which it increases to such an extent that it will keep in solution salts already existing in the blood, prevent their undue deposit in various organs and structures, favor their elimination by the various excreta, and tend to remove these earthy compounds which have already accumulated in the body . . . There is no doubt as to the high value of distilled water used freely as a retarder of the ossifying conditions which appear to constitute the condition of old age.” —C.W.
DeLacy Evans, M.D., in his book, How To Prolong Life</p>

<p>We all know tap water is full of garbage that weakens the body. But distilled water is more than just water free from fluoride, hexavalent chromium, etc. It is water that actively helps the body eliminate deposits of inorganic solids and prevent new deposits. It is my belief that the fact distilled water does not continuously add inorganic solids and is outside of the powerstructures ability to control or add what they wish to poses a bigger threat to the system than one might realize. I believe they have hid this through convincing the general public of a lie. When you research, take note of what website is purporting what, and what the sources are, and whether they are talking about organic or inorganic minerals. The first million posts on google are all spreading the &quot;it leaches minerals&quot; line with zero biological context</p>

<p>edit: Get enough salt in your diet and eat fruits and veggies and there is no risk. Try to find a single case of someone dying from only drinking distilled water. If it leaches things like potassium vital to heart function where are all of the cases of catastrophic organ failure? Why can they legally sell distilled &quot;drinking&quot; water with no warnings if it kills? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about BIFL but the unit I have is Model 300SS from h2o labs.  Looks pretty similar to the megahome model MH943 so you will probably be good with either.  I did have a cheaper model for a while but it only lasted about a year.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve been looking into the automatic ones but haven&#39;t pulled the trigger on that yet.  One of these days.</p>

<p>If you have a water softener, use hot water instead of cold.  That will make cleaning less work.  The water softener removes a bunch of the calcium that would otherwise be left in the distiller when you are finished.</p>

<p>The &quot;cleaners&quot; they sell are pretty much just citric acid.  You can buy it on amazon much cheaper.  </p>

<p>I typically pour the distilled water into a pur filter in the fridge.  It&#39;s one of those with the tap on the front.  That adds to the carbon filtration, which is a good thing.  Makes it continent for the family to always have cold water available.</p>

<p>Also we use it in things like the Coffee Pot.  Our current pot is 5 years old.  Never have to descale it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Pure pure water, like the 3x deionized distilled shit I use for work, will leach minerals out of your body. Water is a super solvent, if it doesn&#39;t have anything dissolved in it, it will suck up the first thing it finds.The pH is really low, it has no buffering capacity. It tastes sorta metallic. Trust me, you want those tiny bits of minerals. Fluoride is a different matter.</p>

<p>Build up of these minerals forms calcification which causes health problems. </p>

<p>Not sure on deionized water though, but distilled water is fine. Just run it through a carbon filter after to get out any VOC&#39;s.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I say salt in this context, i&#39;m talking about mineral salts, not sodium chloride necessarily. Anytime a metal combines with a non-metal, that is a salt.

This is the cause of much human disease.” —Dr. Charles Mayo of the Mayo Clinic</p>

    <div class="md"><p>An organic mineral is a compound containing organic food-based acids, such as amino acids and citric acid. Plants take inorganic compounds in soil and convert them into organic compounds that are more readily integrated into our body. Your body quickly absorbs organic minerals from orange juice that have been processed through photo synthesis. This is compared to the inorganic minerals in rocks which bleed into spring water that the body largely does not incorporate and leaves deposits.

<p>&quot;People who say that Distilled Water leaches minerals out of the body are, therefore, correct only in this respect. This is only 50% of the truth. It is virtually impossible for Distilled Water to separate minerals, which have become an integral part of the cells and tissues of the body. Distilled water collects ONLY the minerals which remain in the body, minerals discarded from natural water AND from the cells, the minerals which the natural water originally collected from its contact with the earth and the rocks. Such minerals, having been rejected by the cells of the body are of no constructive value. On the contrary, they are debris which distilled water is capable of picking up and eliminating from the system.&quot; —Dr. Norman W. Walker, from “Water Can Undermine Your Health”</p>

<p>I am using technology for meditating / astral projection through binaural beats and I just bought a Muse headset to measure my brainwaves while doing these activities.</p>

<p>I actually made an app recently to generate binaural audio beats if you&#39;d like to try it: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.productions.dz.brainwaver&amp;amp;hl=en">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.productions.dz.brainwaver&amp;amp;hl=en</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve had the most success using these beats to train my brainwaves into a specific state. You can combine alpha waves and delta or theta waves for some amazing effects too, including leaving your body if you can relax enough. This guided meditation helped me leave my body fully for the first time: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odUr4XAF0aY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odUr4XAF0aY</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>My belief system right now is I have no idea what&#39;s going on hah. And I&#39;m happy that there is a lot left to the journey.</p>

<p>But I have a hunch that the Law of One and the Hermetic texts are on the right track. At a base level I almost feel like we are all one consciousness working together and experiencing a universe that we&#39;ve shaped like a sandbox. The better and more logically your consciousness functions (the more your consciousness has evolved through lifetimes), the more of the universe you get to shape.</p>

<p>I do believe a mind god of our local finite universe (I think I&#39;ve seen him in my astral travels) exists and that the non-local universe is infinite. I have meditated on the subject of the source of the non-local universe&#39;s infinities and cannot fathom any good reason for why there is something rather than nothing. I think the base state of the universe is both nothingness and infinitness. Nothingness is just another form of infinity - infinite nothing. So the universe is infinite.</p>

<p>I think the fractal nature of our universe demonstrates the finities and infinities of it simultaneously. Fractals show a finite thing as infinite and vice versa. Like a translation service between the infinities manifesting in a finite pattern, running through our local cosmos every which way. We are literally surrounded by infinities that we are never consciously aware of. The fact that we can recognize anything as not infinity is mind blowing in itself.</p>

<p>It&#39;s about the concentration of minerals inside and outside of the cell membrane.</p>

<p>If you drink distilled water, the mineral concentration inside your cells is higher than outside. Since only water can permeate the membrane, the only way to balance out the concentration is for water to go inside the cell, and diluting it. This causes the cell to grow in size, and eventually burst.</p>

<p>Now&#39; i&#39;m not saying 1 glass of distilled water will instantly kill you, but there is definitely an amount (5-10 liters a day), that will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, if  you drink too much of any water at one time it can kill you this way. The argument that distilled water will cause this at a gallon a day is false. The body has enough salt reserves and mechanisms to incorporate the pure water without causing problems with osmosis. These systems can be overwhelmed if you drink huge amounts of any kind of water.</p>

<p>For years while I was in the Navy the vast majority of the water I drank was deionized, distilled water straight out of the DI water tap on the boat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Drinking “straight water” (assuming you mean hard waters, tap waters, reverse-osmosis water, or anything water other than distilled) is bad for you SIMPLY BECAUSE IT CONTAINS INORGANIC MINERALS. </p>

<p>Inorganic minerals are unusable by the body, therefore they are interpreted as foreign matter, or poison. These UNUSABLE minerals, existing UNUSED in the body, are stored in the tissues, bones, and arterial walls as DEPOSITS. As these foreign deposits increase in mass, they begin causing serious, potentially fatal, health problems. </p>

<p>A good general rule to follow when talking about your dietary intake is this: 
If your body is unable to use something, it is harmful to it. And, if consumed, these HARMFUL, UNUSABLE agents will be stored, deposited, and lead to negative health effects.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When water is filtered with one of the most common water filtration methods, reverse osmosis, for example, this process does a good job of removing contaminants and metals such a chloride, copper, and lead. 
However, minerals such as fluoride, calcium, magnesium and phosphorus easily pass through the filters used in this process. These minerals are INORGANIC as they exist in the water. Meaning you’re body cannot use them for anything, due to the human body having a natural affinity for ONLY ORGANIC minerals. </p>

<p>If you look at the label on bottled waters such as Aquafina, Dasani, Ice Mountain, and even especially at the more expensive “Luxury Water” brands such as Pellegrino and Fiji, you will see that they proudly list the high contents of minerals such as Calcium and Magnesium. What they fail to mention is that these minerals are existing in an INORGANIC state. This renders them not only useless, but harmful to the body. </p>

<p>If you have more interest in this topic, I’m currently working on putting together a larger, more in-depth post about this in hopes of educating more people on the subject.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree with most of the tenets of your post. Free minerals are unusable by the body, and in fact can cause disease if they build up. Distilled water, being aggressive, removes the free minerals. The minerals that are organically bound are unaffected.</p>

<p>Also, all of our mineral requirements should thus be obtained through food, not water. So far, good.</p>

<p>Why then, do you add that we should be getting salt in our diet, which is an inorganic mineral? Because it seems to follow from the above logic that salt, and even mineral supplements, do the body no good, and actually may do it harm?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Racing heart, sudden wakeups, poor nail health, general anxiety issues.  Supplementing with salt helped a lot.  I had tried some of the liquid mineral additive stuff from the health store as well, and that helped.  My general opinion on distilled is it&#39;s ok if you supplement it with salts and minerals.  As an initial detox it&#39;s great.  I wouldn&#39;t do it for a long period of time again, exclusively.     </p>
