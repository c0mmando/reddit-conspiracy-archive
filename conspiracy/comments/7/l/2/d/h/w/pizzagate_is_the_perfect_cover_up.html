       This is very true! But it would be easy to hide among that "clutter"
      </p>

       This is my intuition speaking so take it as you will, but can we not see an actual news piece on someone busted for pedophila who was active in the discussions? Isn't that always how it comes to be?

       You could be right, there could very well have been pedos involved in the discussion.

       You or I could literally be pedos by the laws of chance.

       As to your theory of pedos doing all the pizzgate posting, i have to think you're either on the wind up or being seriously over-dramatic, sorry.

       Heh...I've seen this ridiculous talking point pop up a lot recently. Pgate isn't the cover for pedophiles, it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       the pedophiles. And it spiraled into Pedogate, which is far broader in its scope and implications. What you are saying will, either intentionally or not, eventually smother any and all discussion of Pgate, by making it so that if we accept the
       <em>
        reality
       </em>
       that our politicians and celebrities are degenerate pieces of shit who abuse children, suddenly
       <em>
        we're
       </em>
       the pedophiles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's some evidence to show you our politicians are
       <em>
        definitely
       </em>
       involved in this shit:

       I don't want to polorize anyone because you are correct, there are pedophiles in our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I will point out that yesterday I was able to discredit a post on here about a huge pedobust that actually turned out to be Russian propaganda from 2014...
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess here is a new question, are they directly connected with pizzagate? Or do they act alone?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just see that the pizzagate thing as a gateway to pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Showing people how pedophiles operate is like that one time the MSM was showing people how terrorist make pipe bombs. Sometimes too much exposure is just that, too much and it actually reproduces the problem in a way no one can predict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I is impossible to find a single victim of the actual pizzagate scandal anywhere, how can there be evidence of a crime without a victim? What's the point of all this unless it's actually what I see it as, reproducing and normalizing pedophila

        Showing people how pedophiles operate is like that one time the MSM was showing people how terrorist make pipe bombs. Sometimes too much exposure is just that, too much and it actually reproduces the problem in a way no one can predict.

       Exposing people to Pgate won't make them Pedophiles...that's not how this works. Pedophilia is a mental predisposition, it doesn't just "happen", one is born with the condition and lives with it their entire life.

        Also I is impossible to find a single victim of the actual pizzagate scandal anywhere, how can there be evidence of a crime without a victim? What's the point of all this unless it's actually what I see it as, reproducing and normalizing pedophila

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Pgate was always based on the emails, the instagram photos, the bands and their art at CPP. If you get to the root of it you understand why there are no victims to come forward...you don't survive this. You are raped, tortured, and murdered, all in the name of ritual magick. Pgate isn't the normalization of Pedophilia, it is the thread that leads to the unraveling of our entire Elites infatuation with it.

       Psychology has its issues but there are some things it gets right- Schizophrenia is a mental issue, depression is a mental issue, pedophilia is a mental issue. Pedophiles are literally people stuck in their own puberty/prepubescence who are attracted to that age group. There's nothing controversial there at all.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where psychology goes wrong is in the multitude of approved studies and "science" with results that can not be replicated. Nothing I stated above is a part of that though.

       I tend to think of it from the Politicians/Elites pov...a living victim is a loose end. You can get away with this all day, for generations, as long as you make sure they're eliminated once their usefulness is gone. The doc I linked about the Franklin Scandal- Conspiracy of Silence- explains a lot of this at the end, like how they physically intimidated Paul Bonnaci into not testifying, and how the FBI forced him to recant his testimony and ensnare the other victim- Alicia Owens- who upon refusing to recant spent 25 fucking years in jail. And this was in the 80's! They're more careful now, they don't leave loose ends lying about anymore...I highly recommend you take an hour of your time and watch it. Conspiracy of Silence will show you how Pgate can be so real.

       Well, perhaps it was retracted so that people who commit crimes don't see murdering their victims as the only option. That's kind of a scary thought, all crime turning to murder (yes this is a dramatic thought but I hope you see what I am getting at)

       When you are talking about high level abuse, there really isn't another option. Bonnaci then came forward and admitted  that the FBI strong armed him, while Alicia Owens never recanted her testimony and served her whole fucking sentence, then when Bonnaci was supposed to show up in court to set the record straight, he disappeared and hasn't been seen again.

       I didn't make you "seem any less than me". I made an observation based on our discussion. You are skeptical of Pgate and its aims, as well as the systematized abuse perpetrated by our Politicians. It's a hard pill to swallow but the world definitely gets darker when one does. I'm just having a friendly conversation, not belittling you.

       So you blame the people pointing out the heinous crime for committing the crime so the real criminals face no heat. Switching focus is a tactic used to do this. I stopped posting pizzagte stuff to facebook because of this. This tactic is effectively used to silence people since no one wants to even consider they'd do the same fucked up shit much less be publicly accused of harboring those feeling internally.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now that John Podesta is being trotted out to be rebranded as an Alien ufo guru or something, these types of posts are becoming more prevalent. It makes me wonder just how dumb they think most people are. You see the problem with Pizzagate isn't just that he may be molesting children, its that they may also be participating in cannibalism to ingest Adrenochrome, and when you start to knock on the door that is Pizzagate you realize that not just this conspiracy, but all of them run together to cover up for a lie that began long ago, much longer than we have publicly available written history for.

       The people who don't like this pizzagate stuff tend to be actual parents of children, maybe it makes no sense but maybe the intuition of a parent means something?

       They don't like Pizzagate because it forces them to confront the very thing I said, a long with the fear that their children aren't safe. Ignorance is bliss.

       There was a person named Laura Silsby that directly ties Hillary to this. She was accused of attempting to traffic 30 children with her. She was convicted, changed her name and now runs the center for alerts that deal with missing children. The Clinton foundation is the center where the money was exchanged for the people.

       Ok, you win. No reason to suspect that Hilary has any connection to someone she essentially propelled forward. If you're ok with that explanation why are you here? I am not. Actually kind of regret replying to you here. I know where you're going with this. Arguing things down to the finite details is your game, unfortunately when you do this, you also miss the bigger picture. There is no real reason to try and show someone what some of us see happening that operates this way. You do understand this don't you? You will find all the holes you want in this theory like any other. So you sir, get a cupcake today for your victory here.

       I've provided plenty, the fact that you don't see that just refers back to my original post. You can be right here, I stand to lose nothing from it. If its your opinion that there has been no suspicious activity, that there is no reason to at least look in to the events that took place, how they did and why they did I have to ask again what are you doing here exactly? I don't need to change your mind about this, it isn't a task any person should take upon when meeting someone they disagree with.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just like you not agreeing with me doesn't change the fact that I do believe there's reason to be suspicious and look further in to this matter.

       Her name isn't in it directly. She has no involvement. I seriously think you should go apply to work at your local police departments detective program. I think we'd have much fewer crimes left outstanding if we just had more people like you carefully looking at things. You've really shown me the light here.

       Hi friend, I read a lot of what you have posted though not all of it but it was all very interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       To be honest, I think you maybe a victim of gaslighting. Usually seen in abusive relationships it’s a form of control that rewrites what a person sees as the truth. I found myself, as I usually do, captivated and convinced through looking into this and was honestly just like wow how did I not see all of this, but I saw a random pic of the “murder room” at comet pizza and realized that this was all an elaborate control mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I encourage everyone to look up gaslighting, look at the signs and symptoms.

       Yes my friend, but you under estimate to power of the fake garbage “New” you promote here, new evidence makes your brain think that maybe you missed something and all of a sudden this bull shit pizza gate has you question if Hillary Clinton is sucking on a baby’s neck before bed.

       Live for yourself, when I made this post it’s cause I was concerned about how frequently I was seeing this garbage reproduced In what should be a very interesting sub, and potentially would turn to the r/pedo hide out if you are careful

       Also, I will tell you that I first lurked around this Reddit a few months ago and really actually believed this pizzagate thing, like actually showed people in my life in hopes that my see it, but eventually I read something about this comet pizza owner and his now failing business and was like damn... his restaurant got shot up and all the tramatic things that happen as a result of such inflamitory shit. Idk how to say but all I know is that it is dangerous what is going out in our world. It's so easy to just see something and believe it and that's all that's happening except in this case it's actually to the point of mind control. Believeing pizzagate unleashes some scary things inside of a person, question the MSM has always been a thing but ignoring everything they say as false is very dangerous

       I agree, right before pulling myself out from almost believing some of these articles I found that they are literally gaslighting the article from the beginning. You read an initial lie that could almost be true and are left with a feeling on uneasiness while you continue to read. They take true things and literally connect them to total bullshit and at the end cite a source that only proves part of the entire statement.
      </p>
      <p>
       It’s very interesting, as gaslighting is seen in controlling relationship and can literally convince a person to stay with their abusive partner even though it’s not good for them... reminds of some of these pizzagate people, seems it has control over them.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eventually the victim of gaslighting can be left feeling like literally the world is out of control except for the one thing the believe is true typical their abusive controlling partner or in this case pizzagate.

       So you blame the people pointing out the heinous crime for committing the crime so the real criminals face no heat. Switching focus is a tactic used to do this. I stopped posting pizzagte stuff to facebook because of this. This tactic is effectively used to silence people since no one wants to even consider they'd do the same fucked up shit much less be publicly accused of harboring those feeling internally.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now that John Podesta is being trotted out to be rebranded as an Alien ufo guru or something, these types of posts are becoming more prevalent. It makes me wonder just how dumb they think most people are. You see the problem with Pizzagate isn't just that he may be molesting children, its that they may also be participating in cannibalism to ingest Adrenochrome, and when you start to knock on the door that is Pizzagate you realize that not just this conspiracy, but all of them run together to cover up for a lie that began long ago, much longer than we have publicly available written history for.

       Dramatic point: never saw anyone teaching Arabic as a way to stop terrorism and honestly most would see that as a breeding ground for more terrorist regardless of intent

       You could be right, there could very well have been pedos involved in the discussion.

      <p>
       You or I could literally be pedos by the laws of chance.

       As to your theory of pedos doing all the pizzgate posting, i have to think you're either on the wind up or being seriously over-dramatic, sorry.

       I don't want to polorize anyone because you are correct, there are pedophiles in our government.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I will point out that yesterday I was able to discredit a post on here about a huge pedobust that actually turned out to be Russian propaganda from 2014...
      </p>
      <p>
       But I guess here is a new question, are they directly connected with pizzagate? Or do they act alone?
      </p>
      <p>
       I guess I just see that the pizzagate thing as a gateway to pedophilia.
      </p>
      <p>
       Showing people how pedophiles operate is like that one time the MSM was showing people how terrorist make pipe bombs. Sometimes too much exposure is just that, too much and it actually reproduces the problem in a way no one can predict.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I is impossible to find a single victim of the actual pizzagate scandal anywhere, how can there be evidence of a crime without a victim? What's the point of all this unless it's actually what I see it as, reproducing and normalizing pedophila

       hahaha you've been doing this very same thing over and over in this sub with this subject. If this is the conclusion you came to before you even read what I posted (which its clear you already held this position) why waste time disputing something you have no interest in?

       Yes my friend, but you under estimate to power of the fake garbage “New” you promote here, new evidence makes your brain think that maybe you missed something and all of a sudden this bull shit pizza gate has you question if Hillary Clinton is sucking on a baby’s neck before bed.
      </p>
      <p>
       Live for yourself, when I made this post it’s cause I was concerned about how frequently I was seeing this garbage reproduced In what should be a very interesting sub, and potentially would turn to the r/pedo hide out if you are careful

       Also, I will tell you that I first lurked around this Reddit a few months ago and really actually believed this pizzagate thing, like actually showed people in my life in hopes that my see it, but eventually I read something about this comet pizza owner and his now failing business and was like damn... his restaurant got shot up and all the tramatic things that happen as a result of such inflamitory shit. Idk how to say but all I know is that it is dangerous what is going out in our world. It's so easy to just see something and believe it and that's all that's happening except in this case it's actually to the point of mind control. Believeing pizzagate unleashes some scary things inside of a person, question the MSM has always been a thing but ignoring everything they say as false is very dangerous
