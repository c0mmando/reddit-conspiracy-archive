       This all seems very strange, especially the money going into this program. A secret program was created, linked to podesta, and the program was started by a senator in which he funded a friends company to run it, not a third party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Seems fishy that only 22 million was invested in a program that has evidence of unexplained UAP's and unexplainable metal obtained from these objects, when it just recently came to light that 21 trillion is unaccounted for in the U.S. treasury.
      </p>
      <p>
       So it seems like there is only a few scenarios possible.
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Extra terrestrials are here and the government has known about them and somebody is pressuring them to release information because they might release it themselves or an event is coming from the visitors and the government is preparing us for it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The UAP is our own governments technology created from this missing money and they are preparing to let the world know our capability or scare other nations into acting a certain way by pretending it is alien technology. A ton of agendas could be pushed with this tactic.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         An outside party a.k.a the elite, illuminati, NWO, what ever people want to call it, is creating a hoax through the pentagon by using black money in a compartmentalized department to create pseudo "government" credibility to distract us from the missing money or create large scale political change in the U.S and world in which they seize more power in some form.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Our actual government is creating the hoax in order to create political change or use it as some form of propganda to the world, or use it as a smokescreen in some useful form for an upcomming war, as many nations such as russia, china, iran, saudi, israel,  and the U.S. are increasingly posturing for war.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
       All of these scenarios are pretty scary and unpredictable, but the unique theme is that it seems to be culminating for an event this upcomming year.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anybody have any other possible ideas on why this information was release now, out of all the time this program has been around?

       I feel the same way, project Bluebeam and/or mystery Babylon vibes. Sucks cause aliens and such totally exist. However with the black technology the govt has access to combined with the general ignorance of the population, it's going to be easy for them to play this card. My burning question is "Why now?"

       To answer your burning question, and this is just my own speculation along with others'; so much has come to light recently, or nearly come to light that I think the deep state is "spooked."  They're afraid of people waking up, people pushing back against traditional globalist policies.  That's honestly started to happen with Brexit and Trump now, as well as other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
       The "alien card" I see as a last ditch effort for them to salvage their credibility in the eyes of the world, and it's a card that they've held very close to their chest until now.  I think that a combination of things is going on behind the scenes causing either a test-run of some sort of alien false-flag, or the actual event itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       You'd have to assume that the recent news is really just a feeler to see the reactions of the population before anything actually happens.

       I just can't see the political landscape now demanding them to use such an ace in the hole. I get with wikileaks and all the recent developments that there's a feeling that TPTB are on their heels but they've been "On their heels" before and not needed such measures.
      </p>
      <p>
       On top of that, if an entity has enough power to use technology for some sort of alien false flag, I don't see them not employing aspects of said technology to proactively prevent a situation where that was needed. Like extremely sensitive and damning information about these authority figures is released and hardly anyone gives a damn, why do they need aliens for
       <em>
        this
       </em>
       particular information the sheeple are generally ignoring?
      </p>
      <p>
       That being said, and my tinfoil may be... reflecting... a little here but there is that peculiarly shaped cigar object from out of the solar system that is going to fly by earth in the near future, Oumuamua. Its said to have accumulated a layer of organic material (carbon, nitrogen, etc) from it's trip through space that even gives it a reddish color. Are they going to confirm microbial life on this thing and roll it into ongoing soft disclosure or the false flag?

       I think Oumuamua is already well-passed Earth on it's way out of the solar system, but it did pass recently.  It might've been back in Oct/Nov, when they caught it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honestly that's a good question.  Some people are conjecturing that Oumuamua is a part of this whole conspiracy.  Very interesting times indeed, and the organic cover on Oumuamua is extremely interesting.

       Ah ok, I saw it was discovered in oct and read about it then, it probably has passed by now- especially with how fast it was supposedly moving. Who knows, maybe it's just taking a while for the "measurements" or "paperwork" on it come through, haha.

       its def on its way out of the solar system, and if I am not mistaken we actually didnt detect it till after it was at its closest to us which really sucks, but don't quote me on that.

       Oumuamua was the first time you had more mainstream sources legitimately discuss ETs so it's definitely relevant to the theory.

       Exactly why everyone should be skeptical.  Good question though, maybe they have prepared enough and they know people will have a hard time discerning the difference between real and whatever tricks they have up their sleeve.

       I think this is the most likely option as well, there is just too many nefarious things going on in the world right now for this to be coincidence. It seems like this group is intent on releasing more evidence though, just have to watch how the media spins this whole thing to find out the true nature of what is going on.

       This was brought to my attention in
       <a href="/r/UFOs">
        /r/UFOs
       </a>
       , is that private and commercial space flights (SpaceX etc.) are becoming mainstream, UFOs will be harder to hide when these programs literally take off, and the public begins to start asking questions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another rabbit-hole theory is that these UFOs are connected with Antarctica in some way, such as lost ancient technology and / or civilizations.  As climate change appears to be accelerating, this ice will melt and it will become impossible to hide these discoveries, so they can stay one step ahead by releasing information as needed.  I personally think this is the most far-fetched of them all but I'm keeping tabs on possibilities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I agree it is strange, sudden, and unprecedented.  I'm very excited and scared for what 2018 has to offer.

       Do all four points end with it being alien technology, or could point 4 be along the lines of "we saw these things, we don't know what they are, but they are a threat."  Then in 6 months, 6 weeks even, " we figured it out and this is advanced North Korean, Russian, or ISIS weapons tech using rare earth minerals from Mongolia, Yemen, or some other place,  and therefore we need to build an extensive and expensive defense system to protect ourselves."
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe we figured this out 5 years ago, sorry about the $21 trillion, and just so you know we need $21 trillion more, this is nasty shit."

       Just throwing this out there. After 70ish years in pop culture most people have ideas of what an alien or UFO would look like. If you create a technology that looks and acts like what people think aliens would look like, you could make attacks with that tech and say "Wasn't us, must have been those pesky aliens."

       Everything I've read leaves me with three questions. Why send a $70 million jet, armed only with dummy missiles, to check up on these things? Why end a program that has recovered unidentified materials? Why store the materials in a city in the middle of the desert instead of at one of the facilities outside of the city, yet still in the middle of the desert?

       I think Iran thinks the same as you do. From this article released the same day as the one the new York times dropped about 2004 ufo incedents. They believe these are man-made and happen to be doing stuff in places that the United States has an interest in. I'm not sure how credible this site is but it's an interesting read.

       I've come to suspect that we're living through the events of Revelation as we speak, though it's unclear whether Revelation predicted our current timeline, or whether someone is purposefully creating events that mimic what was written in the Bible, so as to bring about what they expect to be the second coming of Christ.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, the resemblance of the biblical text to our current times is often uncanny.

       I wouldn’t worry about rape and pillage - almost everything on earth can be found in much greater and easier to access quantities in our roid belts (and no doubt wherever the alien homework’s is), and asteroids are less likely to fire nukes at your mining operations

       He had mentioned the book he read to a relative who directed him to the official. He phoned him and after stating the book he read, he had said everything you read is true plus more. If he is lying, he is very very good at it to say the least. Saw the link here a day or two ago.

       Well on 4, i meant it to differ from 3 by being the plan of the current administration rather than a rogue element acting in its own self interest, im just brain storming scenarios of who I think stands to benefit and what is possible. I don't have any links to these ideas, I just wrote them based on the new UFO pentagon story and the missing 21 trillion dollars.

       ok so  #3 says the actual administration aint in on it and #4 says the current administration is in on it.
      </p>
      <p>
       then it cant be #3. its a combination of #2 and #4. i revise my analysis. the reason why it cant be 3 is because if the current administration wasnt in on it then they wouldnt have released anything.

       How do you figure?  If we found alien life wouldn't we be interested in it?  As a child you may have found some bugs under a rock or maybe came across a caterpillar or praying mantis.  What did you do?  You probably stopped to check it out.  As a matter of fact if you saw a praying mantis right now you probably would stop and check it out.  Probably even take a photo of it and share it on social media too.  Why wouldn't an alien species be interested in us?

       i dont think they would come themselves. they would use quantum entanglement to communicate over large distances with robotic probes that come here to casually and passively take what they want from us or exterminate us. we will never meet them though. they have better shit to do.

       Personally I think it's number 2. A bit of national defense, and a bit of renewing America's manufacturing sector by building exotic technology reverse engineered from their 70+ years of UFO study.

      <p>
       Nobody is going to fuck with a country who can fly around the globe and disable nukes in a heartbeat. Everyone will want to be friends with a country who can build exotic energy and propulsion systems. Everyone will pay top dollar for that tech, ensuring that the USA is both economically and militarily dominant again (because those designations are quickly slipping away).

       A couple things -
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There isn't much confirmed about the $21 trillion figure. Previous estimates were a lot less than that, but still in the trillions
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The missing money is a little deceiving. The vast majority of it is probably due to poor accounting practices rather than anything sinister. It isn't trillions being spent on secret programs, it's the amount of their actual budget over the years in which they haven't detailed their transactions enough to satisfy potential audits. This includes things as small as HVAC maintenance. It makes it sound like there's the normal operations budget, plus trillions going missing, when that's not the case. There is 100% a problem here, just not really evidence of what you're implying

       While I agree the number is not accurate most likely, hvac and poor accounting will not be the case for anything close to even just one trillion dollars. That is a rediculous amount of money and resources like that cant just go unaccounted for. They may not be related at all, just a strange coincidence that these stories are both out with in such a small time frame from one another.

       The pentagon budget is a little over $500 billion a year. You get into the trillions when you look at the pentagon budget (plus additional spending) over multiple years. This is what that refers to. Their bookkeeping practices have made it so all this money can't be
       <em>
        technically
       </em>
       accounted for by an audit, but it's (at least mostly) money spent on their expected operations. It's not evidence for or evidence against anything really. It's not trillions
       <em>
        on top of
       </em>
       their normal spending, it is their normal spending, which could include some secretive shit but we can't determine anything from that
      </p>
      <p>
       It's like if I give you $20 to buy dinner, and you don't bring back the receipts or provide statements. The money's considered unaccounted for even if I see you come back with some lasagna you didn't finish.

       It's hard telling. If the release of this information was intended as a distraction then it wouldn't seem that it was very effective as a distraction. Sure, we're talking about it here and it has been featured by the mainstream media. But it's not exactly like everyone is eaten up with talking about it or even that focused on it. Of course this could just be the start of a way larger distraction.
      </p>
      <p>
       I like possibility 1. Not pertaining to necessarily an individual, but to a foreign government. There may be some sort of agreement between us and other foreign powers that the world doesn't need to know about this kind of stuff. That's a total assumption. But if it were true then there would be no guarantee that that kind of agreement could stand forever. If we thought another nation was on the brink of disclosure, we might start doing a little soft disclosing ourselves. Of course I'm pretty sure people who buy into the NWO would disagree with this totally. Not that I don't buy into it, but the jury is still out.

       Reid leveraged political clout to pursue a pet project and secured $20M which was enough to get him to shut up from people who were downright sick of hearing about his "UFO thing." Plus, since their names would never be attached to it it was basically win-win. Make Reid happy, and at best discover something amazing and at worse it was a pittance compared to trillions earmarked for other military projects.

       The so-called "artifacts" are probably just fragments of odd alloys created over the years for various special access projects filtered his way by 3rd parties who are not privvy to the special access projects they came from. I mean just because you get a Likewise, the DOD was forced to release some small tidbit video under pressure from Harry Reid and his team. Why? Because a lot of people probably owed Harry Reid a favor and Harry probably believes in aliens and has people from all over the world including NASA pilots telling him flat out they've seen aliens.
      </p>

       Until we see more evidence or more statements from the DOD it would be impossible to pick one of the five options.

       Agreed, they said they have more to release as well, so hopefully they have some real scientific data released on the material found otherwise this is going to grow more and more skeptical. The minimal funding for something so seemingly important if true is key here.

       Scenraio 3, hoax by the deep state is best supported by the evidence. We know they have been trying to make functioning flying saucers since WWII, even though they are aerodynamically inferior to a fighter jet.

       It seems like a psyop, but I'm not sure it'll result in BlueBeam per se, or that it'll culminate in a big event as soon as 2017/2018. I think this is a "long play" psyop, and it serves several different purposes:
      </p>
      <p>
       -- Divert attention from more pressing issues, e.g. Pedogate and the missing Pentagon trillions.
-- Justify the militarization of space, to bolster the MIC. 
-- Unite humanity against a "common enemy". This serves globalism.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think aliens are real, for the record, but this "disclosure" is staged and half-assed.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the purpose was to explain away the missing Pentagon trillions, it's weird that the official narrative states only 22 million were spent.
      </p>
      <p>
       It remains to be seen what happens, but I'll be surprised if they actually try to pull of a BlueBeam-like scenario as early as 2018.

       Because when you dangle the carrot for too long people start looking away and not caring.  So sometimes you have to dangle more carrots, or different ones.  Personally, I don't like carrots.  I don't think they really exist.

       What if the disclosure is so that they can dress up as aliens and decimate the population without fear of retaliation?

       I would hope that if they try to pull some kind of alien scam that people will be smart enough to see through it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there was an alien race with the technology to cross the universe and they wanted to take over the world, it wouldn't be an invasion like independence day or war of the worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
       All they would have to do is create a lethal incurable super virus that attacked only humans. They could probably wipe out everyone on the earth in a year and never have to fire a shot.

       If NYT released the Patterson-Gimlin footage, everyone would start believing in bigfoot. I've seen shit tons of more convincing UFO footage than what was released the other day. Hopefully this will at least get people to start looking into it

       A lot of information is actually now declassified. Have you heard of RAND corp? You know, the big political consulting agency?

       This is what they think about UFOs. Granted, this is an old document. But if you use Google and look for source documents by government agencies I think you might be surprised that many official docs are now public.

       I am not a conspiracy theorist.   I am skeptical of my government and this has the stale smell of an old plan to scare the shit out of the ignorant US citizens.

       To their credit releasing this info right before Christmas is kinda brilliant.   Think about it, this will be discussed over the dinner table as we stuff our fat mouths.
