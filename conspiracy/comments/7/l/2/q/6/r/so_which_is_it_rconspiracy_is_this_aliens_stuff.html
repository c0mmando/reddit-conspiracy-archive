    <div class="md"><p>donny junior, aka Uday, goes on national TV yesterday claiming a secret government cabal at the <em>HIGHEST</em> levels (his words, which we are to assume means higher than trump and pence and congress?) is working to undermine his dad, but r/conspiracy is saying all of these alien &#39;revelations&#39; recently are not the responsibility or results of the trump administration but rather Harry Reid, the globalists, Hillary and the &#39;left&#39;.</p>

<p>So which is it?</p>

<p>These alien stories are all fake so the globalists/NWO can take over,</p>

<p>or trump and co are behind it and it&#39;s all fake,</p>

<p>or aliens are real?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>99.9% or more of UFO and alien information is either mistaken human objects (planes, weather balloons, etc.), mistaken natural phenomena, or simply outright fabrications.  </p>

<p>99.9% is a number that was simply made up to convey the enormity of the misinformation, and is in no way meant to be a scientific number.  But, it&#39;s very close to accurate.</p>

<p>There ARE real, human contacts (I am living proof).  </p>

<p>I am almost certain this latest flare-up of UFO hype is nothing more than a fad based on some information that has been released recently (even though the information itself is old).    The government DID/DOES have projects with respect to alien life and technology.  The have been in contact with aliens.  And for the most part, you&#39;ll never know much about it except what they want you to know for distraction.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>from this article;</p>

<p>I was told by a person who had been with us at a Stone Chamber that on a persons property who had an Ancient Chamber on the land saw a light come out of it when they went into the Chamber according to the story the person once in the Chamber ended up walking into another unknown land area that was beautiful with green grass and blue skies . </p>

<p>When the person went back the way they came . 
Once again they appeared back in the backyard in the dimension they resided in here now. </p>

<p>The Stone Chambers many of them have yet to be found and some said to be active with stories of beings coming out of them and going in then disappearing. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>i just watched a documentary on these stone chambers on amazon video. people have ben assaulted by unseen entities inside these chambers. numerous witnesses on separate occasions saw people wearing bizarre long hooded cloaks come out, and also go into these chambers. some witnesses were even approached and passed out after looking into the large, very bright round ball the beings were carrying. they woke up much later, similar to abductees. nexus magazine did an article on this years ago. once, a large group of these cloaked &#39;&#39;people&#39;&#39; were clearly seen walking through the woods and actually crossing a desolate dirt road, before disappearing into a chamber.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are too many mis-aligned agendas for this information to be faked from the top-down. And also, there&#39;s been so much credible information confirming the existence of alien beings/visitations/craft/etc., that the formal disclosure isn&#39;t a big shock. It shouldn&#39;t be, at least. Not if you&#39;ve been paying attention to the information flow over the past 50 years. </p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting to me are those who doubt this information <em>only because</em> it comes from credible military and private sources. If that&#39;s why there&#39;s doubt, in what package could this information be accepted? IOW, there&#39;s an implicit &quot;No True Scottsman&quot; fallacy being played out by doubters of this very credible set of information. </p>

<p>First, it&#39;s not from &quot;The Daily Alien Report&quot;. It&#39;s from the NYT. Secondly, the sources are from people who have no reason to lie. They wouldn&#39;t make money from lying about alien tech. It&#39;s a fantastic claim, so why make it unless it&#39;s true? If it&#39;s bullshit, they just shot themselves in the foot. Billionaires don&#39;t need &quot;get-rich-quick-scams.&quot; They&#39;re already billionaires. </p>

<p>If one takes all the available data and over laps it for consistency, it looks reliably credible that this disclosure and all its accompanying implications are in fact true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve had some experiences. That said, until the alleged aliens waging secret wars all around us while pretending to be enlightened advanced and millions of years old sort out their foolishness. I say wtf and get your shit together or fuck off. </p>

<p>Or. Step up and out into the everyday slog we call 21st century society as an actual alien. Get a driver&#39;s licence and start helping out by creating better things. </p>

<p>Or. It&#39;s all a play between the conscious mind and the subconscious mind, DNA, and body chemistry within a certain vibratory octave presenting frequencies that present as sound heat light gravity ect. </p>

<p>Or... there are a million of them. </p>

<p>My bet. If an alien civilization hasn&#39;t inserted enough of itself in terms of DNA into our planet, they would not be able to provide an appropriate path for an &quot;alien&quot; mind/soul to incarnate on earth and forget it was an alien in the first place. Then. It&#39;s just a baby. </p>

<p>I guess Carl Sagan is right. We are all starstuff in a multidimensional way. </p>

<p>Anyhow. Back to our regularly scheduled societal slog.  Gotta go to the market. Making curried chicken for dinner tonight. It&#39;ll be delicious.</p>

<p>Do aliens even really matter in all of this? Really?</p>
