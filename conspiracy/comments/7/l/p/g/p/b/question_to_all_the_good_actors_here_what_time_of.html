Before this time, I get one or two nice logical reasonable comments. Then around 10 EST they all turn up with all crappy illogical distractive comments, and it isn&#39;t now flooding in as one or two comments, but 4-5 of them as if coodinated.</p>

<p>And to make my argument more compelling, before 10 EST, I have some decent ups then suddenly at around 10 EST get voted the fuck out down to zer0. Wonderful :D feeling paranoid :DDDD</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the existence of CTR and Shareblue, and their stated missions, make it a pretty obvious possibility. Then you have shit like Elgin AFB that makes it a certainty.</p>

<p>That is just 3 groups. We aint even dipping into big pharma or pro reputation management outfits.</p>

<p>Ya, it&#39;s a big problem, I think most of us that have been here awhile know the difference between dissenting opinions and shills. I got people on here I don&#39;t agree with at all, but we know and respect each other well enough to have civilized conversations. These users are without doubt the most important to me. I don&#39;t want to live in an echo chamber either, no honest user here does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent a lot of time looking for manipulation on Reddit and while there is a lot, it&#39;s nothing like what a lot of people here claim.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the odds of someone interacting with an actual shill on this sub are close to zero. </p>

<hr/>

<p>That said, I&#39;ve seen 2 main issues regarding manipulation here:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Spam blogs. </p>

<p>This was a daily issue for awhile, but I haven&#39;t seen any recently. Spammers would steal content from the most-upvoted submissions here, post it on their spam blog, repost, and upvote it with alts.</p></li>
<li><p>Trolls and sock puppets. </p>

<p>For whatever reason, there are a few people here that use many accounts. Ironically, they often make posts complaining about shills or other trolls.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Examples:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7f39tq/roy_moore_is_no_predatorlove_between_an_older_man/dq98vqm/">This group</a> of over 25 accounts. They would make self posts, then reply with alts. You can see them testing out some of the accounts here: <a href="https://archive.is/aI3Cv">https://archive.is/aI3Cv</a></p>

<p>All of those accounts have since been suspended. They came back recently with another group of accounts but were spotted and banned quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7ci8dy/what_is_the_point_of_top_minds_of_reddit_is_it/">This user</a> appears to admit to using 40+ accounts over the past year or so. They also admitted using alts at least one other time: <a href="https://archive.is/97B26">https://archive.is/97B26</a></p>

<p>If that&#39;s true, it&#39;s significant because there are over 200 different threads where more than one of those accounts appears at the same time.</p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I have over 20 accounts, half of them banned. Why? Because you cannot deny that this sub has been infiltrated by shills and mods with political and corporate agendas, so are you saying that it doesn&#39;t exist? If you do deny this then you&#39;re blind and part of the problem. If you don&#39;t deny this, then how can anyone operate here without saying something minuscule that offends snowflakes, THEN get downvotes the fuck out, then MODs see the massive downvoted comment THEN you get banned. Having many accounts is a reality for many here. </p>

<p>IMO some MODs here are not on the up and up, and I believe are not what they seem. IN MY OPINION AND I SAY IT CLEARLY, I am not attacking the MODs (I have to say this because even when I say this sentence, I may even get banned for this comment. ANd screenshotted anyway) but strange they allow posts that are clearly shills and trolls in certain subjects, especially in politically pro left charged posts, but take you down for small infractions. IN MY OBSERVATIONS. Then when you ask why you get banned, they ban you for contracting the mods for 72 hours??? What? I have many screens of these so it is a fact. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. I think this sub thinks to highly of itself. A lot of people here think they are researching but honestly, they don’t have the training to do so. There’s so much bias it just turns into confirmation. They look for answers that bolster their idea and if you say they are wrong and expound, you are called a shill. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think they are a &quot;problem&quot; other than to casual onlookers who evaluate truth by number of upvotes. They also prevent real content from reaching the front page. And they&#39;re extremely annoying. </p>

<p>So yeah maybe they are a problem.  But yes they definitely exist. You see the same users show up on cue to defend their assigned topics. A user whose name rhymes with Sockran shows up in about 99% of Apollo moon landing threads to tell people we went to the moon but it&#39;s unclear what conspiracies, if any, he actually does subscribe to. </p>

<p>Like the time someone replied to me, then posted the exact same reply verbatim to 4 other posts within 30 minutes. And it was a wordy reply, and in some cases was not overly congruent with the discussion. Then when I pointed this out in a response, they deleted their reddit account entirely.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If someone&#39;s entire comment history is speaking <em>against</em> conspiracy theories, especially if they are focused on disparaging and discrediting one in particular, why would they be allowed to frequent a conspiracy sub?</p>

<p>If I went to the NFL or NBA subreddits, and constantly called people retards and said basketball and football were stupid, I would probably get banned. Even if I didn&#39;t get a ban, the question would arise of why on earth I spent my time on subreddits I had no interest in. This is exactly what happens here.</p>
