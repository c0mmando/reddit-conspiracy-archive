<p>At some level, everyone realizes that mainstream life is crazy and extreme because it is so artificial and hectic, and because it is so physically and psychologically unhealthy. Everyone also realizes, at some level, that mainstream life is crazy and extreme because everyone is being played. They know (at some level) that <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/they-live-cabal-nwo-conspiracy/">both parties and most so-called alternatives are all on the same side</a>. They even know that the mainstream believes absurdities and commits atrocities, and yet, the mainstream is even crazier and more extreme than that, because at some level, everyone realizes that they are addicted to it, and that they are doing nothing to fix it and nothing to learn the scope of the problem—except to occasionally listen to the mainstream media and vote for mainstream politicians ...</p>

<p>Everyone knows, at some level, that the mainstream is crazy and extreme and that any salvation will have to come from outside the mainstream (and the fake alternatives), and thus the craziest and most extreme aspect of the mainstream is that whenever anyone outside the mainstream tries to tell them anything that contradicts the mainstream narrative, they call that person crazy and extreme!</p>

<p>Instead of embracing reality, individuals in the mainstream prefer to double down on the failed, flawed, fatal policies of the past ... rather than risk looking extreme.</p>

<p>The mainstream will support Hillary or Trump ... rather than risk looking extreme.</p>

<p>The mainstream will support taxes and war ... rather than risk looking extreme.</p>

<p>The mainstream will support corruption, injustice, and tyranny ... rather than risk looking extreme.</p>

<p>The mainstream will sacrifice their integrity ... rather than risk looking extreme.</p>

<p>The mainstream will sacrifice their money, time, and health ... rather than risk looking extreme.​</p>

<p><a href="http://endofinnocence.com/roy-derangement-syndrome-double-standard-cognitive-dissonance/">The mainstream will sacrifice their friends and family ... rather than risk looking extreme.</a></p>

<p>In the ancient war of <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/?s=makers+vs+takers">Makers vs. Takers</a>​, the mainstream will side with the Takers ... rather than risk looking extreme.</p>

<p>As the ﻿﻿<a href="http://endofinnocence.com/the-soul-of-animals/">Soul of Animals</a> tries to exterminate the <a href="http://endofinnocence.com/the-soul-of-humanity/">Soul of Humanity</a>, the mainstream will side with evil ... rather than risk looking extreme.</p>

<p>To know that the mainstream is crazy and extreme and that any salvation will have to come from outside the mainstream, and to then sacrifice everything to ensure that only the mainstream media, the mainstream experts, and the mainstream authorities are allowed to change the mainstream narrative ... well ... that&#39;s just batshit crazy.</p>

It&#39;s apparently one of TV&#39;s highest rated series. I was bemused and amazed by what incredible bullshit it was. Phony, full of celebrity worship, societal management and mostly shitty songs.

<p>It sure answered a lot of my questions about the way those family members go about life and relate to others. I couldn&#39;t understand how people could be so blank and absent. It&#39;s because that&#39;s how people are &quot;supposed&quot; to be. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Does anyone really think that the only bad behavior perpetrated by these so called elites is whatever we see in the MSM? I first realized how they won&#39;t go deeper when I saw how much the Republicans invested in attacking Bill Clinton over Monica Lewinsky, while practically ignoring everything else. Look at how Obama is still untouchable. Even the attacks on George Bush were just name calling and empty threats.</p>

<p>He&#39;s untouchable because he&#39;s clean as far as sexual misconduct goes. Same with George Bush. What are you talking about? You&#39;re assuming that these two are doing nefarious things in their personal lives with no evidence to support it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You just answered your own question. Sexual misconduct is usually fair game, as I had already explained with the example of Bill Clinton, because it rarely threatens the illusion of legitimacy. Now a pedo ring that has been covered up by the FBI and goes all the way to the top would threaten the illusion of legitimacy, so don&#39;t expect to see that in the MSM. Also, Obama has plenty of sexual misconduct, but he is more untouchable than perhaps any other politician--partly because the useful idiots in the MSM worship him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey shillbo, this fallacy might work in worldnews or politics but not here. The US is a corporatacracy ruled by the uniparty and has been since JFK. To say otherwise, you have to ignore reality. We literally just had an election with two of the most hated people in our country vying for the top office in the USA. If that doesn&#39;t show how utterly broken our system is, nothing will.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not trying to argue that the system isn&#39;t broken. I think it is. But the fact that Clinton and Trump are so hated says more about the people of our nation than it does about the system itself. It&#39;s not like everyone hated Clinton and Trump. People who loved Clinton hated Trump, and visa versa. We are a deeply divided country. </p>

<p>And you&#39;re ignoring the main point of what I was saying: the two parties are not the same. They don&#39;t vote the same way. They don&#39;t craft the same policy. They don&#39;t argue based on the same assumptions. They don&#39;t have the same code of ethics. They&#39;re different in so many ways. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The combined agenda moves forward no matter which party is in charge.

    <div class="md"><p>I disagree with your assertion that the parties are moving away from each other and have been since the 80&#39;s.  Bill Clinton&#39;s presidency was basically the start of neo-liberalism in which the idea of socially liberal views towards rights were continued but on the economic side they would side with the Republicans and support big business despite the cost to their social ideals.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d also point out that most of the major donors on the federal level donate to candidates in both parties.  This could be seen as hedging the bets but in my opinion its a case of influencing both sides.</p>

<p>Lastly, what the parties&#39; individual platforms are have very little to do with how they actually vote.</p>

<p>Source that major donors donate to candidates in both parties? I can&#39;t remember which paper I read, but there was good evidence that big donors donate almost exclusively to candidates for one party or the other (with some exceptions, most notably pre-president Donald Trump). </p>

<p>And yes, the platform is nonbinding, but looking at how they actual vote (e.g. DW-NOMINATE) gives the same basic results. </p>
