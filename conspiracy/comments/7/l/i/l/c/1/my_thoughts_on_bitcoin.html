       My Facebook friends would call me crazy for posting this. But I really think Bitcoin is a legal money laundering system made by the government to help us move towards a cashless society. They are simply taking dollars and making it numbers on a screen, which then takes physical dollar bills out of circulation.
      </p>

       Does anyone else think it's weird how we don't even know who the creator is of Bitcoin?

       Explain. Most US dollars are already digital. My digital bank account received digital dollars from my employer via direct deposit. I bought bitcoin on Coinbase with digital US dollars from my digital bank account.  No physical money changed hands.

       I️ think he possibly means putting physical money into ATM’s, banks, etc. then it turning into digital money in his bank account which he then purchases his digital cryptocurrency with. Maybe one day in the future when a decent amount of currency has been transferred into digital currency it will “crash” and then all their physical money will be with the banks and the government which they will control? I️ don’t know, it’s just a loose theory.

       Let's reiterate that the money you earn is digital, put into a digital bank, and digital dollars buy crypto. No real dollars are exchanged unless you use Local Bitcoins to pay cash for a Bitcoin to some random person on the street.

       The creator of Bitcoin probably assumed his life was going to be in some form of danger as soon as his white paper went public &amp; began to be understood for what it was. Hopefully he keeps his cover for the rest of his life. That document was essentially a genius's angry, bitter reaction to the 2008 financial crisis, and the bullshit bank-bailouts that followed. He basically said "You know what, fuck this, I've had enough... suck on
       <strong>
        this
       </strong>
       , motherfuckers" and the Satoshi White Paper was born.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin was the tip of the spear, but the REAL important part was the blockchain technology. This decentralized technology, which was designed simply to facilitate the new currency, was truly about wresting control of currency from the hands of Central Banks. That is truly what this is about. But it will become so much more than that in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       New technology disrupts old business models.. no reason banking can't be disrupted either. They are just businesses after all. Central Banks are a powerful cartel of those kinds of businesses, almost like OPEC.  They may want to go cashless, partly for easier control, partly for saving transaction costs to shareholders (we practically are cashless already btw, I rarely withdraw actual cash anymore myself), but they absolutely DO NOT want it decentralized, out of their control, with a
       <em>
        public ledger
       </em>
       keeping track of all transactions, which updates permanently &amp; immutably within seconds, around the entire globe..no sir they do not! Among other things, it makes the need for 3rd party controls pretty much obsolete. That's the main issue at hand: the decentralized, anonymous nature of the blockchain. It can't be controlled by authorities. They would have a better chance of shutting off the entire internet than taking control of the global blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin/blockchain will have some technical growing pains in the early phases, but it isn't going anywhere &amp; it
       <em>
        absolutely
       </em>
       is the bane of central bankers. It eliminates a need for them
       <strong>
        completely
       </strong>
       . It disrupts a business they've had control over for literally thousands of years. It will get bloody, but the war was won when the blockchain was
       <em>
        created
       </em>
       . It's too late to control it now, whether they know it or not, but that's not to say they won't retaliate &amp; be brutal about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The major, unspoken concern on the horizon is the advent of quantum computing, but that is a concern for both sides. That threat will come &amp; be scary for a few days/weeks/months, but it will dissipate quickly as quantum computing becomes the new norm for high-capacity computing all around. Believe me, the current &amp; growing crop of genius bitcoin millionaires/billionaires will make sure QC is in their hands probably the very instant (if not sooner)  it is in the hands of central bankers, keeping the cryptography safe. Besides, you can always keep your bitcoin keys in a physical wallet &amp; wait it out.
      </p>
      <p>
       Blockchain is not currency or an asset class, it won't ever be a bubble. Blockchain is closer to the creation of the Gutenberg Press... times a million. I understand the fear. But Central Banks fear it far more than you do, I promise you. Not to go all rabbit-hole on you, but what this represents is an inevitable development of any sufficiently advanced, sentient species.. whether to free themselves from bondage (as in our case) or simply because it's plain old common sense for a smart global currency, it is an inevitable stage of development for any evolving civilization. And here we are at the cusp of it.. Exciting &amp; scary times!
      </p>
      <p>
       No time for a
       <strong>
        TLDR
       </strong>
       right now, but if this thread still exists later I'll try to drop in &amp; make one.

       Not really because you can use a Bitcoin tumbler - one adress that makes thousands of transactions simultaneously on behalf of someone else. Of course there's a fee for the tumbler.

       If it's money laundering, it's not legal. That's kind of the whole point.

       The inventor of bitcoin probably understood the political ramifications of his efforts, so he contributed it to society anonymously.

       A year ago, M1 (money supply in circulation) was about $3.3 trillion. Only $1.33 trillion is in actual cash, changing hands. The rest is in checking accounts and bank checks. 2/3 of that cash is held outside the USA.
      </p>
      <p>
       M2 was $13 trillion. That includes savings accounts and money market accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Actual physical cash is already just a small percentage of value exchanged in the economy. The vast majority of transactions occur digitally or in non-cash paper transactions.

       Yes. We know who maintains it though. There is a large community of developers who make changes only by consensus. The entire history of all bitcoin transactions is transparent. The source code is open source. It's volatile - for sure (a risky investment), but the network is safe. The exchanges &amp; apps that use that network, however, are as subject to hacking as any other bank, exchange, or financial institution.

       You need to understand how crypto currency works. Read up on Bitcoin, blockchain, etc.. Crypto is a tool for the people who aren't tied to the 1%  Regular people becoming millionaires is not something the govt is going to take lightly. They already started stealing people's money from Bitcoin earnings. A decentralized monetary system is exactly what we need to eliminate the fed, and the banks.

       There's a big difference between Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. While Bitcoin may be a government scheme, it is very doubtful that all the others are too.
      </p>
      <p>
       The government doesn't know how to handle this right now other than having exchanges that you have to verify your I.D. to use, meaning you are no longer anonymous. They control cryptocurrency right now by controlling the institutions that exchange crypto for fiat. But once someone is in the system using something more private than Bitcoin there isn't much they can do. It's a big wait and see what happens game right now, but Bitcoin probably won't be the most important cryptocurrency in the future due to it's energy costs and privacy flaws.

       When do you actually touch cash in real life? I get paid via direct deposit. Last time I had some cash was going to the casino, withdrawing $200 (having to pay a fee to have my money taken out), and then winning some money and going back to the bank to deposit. Seems like a big waste of time to do all that and also with the fees attached makes it even more undesirable. Spent a lot money on Christmas so far, never even touched it physically. Can a millionaire go to the bank right now and withdraw all his money? Prolly not.

        The Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index tracker puts Bitcoin's current estimated annual energy use at almost 32 terawatt-hours, roughly equivalent to Serbia's yearly electricity consumption and ahead of at least 159 other countries, including Ireland and most nations in Africa.

      <p>
       Your using a metric of an appliance used by the entire planet versus mining farms which are still in their infancy. The ignorant masses(such as yourself) are just now catching wind of bitcoin and in the last six months mining has become much more lucrative. Pair this with an increasingly complex algorithm and bitcoin's energy consumption will increase immensely. Perhaps your far to ignorant to google bitcoin energy projections? Just FYI, it's estimated by 2020 that BTC will consume more energy than the US.

       The price of bitcoin is decided by consensus, like the price of a commodity like gold. Why is a US dollar worth what it is worth? As long as people are willing to agree on a value, it's worth something.
There are protocols built into the bitcoin network that determine how many bitcoins are in circulation at any time. To use the bitcoin network, every user has a history of every single transaction in the entirety of bitcoin's existence. Bitcoin is decentralized - as opposed to the US dollar which is centralized to the Fed and banks.

      <p>
       The vast majority of US dollars are already digital. They are literally numbers on a screen. The dollars in your bank account are not backed by physical dollar bills.

       How so? Bitcoin can't simply "go down". That would essentially be the same as the whole internet going down. The bitcoin network is peer-to-peer. You'd have to take out literally every node on the network.

       Yes it does. Today it's priced at ~12k USD per bitcoin.

       Bitcoin is a tiny, tiny fraction of the total value in the economy. Bitcoin dropped 30% TODAY. No stock market crash.
      </p>
      <p>
       You've made several assumptions about a technology that you have reservations about (understandable - bitcoin has a learning curve and is very new relative to other store of value) but haven't done the research.

       Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked. Individual wallets have been broken into via social engineering. Bitcoin itself has not been hacked.

       the exchanges get hacked, this exchanges are sites where a guy bought a lot of coins and is selling to people, or where people transact among themselves with the site as escrow, the system is intact, these hacks barely even register on the price anymore, that was the whole reason for the 2013 crash from over $800 to $30, a hack scared the people, they recently caught that guy and the market stayed the same, those events are meaningless in the big scheme, bitcoin is freedom from the banks

       sure, but that is low security, just a look into "cold storage" should relieve your worries of having it stolen

       Its very clear to people who understand how simple the whole thing is, like most bright insights, the combination of parts that is bitcoin is a simple recipe, key cryptography + proof of work + hashes + open source architecture + the free internet, it is simple in hindsight, we have had all the parts since the 2000s, that is why it has value, cause you can explain how its safe, the only way it can go wrong is if they can access the devices of people to steal passwords, and even then there are ways to take your bitcoin off the net and keep it "cold storage", the only way to steal it from you then, would be to make you spit the 12 word recovery key you memorized.
