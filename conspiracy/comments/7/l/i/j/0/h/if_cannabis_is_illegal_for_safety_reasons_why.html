       I'm glad we dont get that crap over here. However we do have to stomach soccer.. a load of overpaid male models who'll hit the floor as soon as someone sneezes in their direction.

      <p>
       I have to admit i was a big soccer fan, i loved it in the 70s and 80s. Back when you had real hard men playing a much tougher game than we see today.

       I dont watch it anymore however, the likes of  Beckham and Ronaldo turned me right off.

       That's the stupidest reasoning I've seen in a long time. Not only would approximately 90-95% of the population have no idea how to behave in a post-apocalyptic setting, I'm sure you are also 'turned on' by 'hot models' (or whatever) who also wouldn't be of use in your setting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Secondly, these two individuals are better at providing money in this real world setting than you probably are. Why else would you take the setting to some kind of post-apocalyptic fantasy of yours.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, I'm sure the poster only meant to judge their looks, not their personality or hunting skills, lmao.

       I've watched plenty of movies with helicopter pilots and still i'm afraid i don't know how to fly a helicopter.

      <p>
       What makes you so sure to know how to survive? Because those actors survived no one starved to death at the set? I mean there are plenty of films that show some tactics to survive, but some post apocalyptic Hollywood movies, really???

       Yeah, that just means 90-95% of the population are useless wastes of space indulging themselves in hedonistic luxuries all their lives. I think that's what he was getting at.

       Well, I'm sorry that my play on words joke has you feeling that way. I guess my college degree, career and sarcasm will just have to be enough to get me to sleep tonight. Especially since the latter is responsible for our failure.

       You're right, Chi Girl, money and a title is all you're worth, and the possession of them imminently qualify you for a judge of fruitful masculine behavior...somehow. Thanks for reminding me of that.

       Oh, you needed a dictionary and thesaurus to understand what I was saying? Well, what good was that college degree then?

       EDIT: I like how you tried to make yourself sound important by listing your education credentials, and then accused me of trying to sound smart by using not-very-big words. Read some more of my shit, and you'll see it had nothing to do with trying to impress you. That's how I talk (and I don't even have a college degree, lol). You're the one trying to be impressive here. But a college drop-out's everyday speech is "big" talk to you? Fail.

       For the record, I wasn't trying to be impressive - I think I said I was trying to be funny. You seem like a hoot, so I don't need to "read some more of your shit." I'm just going to carry on with my day.

       You've misunderstood. You were suggesting that
       <em>
        I
       </em>
       was trying to be impressive, by suggesting that I had used a dictionary and thesaurus to come up with big words to throw at you. And you were incorrect. This is how I speak all the time. No one said anything about you being impressive.

       I bet the future of TV will be this putrid abomination of interactive commercial participation.  Where stuff like the NFL or whatever prime-time drama requires the viewer to answer a series of questions after each commercial is over in exchange for your "free" NFL or Big Bang Theory.

       That's a bit misleading because a lot of interesting stuff can happen before the ball is in play. Like the offense making audibles to adjust to the defense.

       Absolutely, a lot of the excitement of football is the circumstances of the game's moment/next play. Almost every play has game changing potential.

       Not just government, probably moreso media and pundits do our thinking these days. They tell us when to trust and when to fear our own government without ever sending the message that we dictate our government, and if we lost faith in it it's because we have failed ourseleves.

       Add to that the governments need to polarize the public in order to keep them from coming after them and you have a recipe for prohibition of mind expanding compounds. Same reasons Mushrooms and LSD are illegal. If regulated and done in a safe environment they would not pose a threat to public safety but to the governments safety and they can’t allow that to happen.

       Interesting. I like shrooms.. and I like to drink.. but I don't really 'crave drinking' alcoholism-style..
      </p>
      <p>
       but, I've looked into it a bit and.. ..have often wondered about the effects the microbiome has on alcoholism.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before rambling about that, there is, of course, the more popular-to-date aspects of shooms' medicinal effects..

      <p>
       my thinking being similar to that: just like you can have fermenting organisms living in your gut/body, you can have organisms that have learned to co-exist and even
       <em>
        depend
       </em>
       on consumption of the fermented sugars
       <em>
        from
       </em>
       these organisms' fermenting.
      </p>
      <p>
       Such as to say, maybe
       <strong>
        <em>
         a
        </em>
       </strong>
       cause of alcoholism (of 'many') is that the organisms' in our microbiome haven't gone so far as to fermenting (in quantity?) so much as to be brewing our
       <em>
        own
       </em>
       booze from all the sugar (
       <em>
        most
       </em>
       ) people consume.. ..at least not to detectable levels..
      </p>
      <p>
       but,
       <em>
        have
       </em>
       'trained' their microbiome to depend on the regular consumption of those fermented sugars via 'the drink'.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we
       <em>
        don't
       </em>
       feed them (the fermented sugars of 'booze'), they can't sustain their numbers, start to die back and, in typical organisms-dying fashion: start to 'rot' inside of us..
      </p>
      <p>
       ..a rotting corpse tends to release more disgustingness at a faster rate than the average
       <em>
        living
       </em>
       organism does.. ..ie, instead of farting slowly, as we rot, 'all the gases' in us get released much.more.quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
       ...spread this across 'lots of organisms' that are either directly-dependent upon the regular-booze-consumption-rate.. ..or the ones dependent on products
       <em>
        those
       </em>
       create.. or, farther, maybe those
       <em>
        dying
       </em>
       allows
       <em>
        others
       </em>
       to grow up in their stead.. ..otherwise normally kept in check
       <em>
        by
       </em>
       the booze-consumers 'normally' fed a regular supply
       <em>
        of
       </em>
       booze.
      </p>
      <p>
       take away the booze, they can't sustain their numbers, they start dying, 'toxins' and/or 'other' start getting released.. at a much faster rate.. from their now-dying/rotting corpses.. ..and, as this happens..
       <em>
        at
       </em>
       an increased rate.. ..we start to feel the (internal) stress from this going on.. ..all the more motivating us
       <em>
        to
       </em>
       drink.. ..if for no other reason than just to deal with the stress.. when, in reality, the drink is
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       <strong>
        <em>
         feeding
        </em>
       </strong>
       the organisms that're causing the distress to begin with.
      </p>
      <p>
       ..this keeps the cycle going, of course.. but..
      </p>
      <p>
       well, going with the cnn and business insider articles, maybe the shrooms simply help 'distract us' from this stress as the transition takes place.. ..but.. maybe there's something 'else' going on as well..
      </p>

      <p>
       Tradd talks about the amazing ways that fungi are capable of evolving defenses &amp; attacks against 'things'.. ..I wonder if the 'magic shrooms' actually have a compound in them (maybe the psilocybin, maybe something else??) ..
      </p>
      <p>
       ..and that compound not only helps alleviate symptoms, but possibly even reduces things that would cause stress? ..by, say, 'tying them up' or something like that?
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, maybe it isn't
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       tied to 'magic mushrooms'..
      </p>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       but 'other' mushrooms could benefit as well?  and/or, maybe there's a psilocybin-free, hemp:pot-like mushroom that still produces the
       <em>
        other
       </em>
       'things' .. .. in one of the other popular mushroom types?
      </p>
      <p>
       ....
      </p>
      <p>
       I've eaten shrooms many times, and found that I actually prefer
       <em>
        less
       </em>
       than more. Like, 'a little' goes a lot farther with me than more-at-one-time.  It still takes 'enough' to get the effects going, but then stretch a bag out over a
       <em>
        longer
       </em>
       period helps me maintain that level.. ..and
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       function quite 'nicely' in society.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not gonna say that I'm no a little f'ed up in my head when it's going on.. like, things definitely are a bit more 'off' than 'just-relaxed'.. but i'm
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       'relaxed-enough' that people tend to be very surprised if they find out that I'm on shrooms.. or that I was on shrooms.. and this is people that've been hanging out with me for 'a while' during that given period of time.. ..not just random bystander passerbys .. so 'functionality in society' seems more than possible on them.. if, again, maintaining a low-grade 'buzz' more than a shroom-'drunk'/'high'.
      </p>
      <p>
       ..
      </p>
      <p>
       combining that
       <em>
        back
       </em>
       with alcohol.. ..wonder what the cost differential would be? I mean, maybe.. going
       <em>
        with
       </em>
       the 'low-grade buzz' level of shrooms... .maybe the cost would be equal-to or just-below .. or just-above the cost of more-regular drinking..
      </p>
      <p>
       such that, maybe do it 'long enough'.. like a week or three.. ..if it wouldn't help to reduce the alcohol consumption enough to have a  more-lasting effect?
      </p>
      <p>
       ex: if it
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       a 'microbiome thing', could the microbiome
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       be adjusted by
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       drinking.. ..thus, feeding organisms that we've sculpted to be a more-regular part of our microbiome
       <em>
        while
       </em>
       drinking.. ...and, kill off enough of those, and give time for others to grow in their place..
      </p>
      <p>
       ..time more-easily afforded
       <em>
        by
       </em>
       shrooms.. ..that when we quit the shrooms too, we could go back to at least a lower rate of alcohol consumption as well a lower-level of 'necessity' behind it?

       <strong>
        Take
       </strong>
       the wikipedia article
       <em>
        on
       </em>
       autobrewery syndrome..
      </p>
      <p>
       in the first paragraph it mentions saccharomyces cerevisiae.. ... 'brewer's yeast'..
      </p>
      <p>
       but,
       <em>
        baker's
       </em>
       yeast (saccharomyces boulardii) is a
       <em>
        sub
       </em>
       set of s.cerevisiae.. so, saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii..
      </p>
      <p>
       and, it has a unique capability.. and extra set of genes ... in addition to s.cerevisiae .. whereby, when 'born' (cell division occurs), the organism 'takes its first breath'.. ..if it 'inhales' fermented sugar, it expresses its boulardii genes and goes on living its life
       <em>
        as
       </em>
       a s.boulardii..
      </p>
      <p>
       but, if its first breath
       <em>
        lacks
       </em>
       fermented sugar, it 'assumes' that there
       <em>
        isn't
       </em>
       enough fermented sugar to go around to be available for it.. so it makes an epigenetic decision to
       <em>
        suppress
       </em>
       its boulardii genes (fermentation-consuming genes) and, instead, to
       <em>
        ex
       </em>
       press its
       <em>
        cerevisiae
       </em>
       genes..
      </p>
      <p>
       whereby, instead of
       <em>
        consuming
       </em>
       fermented sugars (or, 'fermentation as respiration') it consumes sugar (and oxygen).. and then
       <em>
        ferments
       </em>
       it.. ie, 'brewer's yeast'.
      </p>
      <p>
       Once there's enough fermentation going on, the s.boulardii genes of new generations can start expressing their boulardii genes and.. ..well, 'grape juice &gt;to&gt; wine' becomes 'wine &gt;to&gt; vinegar'
      </p>
      <p>
       ...granted, in that case (the case of vinegar), it's bacteria.. and, more-specifically,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetobacter_aceti">
        <em>
         Acetobacter aceti
        </em>
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       but..
      </p>
      <p>
       so... well,
       <em>
        jump
       </em>
       to vinegar.. and, more-specifically, raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar.. that still has 'the mother of vinegar' living in it..
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_cider_vinegar">
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_cider_vinegar
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       ...in these, well, second paragraph of the intro covers it..
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        It is made by crushing apples and squeezing out the liquid. Bacteria and yeast are added to the liquid to start the alcoholic fermentation process, and the sugars are turned into alcohol. In a second fermentation process, the alcohol is converted into vinegar by acetic acid-forming bacteria (acetobacter). Acetic acid and malic acid give vinegar its sour taste.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       so...
      </p>
      <p>
       maybe alcoholics would benefit from consuming ACV? Maybe the acetobacters in ACV would help to build up in the microbiome, consuming any fermentation .. and..well, if combined with the mushroom regimen above, maybe shrooms to help with anxiety then ACV (and 'other') as a way to introduce strains to help compete against the strains that are used to consuming alcohol/fermentation/'fermented sugars'?
      </p>
      <p>
       ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, you can buy s.boulardii in supplement form.. Jarrow Formulas is a good one. Bragg's Apple Cider Vinegar another..
      </p>
      <p>
       Just a theory I've bounced around for a while.  'other' probiotics coming into play to help as well?
      </p>
      <p>
       ..
      </p>
      <p>
       Kombucha has/had this issue.  google: 'whole foods kombucha recall'
      </p>
      <p>
       basically, WF made it a point to recall all their kombuchas because the alcohol content was building up in them the longer they sat on the shelf. In a form of self-regulation, they pulled them and had their suppliers deal with it.
      </p>
      <p>
       The short of it: their suppliers (kombucha brewers) started adding fermentation-consuming strains to their kombuchas.. strains
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       s.boulardii, acv's acetobacters, etc..
      </p>
      <p>
       and, if/when/as the fermented sugars would get high enough, the fermentation-consumers would rise to balance.. consume the sugars, die back some, and 'wait' until more were created.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, inside the bottle was a natural ballast that kept the alcohol content
       <em>
        of
       </em>
       the kombucha
       <em>
        below
       </em>
       regulatory standards such that WF
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       get into trouble.. ..that it was voluntary/preventative was all the more interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
       so, maybe just drinking some kombucha could help with alcoholism?
      </p>
      <p>
       ..and, well,
       <em>
        in
       </em>
       that tradd cotter video above (worth the watch, imo),
       <em>
        like
       </em>
       with that.. maybe the evolution of these (there're 'fungi'...yeast mainly.. in kombucha) would help to keep things in check.. ..at least from a microbiomic-induced perspective?
      </p>
      <p>
       obviously there're 'more reasons to drink' than
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       microbiomic motivations..but.. ..reducing the 'push' from that end may help to bring drinking more into a 'choice' than a 'necessity'-of-sort?
      </p>
      <p>
       throw in some shrooms here &amp; there to take the edge off just-in-case?

        via

       the possible 'attacking properties' fungi are capable of having (Tradd Cotter vid reference).. ..actually serves to help kill

       any brain-fungi ...
       <em>
        fed
       </em>
       by alcohol.. ..that, in turn, not only lowers the need to feed these fungi ('cause they're dead.. and thus less of them), but, also, helps to.. in their absence, allow those neurons to connect more.. and, even possibly
       <em>
        promote

       this connection, not just more-neutrally 'allow' it to happen naturally.

       the brain in
       <em>
        case
       </em>
       supplies get low..  ..and, in a natural/competitive environment, this would balance itself.. in a liquor-store-on-every-corner-that-also-sells-sugar-pop-candy-drinks world of modern civilization, we've gotten to the point where we can have this sugar/alcohol at a level that
       <em>
        far
       </em>
       exceeds the natural order of things.. and also includes
       <em>
        just
       </em>
       fermentation (distillation.. an 'unnatural' process vs just a fermenting mango on the ground somewhere).. and concentrated sugar (ie, 'bubble gum') vs sugar that would also contain all the fiber that sugar-rich foods usually contain

       <em>

       enough natural flora/fauna/'microbes' that a 'less-processed' diet would provide..

       allows 'weeds' to take over our microbiome...

      <p>

       and, back to where I was above..
      </p>
      <p>
       what if these 'weeds' make it into our brain.. and, while there, not just do things mentioned in the previous message, but also consume nutrients our neurons would otherwise need.. and, in expense
       <em>
        of
       </em>
       our neurons..
      </p>
      <p>
       they grow to 'clog the pipes' (or at least the spaces synapses would otherwise exist.. or exist more-freely / less unadulteratedly ... less 'clogged'ly' ) .. .. and, now, with those dead, our brain
       <em>
        doesn't
       </em>
       fight them,
       <em>
        gets
       </em>
       the space,
       <em>
        gets
       </em>
       the nutrients.. and.. ..even potentially, with the mushrooms, gets a 'stimulant' of sort that 'promotes' this all increasing in rate..
      </p>
      <p>
       ..then the effects wear off, the organisms grow back, and .. .. 'the clog' happens again, as well, their demand for alcohol / fermented sugars to feed them.
      </p>
      <p>
       basically, a slave to brain fungus. sleep, work, taxes, paycheck&gt;to&gt;alcohol repeat.   ... alcohol tax -&gt;to-&gt; the man.  rinse. repeat.

       Gut flora may have a bigger impact in brain health than we realize. They process sugars differently depending on how it got there. Take sugar, HFCS or an Apple with its sugar. The apple has fibers and the bacteria extracts the sugar a more natural way. HFCS is like coke for your guy flora, easy fix but not long lasting, no fibers to break down. You should also read into Stoned Ape Man theory -

       basically magic mushrooms help our ancestors brains grow. Could’ve been responsible from going from living in trees with little food to following herds of animals, which poop, and mushrooms grow on cow shit right? These hunters would then take and help hunt at night, or explore the landscape for more mushrooms, help with language and art? Who knows

       Technically, tobacco and alcohol are drugs. If consumed too much, they make you an addict and eventually kill you. 
If consumed moderately, they are fine. Just like cannabis, shrooms, DMT, mescaline and stuff. (AFAIK)
      </p>
      <p>
       If you want to be consistent with the war on drugs, alcohol and tobacco should be banned too.

       Well if we arrested the people who smoked them , we’d have to arrest the people who sold them ... and the government is not gonna screw over the tobacco or alcohol industries , those two industries will thrive no matter how the world or economy are, I wish I had stock in either two during the recession I’d be a multimillionaire by now , because it’s okay for companies to profit as long as the government has a hand in it

       Quitting smoke is like quitting any other substance, you will experience withdrawals. Depending on how much you smoke it sometimes is a terrible idea to quit cold turkey- especially while pregnant. 
I had gradually been cutting back on smoking during the month before even realizing I was pregnant. I had already gone from a pack a day (20) down to less than 10 a day. 
I distinctly remember being sick the weekend before taking the pregnancy test and not even being able to smoke half a cigarette.  The day I took my pregnancy test I had bought a new pack and had smoked 3 cigarettes that day.

       Vaping is less dangerous than smoking, but it's still not too good for you. Vaping to smoking is like beer to vodka- they're both bad, but drinking the same amount of beer compared to vodka is far less bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for quitting while pregnant, smoking while pregnant can cause your child to develop asthma or other breathing problems... at best. At worst, there will be pregnancy complications, including an early birth and even a miscarriage.

       Dude, where did you become a scientist? Your analysis of vaping compared to drinking is out of this world and makes so much sense. Why didn't I think of that? Oh ya, because that would be a logical fallacy! Haha!
      </p>
      <p>
       Please reconsider your fallacious views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I'm very skeptical of your views on quitting while Prego, because of how you handled the first thing..

       I will readily admit that my comparisons often are rather flawed, but you didn't need to be that rude about it.

       As for quitting cold turkey, I actually found that one on
       <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/404_im-pregnant-can-quitting-smoking-cold-turkey-hurt-me-or-my-b_1405526.bc">
        this article.

       Edit: for context, searching for the answer got me only results that agreed with the article, that quitting smoking is only good for the baby.

       Rude? No. Rude is comparing marijuana to alcohol, which is what government sponsored scientists did in Washington state and that's why the cops can charge someone with a dwi for having 75 mg/ml THC/Blood level. In the class they make people go to for getting a DUI, they teach that marijuana impairs drivers. This is not scientific and yet is used to incarcerate people for smoking marijuana whereas before these new laws, that was a grey area and no established method was used to test for levels of marijuana at a traffic stop.

       Perhaps you were unaware of these things. I figured you were with the pigs, you know? The popo? Yeah those tools of oppression that have destroyed the lives of thousands of innocent men women and children, who have suffered, for merely their presence, in a world that says, "get back to work, slaves!"

       Marijuana?

       specifically mentioned cigarettes! I was talking about, y'know, how it's good that a woman who specifically said she smoked
       <em>
        tobacco
       </em>
       stopped smoking it during pregnancy, and correcting the misinformation about how quitting
       <em>
        tobacco
       </em>
       cold turkey can be harmful to the child.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you wanna vape weed while pregnant, that's still an issue, but only because the THC will pass into the child's still-developing body, and we do know that marijuana use in children and teenagers is linked to worse off lives, though whether that's causation or correlation has yet to be determined. Regardless, it's still best to not risk a child's life for getting high until we know for sure.

       I admit, comparing marijuana and alcohol is absurd. Which is why I didn't do it, I compared alcohol and tobacco. Because I was initially responding to someone who was talking about tobacco use during pregnancy, and your response to my comment there implied you were
       <em>
        also
       </em>
       talking about tobacco.

       Logic and reason are not enough alone, some would argue, and that we must commit to the hegelian dialectic. I thought I knew what that meant and then it turns out the concept is way deeper than I knew..so now Im just confused :/

       This is the first time I've even heard of the hegelian dialectic, but it seems rather interesting, albeit with rather complex rules. As far as I can tell, it's based in the following principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Nothing is permanent, everything is changing. That is the nature of time.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Every force has an equal and opposite force.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Gradual change causes one force to overcome its opposite, leading to further change. In other words, change begets change.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Change is not circular, but rather helical. Nothing returns to its original state, not entirely- instead, it can only approach what it once was before further changing.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       It works well enough for debates revolving around human affairs, including politics. It's somewhat lacking for scientific and especially subatomic matters, but then, that's what the scientific method is for.

       I haven't seen the Matrix in years, but I'm not really sure. Honestly, the movie doesn't strike me as one about the ever-shifting nature of reality, but about how reality is always more than what we think it is.

       But the way Neo and Smith fought, and the cycles. They were the two sides, overcoming each other and shifting. Yet there was a final end, where two became one and so the Matrix is very much about the concept of the Singluarity. Well that's the impression I got anyways.

       Here's a book I want to read, that may help. Its called The Matrix And Philosophy, Editted by William Irwin. I downloaded it. It works. Scan it if you feel insecure, but its the pdf book. I have mine set to autodownload. Obviously you dont have to do that, just view it on the web if you want.
      </p>
      <p>
       I googled philosophy the matrix pdf and it was the first hit. There are other books that are similar and maybe say more. If I remember correctly, picking up one of them (maybe this one) and leafing through at a book store was what gave me that idea about the hegelian dialectic.

        Tobacco
       </a>
       is a known carcinogen, meaning it causes cancer. While many effects are a result of smoke inhalation, and vaping can reduce the risks due to using a liquid mist instead of smoke, the fact is that it's still filled with dangerous chemicals that our body simply cannot handle properly. Furthermore, it is addictive as hell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pregnancy literally links your air and blood with the unborn child. As that child is still developing, foreign chemicals that could potentially be toxic to a normal human can majorly effect the baby when ingested, inhaled, or otherwise placed into the mother's system. While vaping is not as potentially lethal as smoking, it can still cause issues.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless, it is entirely possible for your child to be born already addicted to tobacco. And that's ignoring things like arsenic, vinyl chloride, and type-2 diabetes,
       <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/electronic-cigarettes-good-news-bad-news-2016072510010">
        all of which are still released/consumed/caused by tobacco vaping.
       </a>
       Oh! And impaired prefrontal brain development,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex">
        which is responsible for
       </a>
       your personality, planning complex cognitive behavior, ability to differentiate conflicting thoughts... and your will to live.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tobacco use when pregnant can literally cause your child to become suicidal.

       My only qualm was your analogy of hard liquor to beer is as cigarettes is to vaping.  This is not supported by your longwinded above post, nor by the sourcesnor by anything I can lersonally find.  It seems to be pure scare tactics (perhaps due to uniformed opinion) which is disheartening to others in their quest for more freedom from smoking combustible cigarettes and having no other options.
      </p>
      <p>
       So.... Do you still think that analogy holds, even in the slightest?  This analogy, in my researched opinion is simply wrong.  First its start off with the premise all vaporizable liquid is equal to some extent, or perhaps entirely.  That it must have some dangerous assortment of chemicals.  But, for instance, what if one were to solely mix their own vegetable glycerin and/or propylene glycol with nicotine (*optionally the nicotine) rather than buy "sugary" (flavored) shit from god knows where?
      </p>
      <p>
       So...is vaping like a "watered" down combustible cigarette?

       The analogy is that vaping is far less potent compared to smoking, but still has its risks. I will admit that the comparison wasn't perfect, though.

       What is an adult dose of valium? My doc is a bit of a nanny and recommends only taking 1x5mg in the evening. Never during the day and never more than 2? I don't really understand why as he's told me on a seperate occasion that you can't really over do it with vals? It's all very confusing.

       Many people ruin there lives with Valium. It isn't on par with cannabis on terms of health risk and addiction. Valium is no joke and is prescribed, go figure.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a doctor prescribes it, its most likely addicting. Regular refills equals a copious amount of money being made on a regular basis.

       I suspect Alcohol industry working to keep MJ out of competition (WIN), with self serving  Court system and long term incarceration system (WIN -WIN) plus use of convicts on "work re-education-projects, slave labor = WIN WIN WIN. My thoughts only. And I am not a proponent of MJ. Netherlands closing prisons due to no convictions. Think. Ungodly harsh lenghy US convictions to ignorant lower class. Longer sentences than murder in some areas. Judges getting financial and civic awards for harsh sentences and keeping prisons full. My rant can go on but will stop here. Big Money going round and round.

       I believe the people benefit from legalization and they could profit much more, but in the end the empire always profits either way. TPTB invest in big growers and pass ridiculous regulations, and maybe concede to some of us, for a little bit, some of the liberties in their treasure chest. The pharmaceutical companies will adjust. Sure, weed can be legal in some states, if the CIA is importing massive amounts of heroin and cocaine into the US daily.

       The State of Washington, and the Liquor Control Board, won and not the people of Washington. The state set up a list of growers. People outed themselves. Then that list got cut in half and those not in, were out. After that, they sliced the medical market with Initiative 502, and flooded the market with bunk weed at outrageous prices. The patients of Washington state are finally bow able again, to have their own collectives. The State was sure to get theirs first, and to let the patents sort it out quietly off to the side afterwards. That shows the State could care less about the people, the citizens, and care only for lining their own greedy scummy pockets.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then it gets worse. The state got these scumbag "scientists" to say whatever they needed to say, to propose that it's possible to test people for levels of the, and then take their license if they have over what was it? 75 mg/ml THC/Blood? I blew that figure out of the water, by at least five times once, just before a deployment haha! The Army pretended it didn't happen so they could send another boot overseas fuck them haha I'm out bitches!

       Or why don't we give the cigarette smokers a clap and a pat on the back for doing their bit to help with the world's  over population? Hell, they deserve a round of applause for not being a vape fck boi and keeping it real imo.

       I have read a few articles that posed just that reality since cigarette smoking causes early death from heart disease, lung disease and cancer, it should not be banned but encouraged since early dying helps keep the Social Security program viable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Make cigarette smokers the new heroes of financial responsibility.

       Well, reading the 'new heroes' has certainly got my ears pricked back. I shall spend some time reading those links, thanks mate.
      </p>
      <p>
       20 year, 20 or so a day habit myself. On occasions I think fuck I'm sick of these things but more than anything I'm sick of the government and the self righteous fucks that carry on as if smokers are Satan's spawn and the new age lepers. So along with being treated as someone who's I.Q is that of a sweaty arse crack is alone incentive enough for me never to quit. I respect the now not so new laws in my country in regards to smoking in pubs and clubs, in fact I quite like the air not being like a Chinese morning fog inside. I know they aren't going to add years onto my life and shit, maybe some of us are perfectly happy with that, I know I am.
      </p>
      <p>
       The constant demonisation is so fkn tiresome and hypocritical though. When questioned if I'm worried about the dangers of smoking I just ask if they care as much about the fact we all literally scrub a list of chemicals that no one can pronunciate thats as long as the Flemington straight into our skulls via the shampoo and conditioner bottle, give the underarms a nice soaking via a deodorant bottle who's ingredients resembles the shampoo, dress in material that contains plastics and god knows what, sit down on couches that are bathed in anti stain and the like chemicals, consume food thats literally a few chromosomes away from the the plastic its wrapped in and then suck the air in from whats literally big industry's catalytic converter? Oh, and do they honestly think society can afford to destroy the cancer industry via a cure which must be worth billions on the all encompassing whole? I say, 'fuck no and I'll be happily biding my time like a cool cunt, smoking a fag over here and loving it when they feel rhey have an answer for me'.

       Third, yes, there's not a lot of chromosomes separating plastic from certain kinds of food. There's also not a lot of chromosomes separating you from an ape, but anyone who tried to use that as proof you should throw your own shit at people would be, I hope, quickly corrected.

       I wouldn't argue with you mate. Like you say, 'if done correctly'. No doubt there's future if not current farming techniques that will offer an abundance of yield vs the input of energy and natural resources currently used.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in a country that sees enough excess water during the northern states wet season that could/should be caught and piped down to the southern states to aid in agriculture but it's all too hard for anyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not to mention a interior landscape of next to nothing but sunburnt red dust that covers a large enough area that you could breakdown in your car and go weeks if not months before anyone came across you. Station owners literally fly helicopters to the end paddocks to muster any cattle up otherwise it's a 2 day round trip by car. I know it wouldn't be the most attractive sight to sore eyes but then again there's nothing to be there for let alone see anyway! You could install enough solar energy panels that will see nothing but sun 90% of the year that it would make a huge dent in our need for fossil fuels. Again it's either too hard or Im just a bit to radical and non conventional with ideas. Seems  the world on a whole that despite our self congratulatory tendencies towards all things advanced techology is really quite backwards and caveman like in a lot of ways.

       All im pointing out is that in my area of the world  theres an abundant amount of  resources that go to wate. Requires nothing more than the infrastructure to be installed so as to take advantage of 'free' and clean energy. In tandem with improved farming practices and techniques it would help provide for a larger world population. I'm sure that goes for many towns in many countries, which would then show the fearmonger, doom and gloom mouthpieces that we perhaps dont buy the  agenda based bullshit they peddle.

       IF they would use tobacco as some kind of population control, when i get you right there, why they have made safety belts in cars mandatory and don't legalize drunk driving?
      </p>
      <p>
       The only thing i can see not banning tobacco is the amount of taxes generated through smoking cigarettes.
Here in Europe, especially in Germany it's a bit complicated, on one hand it's generating more taxes, on the other hand we have a general health insurance, so it would increase costs of the health system with illnesses caused by Smoking.
In the US it's a bit different, because when you don'T have a health insurance you have to pay your medication/surgery or any other medical treatment yourself. So there in some cases they don't have to care for the costs/illnesses caused by smoking.

       It was illegal well before Nixon. Still, your reason isn't wrong, it was made illegal because of racism against blacks and hispanics and because of money, i.e. William Randolph Hearst.

       The following is a quote from John Ehrlichman, an aide during the Nixon Administration - "You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities, we could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."

       It allllll started due to the paper industry. No joke. The "reasons" have evolved and changed through time, but its start never changed. Hemp was going to completley destroy the paper, and by extension, a large chunk of the timber industry.

Of course, I would support a Supreme Court ruling that the right to exercise religion and/or peaceful protest depending on how you view it (1st Amendment), unreasonable search and seizure (4th Amendment), and the precedents already established that give the right to privacy would overrule the commerce clause. Give Americans the right to use whatever substances they want

       There is no need for drugs to pass between state lines and because they don't need to pas over stateliness the price of pot in one state can not affect the price in another. Also, modern interpretation of that clause obviously does not follow original intent.

But in reality it’s because cannabis has pharmaceutical properties that can treat and cure several ailments but big pharma doesn’t want you to know that. 
If we had a cure for everything, where would profits come from? We live in a sick world! (Pun intended)

       Marijuana is more than a drug to take for pleasure. Its good for a variety of diseases and make a cheap alternative for many things we take chemical pills for. But more importantly, using cannabis or psilocybin makes you less affected by mass hypnosis. Institutions that survive on hypnotizing its followers don't do well when their followers use substances that make them

       given what everyone knows about the DEA, how can those anyone look at those agents and not think "threat to general safety".  by now, its hard to believe anyone who signs up to work for the DEA is genuinely interested in making the US a better place.

       If you wanna ban things for being unhealthy how about starting with sitting in a chair for 40 hours a week, I hear it kills faster than cigarettes these days! Maybe I will take up smoking so I can take more walking breaks and increase my life expectancy.

       Weak argument really. The issue about cannabis is the safety of others. This primarily in regards to driving high or operating heavy machinery. It would be more apt to compare weed to alcohol. Darts, despite giving you cancer, don’t make you act like a knob. For the record I’m a daily cannabis smoker. I’m just clearing up what I perceive to be a bad argument.

       Money is the answer to both your questions. Cigarettes cost money to give you cancer that you then also pay for. Weed is medicinal and on some studies shows benefits, so of course it's made illegal so the courts can make money through you that way.

       Because keeping cannabis illegal means the black market price will remain high, which has a multitude of benefits for the US. govt and foreign govts (mexico, columbia, peru, suisse) such as keeping the cannabis competition away from their pharma corps. own narcotis and giving those agents who actively run the trade a lot of personal wealth at the expense of the junkies getting addicted to the GMO cannabis being tested out this way on the public without (legal) reprecussions, before legalizing the GMO cannabis and netting big profit legally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meanwhile people believe total bogus as "cannabis oil cures cancer" and watch the "cool guys" getting they brains reduced to mush by this engineered poison to get hooked themselves and remain a lifelong costumer (bitch) of the drug pimp and their big pharma bosses.
      </p>
      <p>
       Oh and don't forget the DEA enjoying a big paycheck along with permanent job security for busting kids nuts over a bit of skunk weed their own govt. bosses peddle.

       You know what the sad thing is I bet those people would say cannabis is a drug and tobacco is a plant that's why they're illegal and legal lol. Their arguments are based on the reality the government's have set up for our (white) world where cannabis is classified as a drug and that's that. Cannabis is a mind altering plant therefore a drug, to them, making it worse than tobacco somehow despite the effects being 100x worse smoking ciggies

       Marijuana is illegal for many reasons as discussed in this thread.  Many terrible reasons.  Maybe one or two good reasons (in all honesty)
      </p>
      <p>
       But most importantly and interestingly, it's illegal because its a gateway drug to psychedelics; our collective human key out of the mess the psychopaths in control of most (if not all world) governments have concocted out of illusions.

       Forget all of the negative propaganda behind "gateway", brother.  Im just saying that the existence of one mind altering beneficial, and interesting drug opens one up to the possibility there are
       <em>
        other

       I'm pretty sure that the democrats would have moved forward with banning cigarettes if Trump wouldn't have won.  I was told (just a rumor) it was on their agenda for 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thankfully we have Jeff Sessions as AG because as far as I know (and I follow everything he says), he has no plans to ban cigarettes like the DemoRat liberals would have.  They're always trying to control what we do and say, like banning "Merry Christmas" (I'm so glad we can say it again).
      </p>
      <p>
       And yeah, Sessions might want to lock people up for smoking marijuana, but think about it -- the majority of people who smoke the ganga are loser hippies that exclusively vote democrat, so really, who cares?  We need to make this country great again, whatever it takes.

       Im hoping this is sarcasm all around. Banning cigarettes would hurt my state pretty badly as we are a massive tabacco producer. Now taxing the shit out of them like they do in Australia wouldn't be as bad of an idea because it would lower the amount of smokers and then using the tax hick they could subsidize tobacco farms so they don't lose. It's a win win. Now pot on the other hand is not a majority loser hippies who vote exclusively democrat. I'm a young republican (I do not vote part lines though) and I have smoked regularly in the past. If it were legal I would rather smoke than drink to be honest. Also, head to a state where it's legal and go to a shop, you will see people of all ages and backgrounds. When I was in CO I saw moms, businessmen, yes hippies, and a lot of middle class run of the mill folks. It was actually quite surprising. Open up your eyes the war on marijuana is a farce, by legalizing it federally we could open up an new tax revenue stream, encouraged small business growth in the new market, create jobs, and stop this unnecessary spending on this so called war.

       For the record, I wasn't trying to be impressive - I think I said I was trying to be funny. You seem like a hoot, so I don't need to "read some more of your shit." I'm just going to carry on with my day.

       Wow, you're grumpy hey? FYI I can live without the shampoo, the deoderant, the couch, the plastic, and if you quit smoking, within ten years you'd have the majority of your lungs capacity back.

       ... You know that just because you can't pronounce a chemical, doesn't mean it's going to kill you?
      </p>
      <p>
       Like, "bullet" is very easy to pronounce, but it's still more lethal than "sodium chloride".
      </p>
      <p>
       And oh god, we dress in things that contain
       <em>
        plastic
       </em>
       ? The horror. The fuckin' horror. We use
       <em>
        plastic
       </em>
       in our modern society???
      </p>
      <p>
       Third, yes, there's not a lot of chromosomes separating plastic from certain kinds of food. There's also not a lot of chromosomes separating you from an ape, but anyone who tried to use that as proof you should throw your own shit at people would be, I hope, quickly corrected.

       Posts like this don't make me think you're a "cool cunt". They just make me think you weren't paying very much attention in any of your chem classes.
