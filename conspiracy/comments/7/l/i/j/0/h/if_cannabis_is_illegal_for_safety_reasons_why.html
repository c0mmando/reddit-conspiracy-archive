    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s the stupidest reasoning I&#39;ve seen in a long time. Not only would approximately 90-95% of the population have no idea how to behave in a post-apocalyptic setting, I&#39;m sure you are also &#39;turned on&#39; by &#39;hot models&#39; (or whatever) who also wouldn&#39;t be of use in your setting.</p>

<p>Secondly, these two individuals are better at providing money in this real world setting than you probably are. Why else would you take the setting to some kind of post-apocalyptic fantasy of yours. </p>

<p>Lastly, I&#39;m sure the poster only meant to judge their looks, not their personality or hunting skills, lmao.</p>

<p>What makes you so sure to know how to survive? Because those actors survived no one starved to death at the set? I mean there are plenty of films that show some tactics to survive, but some post apocalyptic Hollywood movies, really???</p>

<p>EDIT: I like how you tried to make yourself sound important by listing your education credentials, and then accused me of trying to sound smart by using not-very-big words.

<p>NPR: Auto-Brewery Syndrome: Apparently, You Can Make Beer In Your Gut - Sept 2013
<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/09/17/223345977/auto-brewery-syndrome-apparently-you-can-make-beer-in-your-gut">https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2013/09/17/223345977/auto-brewery-syndrome-apparently-you-can-make-beer-in-your-gut</a></p>

<p>..</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-brewery_syndrome">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto-brewery_syndrome</a></p>

<p>..</p>

<p>my thinking being similar to that: just like you can have fermenting organisms living in your gut/body, you can have organisms that have learned to co-exist and even <em>depend</em> on consumption of the fermented sugars <em>from</em> these organisms&#39; fermenting.</p>

<p>Such as to say, maybe <strong><em>a</em></strong> cause of alcoholism (of &#39;many&#39;) is that the organisms&#39; in our microbiome haven&#39;t gone so far as to fermenting (in quantity?) so much as to be brewing our <em>own</em> booze from all the sugar (<em>most</em>) people consume.. ..at least not to detectable levels..</p>

<p>but, <em>have</em> &#39;trained&#39; their microbiome to depend on the regular consumption of those fermented sugars via &#39;the drink&#39;.</p>

<p>When we <em>don&#39;t</em> feed them (the fermented sugars of &#39;booze&#39;), they can&#39;t sustain their numbers, start to die back and, in typical organisms-dying fashion: start to &#39;rot&#39; inside of us..</p>

<p>..a rotting corpse tends to release more disgustingness at a faster rate than the average <em>living</em> organism does.. ..ie, instead of farting slowly, as we rot, &#39;all the gases&#39; in us get released much.more.quickly.</p>

<p>...spread this across &#39;lots of organisms&#39; that are either directly-dependent upon the regular-booze-consumption-rate.. ..or the ones dependent on products <em>those</em> create.. or, farther, maybe those <em>dying</em> allows <em>others</em> to grow up in their stead.. ..otherwise normally kept in check <em>by</em> the booze-consumers &#39;normally&#39; fed a regular supply <em>of</em> booze.</p>

<p>take away the booze, they can&#39;t sustain their numbers, they start dying, &#39;toxins&#39; and/or &#39;other&#39; start getting released.. at a much faster rate.. from their now-dying/rotting corpses.. ..and, as this happens.. <em>at</em> an increased rate.. ..we start to feel the (internal) stress from this going on.. ..all the more motivating us <em>to</em> drink.. ..if for no other reason than just to deal with the stress.. when, in reality, the drink is <em>also</em> <strong><em>feeding</em></strong> the organisms that&#39;re causing the distress to begin with.</p>

<p>..this keeps the cycle going, of course.. but..</p>

<p>well, going with the cnn and business insider articles, maybe the shrooms simply help &#39;distract us&#39; from this stress as the transition takes place.. ..but.. maybe there&#39;s something &#39;else&#39; going on as well..</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In this video:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krk2CoE2FPs&amp;amp;ab_channel=ThePermaculturePodcast">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Krk2CoE2FPs&amp;amp;ab_channel=ThePermaculturePodcast</a></p>

<p>Tradd talks about the amazing ways that fungi are capable of evolving defenses &amp; attacks against &#39;things&#39;.. ..I wonder if the &#39;magic shrooms&#39; actually have a compound in them (maybe the psilocybin, maybe something else??) ..</p>

<p>..and that compound not only helps alleviate symptoms, but possibly even reduces things that would cause stress? ..by, say, &#39;tying them up&#39; or something like that?</p>

<p>I mean, maybe it isn&#39;t <em>just</em> tied to &#39;magic mushrooms&#39;..</p>

<p><a href="http://www.evolveandascend.com/2017/04/25/top-7-amazing-health-benefits-of-psilocybin-mushrooms/">http://www.evolveandascend.com/2017/04/25/top-7-amazing-health-benefits-of-psilocybin-mushrooms/</a></p>

<p>but &#39;other&#39; mushrooms could benefit as well?  and/or, maybe there&#39;s a psilocybin-free, hemp:pot-like mushroom that still produces the <em>other</em> &#39;things&#39; .. .. in one of the other popular mushroom types?</p>

<p>....</p>

<p>I&#39;ve eaten shrooms many times, and found that I actually prefer <em>less</em> than more. Like, &#39;a little&#39; goes a lot farther with me than more-at-one-time.  It still takes &#39;enough&#39; to get the effects going, but then stretch a bag out over a <em>longer</em> period helps me maintain that level.. ..and <em>also</em> function quite &#39;nicely&#39; in society.</p>

<p>Not gonna say that I&#39;m no a little f&#39;ed up in my head when it&#39;s going on.. like, things definitely are a bit more &#39;off&#39; than &#39;just-relaxed&#39;.. but i&#39;m <em>also</em> &#39;relaxed-enough&#39; that people tend to be very surprised if they find out that I&#39;m on shrooms.. or that I was on shrooms.. and this is people that&#39;ve been hanging out with me for &#39;a while&#39; during that given period of time.. ..not just random bystander passerbys .. so &#39;functionality in society&#39; seems more than possible on them.. if, again, maintaining a low-grade &#39;buzz&#39; more than a shroom-&#39;drunk&#39;/&#39;high&#39;.</p>

<p>..</p>

<p>combining that <em>back</em> with alcohol.. ..wonder what the cost differential would be? I mean, maybe.. going <em>with</em> the &#39;low-grade buzz&#39; level of shrooms... .maybe the cost would be equal-to or just-below .. or just-above the cost of more-regular drinking..</p>

<p>such that, maybe do it &#39;long enough&#39;.. like a week or three.. ..if it wouldn&#39;t help to reduce the alcohol consumption enough to have a  more-lasting effect?</p>

<p>ex: if it <em>is</em> a &#39;microbiome thing&#39;, could the microbiome <em>not</em> be adjusted by <em>not</em> drinking.. ..thus, feeding organisms that we&#39;ve sculpted to be a more-regular part of our microbiome <em>while</em> drinking.. ...and, kill off enough of those, and give time for others to grow in their place..</p>

<p>..time more-easily afforded <em>by</em> shrooms.. ..that when we quit the shrooms too, we could go back to at least a lower rate of alcohol consumption as well a lower-level of &#39;necessity&#39; behind it?</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Take</strong> the wikipedia article <em>on</em> autobrewery syndrome..</p>

<p>in the first paragraph it mentions saccharomyces cerevisiae.. ... &#39;brewer&#39;s yeast&#39;..</p>

<p>but, <em>baker&#39;s</em> yeast (saccharomyces boulardii) is a <em>sub</em>set of s.cerevisiae.. so, saccharomyces cerevisiae boulardii..</p>

<p>and, it has a unique capability.. and extra set of genes ... in addition to s.cerevisiae .. whereby, when &#39;born&#39; (cell division occurs), the organism &#39;takes its first breath&#39;.. ..if it &#39;inhales&#39; fermented sugar, it expresses its boulardii genes and goes on living its life <em>as</em> a s.boulardii..</p>

<p>but, if its first breath <em>lacks</em> fermented sugar, it &#39;assumes&#39; that there <em>isn&#39;t</em> enough fermented sugar to go around to be available for it.. so it makes an epigenetic decision to <em>suppress</em> its boulardii genes (fermentation-consuming genes) and, instead, to <em>ex</em>press its <em>cerevisiae</em> genes..</p>

<p>whereby, instead of <em>consuming</em> fermented sugars (or, &#39;fermentation as respiration&#39;) it consumes sugar (and oxygen).. and then <em>ferments</em> it.. ie, &#39;brewer&#39;s yeast&#39;.</p>

<p>Once there&#39;s enough fermentation going on, the s.boulardii genes of new generations can start expressing their boulardii genes and.. ..well, &#39;grape juice &gt;to&gt; wine&#39; becomes &#39;wine &gt;to&gt; vinegar&#39;</p>

<p>...granted, in that case (the case of vinegar), it&#39;s bacteria.. and, more-specifically, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetobacter_aceti"><em>Acetobacter aceti</em></a></p>

<p>but..</p>

<p>so... well, <em>jump</em> to vinegar.. and, more-specifically, raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar.. that still has &#39;the mother of vinegar&#39; living in it..</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_cider_vinegar">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_cider_vinegar</a></p>

<p>...in these, well, second paragraph of the intro covers it..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is made by crushing apples and squeezing out the liquid. Bacteria and yeast are added to the liquid to start the alcoholic fermentation process, and the sugars are turned into alcohol. In a second fermentation process, the alcohol is converted into vinegar by acetic acid-forming bacteria (acetobacter). Acetic acid and malic acid give vinegar its sour taste.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>so... </p>

<p>maybe alcoholics would benefit from consuming ACV? Maybe the acetobacters in ACV would help to build up in the microbiome, consuming any fermentation .. and..well, if combined with the mushroom regimen above, maybe shrooms to help with anxiety then ACV (and &#39;other&#39;) as a way to introduce strains to help compete against the strains that are used to consuming alcohol/fermentation/&#39;fermented sugars&#39;?</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Also, you can buy s.boulardii in supplement form.. Jarrow Formulas is a good one. Bragg&#39;s Apple Cider Vinegar another..</p>

<p>Just a theory I&#39;ve bounced around for a while.  &#39;other&#39; probiotics coming into play to help as well?</p>

<p>..</p>

<p>Kombucha has/had this issue.  google: &#39;whole foods kombucha recall&#39;</p>

<p>basically, WF made it a point to recall all their kombuchas because the alcohol content was building up in them the longer they sat on the shelf. In a form of self-regulation, they pulled them and had their suppliers deal with it.</p>

<p>The short of it: their suppliers (kombucha brewers) started adding fermentation-consuming strains to their kombuchas.. strains <em>like</em> s.boulardii, acv&#39;s acetobacters, etc..</p>

<p>and, if/when/as the fermented sugars would get high enough, the fermentation-consumers would rise to balance.. consume the sugars, die back some, and &#39;wait&#39; until more were created.</p>

<p>so, inside the bottle was a natural ballast that kept the alcohol content <em>of</em> the kombucha <em>below</em> regulatory standards such that WF <em>didn&#39;t</em> get into trouble.. ..that it was voluntary/preventative was all the more interesting.</p>

<p>so, maybe just drinking some kombucha could help with alcoholism?</p>

<p>..and, well, <em>in</em> that tradd cotter video above (worth the watch, imo), <em>like</em> with that.. maybe the evolution of these (there&#39;re &#39;fungi&#39;...yeast mainly.. in kombucha) would help to keep things in check.. ..at least from a microbiomic-induced perspective?</p>

<p>obviously there&#39;re &#39;more reasons to drink&#39; than <em>just</em> microbiomic motivations..but.. ..reducing the &#39;push&#39; from that end may help to bring drinking more into a &#39;choice&#39; than a &#39;necessity&#39;-of-sort?</p>

<p>throw in some shrooms here &amp; there to take the edge off just-in-case?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>oh, forgot to include this length.. and, the &#39;real theory&#39; I was thinking to begin with...</p>

<p>slide 2 in this article:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.livescience.com/48704-odd-facts-about-magic-mushrooms.html">https://www.livescience.com/48704-odd-facts-about-magic-mushrooms.html</a></p>

<p>&#39;Mushrooms hyperconnect the brain&#39;</p>

<p>..</p>

<p>what <em>if</em> it&#39;s fungi that&#39;ve crossed the blood/brain barrier and taken root <em>in</em> the brain that help drive ... ... not just alcoholism.. but &#39;lots of things&#39; in the brain.. ..from a negative perspective.</p>

<p>such as to say: </p>

<p>what if <em>via</em> the possible &#39;attacking properties&#39; fungi are capable of having (Tradd Cotter vid reference).. ..actually serves to help kill <em>back</em> any brain-fungi ...<em>fed</em> by alcohol.. ..that, in turn, not only lowers the need to feed these fungi (&#39;cause they&#39;re dead.. and thus less of them), but, also, helps to.. in their absence, allow those neurons to connect more.. and, even possibly <em>promote</em> this connection, not just more-neutrally &#39;allow&#39; it to happen naturally.</p>

<p>such as to say: fungi need nutrients just like our neurons do.. and it goes beyond &#39;fermented sugars&#39;.  The brain is/ neurons are a <em>huge</em> consumer of glucose.  The evolution of more complex brains is arguably what necessitated internal body temperature regulation.. and, thus, body fat.. .. that pushed reptiles to mammals..</p>

<p>in such that: the extra fat serves as glucose storage to <em>feed</em> the brain in <em>case</em> supplies get low..  ..and, in a natural/competitive environment, this would balance itself.. in a liquor-store-on-every-corner-that-also-sells-sugar-pop-candy-drinks world of modern civilization, we&#39;ve gotten to the point where we can have this sugar/alcohol at a level that <em>far</em> exceeds the natural order of things.. and also includes <em>just</em> fermentation (distillation.. an &#39;unnatural&#39; process vs just a fermenting mango on the ground somewhere).. and concentrated sugar (ie, &#39;bubble gum&#39;) vs sugar that would also contain all the fiber that sugar-rich foods usually contain </p>

<p>(Fiber-Famished Gut Microbes Linked to Poor Health - March 2015
<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fiber-famished-gut-microbes-linked-to-poor-health1/">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fiber-famished-gut-microbes-linked-to-poor-health1/</a>  )</p>

<p>...so, um.. too much easy sugar, too much easy booze/fermentation.. and, <em>not</em> enough natural flora/fauna/&#39;microbes&#39; that a &#39;less-processed&#39; diet would provide..</p>

<p>allows &#39;weeds&#39; to take over our microbiome...</p>

<p>and, as such, those may reach our brain.</p>

<p>and, back to where I was above..</p>

<p>what if these &#39;weeds&#39; make it into our brain.. and, while there, not just do things mentioned in the previous message, but also consume nutrients our neurons would otherwise need.. and, in expense <em>of</em> our neurons..</p>

<p>they grow to &#39;clog the pipes&#39; (or at least the spaces synapses would otherwise exist.. or exist more-freely / less unadulteratedly ... less &#39;clogged&#39;ly&#39; ) .. .. and, now, with those dead, our brain <em>doesn&#39;t</em> fight them, <em>gets</em> the space, <em>gets</em> the nutrients.. and.. ..even potentially, with the mushrooms, gets a &#39;stimulant&#39; of sort that &#39;promotes&#39; this all increasing in rate..</p>

<p>..then the effects wear off, the organisms grow back, and .. .. &#39;the clog&#39; happens again, as well, their demand for alcohol / fermented sugars to feed them.</p>

<p>basically, a slave to brain fungus. sleep, work, taxes, paycheck&gt;to&gt;alcohol repeat.   ... alcohol tax -&gt;to-&gt; the man.  rinse. repeat.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Gut flora may have a bigger impact in brain health than we realize. They process sugars differently depending on how it got there. Take sugar, HFCS or an Apple with its sugar. The apple has fibers and the bacteria extracts the sugar a more natural way. HFCS is like coke for your guy flora, easy fix but not long lasting, no fibers to break down. You should also read into Stoned Ape Man theory - <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_McKenna</a> basically magic mushrooms help our ancestors brains grow. Could’ve been responsible from going from living in trees with little food to following herds of animals, which poop, and mushrooms grow on cow shit right? These hunters would then take and help hunt at night, or explore the landscape for more mushrooms, help with language and art? Who knows</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dude, where did you become a scientist? Your analysis of vaping compared to drinking is out of this world and makes so much sense. Why didn&#39;t I think of that? Oh ya, because that would be a logical fallacy! Haha!</p>

<p>Please reconsider your fallacious views. </p>

<p>Also I&#39;m very skeptical of your views on quitting while Prego, because of how you handled the first thing..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I will readily admit that my comparisons often are rather flawed, but you didn&#39;t need to be that rude about it.</p>

<p>As for quitting cold turkey, I actually found that one on <a href="https://www.babycenter.com/404_im-pregnant-can-quitting-smoking-cold-turkey-hurt-me-or-my-b_1405526.bc">this article.</a></p>

<p>Edit: for context, searching for the answer got me only results that agreed with the article, that quitting smoking is only good for the baby.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Rude? No. Rude is comparing marijuana to alcohol, which is what government sponsored scientists did in Washington state and that&#39;s why the cops can charge someone with a dwi for having 75 mg/ml THC/Blood level. In the class they make people go to for getting a DUI, they teach that marijuana impairs drivers. This is not scientific and yet is used to incarcerate people for smoking marijuana whereas before these new laws, that was a grey area and no established method was used to test for levels of marijuana at a traffic stop.</p>

<p>Perhaps you were unaware of these things. I figured you were with the pigs, you know? The popo? Yeah those tools of oppression that have destroyed the lives of thousands of innocent men women and children, who have suffered, for merely their presence, in a world that says, &quot;get back to work, slaves!&quot; </p>

<p>The enemy is not a man. The enemy is information. The information is in your mind. This has been a mental war. Thank you for participating. Through conflict, we can glean great truths, hopefully with little consequence.</p>

<p>No hard feelings right?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Marijuana? <a href="/u/ThisIsMy1stRodeo">/u/ThisIsMy1stRodeo</a> specifically mentioned cigarettes! I was talking about, y&#39;know, how it&#39;s good that a woman who specifically said she smoked <em>tobacco</em> stopped smoking it during pregnancy, and correcting the misinformation about how quitting <em>tobacco</em> cold turkey can be harmful to the child.</p>

<p>If you wanna vape weed while pregnant, that&#39;s still an issue, but only because the THC will pass into the child&#39;s still-developing body, and we do know that marijuana use in children and teenagers is linked to worse off lives, though whether that&#39;s causation or correlation has yet to be determined. Regardless, it&#39;s still best to not risk a child&#39;s life for getting high until we know for sure.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is the first time I&#39;ve even heard of the hegelian dialectic, but it seems rather interesting, albeit with rather complex rules. As far as I can tell, it&#39;s based in the following principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Nothing is permanent, everything is changing. That is the nature of time.</p></li>
<li><p>Every force has an equal and opposite force.</p></li>
<li><p>Gradual change causes one force to overcome its opposite, leading to further change. In other words, change begets change.</p></li>
<li><p>Change is not circular, but rather helical. Nothing returns to its original state, not entirely- instead, it can only approach what it once was before further changing.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>It works well enough for debates revolving around human affairs, including politics. It&#39;s somewhat lacking for scientific and especially subatomic matters, but then, that&#39;s what the scientific method is for.</p>

<p>The ancient Athenians were surprisingly wise for a people who made pedophilia a cultural standard and status symbol.</p>

Scan it if you feel insecure, but its the pdf book. I have mine set to autodownload. Obviously you dont have to do that, just view it on the web if you want. </p>

<p>I googled philosophy the matrix pdf and it was the first hit. There are other books that are similar and maybe say more. If I remember correctly, picking up one of them (maybe this one) and leafing through at a book store was what gave me that idea about the hegelian dialectic.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pamf.org/teen/risk/smoking/risks.html">Tobacco</a> is a known carcinogen, meaning it causes cancer. While many effects are a result of smoke inhalation, and vaping can reduce the risks due to using a liquid mist instead of smoke, the fact is that it&#39;s still filled with dangerous chemicals that our body simply cannot handle properly. Furthermore, it is addictive as hell.</p>

<p>Pregnancy literally links your air and blood with the unborn child. As that child is still developing, foreign chemicals that could potentially be toxic to a normal human can majorly effect the baby when ingested, inhaled, or otherwise placed into the mother&#39;s system. While vaping is not as potentially lethal as smoking, it can still cause issues.</p>

<p>Regardless, it is entirely possible for your child to be born already addicted to tobacco. And that&#39;s ignoring things like arsenic, vinyl chloride, and type-2 diabetes, <a href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/electronic-cigarettes-good-news-bad-news-2016072510010">all of which are still released/consumed/caused by tobacco vaping.</a> Oh! And impaired prefrontal brain development, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefrontal_cortex">which is responsible for</a> your personality, planning complex cognitive behavior, ability to differentiate conflicting thoughts... and your will to live.</p>

<p>Tobacco use when pregnant can literally cause your child to become suicidal.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My only qualm was your analogy of hard liquor to beer is as cigarettes is to vaping.  This is not supported by your longwinded above post, nor by the sourcesnor by anything I can lersonally find.  It seems to be pure scare tactics (perhaps due to uniformed opinion) which is disheartening to others in their quest for more freedom from smoking combustible cigarettes and having no other options.    </p>

<p>So.... Do you still think that analogy holds, even in the slightest?  This analogy, in my researched opinion is simply wrong.  First its start off with the premise all vaporizable liquid is equal to some extent, or perhaps entirely.  That it must have some dangerous assortment of chemicals.  But, for instance, what if one were to solely mix their own vegetable glycerin and/or propylene glycol with nicotine (*optionally the nicotine) rather than buy &quot;sugary&quot; (flavored) shit from god knows where?</p>

<p>So...is vaping like a &quot;watered&quot; down combustible cigarette?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe the people benefit from legalization and they could profit much more, but in the end the empire always profits either way. TPTB invest in big growers and pass ridiculous regulations, and maybe concede to some of us, for a little bit, some of the liberties in their treasure chest. The pharmaceutical companies will adjust. Sure, weed can be legal in some states, if the CIA is importing massive amounts of heroin and cocaine into the US daily. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The State of Washington, and the Liquor Control Board, won and not the people of Washington. The state set up a list of growers. People outed themselves. Then that list got cut in half and those not in, were out. After that, they sliced the medical market with Initiative 502, and flooded the market with bunk weed at outrageous prices. The patients of Washington state are finally bow able again, to have their own collectives. The State was sure to get theirs first, and to let the patents sort it out quietly off to the side afterwards. That shows the State could care less about the people, the citizens, and care only for lining their own greedy scummy pockets.</p>

<p>Then it gets worse. The state got these scumbag &quot;scientists&quot; to say whatever they needed to say, to propose that it&#39;s possible to test people for levels of the, and then take their license if they have over what was it? 75 mg/ml THC/Blood? I blew that figure out of the water, by at least five times once, just before a deployment haha!

    <div class="md"><p>Well, reading the &#39;new heroes&#39; has certainly got my ears pricked back. I shall spend some time reading those links, thanks mate.  </p>

<p>20 year, 20 or so a day habit myself. On occasions I think fuck I&#39;m sick of these things but more than anything I&#39;m sick of the government and the self righteous fucks that carry on as if smokers are Satan&#39;s spawn and the new age lepers. So along with being treated as someone who&#39;s I.Q is that of a sweaty arse crack is alone incentive enough for me never to quit. I respect the now not so new laws in my country in regards to smoking in pubs and clubs, in fact I quite like the air not being like a Chinese morning fog inside. I know they aren&#39;t going to add years onto my life and shit, maybe some of us are perfectly happy with that, I know I am. </p>

<p>The constant demonisation is so fkn tiresome and hypocritical though. When questioned if I&#39;m worried about the dangers of smoking I just ask if they care as much about the fact we all literally scrub a list of chemicals that no one can pronunciate thats as long as the Flemington straight into our skulls via the shampoo and conditioner bottle, give the underarms a nice soaking via a deodorant bottle who&#39;s ingredients resembles the shampoo, dress in material that contains plastics and god knows what, sit down on couches that are bathed in anti stain and the like chemicals, consume food thats literally a few chromosomes away from the the plastic its wrapped in and then suck the air in from whats literally big industry&#39;s catalytic converter? Oh, and do they honestly think society can afford to destroy the cancer industry via a cure which must be worth billions on the all encompassing whole? I say, &#39;fuck no and I&#39;ll be happily biding my time like a cool cunt, smoking a fag over here and loving it when they feel rhey have an answer for me&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t argue with you mate. Like you say, &#39;if done correctly&#39;. No doubt there&#39;s future if not current farming techniques that will offer an abundance of yield vs the input of energy and natural resources currently used. </p>

<p>I live in a country that sees enough excess water during the northern states wet season that could/should be caught and piped down to the southern states to aid in agriculture but it&#39;s all too hard for anyone. </p>

<p>Not to mention a interior landscape of next to nothing but sunburnt red dust that covers a large enough area that you could breakdown in your car and go weeks if not months before anyone came across you. Station owners literally fly helicopters to the end paddocks to muster any cattle up otherwise it&#39;s a 2 day round trip by car. I know it wouldn&#39;t be the most attractive sight to sore eyes but then again there&#39;s nothing to be there for let alone see anyway! You could install enough solar energy panels that will see nothing but sun 90% of the year that it would make a huge dent in our need for fossil fuels. Again it&#39;s either too hard or Im just a bit to radical and non conventional with ideas. Seems  the world on a whole that despite our self congratulatory tendencies towards all things advanced techology is really quite backwards and caveman like in a lot of ways.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>All im pointing out is that in my area of the world  theres an abundant amount of  resources that go to wate. Requires nothing more than the infrastructure to be installed so as to take advantage of &#39;free&#39; and clean energy.

I&#39;m sure that goes for many towns in many countries, which would then show the fearmonger, doom and gloom mouthpieces that we perhaps dont buy the  agenda based bullshit they peddle.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>IF they would use tobacco as some kind of population control, when i get you right there, why they have made safety belts in cars mandatory and don&#39;t legalize drunk driving?</p>

<p>The only thing i can see not banning tobacco is the amount of taxes generated through smoking cigarettes.
Here in Europe, especially in Germany it&#39;s a bit complicated, on one hand it&#39;s generating more taxes, on the other hand we have a general health insurance, so it would increase costs of the health system with illnesses caused by Smoking.
In the US it&#39;s a bit different, because when you don&#39;T have a health insurance you have to pay your medication/surgery or any other medical treatment yourself. So there in some cases they don&#39;t have to care for the costs/illnesses caused by smoking.</p>

We knew we couldn&#39;t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin. And then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities, we could arrest their leaders. raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.&quot;</p>

<p>@post title</p>

<p>Because keeping cannabis illegal means the black market price will remain high, which has a multitude of benefits for the US. govt and foreign govts (mexico, columbia, peru, suisse) such as keeping the cannabis competition away from their pharma corps. own narcotis and giving those agents who actively run the trade a lot of personal wealth at the expense of the junkies getting addicted to the GMO cannabis being tested out this way on the public without (legal) reprecussions, before legalizing the GMO cannabis and netting big profit legally.</p>

<p>Meanwhile people believe total bogus as &quot;cannabis oil cures cancer&quot; and watch the &quot;cool guys&quot; getting they brains reduced to mush by this engineered poison to get hooked themselves and remain a lifelong costumer (bitch) of the drug pimp and their big pharma bosses.</p>

<p>Oh and don&#39;t forget the DEA enjoying a big paycheck along with permanent job security for busting kids nuts over a bit of skunk weed their own govt. bosses peddle.</p>

<p>&quot;Winners don&#39;t take Drugs (unless they buy &#39;em from us)&quot; - Govt.</p>

Their arguments are based on the reality the government&#39;s have set up for our (white) world where cannabis is classified as a drug and that&#39;s that. Cannabis is a mind altering plant therefore a drug, to them, making it worse than tobacco somehow despite the effects being 100x worse smoking ciggies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure that the democrats would have moved forward with banning cigarettes if Trump wouldn&#39;t have won.  I was told (just a rumor) it was on their agenda for 2018.</p>

<p>Thankfully we have Jeff Sessions as AG because as far as I know (and I follow everything he says), he has no plans to ban cigarettes like the DemoRat liberals would have.  They&#39;re always trying to control what we do and say, like banning &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; (I&#39;m so glad we can say it again). </p>

<p>And yeah, Sessions might want to lock people up for smoking marijuana, but think about it -- the majority of people who smoke the ganga are loser hippies that exclusively vote democrat, so really, who cares?  We need to make this country great again, whatever it takes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Im hoping this is sarcasm all around. Banning cigarettes would hurt my state pretty badly as we are a massive tabacco producer. Now taxing the shit out of them like they do in Australia wouldn&#39;t be as bad of an idea because it would lower the amount of smokers and then using the tax hick they could subsidize tobacco farms so they don&#39;t lose. It&#39;s a win win. Now pot on the other hand is not a majority loser hippies who vote exclusively democrat. I&#39;m a young republican (I do not vote part lines though) and I have smoked regularly in the past. If it were legal I would rather smoke than drink to be honest. Also, head to a state where it&#39;s legal and go to a shop, you will see people of all ages and backgrounds. When I was in CO I saw moms, businessmen, yes hippies, and a lot of middle class run of the mill folks. It was actually quite surprising. Open up your eyes the war on marijuana is a farce, by legalizing it federally we could open up an new tax revenue stream, encouraged small business growth in the new market, create jobs, and stop this unnecessary spending on this so called war. </p>

<p>Third, yes, there&#39;s not a lot of chromosomes separating plastic from certain kinds of food. There&#39;s also not a lot of chromosomes separating you from an ape, but anyone who tried to use that as proof you should throw your own shit at people would be, I hope, quickly corrected. </p>
