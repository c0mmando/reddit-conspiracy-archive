<p>Through psychedelics, I have come to realize that beyond all physical boundaries, we all could be anything, anyone, or everything and everyone. </p>

<p>I often wonder if transgenderism is the physical expression of the infinite nature of spirit. </p>

<p>Or perhaps it&#39;s a perversion of the spirit withon physical bounds. </p>

<p>Either way, I feel there is an agenda in popularizing it that goes beyond discrimination. </p>

<p>Therein lies the conspiracy angle. </p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s definitely not a good thing. </p>

<p>I read a book once that was about alchemy; it describe how primordial mankind was actually hermaphroditic. 4 arms, 4 legs. 2 heads. 2 different genitals. </p>

<p>For a while I thought it was a beautiful representation of the possible former spiritual union of the sexes. </p>

<p>Then later I realized it was just a bunch of mumbo jumbo. </p>

<p>We are all born with a gender for a reason. </p>

<p>These people have been tragically deceived  </p>

<p>1) The science is clear. There are observable differences between men and women and two separate sexes. Gender correlates with those seces.... 99.99% of the time. Anyone who tells you different is lying or uneducated.</p>

<p>2) These are PEOPLE. Experiencing something extremely unpleasant and life altering. They should be treated with the same love and respect that you deserve. We should be compassionate, accommodating, and loving towards these people. We don&#39;t have to change our language, you don&#39;t need to change your beliefs...
