       I think the focus of transgenderism is to focus on the inverse of our spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through psychedelics, I have come to realize that beyond all physical boundaries, we all could be anything, anyone, or everything and everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I often wonder if transgenderism is the physical expression of the infinite nature of spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or perhaps it's a perversion of the spirit withon physical bounds.
      </p>
      <p>
       Either way, I feel there is an agenda in popularizing it that goes beyond discrimination.
      </p>
      <p>
       Therein lies the conspiracy angle.
      </p>
      <p>
       Any thoughts?

       I think it's definitely not a good thing.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read a book once that was about alchemy; it describe how primordial mankind was actually hermaphroditic. 4 arms, 4 legs. 2 heads. 2 different genitals.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a while I thought it was a beautiful representation of the possible former spiritual union of the sexes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then later I realized it was just a bunch of mumbo jumbo.

      <p>
       We are all born with a gender for a reason.

       I personally feel it's a lack of acceptance of the limitations of physicality. 
    We are born who we are for a reason.

       Plastic surgery is bullshit. 
  Hormone therapy too.

       I meant like, I reject social norms. I don't watch TV usually. I don't play video games. I could care less about pointless entertainment. I want (ed) power, super powers. I have dabbled in every religion, every major philosophical pursuit I could get my hands on.

       i didn't mean that you identified directly. 
    I mean the agenda as far as it applies to them.

      <p>
       I don't identify with their plight, I just try to have a sense of empathy about it. 
     I personally think they're being misled by being encouraged. 
    I think it's a distraction from finding happiness in who they already are. 
    Another way to make people dissatisfied with their lives. 
     It's sad that they took the bait, to me.

       I appreciate your concern, and I've been off them for years. 
    The greatest lesson they taught was that no one has the penultimate view, and there's no reason to order anyone else in their lifestyle choices. 
    Hence my consideration for their illness. 
    Consumerism and egotism are illness as well.

       If you had any idea what psilocybin can do for the mind and soul you'd feel really ridiculous saying that. Mushrooms turned me from an angry athiest to a believer in God and full blown spiritualist. Whatever you think about "shrooms" is government propoganda you've yet to realize.

       I see your point. I also understand it in a galactic sense. I stuggle with wrapping my mind around 7 genders. I also know. I'm wired a certain way. I support everyone in finding their way, whatever that might be. ...a word of advice. Find your self and then find love with minimal heartbreak on the way.

       I have no clue what you even mean by finding myself and finding love with minimal heartbreak, unless it's just general and non specific advice.

      <pre><code> All is full of love and it's just sad to me that people hate themselves so much that they want to deform themselves. 

  However, the push for people to do so is bizarre and confusing to me. 

  Why encourage self mutilation and dissatisfaction with the vehicle which grants us this world?

       It's what the media seems to tell these people.

       To find themselves through genital mutilation.

       Look. You are reading way to far into my comments. In terms of transgendered people. I have known a few. When they found themselves and found love and settled  their lives became remarkable regular.

       I'm not really caring which side of the fence on this issue you happen to be. I hope resolution for anyone's particular journey in identification of self.

       I don't understand the mainstream push encouraging people to self mutilate. 
     I suppose the grass is always greener to most, but really, mutilating your genitals is the opposite of seeking comfort to me.

       There are two issues here and people confuse them.
      </p>
      <p>
       1) The science is clear. There are observable differences between men and women and two separate sexes. Gender correlates with those seces.... 99.99% of the time. Anyone who tells you different is lying or uneducated.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) These are PEOPLE. Experiencing something extremely unpleasant and life altering. They should be treated with the same love and respect that you deserve. We should be compassionate, accommodating, and loving towards these people. We don't have to change our language, you don't need to change your beliefs... But to treat them as anything but this is cruel and anti-humanity. Let others do what they want to do, as long as it doesn't infringe on you.

       That's the type of thing I'd hoped to find in reaching out. 
    Trying to strike a conversation with someone with more than a passing fancy to opinion. 
    I appreciate you, and your appreciation of facts.
