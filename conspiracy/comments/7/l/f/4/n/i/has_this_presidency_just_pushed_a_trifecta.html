       The FCC repeal allows ISP to control information and the monetization of that information, the new tax reform just passed to marginalize 300M people into Financial compliance, and now they are trying to sneak in a mass surveillance bill.
      </p>
      <p>
       If this is not a recipe for a Autocratic-Oligarchy with  white nationalist rhetoric sprinkled in, this sub is defiantly run by GOP sympathizers.
      </p>
      <p>
       The American Revolution was mainly "taxation without representation," we now have three majorly destructive laws to completely oppress 99% of US citizens into compliance and Financial ruin that trumps the America Revolution. People need to wake up.

       If you say so, I don’t really feel like getting to in a petty argument with you. I was hoping to hear why you feel there is an one sided bashing party going on here, but if you don’t want to engage in a sincere conversation then there’s not much I can do.

       So you chose this place, and briefly looking at your history, correct me if I'm wrong, you obviously are a logic cowboy spreading the word, and you are gunnin' for a fight where you are the quickest draw shooting logic and impartiality bullets to slay those 'conspiracy people's view that you have a problem with.hmm ok, so you mention your issue with the sub, why come?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't think you posted here yesterday. and your suddenly here in this post replying to me? fishy. And your username, can't imagine that is you primary account.. Nope, not going to discuss with you as your already chosen an immovable viewpoint, look to be an alt account, and maybe you were someone replying to me elsewhere with a different account. that username tho, usually the trolls like to unveil later as a maliscious suprise. anyway I'm done here cowboy, your true nature is transparent. is that enough for you to call me something something conspiracy nut? merry xmas

       Note that all I’ve done is ask you a sincere question, and all you’ve done is shoot back with insults. And no, I wasn’t referring to “cowboy”, and either way whats does it matter? Are you saying you weren’t trying to insult me? You’re being a condescending dick. And why do you keep saying merry xmas?

       You implied that I am using an alt to troll you or something, said that I am unwilling to change my viewpoint, and as I said you are being condescending and disingenuous. I didn’t drop my logic.

       Also, I definitely didn’t take “cowboy” as an insult, but now I’m wondering if “logic cowboy” is supposed to be an insult.

       out of the blue you pick this post this part of the thread to pick a fight, why? oh I know maybe the timing and the guy that messaged me about him being banned angrily asking if I was happy?  that is my guess. so you declared yourself the winner, right then, you win the harassment achievement of the day troll

       You’re the one who’s picking a fight bud. I
       <strong>
        asked you a question
       </strong>
       . Amazingly, you still haven’t answered it. Fine by me tbh. I assumed you were full of shit and had nothing to back up your claim, but I wanted to give you the opportunity at least. Your claims were clearly baseless though, and after this little debacle I’m sure anyone else who reads your comment will think the same.

       I didn’t think this was an argument but alas, you’ve continued to evade my original question and insult me, clearly because there’s no reason to think this is a “bashing” or that any of the claims made by OP are untrue and you are just being a jackass for teh lulz.

       More insults, cool lol. And still no answer to my question. At this point you’re actually picking on me, and for what reason? Because I dared to question the validity your little rant?

      <p>
       No problem, I don’t need to one up you because you

       Or are you just a hardcore zealot or something? Let me guess, if I were to look through your history as you did with mine, I’d find that everyone you engage with either agrees with you or is a complete imbecile/a troll/a shill, right?

       And as I keep saying, I’d just like to know why you think this is a “one sided bashing party” and what sweeping generalizations you feel have been made in this post.
      </p>
      <p>
       But sure, pretend I’m relentlessly attacking you while actually relentlessly attacking me.

       it is intuitively obvious to even the most casual observer the absolute youthful written verbal responses started by this pseudo logical self named troll are meant as an attack, when given the constant babble and juvenile actions of back comment posts and inability to move on.

       going back through my history and mass replying to old comments I made, instead of just reading, is juvenile. oh, I have been observing and commenting not insulting. and here you are, still at it, still can't not 1 up, logic cowboy! Sorry that is not an insult, I just like saying it. actually in the beginning I was impressed by youn calm way in your post history you were when responding. But we all know what you are like now.

       To be clear, the thread remains visible for long after the fact, which is how I saw it. Or hey, maybe the title of this thread and certain keywords in your comment caused it to be placed into a queue where it sat for the customary 24 hours before I began my quest to goad and troll you and bait out the logic of your claim and show it to be baseless and without merit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or maybe I was on controversial and saw your ridiculous comment and was in awe at the way you and others like you have made it your religion to defend the billionaire President of the United States as being a man of the people and our only hope in the fight against the luciferian Illuminati pedophile liberal reptilians along side his trusted allies the military industrial complex, the zionists, and assorted child milestones and convicted pedophiles.

      <p>
       But nah, everyone who disagrees with me is a troll, a shill, and a bot.

       Yay, I win. But seriously, you go by the name troll. You expect to win arguments because you are always right, and this is how you spend your time. Actually a bid sad that you need validation. You obviously aren't going for popularity, and love to argue with folks, making mountains out of whatever primary school insult you can cobble together from conversing.  shrug, my intention was to waste your time and be annoying, I hope I've done that. really bummed you haven't come back yet. I wish to make more typing errors that you can make fun of, in the desperate need to make someone feel bad, to pump yourself up. iits great fun getting your goat, lol. There has to be a reason though, that your hobby is attacking people with vain attempts to lash out. I`m guessing personal problems.

        Dont worry guys, ill leave you to your bashing and one sided party here. Sounds like youve made up your minds already. Why post then if you are going to make sweeping over generalizations without room for discussion?

       Let’s try this one more time lol, how is this post a one sided bashing party and what sweeping over generalizations have been made? That’s what you said. Were you actually trying to make this claim, or was it just a clever little zinger you figured you’d toss out there?
      </p>
      <p>
       And what do you know, you’ve managed to think of another way to try and insult me. The disconnect is truly amazing. And at this point you’ve actually admitted that you’re trolling. Did my username trigger you or something? You should really try not to let yourself get so upset. But hey, go ahead and keep it up kid.

       Actually I came to you on a public forum (do you usually solicit replies to your comments?), asked you a simple question, and you immediately decided I was a troll and launched into an endless string of abuse towards me. For your information, this username is one I made when dealing with a troll not unlike yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
       And I’m hardly upset, I’d say this has been more amusing and predictable than anything else. Did you actually think this was some grand debate that you could win by repeatedly saying what you hoped to be true?

       And you’re one to talk about goading and personal attacks. It’s literally all you’ve done this whole time lol.

       I never really felt bad about the insults you’ve flung at me (15yo is an amusing one, and surely one only a 16yo would make lol), but now I’m feeling a bit worried about you. It was as I suspected, and literally any time someone has disagreed with you they’ve been branded a troll, a shill, a bot, a mental case, a child, and probably a million other things.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why am I not surprised? Probably because you’ve behaved exactly as would be expected for a smug narcissistic bully.

       So you chose this place, and briefly looking at your history, correct me if I'm wrong, you obviously are a logic cowboy spreading the word, and you are gunnin' for a fight where you are the quickest draw shooting logic and impartiality bullets to slay those 'conspiracy people's view that you have a problem with.hmm ok, so you mention your issue with the sub, why come?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, I don't think you posted here yesterday. and your suddenly here in this post replying to me? fishy. And your username, can't imagine that is you primary account.. Nope, not going to discuss with you as your already chosen an immovable viewpoint, look to be an alt account, and maybe you were someone replying to me elsewhere with a different account. that username tho, usually the trolls like to unveil later as a maliscious suprise. anyway I'm done here cowboy, your true nature is transparent. is that enough for you to call me something something conspiracy nut? merry xmas
