        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>EDIT: <strong>from now on I&#39;ll archive each comment thread around the time of posting, so the users can see what The comments section looked like, compared to what it looks like after the infiltrators roll in with the vote bots. They didn&#39;t start coming in until about 8-9 am EST, they like to wait to bury the thread until the largest audience possible is present.</strong></p>

<p>Does anybody else find it rather odd, that on a sub called r/conspiracy, where a wide range of outlandish topics are free to be discussed, Pizzagate is somehow the <em>one</em> thing that gets pummeled into the ground? A conspiracy that was essentially handed to us on a silver platter, consisting of dozens of angles and several facets of circumstantial evidence to observe, somehow <em>each</em> and every aspect of the scandal/investigation, has its own little recited debunking talking point, and HAS to be attacked and downvoted. Every fucking time. Routinely.</p>

<p>Also, it&#39;s usually accompanied with very strange and inorganic voting on the post and in the comments. Usually 3-5 of the same users seem to come out of the woodwork, to spread their usual debunking techniques, and they seem to be &quot;coached&quot; almost, as I have observed the evolution of their anti-PG talking points/debunking attempts over the last year. The same new talking point seems to be pushed in unison as well, further evidence of coordination.</p>

<p>Take a look at this older PG thread that was posted last year. See that the comments actually reflect the conspiratorial attitude and openness to ideas like this?</p>

<p><a href="https://NP.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5d6ryy/pizza_gate_should_be_our_main_focus_if_we_expose/?st=JBHEJVT6&amp;amp;sh=b3d943ce">https://NP.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5d6ryy/pizza_gate_should_be_our_main_focus_if_we_expose/?st=JBHEJVT6&amp;amp;sh=b3d943ce</a></p>

<p>&quot;Well, maybe that was before everyone realized it was bullshit?&quot;</p>

<p>Oh that&#39;s right, Wikipedia, Snopes, and a slew of MSM sources claimed it was debunked, so it must be true. Does this sound like the mentality of a conspiracy sub? Regurgitating MSM talking points?  </p>

<p>Now, when you see any current PG thread, you have top comments that are <em>nowhere</em> near reflecting the attitude of the sub like they used to.  </p>

<p>PG posts have been gracing the front page of this sub for over a year now. So, if the users are interested in the investigation and upvoting the topic, <strong>Then who the fuck is downvoting good comments, and upvoting skeptical/abrasive ones?</strong> This looks shady as fuck...</p>

<p>I really hope most of the organic lurkers/users here are able to see this, and don&#39;t blindly accept every top comment of every thread at face value, or every downvoted/buried comment at the same token. </p>

<p>Why is this particular conspiracy so vehemently attacked and injected with skepticism and outright rejection? Has anybody else noticed this transition in the attitude? </p>

<p>The entire politics sub and most of the media have the &quot;Trump/Russia conspiracy&quot; well covered.  In fact, there&#39;s probably <em>thousands</em> of posts on politics about it.  Is that &quot;organic&quot;?  What&#39;s the real conspiracy here?  </p>

<p>I got severely downvoted in politics for bringing up how important the JFK Files are.  People literally saying to me that files that showed a COUP of the American government didn&#39;t matter because it happened so long ago.  </p>

<p>So yeah, there are a lot of people on here that ARE quick to look for &quot;inorganic&quot; behavior, and call it out.  Those accounts always turn out to be &quot;nasty people&quot;.</p>

<p>If you call what goes on in politics debate or discussion, then yeah, totally organic.  But when those same people IGNORE the gravity of JFK, credibility goes out the window.  Is it debate/discussion if ANY contrary points are downvoted to obscurity?  Not really.  Do I downvote people that talk about collusion?  NO.  But still no impeachment, reporters even for WaPo say it looks like little is going to come of it, yet the recurring theme is &quot;any day now&quot; since the beginning of Trump&#39;s term.  </p>

<p>Do you think having TWO Bushes as president is &quot;organic&quot;?  Or Obama, who is related to the Bushes?  </p>

<p>And Trump broke up the dynasties, so the appearance of so many shills is interesting.  I&#39;m not saying Trump isn&#39;t pre-picked or anything either, but all hell broke loose when he looked like he had a shot at winning.  Things haven&#39;t been the same since.

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s why.  All the other conspiracies you mentioned do not have direct victims.  Thinking elites are reptilians or thinking the moon is  hollow does not create victims even if the theory is wrong.</p>

<p>Pizzagate, on the other hand, has and is creating real victims.  Comet pizza is a real business that was completely destroyed by Pizzagate.  Hell, a man even showed up at the business carrying a rifle.  Podestas, Alefantis, Lynn de Rothschild, even that spirit cooking lady, all of them, I detest with a passion.   </p>

<p>But they are all still citizens of this country and deserve not to be lynched by a public mob.  Now, I know a lot people think there&#39;s plenty of evidence to be certain that Pizzagate is real.  But that really isn&#39;t the point.  If there was real enough evidence, then the police or FBI should investigate and arrest or clear them.  The fact that these people (who again, I really do hate) have had their lives turned upside down just isn&#39;t right to me.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ben Swann is hardly a professional investigator. He&#39;s a hack journalist, and his report is glaring with the same argumentative fallacies that form the wobbly backbone of Voat&#39;s Pizzagate sticky thread.</p>

<p>This video is no different than a campfire story.</p>

<p>At any rate, even Swann doesn&#39;t say &quot;There&#39;s enough evidence here to justify an arrest, so why hasn&#39;t anyone been arrested?&quot; No, he gets away with the oldest trick in the book - asking a question that plants the suggestion in the mind of the viewer because it refuses to provide the obvious answer.</p>

<p>Swann&#39;s question: &quot;Why hasn&#39;t any investigation taken place?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>The obvious answser: &quot;Because the evidence is too weak.&quot;</strong></p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ditto.  You can&#39;t destroy somebody because you THINK they are guilty.  Like these creeps in Hollywood.  Kevin Spacey gets ERASED from a production and replaced without even having due process.  What kind of justice is that?  Sure, the guy is almost for sure guilty but that&#39;s not the way it works.  You get charged and then you get your day in court.  Then consequences.  But no, these people are getting canned before due process occurs.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ok here is the thing there are some conspiracies that are legit like bay of pigs, Tuskegee experiments yes first they were denied but after time the government admitted it happened. Then there are the ones that are still need to be explain like on 9/11 wtc building 7 just fell because a fire randomly took it down. The official report said a fire and debris somehow knocked a building down and in the aftermath the owner of the building states that the fire department said they need to demolish the building in a process that takes months in planning even the fire department says that they do not handle explosives. Even on a personal level i believe that bush is behind it. Then there are the conspiracies that are flat out balls to the wall insane like pizzagate. Hearing it in face value that Hillary Clinton is involved in a chipd sex ring is insane. I know that Hillary has done shady and illegal shit but she wouldnt be involved even why a pizza palor even a believer went to the place with guns to find the kids surely if he was determined he would&#39;ve knocked down every door to find them. Then the things alex jones have said are out there like U.N troops in chicago i know that a news station like Fox news would be the first to cover as America under attack and we would see a large force of our own army heading to Chicago. One of his conspiracies that never happened was that during Obama term he would take away the guns of the American people well obama is gone and we still have guns. I come here and keep a open mind that there is a idea here is the evidence and i make a conclusion. With 9/11 i believe bush is behind it because that attack caused a ripple effect with perfect events and how like the pentagon is supposedly the most secure building in the world and only 2 tapes of the event has been released. Even now i am believing that Las Vegas is a orchestrated attacj1 because unlike other events like the homedepot truck attack or that school shooting in new mexico we have motives but Vegas no info the only thing i saw was a report last night on how a UCLA student saved people. Then the survivor&#39;s of the shooting are dying in &quot;accidents.&quot; Its just mainly that some are ok its possible to its flat out true to just crazy insane conspiracies</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve spent a lot of time researching and practicing various occult methods and I can tell you, it is very real. The only way to find out is to do your own research and try it out. You&#39;re a human being with more power than you realize and it is my personal belief our society is setup to prevent us all from realizing this fact. The poison in our food, water and medicine is all meant to dumb us down and kill us before we can become conscious enough to realize our full potential. But I&#39;ll get off my soap box now.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>False. Longevity is the same, the numbers you&#39;ve read have been fudged by including all the women who die of child birth and all of the children who died due to unclean birthing environments. Typically, most people survived well into their 80s or 90s if they weren&#39;t shipped off to war. In fact life expectancy is failing nowadays purely because of all of those things I mentioned, look it up.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve read a lot of sources and I&#39;ve never once seen any mention of animal or human sacrifice. I think that only happens in elite circles to get the psychological &quot;splitting&quot; effect. Spirit Cooking is the toned down version of this but its still not something that people in occult circles aspire to. Also, if you read old grimoires and they have ingredients that sound like human or animal remains they are most likely just some kind of old-timey term for a kind of wild herb or plant.</p>

<p>You can achieve gnosis (&quot;one-ness&quot; or an altered state) through drug use but it&#39;s not as potent or useful as plain old meditation. </p>

<p>You can use magick to &#39;nudge&#39; results in a direction you want. Its kind of like the law of attraction. You can&#39;t cast a spell for a Ferrari and expect good results, you may only end up with a flyer in the mail with a picture of a luxury vehicle on it. You want to attract things that have a realistic way of manifesting. For example after 5 months of no luck on a job search I cast a simple spell and two days later got an offer for a job that was 40% higher pay than my previous one. </p>

<p>If you go inwards through meditation and quiet your ego there is a whole world there to be explored. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The secret to all of this is your belief. For this to work you need to believe it with every fiber of your being. That will engage your will and make your intentions all the more potent. So if knowing the full history and various incarnations of magic from 10,000BC and onwards will help you feel more connected and spur your beliefs, then I&#39;d say have at it. This path is long and a lot of it has to do with following your own intuition. IMO The only truth is your own inner truth. That&#39;s the coolest part of all of this, to me, that the world of higher realities and magic is so nonjudgmental. (mostly)</p>

<p>Hang out in <a href="/r/occult">/r/occult</a> for a while, they get their fair share of nonsense trolls but there are a ton of legit people there from all kinds of different backgrounds and belief systems. Just allow yourself to be drawn to any particular direction that you feel some connection to and your path will eventually reveal itself to you. That&#39;s the other beauty in all of this, things tend to fall into place.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I see that many people already responded but I would like to explain the context as I used it in my comment. Magic(k) is used to denote ritual Magick from stage tricks, spelled
Magi(c). The term was coined by Aleister Crowley, founder of Thelema. Understanding Crowley is essential to understanding the modern occult. </p>

<p>Magick, per his definition, is Will manifested into Reality. It is the active attempt on ones part to alter the base nature of reality. This can be as simple as Sigil creation to the darker practices of Enochian and Khabalistic language communication. </p>

<p>Let’s be honest about this. PG is bullshit. The Lolita Express is not. Bill Clinton, and Hillary by extension, is directly linked to the Lolita Express, but not to PG. This sub and people like you won’t give up on PG but you completely ignore the Lolita Express. </p>

<p>As always: I believe there is overwhelming evidence that sexual abuse of children by elites is rampant.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll address your specific claims, not the vague general ones. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>children tied up?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not tied up, not children. One child. Taped to the table. By another child. Kids play. Sometimes this play, when viewed through adult sensibilities, may look sexual. I was tied to trees, chairs, and locked in cages by other children when a child, at my request. Because it was fun, nothing to do with sex. In this instance, you appear to be sexualizing the innocent play of children. You brought sex into this, not them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>his picture being a greek boy lover statue?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dude is <em>deep</em> in the art community, where greek art is heavily represented. In greek society, pederasty was acceptable and ubiquitous. There is a fuckload to admire about greek society, the birthplace of democracy and western society. Someone in the god damned art world has a greek bust, and you can only imagine that it could be about boy fucking. But it&#39;s other people with the sick fixations, right?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>his name meaning &#39;love for infants&#39;?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It doesn&#39;t mean that. To english speakers, it bears a superficial resemblance to that phrase in <strong><em>grammatically incorrect</em></strong> French. Which is a textbook example of twisting the evidence to fit the crime, the entire problem with thise whole mess. It is purely confirmation bias. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yea just cherry picking right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes. And even your cherry picked examples hold up as well as wet tissue paper. </p>

<p>I am absolutely convinced that sexual abuse of children by elites is completely rampant. There is actual evidence for this, in abundance. But this is being pushed by dishonest people with agendas. You&#39;ve been manipulated with appeals to emotion, your confirmation bias ruthlessly exploited. As a result of how you and others in your community are behaving, <em>more</em> children will the raped and murdered. The &quot;investigation&quot; is not conducted with maturity, responsibility, or critical thought, and therefore is seriously inhibiting acceptance of elite child abuse by the public.</p>

<p>If one were to conduct a psyop to bias the public against taking the idea of elite sexual abuse of children seriously, one would be hard pressed to do a more effective job of it than you guys have. I rather suspect that was deliberate. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The very term PizzaGate struck a lightning chord with so many across generations,religion and politics like nothing else before! </p>

<p>Many in here never really experienced the Satanic Day Care scare and how effective it was to silence victims, victim survivor families and the long lasting consequences. The years of silence, death and untold, unnamed, faceless victims.</p>

<p>It was careening right into Hollywood for my sister until James Wood did that made for TV movie and BAM! The doors were shut tight! I&#39;m pretty sure James Wood knows my nieces abductor - how weird is that to say in a public forum!</p>

<p>There&#39;s no possible way that I can prove exactly what happened to my nieces and I have no <em>Proof of life</em> for my baby sister who couldn&#39;t get any help from the Holly Wood LEO&#39;s nor form the FBI!</p>

<p>Well I now know where two abducted children from the Belly of the Hollywood Beast are but I can&#39;t prove shit. And because the Law let my sister down I have no way to approach my nieces. </p>

<p>So while people were freaking out about the Paid Actor that went in and shot up CPP I was looking at the faces of my grown nieces that I had been searching for for years and I have u/911BodySnatchers322 and u/maebrustlehustler and so many in here to thank! We learned techniques and back doors!</p>

<p>Where are the victims? They&#39;re silenced by ignorant craven people. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My youngest sister became involved with this much older, very persuasive Holly Wood actor, screenwriter, lawyer-ish (he never had a law licence but it was part of the allure to her that he could speak in legalese as she was well versed in Constitutional Sovereign Law shit, her undoing in the end...) anyway a handsome dude...she was off the charts book smart but not very wise to the world. </p>

<p>She gave birth to two little girls at home - alone. There were no birth certificates issued but we/I (family) didn&#39;t learn that till later. She began suspecting things after her second child was born and then her personal suspicions were confirmed and she said she went to the Holly Wood police and to the FBI. </p>

<p>All of her <em>alleged</em> (I say this because I never saw any of it, just what she told me...)  and at one point when she herself was on the run with the girls the evidence disappeared from the authorities, then her daughters were abducted by their father, the man my sister claimed/suspected was abusing and filming the abuse - they were taken out of the US. </p>

<p>At first, much of the initial stuff was <em>filtered</em> by my mother. In my own personal life I was raising kids, having my own crisis and following major <em>builds</em> around the country every three years. My mother, sadly was of the belief that sister was very fortunate, that she should shut her mouth and enjoy the ride. Much of this I admit, I didn&#39;t piece together. Strange how the guilt piled on story by story and then at one point my sister, according to my mother, just went utterly bonkers.</p>

<p>I last spoke with my sister in 1998-1999. I&#39;ve had <em>no proof of life</em> for her since. In about 2006 I got a call from the US/Mexico consulate where one of my nieces was trying to establish her birth record - needless to say I was panicked and I did everything wrong and our call was disconnected.</p>

<p>I began telling bits of this story in here long long before Pizza Gate or the Holly Wood Gate stuff ever came up. I&#39;ve been in reddit nearly eight years now, and five years ago this account name.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve nothing to gain or lose in the telling. There&#39;s a suffocating guilt that is very hard to explain but I own it.</p>

<p>there is a psychological word for it which I can&#39;t think of, but it&#39;s because they don&#39;t want to believe the world that they &quot;know and understand&quot; is not only completely different but also totally messed up</p>

<p>When r/pizzagate started hitting some nerves, the subreddit was banned on November 23, 2016. When the internet coverage continued on other subs and sites, some jackwad carried weapons into the shop to discredit all further discussion in MSM and any traction other than alternative media was &quot;<em>over</em>&quot;</p>

<p>Podesta and his circle of friends are pretty creepy, if you ask me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>..I mean did you even check the sources? I&#39;m through the first paragaph and half of it seems made up or heavily stretched.</p>

<p>Chicken lover as a code for pedophilia. they link to some community defined definition. 
<a href="http://archive.is/uvDYq">http://archive.is/uvDYq</a></p>

<p>They provide this, however if we look at something that dates when entries were made we can see on Urban Dictionary the definition of Chicken Lover as being associated with fucking children only was posted in March 2017. A long time after the podesta emails were posted.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chicken%20lover">https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chicken%20lover</a></p>

<p>Let&#39;s go to the next claim. Some dude james had a picture of him with some greek statue that supposedly represents pedophilia. It doesn&#39;t seem like anything in the archive link they provide indicate that he is a symbol for pedophilia. It merely states that he was the lover of some emperor.</p>

<p>The link to the picture isn&#39;t provided however, and we are left to speculate on the context of it. And even if it&#39;s in his own house who cares? It seems like just random art work unless you are looking for something special in it which seems to be what this voat article is digging for.</p>

<p>So far everything just seems to be reading into stuff beyond what is justified. Should I bother going deeper?</p>

<p>On computers, the data is stored on small disks called hard drives. You could fire a bullet through any other part of the computer and the data would be unaffected. Your operating system, photos and music are on your hard drive. Pizzagate people claim the hard drive was destroyed (a bullet wouldn&#39;t erase all incriminating evidence anyway).

    <div class="md"><p>I mean democrats an republicans do enough sketchy shit that I don&#39;t feel its necessary to paint the others as devils for things that are untrue/unprovable. </p>

<p>That&#39;s my issue with pizzagate, seth rich, etc. It&#39;s like the DNC and HRC have done enough terrible shit but you have to convince yourself and others that democrats are literally pedophile murderers? I get that&#39;s easier to argue, but when you feel the need to paint people on &quot;the other side&quot; as just absolutely evil by definition is stupid and completely unproductive.</p>

<p>You want to rail on how HRC isn&#39;t qualified because shes two faced, engages in pay to play, and is bought off by big banks and her donors? Fuck yeah, I&#39;m on board with that. Plenty of evidence of that.</p>

<p>But then someone links me some official pizzagate conspiracy thread on voat and it has dozens if not hundreds of just completely asinine unsupported conjecture that no rational person should bother believing.</p>

<p>Like seriously, there is enough to genuinely hate a given politician for ignoring unconfirmed or even fake bullshit. Like if you look at Roy Moore people focused so much on how he&#39;s a pedophile. 90% of the negative things said about him in the media were about his proclivity to sexually pursue young girls. Yet all you had to do was look at why he got kicked out of being a judge twice, and read his policy positions on gay marriage, the constitution, slavery, and women voting and you should realize this guy shouldn&#39;t be allowed to judge a finger painting competition let alone craft legislation or be a judge.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree with your rationale...HRC was a scoundrel long before she became a Senator, etc. and I didn&#39;t experience any change in my opinion either way because of youtube or reddit nonsense. The manners in which these elite scum are groomed is way above my pay-grade, though I have a clear understanding that it&#39;s not being done for our benefit.</p>

<p>Moore was an obscure numbskull long before whatever forces dug up especially horrific versions of stories about him. I am not especially keen on national news affecting local/state races, but I am relieved none the less that this horseback clown is out.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have time to invest in deciphering the speciously reported goings on at some D.C. venue, even if it seems likely to be connected to a bunch of creepy blood drinkers.</p>

<p>There is plenty of blame to go around. I won&#39;t be voting for any of these clowns. A vote for a Democrat or Republican is not rational in light of their collective behavior.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well it escalated pretty damn quick with only circunstancial evidence, and now it’s common to see death wishes against Podesta and Alefantis, despite being no evidence of actual wrong doing. That is part of the reason it gets pushback.

Also many times the evidence is presented without context, and when people try to argue the evidence they are labeled pedophile defenders, shills, etc. I can say I don’t believe in reptilians and don’t think Bill Hicks is Alex Jones but no one says I don’t belong here. If I say picture of a kid with a single strip of masking tape is not evidence of child bondage I’m told I don’t belong here. That’s another reason. 
Pizzagate reaches the front page of this sub multiple times a week, and yet I still see posts like this saying no one is letting it be discussed. This post would be a great place to discuss it, but instead people are discussing not being allowed to discuss it. 
No one is telling anyone not to investigate, go right ahead, but your investigation should not presuppose their guilt. Downvotes aren’t stopping you from acting. But until your investigation is complete, or at least until any victims come forward, it’s strange they have already been roundly convicted here and that such a persecution complex follows this conspiracy. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is exactly what I was talking about. I’ve had the argument about the girl with the tape, and been called a shill because of it, and now when I use it as an example I must have an agenda for bringing it up like I cherry picked it. There’s always an excuse for someone not believing in pizzagate. 
But I’ll bite. What’s the strongest evidence? Handkerchief? Walnut Sauce? Shock Rock Band? Grafiti? Triangle shaped pizza logo? Dominoes on stomach full of pasta? Cum Panda? Chicken Lover? Maria Abromovich? That one Balkan artist? Complex film projects? Kids in a pool? Obama spending $65,000 on hot dogs? Ryan O’Neal? False flag shooting? Ben Swann recap video? Hotard? Drag Queen bartender? No deflecting, you act like I picked a weak link on purpose. 
(And just for the record I do believe in pedogate, I do believe there are elites who use pedophelia for blackmail, I just don’t believe pizzagate (being Podesta and Alefantis and Comet Pizza))</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t duct tape and there were no jokes about abuse. So why does minimizing the contents of photo make you scream &quot;SHILL!&quot;, when you&#39;re misrepresenting what&#39;s in the photo as well?</p>

<p>the claims of the owner are that the place is family oriented...he brought these types of posts on himself by making a claim that has been verified false time and time again.  the reason people share posters like that is to further prove that jimmycomet is not being honest.

<p>I agree with this, a lot is posted without context and I believe that is because the poster is under the assumption we will understand.  Problem is not everyone is keen on the latest PG news...but this lack of context is seen on many topics and they dont get attacked for it as hard as this topic does.</p>

<p>someone was just banned after posting an amazing thread with well organized data in regard to PG though.  Another thing, I think a lot of people who believe PG is real and jimmycomet/podesta are guilty know they have no proof.  Most of the back and forth I see is people trying to convince others on whether or not such and such is good enough circumstantial evidence to support an actual investigation</p>

<p>Edit. Fairly called out about the tape. It was definitely more than one piece. It’s about 10 or so per hand, but it’s still masking tape, the kid is clearly in no danger, and it is clearly a joke about rowdy kids running around restaurants. </p>

<p>You cant look at each bread crumb individually, its the culmination of all the bread crumbs that forms a trail and i think THAT is the big difference between the two sides of this topic.  One half looks at the culmination of findings as a whole while the other looks at each find individually</p>

<p>I have very strong feelings about <em>anyone</em> being accused, tried and sentenced by internet mobs for crimes based on extremely circumstantial and often made-up evidence. </p>

<p>The average famous person does not have their name tied to accusations of a child sex slave ring run out of the basement of a pizza parlor. </p>

<p>And that&#39;s besides the point that John Podesta and especially James Alefantis are not famous people. One is a lobbyist and one is a business owner. Outside of the local DC area and a puff piece in GQ, nobody knew who Alefantis was until a bunch of people decided he ran a child sex ring.</p>

<p>Why are you just hand-waving away an armed man shooting up Alefantis&#39; restaurant as if it&#39;s a forgone conclusion that it was a false flag operation?  </p>

<p>I want you to imagine for just a second that you were the person who&#39;s name was tied to Pizzagate. Instead of James Alefantis, it&#39;s you. Thousands of people online think you&#39;re guilty of molesting and murdering hundreds (or thousands) of children, and that law enforcement refuses to do anything about it. Someone has already gone to your place of work with a gun in order to investigate you.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s besides the point that John Podesta and especially James Alefantis are not famous people. One is a lobbyist and one is a business owner. Outside of the local DC area and a puff piece in GQ, nobody knew who Alefantis was until a bunch of people decided he ran a child sex ring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>one ran hilarys presidential campaign and the other has been on TV, and has agreed to go on news shows to talk about PG (aka placing himself in the limelight)</p>

<p>they&#39;re famous </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why are you just hand-waving away an armed man shooting up Alefantis&#39; restaurant as if it&#39;s a forgone conclusion that it was a false flag operation? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>because it was most likely a staged event to try and hammer the nail into the coffin of PG</p>

<p>street cams moved away from the restaurant a day earlier?  hundreds of people predicting a false flag was going down, the only shot fired was through a locked closet and into a hard drive?  cmon</p>

<p>there is no way to really know, but thats why im hand waving it away.  the meaning behind that is its own argument</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want you to imagine for just a second that you were the person who&#39;s name was tied to Pizzagate. Instead of James Alefantis, it&#39;s you. Thousands of people online think you&#39;re guilty of molesting and murdering hundreds (or thousands) of children, and that law enforcement refuses to do anything about it. Someone has already gone to your place of work with a gun in order to investigate you.</p>

<p>Are you telling me that this would not affect you negatively in any way?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Barring the potential false flag I was in on, no it would not hurt me in anyway.  These thousands of people online that think Im guilty are screen names... they&#39;re not real people in my life and if I dont want to deal with it online I can block them, make a new account, change privacy settings, etc.  These people are fine.  Podesta is doing talks and there aren&#39;t protests or anything outside of them.  Comet is open and not going bankrupt....theyre fine.</p>

<p>the relatively small group of people who have convicted them in thier minds are a non issue, period.</p>

<p>The Clinton&#39;s have way more dirt surrounding them, with way more people talking about it, but no one jumps to defend them and thier honor.  Its odd how jimmycomet and podesra are the only ones anyone cares about defending so vehemently. </p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>the &quot;investigation&quot; is just a collection of circumstantial evidence.  When you have a shop owner state that he runs a family restaurant and is then proven to be lying you wonder what else would he lied about.  Especially if hes lying about something so insignificant.</p>

<p>Speaking of deflection, no one said a fetish show is proof of molesting children.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is there any good evidence or are you just going to keep throwing the same ‘circumstantial’ evidence against the wall to see what sticks this time? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The culmination of circumstantial evidence is good enough to warrant an official investigation.  You not agreeing with it doesnt change that fact.  Investigations have been green-lit with less.</p>

<p>Also, just to be clear, as any lawyer or cop worth a damn would tell you - circumstantial evidence is more important than youre giving it credit for.  Attempting to dismiss it simply because its not a smoking gun is extremely niave.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No one cares about death threats to innocent people? Well fuck off, because I do. I have this weird beliefs that people are innocent until proven guilty, </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me too.  Lets start an investigation and get to the bottom of it.  Much better to close the case one way or another than to leave people to thier own opinions.  </p>

<p>As mentioned above.  There is more than enough to open a case, so let&#39;s do it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that the evidence should actually point to a real crime.</p>

<p>Absolutely, lets do a thorough investigation and find out if there is one.</p>

<blockquote>

    <div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re not tainted by the gospel of the cult? Then surely it&#39;s much easier to see why nobody takes Pizzagate seriously?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a simple trick that shows why Pizzagate isn&#39;t taken seriously... Ask the question: &quot;US there a single shred if evidence fur this conspiracy theory?&quot;. The answer is no.</p>

<p>As for why you get such militant reactions to it, well, it&#39;s been done to death. It&#39;s been investigated by the conspiracy community for a full year. And not a single piece of evidence has been found. Not a bit. There&#39;s only two groups of people trying to keep it alive. Trumps cult and idiots. And there&#39;s significant crossover. Hence the above users comment.</p>

<p>So think if it this way. Pizzagate and Flat Earth theory are pretty much the same. Thoroughly debunked and frustrating to see people STILL bring it up. Especially here, at a time when the biggest conspiracy in history is unfolding before our eyes and 90% of the sub have been brainwashed to effectively be part of it. That&#39;s frustrating as hell. Even more so when people like you bring up the equivalent of flat earth theory, helping bury the bigger conspiracy. </p>

<p>Unless you have something new, get off the front page.</p>

<p>Anyone involved in actual human trafficking who has become aware of Pizzagate is probably delighted that the finger is being pointed in a different direction from where they&#39;re standing. The only reason the Democrats (and hence certain large media organizations) cared was because they knew they were losing a digital battle over the election to clever Internet trolls. It&#39;s why they spammed Reddit with a hundred anti-Trump subs and made stupid speeches about the dangers of Pepe the Frog.</p>

<p>Yeah, I&#39;m sure there are sex abusers hiding in their ranks. Do I think it goes all the way to the top and has anything to do with Comet Ping Pong or the Podesta Brothers? The evidence for that argument is beyond weak, misinformative, and fallacious.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I can&#39;t get over the fact that you can&#39;t entertain the idea that some particular force is still pushing Pizzagate for unknown reasons, but you&#39;re warrantlessly convinced <em>I</em> work for someone.</p>

<p>Yes. Our standards demand that a crime be committed before an investigation can commence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They found Ted Bundy mid strangling a victim, and said, &quot;finally something we can use to investigate him!&quot;. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they started investigating after Bundy&#39;s first victim had been found. And in Bundy&#39;s case, no investigator said, &quot;finally something we can use to investigate him!&quot; because no one knew who the hell was doing the killings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sounds like you don&#39;t understand how this works.</p>

<p>Well, as I understand it, when a crime is determined to have happened, investigators work backwards to figure out who the perp is. You don&#39;t designate a person a criminal and proceed to pick their life apart to find the crime they&#39;ve committed. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Well it escalated pretty damn quick with only circunstancial evidence, and now it’s common to see death wishes against Podesta and Alefantis, despite being no evidence of actual wrong doing. That is part of the reason it gets pushback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to respectfully disagree.  No random cares about jimmycomet or skippy getting death threats.  Its a nice <em>excuse</em>, but I dont buy it.  Anyone saying they&#39;re defending them is a liar imo.  That sort of thing just doesn&#39;t really happen unless you know them or yourself had been falsely accused and the topic is now personal to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Additionally we have posts like yesterday with the band flyer and the drag queen which seem to conflate an all ages concert, fetish wear, and pedophelia somehow. The repetition of these type of tenuous links seem disingenuous and manipulative. Another reason for pushback.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>the claims of the owner are that the place is family oriented...he brought these types of posts on himself by making a claim that has been verified false time and time again.  the reason people share posters like that is to further prove that jimmycomet is not being honest.  Again, people feeling compelled to defend a pizza shops honor is far-fetched imo.  Its not something anyone would care to defend unless there is a vested interest in it.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also many times the evidence is presented without context, and when people try to argue the evidence they are labeled pedophile defenders, shills, etc. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree with this, a lot is posted without context and I believe that is because the poster is under the assumption we will understand.  Problem is not everyone is keen on the latest PG news...but this lack of context is seen on many topics and they dont get attacked for it as hard as this topic does.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I can say I don’t believe in reptilians and don’t think Bill Hicks is Alex Jones but no one says I don’t belong here. If I say picture of a kid with a single strip of masking tape is not evidence of child bondage I’m told I don’t belong here. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If thats happening then I agree it should stop, but Ive never seen that said or implied to anyone</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Pizzagate reaches the front page of this sub multiple times a week, and yet I still see posts like this saying no one is letting it be discussed. This post would be a great place to discuss it, but instead people are discussing not being allowed to discuss it. No one is telling anyone not to investigate, go right ahead, but your investigation should not presuppose their guilt.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>someone was just banned after posting an amazing thread with well organized data in regard to PG though.  Another thing, I think a lot of people who believe PG is real and jimmycomet/podesta are guilty know they have no proof.  Most of the back and forth I see is people trying to convince others on whether or not such and such is good enough circumstantial evidence to support an actual investigation</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Downvotes aren’t stopping you from acting. But until your investigation is complete, or at least until any victims come forward, it’s strange they have already been roundly convicted here and that such a persecution complex follows this conspiracy. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>is that really any different than chemtrails, 9/11, jfk, or any other conspiracy though?  Why do people get a pass for &quot;knowing&quot; the true story behind those things and not this?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Edit. Fairly called out about the tape. It was definitely more than one piece. It’s about 10 or so per hand, but it’s still masking tape, the kid is clearly in no danger, and it is clearly a joke about rowdy kids running around restaurants. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You cant look at each bread crumb individually, its the culmination of all the bread crumbs that forms a trail and i think THAT is the big difference between the two sides of this topic.  One half looks at the culmination of findings as a whole while the other looks at each find individually</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It literally proves that most users here are tired of hearing about Pizzagate and we&#39;re tired of Pizzagaters playing the victim card and then using that as proof that they must have been right all along.</p>

<p>The Pizzagate theory doesn&#39;t prove jack shit, it targets people who are by all accounts innocent of any crime, and it encourages harassment, doxxing, invasion of privacy, and other acts of domestic terrorism on the part of its believers.</p>

<p>All you have is a superficially compelling &quot;mountain&quot; of creepypasta, most of which is either attempts at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisoning_the_well">poisoning the well</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_fallacy">guilt by association</a> that relies on half-truths which allow the reader&#39;s imagination to fill in the obvious blanks.</p>

<p>You cry and you cry and you cry, saying all you want is an investigation, but none of you have any idea how the criminal justice system works. <em>You don&#39;t even have evidence of an actual crime.</em></p>

<p>The only victims of Pizzagate are your targets, and it&#39;s entirely politically motivated. It began as a 4chan troll meant to hurt the 2016 election.</p>

<p>You did your jobs as useful idiots. The election is over. No matter how much <em>weird art</em> John Podesta&#39;s brother might own, there&#39;s no indication of any kind that he or Alefantis have ever been involved in anything nefarious.</p>
