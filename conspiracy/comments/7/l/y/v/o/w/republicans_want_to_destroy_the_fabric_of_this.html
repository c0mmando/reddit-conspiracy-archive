       Republicans can't fucking stand anyone who isn't filthy rich. Hence why all their policies, like the tax bill, have a defined purpose of doing whatever it takes to make sure non-rich people become as poor as possible, and stay that way.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is because Republicans dream of a country where there are a very select few group of ultra rich people who live life full of luxury and indulgence, surrounded by gates and armed guards. Then the rest of the population is dirt poor, peasants, living in squalor, fighting for scraps, struggling to stay alive, who act as servants/slaves to the ultra rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fuck Republicans and fuck anyone who votes for them to continue us down this path.

       Democrats don't vote to kick millions of undocumented persons out of this country.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats don't vote for tax bills aimed at funneling money directly from the poor/middle class to the rich.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats don't vote for bills aimed at taking away people's health care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Democrats don't vote for bills that cut necessary services like Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, Welfare and SNAP for those who benefit from them.

      <p>
       Democrats don't support policies aimed at turning our entire planet into a toxic waste dump just so shareholders can earn an extra 0.25% dividend profit.

       I am FUCKING TIRED of the whole "both sides are bad" meme. It's not fucking true. Democrats at least care.

       I used to be where you are, buddy. It's tough to face the facts about partisan politics. I was raised diehard Democrat in a blood red state. It really hurt to realize neither side stood for me, and that one side is as bad as the other.
      </p>
      <p>
       They fight in front of you to create the illusion that there's a side you can take and a protective force that's watching over you. They're allies behind the scenes with the only competition between them being who can fuck us over the hardest.

       Did you learn that from a history teacher? Seems like a lot of us get here from that one really awesome history teacher who taught you stuff that wasn't in the text book. It starts from there.

       (Disclaimer: Never Voted Republican, did not vote dem in 2016...) The democrats serve their corporate overlords just like republicans if you don't know that by now you are not paying attention. The democrats stopped being "for the people" as soon as the unions became weakened (90's) and post citizens united ruling by the " Supreme Court" they take as many corporate hand outs as the " other party". If you still cling to the us vs them thing you are part of the problem imo .

       If you were to take a home equity loan and spend it all on your spouse and children they would temporarily be elated as well. It's not a good strategy though for government or home finances. Trump went from "I'm going to audit the Federal Reserve" to giving them a sloppy kiss instead.

       History reveals that every piece of racist legislation that was ever passed and every racist terrorist attack that was ever inflicted on African Americans, was initiated by the members of the Democratic Party. From the formation of the Democratic Party in 1792 to the Civil Rights movement of 1960's, Congressional records show the Democrat Party passed no specific laws to help Blacks, every law that they introduced into Congress was designed to hurt blacks in 1894 Repeal Act. The chronicles of history shows that during the past 160 years the Democratic Party legislated Jim Crows laws, Black Codes and a multitude of other laws at the state and federal level to deny African Americans their rights as citizens.
      </p>
      <p>
       History reveals that the Republican Party was formed in 1854 to abolish slavery and challenge other racist legislative acts initiated by the Democratic Party.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some called it the Civil War, others called it the War Between the States, but to the African Americans at that time, it was the War Between the Democrats and the Republicans over slavery. The Democrats gave their lives to expand it, Republican gave their lives to ban it.

       You must like to sit at home and play the vidya games, dontcha boy? Tell you what, when you get a fucking job, pay taxes, and raise a family, pay for your healthcare and insurance, get back to me. I struggle everyday to make it, that's life kid. The way you speak, it sounds like you are envious of the elite and how easy they have it. Wake up kid! If you could sit in Jay Rockefellers shoes, Rupert Murdochs shoes, Bill Gates shoes, you would feel their intense hate for humanity and you would recoil in disgust. Be poor, be middle class and enjoy your life instead of pointing the goddamn finger at people who dont like to give handouts to do nuthins. Republican speaking.

       So the fuck what if I play video games? My point is I shouldn't have to fucking work against my will in order to have my needs met. Working against one's will is slavery. This country has trillions of dollars of wealth and money, so at the very least we can afford to meet everyone's needs, but no, the fucking rich call the shots and decide to horde the money for themselves, forcing people to work or starve. Fuck that shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       People should have their needs met by the government. That way the individual can decide to pursue their passions in life instead of doing mundane jobs just to put food on the table. Fuck that. Society would be so much better off if people pursued their dreams and passions. My passion happens to be video games, what does that have to do with anything? If I want to play video games all day every day, I should have every fucking right to. Instead I have to do it with the constant fear that Republicans will take away my benefits and rights that I am entitled to just to make the rich richer.
