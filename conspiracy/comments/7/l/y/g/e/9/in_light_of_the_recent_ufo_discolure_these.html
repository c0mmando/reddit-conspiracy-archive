<p>**** EDIT: I credited DownvoteDeamon for the post but realized the credit really goes to <a href="/u/Alx__">/u/Alx__</a> as stated later in the post ****</p>

<p>ASTRONAUTS</p>

<p>I believe that these extraterrestrial vehicles and their crews are visiting this planet from other planets which obviously are a little more technically advanced than we are here on Earth.&quot;</p>

<p>— Colonel Gordon Cooper, Mercury &amp; Gemini Astronaut</p>

<p>I happen to be privileged enough to be in on the fact that we have been visited on this planet and the UFO phenomenon is real. It has been covered up by governments for quite some time now.&quot;</p>

<p>— Captain Edgar Mitchell, Apollo 14 Astronaut</p>

<p>I&#39;ve been asked [about UFOs] and I&#39;ve said publicly I thought they [UFOs] were somebody else, some other civilization.&quot;</p>

<p>— Astronaut Eugene Cernan, Apollo 17 Commander</p>

<p>I was testing a P-51 fighter in Minneapolis when I spotted this object. [...] It looked like a saucer, a disk. About the same time, I realized that it was suddenly going away from me - and there I was, running at about 300 miles per hour. I tracked it for a little way, and then all of a sudden the damn thing just took off. It pulled about a 45 degree climbing turn and accelerated and just flat disappeared.&quot;</p>

<p>— Captain Donald Slayton, Mercury Astronaut</p>

<p>Statistically it&#39;s a certainty there are hugely advanced civilizations, intelligence, life forms out there. I believe they&#39;re so advanced they&#39;re even doing interstellar travel. I believe it&#39;s possible they even came here.&quot;</p>

<p>— Dr. Storey Musgrave, NASA Astronaut</p>

<p>For nearly 50 years, the secrecy apparatus within the United States Government has kept from the public UFO and alien contact information.&quot; &quot;We have contact with alien cultures.&quot;</p>

<p>— Astronaut Dr. Brian O&#39;Leary</p>

<p>In my official status, I cannot comment on ET contact. However, personally, I can assure you, we are not alone!&quot;</p>

<p>— Charles J. Camarda (Ph.D.), NASA Astronaut</p>

<p>NASA, CIA, ARMY, AIR FORCE ETC</p>

<p>Unknown objects are operating under intelligent control... It is imperative that we learn where UFOs come from and what their purpose is...&quot; (1) &quot;Behind the scenes, high-ranking Air Force officers are soberly concerned about the UFOs. But through official secrecy and ridicule, many citizens are led to believe that unknown flying objects are nonsense.&quot; (2)</p>

<p>— Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter, first Director of the CIA, 1947-1950</p>

<p>We had a job to do, wether right or wrong, to keep the public from getting excited.&quot; (2)</p>

<p>— Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Scientific consultant for Air Force Project Blue Book</p>

<p>Of course UFOs are real, and they are interplanetary. The cumulative evidence for the existence of UFOs is quite overwhelming and I accept the fact of their existence.&quot;</p>

<p>— Air Chief Marshall Lord Hugh Dowding, Commanding Officer of the Royal Air Force during WWII</p>

<p>We must insist upon full access to disks recovered. For instance, in the La case the Army grabbed it and would not let us have it for cursory examination.&quot;</p>

<p>— J. Edgar Hoover, first Director of the FBI</p>

<p>We already have the means to travel among the stars, but these technologies are locked up in black projects and it would take an act of God to ever get them out to benefit humanity... anything you can imagine we already know how to do.&quot;</p>

<p>— Ben Rich, former Head of the Lockheed Skunk Works</p>

<p>This &#39;flying saucer&#39; situation is not at all imaginary or seeing too much in some natural phenomena. Something is really flying around. The phenomenon is something real and not visionary or fictitious.&quot;</p>

<p>— General Nathan Twining, US Air Force, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 1955-1958</p>

<p>Unidentified Flying Objects are entering our atmosphere at very high speeds and obviously under intelligent control. We must solve this riddle without delay.&quot;</p>

<p>— Rear Admiral Delmar Fahrney, USNR</p>

<p>The nations of the world will have to unite, for the next war will be an interplanetary war. The nations of the earth must someday make a common front against attack by people from other planets&quot;.</p>

<p>— General Douglas MacArthur</p>

<p>ROCKET SCIENTISTS &amp; PHYSICISTS</p>

<p>It is my thesis that flying saucers are real and that they are space ships from another solar system. There is no doubt in my mind that these objects are interplanetary craft of some sort. I and my colleagues are confident that they do not originate in our solar system.&quot;</p>

<p>— Dr. Hermann Oberth, the &quot;father of modern rocketry&quot;</p>

<p>I am completely convinced that UFOs have an out-of-world basis.&quot;</p>

<p>— Dr. Walther Riedel, chief designer and research director at the German rocket center in Peenemunde</p>

<p>The least improbable explanation is that these things are artificial and controlled... My opinion for some time has been that they have an extraterrestrial origin.&quot;</p>

<p>— Dr. Maurice Biot, leading aerodynamicists and mathematical physicist</p>

<p>The possibility of reduced-time interstellar travel either by advanced extraterrestrial civilizations at present or ourselves in the future, is not fundamentally constrained by physical principles.&quot;</p>

<p>— Dr. Harold Puthoff, Director, Institute for advanced studies at Austin, Author of fundamentals of Quantum Electronics</p>

<p>SOVIET / U.S. PRESIDENTS</p>

<p>The phenomenon of UFOs is real. I know that there are scientific organisations which study the problem. It must be treated seriously.&quot;</p>

<p>— Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev</p>

<p>I can assure you that flying saucers, given that they exist, are not constructed by any power on earth.&quot;</p>

<p>— President Harry S. Truman</p>

<p>I strongly recomment that there be a committee investigation of the UFO phenomena. I think we owe it to the people to establish credibility regarding UFOs and to produce the greatest possible enlightenment on this subject.&quot;</p>

<p>— President Gerald Ford</p>

<p>I don&#39;t laugh at people any more when they say they&#39;ve seen UFOs. It was the darndest thing I&#39;ve ever seen. It was big, it was very bright, it changed colors and it was about the size of the moon. We watched it for ten minutes, but none of us could figure out what it was.&quot;</p>

<p>— President Jimmy Carter</p>

<p>&quot;I looked out the window and saw this white light. It was zigzagging around. I went up to the pilot and said, have you ever seen anything like that? He was shocked and he said, &quot;Nope.&quot; And I said to him: &quot;Let&#39;s follow it!&quot; We followed it for several minutes. It was a bright white light. We followed it to Bakersfield, and all of a sudden to our utter amazement it went straight up into the heavens. When I got off the plane I told Nancy all about it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I occasionally think how quickly our differences worldwide would vanish if we were facing an alien threat from outside of this world.&quot;</p>

<p>— President Ronald Reagan</p>

<p>Anyone is welcome to provide evidence that a quote is legitimately out of context, and I will remove it.</p>

<p>All credit goes to <a href="/u/Alx__">/u/Alx__</a> for compiling these. Sources for these quotes can be found at <a href="http://spaceflare.net">http://spaceflare.net</a>. Many of them are on video, in context. For example, this one.</p>

<p>It is recognized that quotes are not proof. However:</p>

<p>There is compelling evidence that UFOs are physical phenomena, not imaginary or hallucinatory. They are captured on radar that only detects physical objects, and perform feats not explainable by known physics. 90-95% of sightings can be explained by known phenomena, but 5-10% cannot.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a big list, but quantity doesn&#39;t mean quality or fact. Isn&#39;t it possible Harry Reid is just trying to cover up using a program to funnel money? Isn&#39;t it possible that putting &quot;evidence&quot; and surrogates out there is just a way of setting up a plausible defense to a corruption case? Afterall, incompetence and a lack of results isn&#39;t enough to prove corruption, no matter how much money went to his friends for contracts under the program.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some of the reports are genuine sightings by honest people of our own hidden technology. Maybe some were real. We all know UFO is used synonymously with &quot;alien&quot; because we want to believe it. It is  far more likely that it is just technology that has been hidden from the human cattle. </p>

<p>We also know Hollywood has an Alien propaganda agenda, we also know people like Tom Delonge and Steven Greer and the like are plants to spread disinfo mixed with truth.</p>

<p>Some of the sightings may actually be aliens, we had to get the tech somehow after all, maybe it was tesla, maybe it was reverse engineering.</p>

<p>I guess what i&#39;m saying is, if this innocent UFO sighting stuff turns into a &quot;UFO Threat&quot; by the gov and the media, it will be the advancement of the agenda all of us here (hopefully) know about. </p>

<p>Why? because if aliens have been visiting for however long, have they been waiting for this specific moment in time to destroy us all? no, if they were really hostile, they would have stomped us and it would have been over long ago.</p>

<p>The technology our rulers have would fool everyone into thinking it&#39;s aliens, thats how far they have come. And they know it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There&#39;s much more to it, though. If it&#39;s advanced tech, then it&#39;s been had for thousands of years since there are paintings depicting de facto UFO ships in the sky.</p>

<p>And if that&#39;s the case, why have an industrial revolution - or let any revolution happen. It seems too free.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think we are in an epoch and the high tech is what was preserved in various forms inbetween cataclysmic events.</p>

<p>This is also very possible.</p>

<p>If the theory about tesla opening up humans to this tech then the industrial revolution and oil economy would have already been established, and his tech was stolen by the elite barons of the time.</p>

<p>As for the paintings of ancient UFO&#39;s... It is very possible that those are part of the propaganda program, we have seen tons and tons of evidence of ancient historical artifacts being messed with and purposely interpreted incorrectly. For example, the egyptian relief of a &quot;helicopter&quot; has actually just been eroded or manipulated to look like that.</p>

<p>As researchers of the truth we must remain vigilant.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So... They plan on waiting until they can make their tech&#39;s origins untraceable, so that no one knows a human made it. If you can&#39;t even figure out that <em>a</em> human made it, you&#39;re not going to be looking for <em>the</em> human who did. Then they&#39;ll enslave humanity and no one will even try to stop them because everyone is busy trying to fight back against aliens?</p>

<p>Yeah, that sounds like a plan that could work. Good thing we&#39;ve got quick thinkers theorizing about this stuff so if it&#39;s tried it can be called out and nipped in the bud.</p>

<p>If you had to guess, what do you think these objects are?  </p>

<p>I&#39;m of the opinion of either a probe of sorts from a distant civilization or some kind of phenomenon natural to our planet we don&#39;t understand as of yet.</p>

<p>Fascinating though and in the information age (although littered with a lot of disinformation) the truth will inevitably come out, I&#39;m just happy to be a spectator </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah that&#39;s why I said it&#39;s a mix of both. I think they fully reverse engineered it towards the end of the 20th century and started to stock up on these craft and suitable weapons (project MARAUDER?) in the last couple decades which explains the missing $21T. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No sir.  Not anti science or history although I do admit the chance we are lied to via history is pretty high when there are only words involved.  Ive no way to verify it at least when its only words and there is no physical evidence.</p>

<p>The truth is, my original post was mostly directed towards hearsay such as the shite presented in this thread (aliens and apparently a number of different races).  Given there are guaranteed plethora number of reasons to deceive people about such sensitive, highly controversial matters, one would think my advice is rational.  In addition to documented plans that make logical and intuitive sense such as Project Bluebeam.  </p>

<p>So why dont you think my advice is rational here? What have YOU seen?  </p>

<p>And if I didn&#39;t see it with you, what reason do I have to believe your ... words about aliens?  Should I also believe in those accounts which suggest they saw God in the flesh?  Or angels?  And why not?  </p>

<p>To my best understanding and analysis of the physical evidence regarding &#39;aliens&#39;, it seems much more reasonable to pursue the thread of advanced human technology.  Perhaps even runaway human ancestors (i suppose we may call them aliens?)  But not even necessarily that, just modern black ops is a likely possibility, if anything. </p>

<p>Just my best analysis.  The readers here can take or leave it.</p>

<p>Direct testimony of multiple pilot witnesses is not hearsay, backed up by ground radar and multiple air radars, observed multiple times over weeks.  Dismissed as some <em>easily falsifiable &quot;radar report&quot;</em></p>

<p>You were arguing that we should stick to evidence we see with our own eyes, that the pilots and other witnesses were <em>&quot;official&quot; liars</em>, that believing them is a fallacious appeal to authority.</p>

<p>In a stretch, you seemed to argue that trained pilots and radar operators verifying contact with UFOs are tantamount to lunatics who see hallucinations.</p>

<p>Now your position slithers into whether black ops or hidden hi-tech civilizations are a better explanation than aliens for these craft whose performance defies our understanding of physics, and certainly of engineering. That question does remain until further evidence is revealed.  </p>

<p>Question is whether fact pattern and leaks support man made or alien technology. </p>

<p>I appreciate your well thought out response.</p>

<p>But perhaps there is still a misunderstanding.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, it all depends on the conclusions reached by them and those who hear their testimony.  I suggested two more viable alternatives than a plethora of alien species out there in space and here on earth.  The issue I have with these types of testimonies is that there is no way we have invalidated the more likely &quot;advanced human technology&quot; </p>

<p>Is there any actual evidence you believe about humans meeting non humans in the flesh?  Why can&#39;t these just be human operated.  I suggested the possibility of a run-away part of our own human race.   The common element to these accounts is advanced vehicles.  I admit that seems to be the case.  But aliens?  Why?  </p>
