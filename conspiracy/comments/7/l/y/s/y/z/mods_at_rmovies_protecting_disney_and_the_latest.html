<p>There’s the clip.  I admire Mark Hamill so much for being real about this.  He’s going against a company that has a multi billion dollar franchise on the line.  Having people hear that the most iconic hero in the story isn’t being portrayed correctly—and hearing it from the actor who plays him—that’s a big fucking deal.</p>

<p>If someone is able to post this and get a discussion going on that sub I’ll delete this, but I’ve tried several times and it’s shadowed out.</p>

<p>Here’s another thread they just removed/hidden (5 mins ago it was on the front page of that sub)—along similar lines:</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Stop. </p>

<p>Do not for a second think that they&#39;re disseminating anything good post-Walt Disney. Every head of every major corporation and institution is in the same club vying for the same monopolistic globalist utopia. By encouraging distrust they generate chaos and order out of that. Pushing Racial equality sedates the masses and brainwashes younger generations to accept mass immigration. Anti-male propaganda is to push for emasculation. There is a reason the elite bolster women and their movements: on average They&#39;re excellent consumers and very obedient. Xenoestrogens aren&#39;t being removed for several reasons beyond it being too costly. Without enough riled up men in a country of obedient consumer drones amalgamated with throngs of disconnected foreigners, you have an easily controlled populace. </p>

<p>Be scared.</p>

<p>Remember to also provide evidence for the claims that you make. If your evidence must remain confidential, message the moderators to privately verify your claims. If a post makes a claim that is later proven false, the post will be deleted, regardless of vote totals. We don&#39;t want misinformation taking over KiA.</p>

<p>You&#39;re a <strong>day old account</strong> and you seem to have solely joined Conspiracy to push some absurd attack on Gamergate using this sub.</p>

<p>Given this is Ghazis MO to push idiocy like this on other subs, it&#39;s pretty transparent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you didnt even read did you</p>

<p>how was i attacking gamergate by posting a clip of hammil? it was instantly removed for an absurd reason.</p>

<p>exactly why this thread was created. the clip is censored site wide. mods give bullshit reasons for censorship. clip wasnt edited in any way.  the title is the same as the youtube clip. no editing</p>

<p>i then tried posting an archive link or a news site. no rule breeaking.</p>

<p>got banned</p>

<p>this thread is precisely what is happening on reddit sitewide. mods of most subreddits are deleting any mention of this. most subs are compromised including kotakuinaction. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here are a few thoughts about this that I posted recently.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SciFiScroll/comments/7l9hki/a_few_thoughts_about_star_wars_and_disney_vs_lucas/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SciFiScroll/comments/7l9hki/a_few_thoughts_about_star_wars_and_disney_vs_lucas/</a></p>

<p>The reason I posted this in r/SciFiScroll is because it&#39;s a sub for real scifi fans and also because r/movies is a corporate controlled sub.</p>

<p>They have almost as many subscribers as worldnews. So if a post like mine hits the front page there, literally millions of people would see it in the first day. If I point out all the things that are missing or problems with the new movie, it will affect the way millions of people perceive a franchise the Disney spent a few Billion $$$ to buy.</p>

<p>tldr; uncontrolled r/movies vs controlled adds up to millions of $$$. Corporations are all about max profits, therefore r/movies = controlled.</p>

Guillermo Del Toro was going to adapt another of the guy&#39;s works called Monster, but I guess it was too intelligent for Hollywood or maybe they blacklisted him because of Billy Bat.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve looked at some manga and was really interested. First time it did take a second to figure out the right to left thing, funny how we get used to one way to do something.</p>

<p>Is the manga version of the bible common? I worked at a warehouse that carried a lot of religious books and we had some. It looked like it was horrible.</p>

<p>Dutch merchants started the VOC and expanded into England. They were jews. The proceeded to rape and exploit lands, instead of the Christian moralization. These are facts. The Rothschilds gained a majority share of the market with the napoleonic wars. this is a fact. The jewish merchants started the opium war for their profits. This is a fact. The jews now own every fed in the world except for 6 countries or so. Their shear material values vastly exceed the money in the market, and if you knew anything about economics you would realize it is a continuous wealth redistribution to the share holders of the jews, who have more value than exists in money. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>My theory (well not really MY theory, but the one I&#39;ve subscribed to) is that some are simply untouchable. Wood Allen, Dan Schneider, Brian Gelman, these are all guys that are all so plugged in that they can&#39;t ever be taken down. They simply know too much about other people. Allen is friends with Epstein, and his &quot;son&quot; Ronan Farrow (who is really Frank Sinatra&#39;s son) is the one who wrote the NYT article on Weinstein.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s what really going on. Is Weinstein guilty? Sure, but others are far more guilty, and this is a distraction. If anything, he wasn&#39;t willing to do worse shit, and they punished him for it. God save us.</p>

<p>Which really just shows how fucking retarded this concept of race is. It doubly shows how retarded these non WASP racists are, because they&#39;re just a little further down the discrimination agenda.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a messenger or leader, I am not trying to rally the troops, if it falls upon deaf ears for being called a wanker- big deal. Harsh language ought to people up. I listen to people if they have a fucking point, regardless of delivery. </p>

<p>I&#39;m just a fellow wanker who can&#39;t understand why people invest so much time, energy, and money into Hollywood bullshit but at the same time worry about deep issues in life.</p>

<p>Star Wars? Really, dude? Adults who &quot;need&quot; to see these movies need to grow the fuck up. They are pure man-children who condition their snot-nosed rugrats to want to consume more plastic crap. The baby baby boomers spoiled their kids on this shit, and now the Generation X kids are parents of Millenials who think it&#39;s normal for their dads to play PS4 with them all day and binge watch Netflix for 8 hours.</p>

<p>Alan Moore calls out this bullshit all the time with superhero movies. It&#39;s time for people to create, not to consume. It&#39;s time for innovate creative works, not retreads, reboots, remakes, sequels, and prequels of fucking licensed toys!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Michael Arndt had outlined a trilogy with Lucas giving notes on it. Disney threw it out, cancelled the EU, and let Abrams make up whatever he wanted for the VII, with no overarching plan for VIII or IX. </p>

<p>VII set up all these questions, then the discussions and hype around VII revolved around the questions &quot;Where&#39;s Luke? Who are Rey&#39;s parents?&quot; </p>

<p>Now Johnson comes in and effectively says &quot;F*ck it. </p>

<p><strong>Spoiler</strong> It doesn&#39;t matter where Luke was. Rey&#39;s parents are nobodies. These questions aren&#39;t important. Destroy the past.&quot; We left 7 with Luke looking at his saber. We started 8 with him tossing it over his shoulder. <strong>End spoilers</strong></p>

<p>My issue is it feels like there&#39;s no planned out trilogy. There&#39;s no set up and payoff and conclusion that 3 &quot;eps&quot; can do. I like what Rian Johnson did with a lot of VIII, but he did away with anything VII did narratively. To me, VIII was a better starting point for a trilogy. And that frustrates me as someone who wants to spend time with these movies. </p>

<p>To sum it up, Disney doesn&#39;t know what the f*ck they have planned for this trilogy but are fine letting people do whatever they want with the episode they get. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, there&#39;s no Rotten Tomatoes Disney shill conspiracy, you just don&#39;t know how the site works. basically if a critic gives a movie anything higher than a 5 it&#39;s labeled fresh, below 5 it&#39;s rotten. So if you had a movie where 99% of critics thought it was just ok. it&#39;d have a 99% on RT. And would you really not put it past salty Star wars fans to go and spam 0 star reviews cuz their Snoke theory was wrong?</p>

<p>I believe it was referenced by Kylo earlier in the movie that the effort of projecting yourself across that large a distance would kill you. The fact is, Luke was stranded on that planet with no real way to leave. (well, unless that ship is waterproof.) He did the only thing he could to save what was left of the Resistance.</p>

<p>Also, Force Projection is pretty badass.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the issue is the decision to have  him almost kill Kylo in his sleep in an attempt to prevent him from becoming Vader 2.0</p>

<p>It&#39;s completely out of character for Luke! He&#39;s a redeemer! When Obi-wan tried to tell them Vader was beyond saving Luke disagreed and saved him! So now we we have a new Luke who would consider murdering a sleeping boy. The complaint here is that it feels like Johnson changed a significant part of an OG character just to make a new one more sympathetic. That strikes a lot of folks as disrespecting the original story.</p>

<p>Luke is well established to have strong flashes of darkness and so his reaction was like a Vietnam veteran having a flashback. He&#39;s not a pure Christ-figure despite the galaxy&#39;s belief otherwise. He&#39;s still human, capable of bad decisions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I’ve seen the movie twice and didn’t really care for it. Jedi aren’t supposed to turn to the Dark Side either but “things happen” as Luke says in TLJ. He was the last one, all by himself, almost killed his nephew and ended up turning him to the dark side. Ample reason to shut things down and head to a deserted island IMO.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There has to be some tomfoolery over at r/starwars too, and pretty much all over the net where TLJ is discussed, because that movie was seriously bad on a number of levels, but users there are just eating it up like nobody&#39;s business, while people giving honest, and quite frankly, obvious criticisms, are getting down voted hardcore. Its really a shame because after enjoying Disney&#39;s Marvel, I had high hopes for their star wars movies. Rogue One was pretty good. It felt like star wars for the most part anyways. But TFA was a reboot, and TLJ was canceraids. I&#39;m just glad real people are taking the time to rate it on sites like rotten tomatoes.       </p>

<p>I honestly cant remember ever seeing such blatant manipulation on a product review before.

    <div class="md"><p>The way I understand modern media &quot;bribery&quot; is this--a company will give a client a release copy, or early tickets to see a movie. The company will also provide lodging and transportation costs to critics to bring them to events. Sometimes the company will also provide you with merchandise. If you won&#39;t play nice with the company, then you won&#39;t get these perks, as the company can (and will) simply stop giving you the perks. Sure, they aren&#39;t outright giving you money to give a good review. But they are providing you with reasons to suck their dick.</p>

<p>This happens time and time again in the videogame industry (especially with Ubisoft and Activision) so I imagine it is no different for films.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah yeah I got my years mixed up. Feels like forever ago. </p>

<p>I honestly thought The Force Awakens, The Phantom Menace, and Revenge of The Sith were all far more cohesive and focused films than The Last Jedi. </p>

<p>I think the big misconception being spun here is that people hated this movie because it wasn&#39;t the Star Wars they wanted. Disney is using the tried and true &quot;fan entitlement&quot; angle that&#39;s used to shut down negative consumer reactions in the video game industry all the time. This couldn&#39;t be further from the truth, though. All of the major criticisms being made about this film have nothing to do with the Star Wars franchise. </p>

<p>It fails to maintain a consistent or appropriate sense of tone. It takes two and a half hours to tell a 90 minute story. It completely ignores its source material. It is technically flawed on many levels that I won&#39;t bother discussing until a Blu-ray is available to provide visual examples.</p>

<p>For some people like me, and almost half of Rotten Tomatoes, it&#39;s just a bad movie. </p>

<p>Somehow Disney has the whole world thinking &quot;Oh, it&#39;s just a bunch of nerds getting pissy because the director did something different. I don&#39;t care. I like different. I&#39;ll still go see it.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fine to hate it all you want, but I really don&#39;t understand your criticisms. I&#39;m not a fan of Star Wars, so I was really not expecting to like this movie -- especially after the last two / five boring pieces of junk. I thought this last movie took risks, and I liked it for that. I really liked that they touched a little on the military-industrial complex selling weapons to both sides. Talk about red pill! Read about IG Farben and Standard Oil trusts during WW2.</p>

<p>Anyways, feel however you want about the movie, but try to be more specific with the criticisms because it sounds like you&#39;re just making arbitrary observations. Was it too long because they failed so much? Did you not like them failing? Or just not failing that much? I&#39;m curious. I&#39;m starting to think people didn&#39;t like it because it didn&#39;t suck like the other movies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry I was keeping my review short since this isn&#39;t a movie subreddit.  I guess I&#39;ll put a big SPOILER WARNING here in case anybody reads this far down the thread.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Inconsistent tone: The film&#39;s sense of humor is very farcical and at time borderlines on burlesque.  It&#39;s almost enough to break the fourth wall.  This felt very strange and inappropriate for a fantasy film that otherwise focused on heavy themes like death, failure, and disillusionment.</p></li>
<li><p>It was too long: Finn and Rose going to that casino planet and riding those crazy greyhound aliens and failing their mission and fighting Captain Phasma and blasting their way out in that walker?  None of that needed to happen.  You could cut that entire sub-plot out of the movie and nobody would know the difference.  They just meet back up with the rest of the Resistance and say &quot;okay we&#39;ll just do what you guys were gonna do all along instead.&quot;  Failure can be an interesting storytelling device, but if that failure doesn&#39;t actually change the course of the story then it&#39;s just a self-contained narrative that doesn&#39;t need to be there.</p></li>
<li><p>Disregarding source material: This was actually a sequel to a film called The Force Awakens which set up <em>a lot</em> of seemingly important story points.  The bad guy&#39;s gigantic star-exploding superbase got destroyed.  This literally happened days before the events of TLJ and they never even mention it.  Rey had some kind of vision where she saw things related to Luke, Kylo, the Jedi, and the Knights of Ren.  Another character knew why she was having these visions, and said &quot;that&#39;s a story for another time&quot;.  That whole thing was just re-written so that Snoke was controlling her mind to take the lightsaber.  </p></li>
<li><p>There are other glaring inconsistencies with smaller details like character performances, such as Yoda&#39;s ghost doing the &quot;kooky trickster hermit&quot; thing even though that was established to be just a ruse and not his actual personality.  General Hux, who was a sneering militant villain in TFA (days prior) has suddenly become a submissive buffoon that the audience is supposed to laugh at.</p></li>
<li><p>Technically flawed:  Like I said, I&#39;d rather not get into this without visual examples handy.  There are a lot of terrible edits in this film, poor lighting, uninspired camerawork, and rough CGI composites.  I didn&#39;t care much for Rogue One, but from a technical standpoint it makes TLJ look like a bargain bin B-movie.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So that&#39;s not to say I didn&#39;t like anything about this movie.  I really loved the interactions between Rey and Kylo.  Their acting performances were both fantastic and their characters developed in very exciting and unexpected ways.  That whole thing with unconscious Leia going Superman and floating back into the ship was extremely bizarre but I thought it was eerie and inventive despite most fans really hating it.</p>

<p>And see, I think it&#39;s interesting you note that you aren&#39;t a Star Wars fan, because that seems to fit with Disney&#39;s whole conspiratorial reception pattern here.  It&#39;s something that they already did successfully with the Marvel property.  Make fans hate it, and make non-fans love it.  Create a narrative that disparages criticism for being nerdy or uncool.  Divide and conquer.  It&#39;s just easier for them to make money that way.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s funny that everything you hated about the movie are reasons why I loved it. I love movies with comic relief in serious films. I love subplots that may or may not advance a plot. I love that it rejected the last shitty movie. I love that Yoda burned the Jedi library and Skywalker never studied the material. I loved the effects.</p>

<p>Anyways, you&#39;re not the first person that complained about comedy, subplots, and rejecting TFA material. That&#39;s exactly the same review Half in the Bag said about it. I usually like their reviews, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they come out with another review a year later that basically takes everything back like they did with TFA.</p>

<p>You&#39;re turning this argument into gatekeeping. There&#39;s your conspiracy. You&#39;re hating the only decent Star Wars movie in the last twenty years for the most trite reasons. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a Star Wars fan or not. I&#39;m not going to suddenly like it more or less because I don&#39;t follow a fan club.

<p>You&#39;re being divisive because an entire paragraph of your previous post was devoted to putting down people who liked a movie:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also, I find it very weird that fans loved the shitty movies. Then Disney comes out with a movie that doesn&#39;t suck, and the fans hate it for that. We want a shitty movie because that&#39;s what a Star Wars movie should be! Completely unwatchable! Ugh. Remember when everyone hated Jar Jar? Now people like him? WTF? That just demonstrates the fans will like anything.</p>

<p>Oh really? What exactly did you like about it? The over the top cringe comedy? The decimation of established lore? The dialogue written for ten year olds? The numerous plot holes? The over the top antics of bb8? The uselessness of most of the cast? The mary sue-ness of rey and leia? Leia&#39;s superman impression? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>didnt notice any plot holes. liked the characters and world building. liked the anti-plot twist. besides poe in the beginning, dialogue still felt &quot;star wars-y&quot;.</p>

<p>the discussion for this movie is turning into &quot;this movie was objectively bad and if you liked it youre an idiot&quot;. ex. i hate fast and furious and think theyre all shitty movies but i understand why people like it.</p>

<p>well then i have no reason to keep talking to you about this.       </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Oh i understand why people like it...people like it because they have the mental capacity and attention spans of little children who are awestruck by modern cgi and easily succumb to modern product marketing. That doesn&#39;t change the fact that Disney completely gutted star wars with TLJ and turned it into a cash grab abomination. I mean I&#39;m not against Disney making money, but I would like them to earn it. Not by exploiting millions of star wars fans while simultaneously shitting on them by giving absolutely 0 fucks about what Star Wars has been before their involvement....       </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I found it strange how the user score and critic score on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes are so different with the critics score being really high across the board. </p>

<p>Pretty sure Disney paid for those reviews as I refuse to believe that barely any movie critics found any problems with the film and all thought it was a 4/5 star movie. Even if it was enjoyable there are obvious faults that are only discussed in the user reviews.</p>
