    <div class="md"><p>I mean he deleted his own account. But idk even know if that was him because of the embassy raid and what not. I&#39;m gonna reserve judgment and see what wikileaks has to say about the matter. And go from there. But it is very interesting </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, Assange hasn&#39;t deleted his own account, but Twitter has censored Wikileaks in the past. They bragged in front of Congress about how well they censored the DNC emails off of their platform. Twitter also briefly deleted President Trump&#39;s account, so that could be precedence, although when they did it to Trump, it came back shortly thereafter. Perhaps maybe the President has enough pull to get his account un-deleted, but I can&#39;t imagine Assange would. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Worth noting that, this account that is/was &quot;Julian Assange&quot; was never officially verified. Not that verification adds much, but still.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always kinda been skeptical of tweets that have came from that account. Sometimes, the account speaks very much like Julian. Other times, it doesn&#39;t seem like Julian would say. Julian is well-spoken, and some of the stuff &quot;he&quot; tweeted was not very &quot;polished&quot; (unfortunately i don&#39;t have record of any tweets), as in, he has a lot more time to think about what he wants to share, rather than in an interview or whatever.</p>

<p>However, the official Wikileaks account did follow, did like, did retweet that account numerous times.</p>

<p>Weird shit has been happening since October 2016 in relation to Wikileaks.</p>
