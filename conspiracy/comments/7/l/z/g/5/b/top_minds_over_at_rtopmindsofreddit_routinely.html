Most of the time, it&#39;s just shit posts they posted with alts that they link to on their sub and make fun of to make us look bad. Other times, they link to threads on their sub, as a way of targeting certain posts and brigading with downvotes. And, they do it all in plain sight, without suspicion, because the sub generally has a harmless and goofy demeanor to a vulnerable outside lurker.</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;top minds&quot; over at Top Minds Of Reddit seem to get their juvenile rocks off, on mocking, doxxing, and pestering other reddit users. </p>

<p>How much time do these guys have on their hands, to commit several hours of time documenting and archiving The activity of several users on Reddit? </p>

<p>Their main lie (of many) is that their sub is just a hub to link to wacky/off the wall posts from r/conspiracy.</p>

<p>The admitted paid employees (like <a href="/u/MAGA_hatter">/u/MAGA_hatter</a>) create this &quot;get a load of THESE guys!&quot; environment on their sub, which indoctrinates their retarded organic (and quickly shrinking) userbase into harboring resentment and mockery for the truth movement and the conspiracy culture.</p>

<p>The sub is an indoctrination tool to control the minds of the people that stumble upon it. Also a great way to link to threads and downvote brigade them. </p>

<p>They also have their own private sub where they congregate and &quot;plan&quot;.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s not kid ourselves and pretend like a lot of content on this subreddit (and even this post) isn&#39;t downright farcical. </p>

<p>Hell, many of the mods in this subreddit are so petty and disingenuous it makes my skin crawl. Some of the mods I&#39;ve interacted with in the comments have no intention of arguing in good faith and would rather keep pushing their agenda. I&#39;ve even have had that shitty gate-keeping technique thrown at me by implying that I&#39;m not a &quot;legitimate conspiracy user&quot;. Like I&#39;ve mentioned before, I don&#39;t think a little bit of critical thinking and skepticism does a disservice to this sub.</p>

<p>Joshua Ryne Goldberg is an interesting character. He was a Jewish American who wrote neo-nazi articles, posted anti-semitic stuff to Reddit, and a whole bunch of other things. He wrote an article for the Daily Stormer, a neo nazi website, that claimed &quot;<a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> is a fertile ground for recruitment.&quot; His alias was Michael Slay. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On online forums Reddit and 4chan, under the name European88, he uploaded thousands of anti-semitic and racist posts as a neo-Nazi, and on the specialty neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer, he his alter-ego Michael Slay did the same.</p>

<p>This is the article he wrote for Daily Stormer, which was used by so many people as &quot;proof&quot; this sub is targeted by white supremacists and nazis for recruitment:</p>

<p><a href="https://archive.is/5EBcB">https://archive.is/5EBcB</a></p>

<p>There is another example I am aware of. See <a href="/u/interrogatorybunny">/u/interrogatorybunny</a>. He posted a bunch of obviously racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. But his second post had proof he was actually a former <a href="/r/news">/r/news</a> mod &quot;Bipolarbear0.&quot; This is one of his submissions: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/">https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/128s2h/i_noticed_this_today_while_browsing_reddit_seem/</a></p>

<p>If you see the image he posted, it says right on there &quot;bipolarbear0.&quot; Under his moderator account, he was very anti-conspiracy, but then he posts racist stuff to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>. </p>

<p>Also see this post by <a href="/u/Amos_Quito">/u/Amos_Quito</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/3klzcr/racist_stormfront_article_declaring_rconspiracy/">&quot;Racist&quot; Stormfront article declaring /r/Conspiracy as a &quot;Fertile Ground for Recruitment&quot; for white supremacists was actually written by Joshua Ryne Goldberg - the Florida Jew recently arrested by the FBI under terrorism-related charges</a></p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see any evidence of what you trying to say. Especially the mod part, and &#39;a bit of &#39;critical thinking and skepticism&#39; that you are mentioning as healthy.</p>

<p>Calling conspiracy theorists here thins like wackjobs or just plain badgering is easy to say and easy to get others to agree without much effort, especially if they come in biased against conspiracies in general. </p>

<p>I&#39;m a lurker most of the time but lately I&#39;ve been getting pretty concerned, which is why I&#39;m speaking up lately.</p>

<p>Now a group of even 2-3 folks making comments about the person or theories&#39; sanity, or variation of stupid, causes chaos and blurs what is happening to outsiders or new folks. I&#39;ve witnessed this and so have many others, and it&#39;s not light criticism or pointing out by critical thinking. It&#39;s goading, attacking by insulting the ideas similar to &#39;aww, c&#39;mon you know that&#39;s nuts&#39; or just attacking the idea that there is a conspiracy. By doing this in a sub called that, conspiracy, it&#39;s odd that they don&#39;t just disagree and leave, but continue to badger and at times openly try punish the person by shaming, in seemingly to virtue signal what they are doing to others that are with them, or have just joined in the punishment. I think it&#39;s more of they were together than just random. In this post, many of the names I recognize during my time here. I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m a gatekeeper or attendance taker I just find it odd that those making the most vigorous points, borderline attacks seem really have an interest in making points here, imho.</p>

<p>I notice this happening more and more. I still am little amazed that people are having a problem with conspiracy theories in a conspiracy sub. There are posts that are ridiculous, and they are so ridiculous that it is very suspiscous...Like someone obviously had reason to say they are getting enough free energy from makeshift chemical battery to do things that even someone who took a fresh high school science class four poke holes in, to purposely look that way. But there aren&#39;t the ones I&#39;m seeing this behaviour.</p>

<p>I hardly ever see the mods involved in anything to be honest. There was one case where people were personally attacking folks instead of just leaving if they weren&#39;t getting their point through.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, I&#39;m not refuting your observations. I&#39;m just disagree about some points, and that I have had distinctly different observations along with others, and it seems like we are burdened with having proof every time instead of people actually looking at data available. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Really, I&#39;d like to make one thing clear. The conspiracy folks, anywhere, have always been considered &#39;a little out there.&#39; Radio, TV, online and are the butt of comments and joked, it&#39;s an easy target. Just like oldMiseryGuts up above calling conspiracy theorists here wackjobs, easy to say and easy to get others to agree without much effort. Now a group of even 2-3 coordinated folks doing causes chaos and blurs what is happening to outsiders or new folks.</p>

<p>So why are they doing it? Just to make fun of us for sport? To take over the <strong><em>conspiracy</em></strong> sub for talking <strong><em>conspiracy theories?</em></strong> WTH? Does that not sound over the top? If you don&#39;t agree with someone&#39;s point, and you feel after some time you aren&#39;t getting anywhere, most people will move on. But continuing to mock, belittle and virtue signal to your group by doing this is Juvenille and of course the goal is not to change their mind anymore. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s say they are not politically motivated or that none of them are shills. Then why? To squash open discussion of what they perceive as crazy? Really? They are the experts in all areas and can say &#39;you are a wackjob&#39; because listen to yourself, it&#39;d ridiculous you crackpot conspiracy dude! Now there are posts that are ridiculous, and they are so ridiculous that it&#39;s a lot suspiscous...Like someone obviously had reason to say they are getting enough free energy from makeshift chemical battery to do things that even someone who took a fresh high school science class four poke holes in, to purposely look that way. I ranted all this wall o text. I&#39;m sorry, just super frustrated of always expected to have the burden of proof only to shot down by dimple name calling.</p>

Some victims of non consensual experimentation try coining new terms like &quot;biohacking victim&quot; however the term TI keeps getting used by most victims and the media. people being tortured often struggle with communication because of stress levels and anger issues.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You shouldn&#39;t have to deal with disingenuous people just to have an honest discussion or conversation about anything - why is it fun to be manipulated by somebody who sees you as lesser from the get-go? The whole point of &#39;top minds&#39; is that they are mocking people they feel are stupid and out of touch by calling them &#39;top minds&#39;, and if such a community is targeting another, what do you think their objective is going to be? It&#39;s transparent.</p>

<p>Nobody should have to deal with anybody who is only interacting to exploit weakness and attack on it. That&#39;s a pretty shitty thing to do, even if it&#39;s just on an online message board.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what has been going on here for months, and the mods have done fuck all about it. I have already messaged them to make upvoting/downvoting for subscribers only. These topminds vermin only come to r/conspiracy to mock and disrupt critical thinking.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know any other subreddits whose mods would stand idly by and let the entire sub go to shit like this. Yes you can&#39;t just call everyone who disagrees with you a shill, but when someone is posting exclusively on r/conspiracy, doing nothing but antagonizing other users with establishment propaganda and a brand new account, it&#39;s pretty obvious what their intentions are.</p>
