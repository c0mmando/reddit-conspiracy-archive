        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It is a far greater brainwashing tool than the TV. You can convince people that thousands of ordinary people believe something, just by paying for shills to astroturf. You can buy votes, likes, views. It’s far more insidious than TV because it is much harder to tell when you are being fooled. </p>

<p>Reddit is surely one of the worst places for free thinking. It has become somewhere where the front page is filled with content which has been paid for, whether it be for marketing or political purposes. Much of what is popular on reddit is essentially trashing people for who they are, what they look like, how they live, and what they think. Reddit in general has little room for anyone who thinks outside of a pretty narrow set of ideals and perspectives. In fact deriding people for thinking outside of this box is one of the most sure fire ways of getting upvotes, or in other words, praise and recognition. </p>

<p>Back in the day, the internet was a great way to share thoughts and ideas. Now it is full of stifling little cliques, and shitting on people and dismissing them as if they are worthless trash, often for only the slightest transgressions, is considered perfectly acceptable, even noble.</p>

<p>The internet has become a terrible place for free thinking. It’s like a gigantic school playground, and us in this sub are like it’s freaks and geeks, but even here there is plenty of shitty, closed minded behaviour towards one another to be found.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the Internet&#39;s fault. For only a few dollars a year, anyone can make a website and post almost anything they want on it. If you want a place to share ideas and don&#39;t think there are any adequate sites for it anymore, then go make one yourself. That&#39;s the true power of the Internet. It&#39;s not just a tool for you to find immediate gratification for each and every one of your ideas. But if you really want to, you can make a site for just that!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you don’t feel there’s a problem in the fact that in the past there were big, popular sites which were great for free thinking and sharing ideas, and now you have to make your own website and pay for advertising to say anything that goes against the grain and actually get some kind of interest. You don’t think that’s a step back?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No. You cannot control what is and isn&#39;t popular. Again, if you have something you want to talk about and there is no place else on the net to talk about it, then go build a site to talk about it and draw people to it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s how many popular internet sites got started. The Internet wasn&#39;t designed for the web the way that it currently is. It was designed for anyone who wanted to be able to build a site and connect it to the entire collective internet for anyone to come along and browse. I will agree that it has become a far more complicated and scary beast, largely due to the overstated importance of search engines, data collection and social media, but the fact remains that for now at least, we have a relatively free and open Internet where anyone can potentially change the state of things at any given moment. </p>

<p>The problems you cite have nearly nothing to do with the Internet, and almost everything with Humans being fickle, short-minded and inattentive for the most part. </p>
