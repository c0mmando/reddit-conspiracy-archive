       I'm talking about things like "Pork &amp; beans." When your product is 98% beans and 1% maple syrup &amp; 1% pork, calling your product "pork &amp; beans" is a conspiracy to promote/market pork and to ignore how important beans are to the equation.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pork's stock is higher than beans. Pork is the other white meat, it's porkchops and bacon, it's battle-tested All American fare.
      </p>
      <p>
       This shit should be called "Beans &amp; Pork" if we're being generous, "Pork Flavored Beans" if you want to be accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not always the big stuff that constitutes the most insidious scams.
      </p>
      <p>
       What other examples can we think of?

       This is similar to "ice cream" being so pumped with air that the FDA had to step in and enforce the definition of ice cream. Now what's being sold is more often labeled as "frozen dairy desert" or something, because it's not enough of a composition between actual cream and sugar.

       are begging for McDonalds to add vegan options almost everyday. I feel its mostly the result of a corporate marketing attempt more than an organic desire from vegans to eat shitty food at a horrible and unethical animal product company.

       I've had many vegan friends spanning many years, and a large majority of them oddly wished for vegan options at McDonald's and Jack n The Box.
      </p>
      <p>
       One vegetarian friend years ago even convinced himself that the taco meat in Jack n The Box tacos were fake, so he'd eat them every now and then. Vegans and vegetarians can be weak just like everyone else.

       Think of it as an opportunity. You can now make independent decisions that weren't formed subconsciously by propaganda.

       Sometimes freedom has initial consequences, you feel alone or don't know where to point your will. But never forget to thank the universe for your freedom and it will show you it's deepest truths.

       Deceiving the consumer market is not a new line of thought, Marketing studies dig deeply into the public reaction to the very thing you mention. i.e. How people react to it being called porked and beans vs beans and pork etc. Humans are very perceptive in some ways, and this can be used against us if we do not stay conscious of how this strength can also be a great weakness.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm sure they put pork first on the label because people see that has being more valuable than beans, I like where this may go but at the same time it's kinda like..... duh the consumer is seen as a sheep that needs guided to what they want, honestly people seem to like it this way and often enjoy having things made simple and decided for them. Speaking from general observation.

       To anyone curious:
       <br/>
       It's because they're less than a gram each, and they class one single tic tac as one serving. So since one serving has less than a gram of sugar they can call it "sugar free"

       we would learn that it's

       the bread price was fixed, the news would complicate the shit out of it, and then the government would get paid some money in a settlement under the table and the CEO would retire with his golden parachute, giving us the finger as he ascends into the obscurity of the 1%.

       We were talking about this at work. My bet is that to get the gift card includes disclosing your contact info and signing away rights to compensation from a class action suit. This whole campaign is loblaws lawyers earning their paycheck by minimizing legal exposure.

       YES. I hate the word “natural.” Like yeah, arsenic is natural, doesnt mean I need it. Just because its natural doesnt constitute something as safe. Use your brain and really think about what you are buying, and read the ingredients! The more shit you cant pronounce the worse off it usually is.

       Well of course. Banks can only leverage in loans (in whatever multiplier the Fed sets) based on what they have in reserves, or, peoples' bank balances. Smaller accounts are practically useless to them, just as poor people as somewhat useless to a capitalist-driven economy.

       I don't know man, I'm pretty inclined in the kitchen as I have cooking experience from various restaurants I've worked at. I buy fresh ingredients and often prepare meals from scratch. I'm from Canada and bacon ranges anywhere from 6.99-12.99 a pack. Shit just adds up so quickly in your shopping cart, don't get me wrong though 100$ at the store still goes a long way but still.

       The GMO and pesticide laden food is a big problem too, but don't forget that the animals are eating the most heavily messed with food, plus the hormones and antibiotics. For all we know it could be worse for us to be eating these animals, because the toxicity could be accumulating in their cells that we eat. At least the fruits and veggies can be rinsed and some don't absorb the pesticides as much, like avocados. Spinach and strawberries on the other hand, I would only eat spray free/organic.

       That's the thing though. Even raw ingredients are going up in price. My girlfriend and I cook mostly home made meals and we still easily end up spending 80-100$ in a blink of the eye.

       Bacon alone is 7-10$. Shit adds up fast, even raw ingredients.

       Not sure I agree. Shitty processed food is artificially cheaper because they're primarily made of corn, soy, and meat: all three of these big industries (the kind that do GMO and hormones) receive
       <em>
        massive
       </em>
       subsidies. Fruits and vegetables get $0.
      </p>
      <p>
       My healthy diet is absurdly expensive. I have zero regrets because I view it as the best form of health insurance (and I'm a big foodie), but the bill total is equivalent to buying a designer bag every week.

       I always thought the side effects of chantix, the stop smoking aid, were just side affects of quitting itself, and ultimately indicate it's little more than a placebo, at best... At worst, it's got other things in it and it's parading as a stop smoking aid.

       Monosodium Glutamate. Potential 'trigger', not the root cause, but perhaps one of several triggers for autism. Not to mention it's why you can't eat only one pringle or cheese it. I've always hated American Chinese food and now I realize for good reason too.

       Sodium Flouride. I was called 'eccentric' for buying a gravity filter for my drinking water, doing my best to flush out the fluoride from my body and keep it out. I honestly feel sharper for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know if Sodium Fluoride actually strengthens your teeth, however, I do know there are other healthier and more natural substances that do a better job, like coconut oil - of which do not include the side effects of a possible 'neural toxin' -

       Screw Colgate for removing the 'fluoride free' from their toothpastes. Since that time I have not bought a single tube of theirs and never will again - I switched to the only toothpaste I know that offers zero fluoride - Tom's of Maine.

       I normally don't bother taking the time to actually provide source information or reasonable examples - it's not my job to educate people or to change anybody's mind here or anywhere else(I'm talking to you young American) - however, I'm feeling magnanimous.

       Let's get even bigger. Why does this happen? Money, for power, for control. America is, as we see, the most control obsessed country on the planet. The most power obsessed, and the most wealth obsessed. You will know them by their fruits. This will never go away through legislating away a name of a product, it goes away when people aren't finding for wealth and power to the point they have to deceive everyone with so much bullshit for a dime.

       Lets talk about pet food......
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at all that fresh delicious food on the bag! So many great words like 'grain free', 'REAL MEAT! High quality protien!' 'HIGH PERFORMANCE' And it's in all sorts of artaficial flavours and fun shapes (that's so you'll buy it, your dog doesn't care if it's bright orange and red)
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/dog-food-reviews/purina-dog-chow/">
        This
       </a>
       is the most popular food in my town and I don't know a single dog owner who doesn't blindly vouch for purina, kibbles n bits, ol roy, etc (the popular brands). And they all defend it to the death because 'it's only 20$ per bag!' while they follow the talking points that raw feeding will KILL your dog, no.... it's healthier and i'm not feeding my dog:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Chicken by-product meal, a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste. It’s made from what’s left of a slaughtered chicken after all the prime cuts have been removed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meat and bone meal, a dry “rendered product from mammal tissues, including bone, exclusive of any added blood, hair, hoof, horn, hide trimmings, manure, stomach and rumen contents”
What’s worse, this particular item is anonymous. So, the meat itself can come from any combination of cattle, pigs, sheep or goats — which can make identifying specific food allergens impossible.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to organs (the nourishing part), this stuff can contain almost anything — feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs — anything except feathers.
       </p>
       <p>
        animal digest is a chemically hydrolyzed mixture of animal by-products that is typically sprayed onto the surface of a dry kibble to improve its taste.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No wonder your dog is is bright red and itching all the time, along with a plethora of health issues. But yet they just keep buying this crap food and spending thousands of dollars at the vet because they refuse to READ THE PACKAGE and spend the extra 30$ for better food or just straight up raw feed.

       Yes, agreed about all of this.

       I will say that I think there is some good dry food available, it's just more expensive and you have to read the ingredients and be choosy. But you're not going to find it in the grocery store and it's not going to be cheap.

       "Made with all natural ingredients"

      <p>
       Just because something is made from natural ingredients does not automatically mean its safer or healthier. In certain cases, too much of an all natural ingredient can cause sickness.

       Forced arbitration.  You're agreeing to it more and more (read the fine print of those
       <em>
        terms of service
       </em>
       ) but in a nutshell, we're losing our collective bargaining ability and being forced to go toe to toe with corporations when we're wronged.  And then, in the off chance we
       <strong>
        do
       </strong>
       win, we're likely bankrupted or it's only a symbolic victory
       <em>
        <strong>
         plus
        </strong>
       </em>
       we're often forced to sign NDAs so each person challenging the company has to do it on their own, in a vacuum.

       Think about how many cows and udders it would take to produce milk for every store in every city/town in America. There are 93 million cows in this country but probably less than half of that are actually milked, producing 6-7 gallons a day.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is probably 200+ stores carrying milk or using milk in my city alone. There might be a reason you get arrested for selling raw or real milk. Probably because its good for you.

       YES. I hate the word “natural.” Like yeah, arsenic is natural, doesnt mean I need it. Just because its natural doesnt constitute something as safe. Use your brain and really think about what you are buying, and read the ingredients! The more shit you cant pronounce the worse off it usually is.
