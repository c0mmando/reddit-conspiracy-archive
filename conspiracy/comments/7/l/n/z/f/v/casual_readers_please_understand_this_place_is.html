       If I where to post or comment that the Moon Landings were faked on r/space or that capitalism is great on r/communism I can understand there's a barrage of downvoting. But the same thing occurs when I post about conspiracies I've concluded are the most likely and that many what I call "controlled conspiracies" are about covering. For example:

       Sadly most mods have given up on this. When I first joined Reddit a decade ago, there was more emphasis on all inclusive conversation. So only the worst of the trolls or those being an arse got downvoted.

       A) That rule is only for comments. For whole posts, you're supposed to upvote content you want to see more of downvotes content you want to see less of.
      </p>
      <p>
       B) So? The way people are
       <em>
        supppsed
       </em>
       to use upvoting and downvoting is not very relevant compared to how they actually
       <em>
        do
       </em>
       use them, in the context of explaining why they occur in the patterns they do.

       Naw man, that's a cheap cop out. When you come forward with bad arguments people won't agree with you sometimes. Simple. If you really live your life thinking that everyone who disagrees with you is a bot/shill/whatever you'll never learn to be critical of what your saying. Rather than dismissing someone who disagrees with you, be able to point out why they're wrong.

       I've only ever seen the "no one died on 9/11" theory posted a handful of times in my years of browsing. Those theories are pushed as a means of invalidating the rest of the message here. OP is correct in saying this place is heavily controlled.

       For example: Make a post criticizing a documented violation of human rights committed by Israel and see what I mean. Your post will be locked at 0.

       You're attributing to malice what is more easily attributed to stupidity and confirmation bias. I'm quite sure there are people here who genuinely believe that no one died on 9/11. Just as there are people who believe no one died in Vegas, or at Sandy Hook.

       No my only point is shills are here by the thousands to stifle conversation on various subjects.  I don't have to believe a particular theory to want to discuss it.  Those who downvote stories in a conspiracy sub don't want those theories discussed.  If they didn't care, they would simply bypass it....but they don't.  They make it a point to shit all over it.  Why take the effort?  Never once have I believed in the flat earth theory, having seen the curve of the earth with my own eyes, but that doesn't mean I am going to jump into a thread about it and shit all over everything.
      </p>

       These shills spend hours downvoting and arguing against things they pretend not to care about, and its laughable.  That's why they will always be easy to spot.

       So you understand that even if the 9/11 towers fell by controlled demolition, there were still tonnes of people who died with the buildings falling? The plane crash itself would have only had a hand-full of casualties compared to the fall, so even if one were to take your bait, your argument doesn't hold up to start with.

       do you have another provocation to throw out instead?

       I know no planes hit any buildings; whether people died in the buildings is unclear to me but there is definitely a strong case to be made for the deaths being fake, which you are not familiar with and therefore cannot refute.

       I think almost anything is a possibility, to be honest. I think it's possible that the planes were remote controlled like drones, and I think that it's possible it was just a controlled demolition and people just reacted to the initial blast like a plane crash. I don't know which one is likely, but you have to be precise with your language. To try to make somebody claim that
       <strong>
        nobody
       </strong>
       died in the 9/11 plane crash is to compartmentalize a small aspect of a very large event. People are going to assume you mean 9/11 as a whole, and not just the small detail of whether or not there were planes with people on board or even planes at all. It's besides the point - the buildings fell and that was the lion's share of the damage done by far. Why argue about an insignificant aspect in regards to the big picture?

       There is a school of thought that part of the illusion was to gradually empty the towers while still making everyone believe they were a bustling hub of activity and full of busy workers. So that when they fell, it was purely a demolition job.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this is true, I'm just saying there is some substance to the idea that the 9/11 victims were fake, since some of them definitely seem to be contrived "vicsims." And the lack of wrongful death lawsuits brought against everyone involved by the families.
      </p>
      <p>
       How 9/11 was done is important to the big picture if you want to know who did it and why.

       Why create all of those risky insiders? Were all the workers in the building in on this then? I don't see how this school of thought holds up to pragmatism and logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are making this large of a play, why do you care about government wrongful death lawsuits paid with taxpayer money? If you are dropping the WTC towers in NYC, why are you shying away from a few casualties? People were going to die when the towers fell regardless, so why create a smoking gun possibility?
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, is it possible that certain floors/businesses were on the inside and were told to evacuate or not show up that day as to protect their employees and managers? Absolutely - no argument there. I just don't think it could have been done as a rule, I don't see how you mitigate that risk in a reasonable manner.

       No I saw the second plane, but one of my friends  who was walking to Stuyvesant high saw the first hit, as did the person in Battery Park. The towers are right there and can be seen easily. I have spent a lot of time in airports, in planes, and have always had an avid interest in aviation. I know what a passenger plane looks and sounds like.

       This is ignoring the bullshit claim that it’s easy to fake videos from multiple angles with the exact same details that somehow magically match up with what I and thousands of other New Yorkers saw with our own eyes. I used to work in CG and video editing, you can’t get that many details that right and completely skip the uncanny valley with early 00s tech. Even now it would be difficult to get that perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you really want to get into it we can talk about how absurdly impossible it would be to organize that many people without anyone saying anything, but you strike me as someone who so wants these things to be true that you will ignore any and all evidence (even someone who lives in NYC and fucking saw it happen) that goes against your preferred belief.

       The videos don't match up though, that's one way we know they are fake. I already linked September Clues, the first 30 minutes of which are sufficient to prove this. Maybe someone else will watch it.

       Have you ever fucking been to NYC? You could see the towers from miles away. In Battery Park (where Stuyvesant High is) you have to make an effort not to look at them.

       When a massive plane flies low over the city you look at it. When it crashes into a massive building it's not so weird for people to go outside and look for themselves. These are high school kids for fucks sake, they ran outside to look before any teachers could say shit.

       I already explained to you how flawed your "hollow tube and solid object" claim was. And that was so obviously something you regurgitated from a video or article, and again demonstrates your inability to think for yourself and challenge what you are told. It's also a pretty easy concept in physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm going to bed now, but I am perfectly willing to get into the detailed physics with you tomorrow so you can learn just how gullible you've been.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yeah I've watched the videos making these claims, but I took it a step further and actually did follow up research because the physics and engineering knowledge shown was so bad.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ready when you are tomorrow.

       Videos do match up. I watch them every year on 9/11. Some idiot can edit and zoom in on something and claim it wasn’t in the other video, and you’ll believe him when in reality it’s what happens when you see things from different angles. Shit gets blocked by other shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Physically impossible how? Do you really want to get into the physics with me? Really? Because bring it on. I know my shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       All you are is someone on the internet making claims because someone else on the internet made claims. You want these things to be true because it makes you feel good to be smarter than everyone else, so literally anything that will counter that claim, no matter how rational, is thrown out by your mind to protect that feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
       Someone who actually cares about learning the truth, actually cares about conspiracies, would not be so open to literally every claim made about government false flag attacks. Yet clearly you believe all of them and refuse to accept any could be terrorism. That shows zero sense of critical thinking or nuance.
      </p>
      <p>
       You're the bad kind of conspiracy enthusiast. The kind that believes anything that fits into their socio-political-economic world view and is incapable of changing their minds when presented with compelling counter evidence or logic.

       You seem really adamant and touchy about this issue. If you know you saw a plane hit the tower with your own eyes, who cares what I say? Who cares that it's physically impossible for a relatively light and hollow object to fully embed itself in a relatively massive and solid object regardless of speed? Who cares that there are no visible airline logos on any of the planes in any videos, nor strobe lights, not to mention the CGI glitches involving the wings and vertical stabilizer? Just go your merry way and tell people you were there and you saw it. Then, if they want, they can use their own common sense, watch a no-planes presentation, and see which one is more believable to them.

       Like I said, all of these claims have been debunked by multiple sources. Your understanding of physics and engineering is pretty poor if you don't understand how a plane flew into a building. You are straight up demonstrating you don't know how the twin towers were constructed.
      </p>
      <p>
       The towers were not solid and massive objects all the way through. They were mostly a frame around a solid core. That way you can build tall without making it untenably heavy.
      </p>
      <p>
       If anything hitting a glass and steel wall perpendicularly will do far more damage than hitting an aluminum and plastic tube along it's axis. Take a cardboard tube for example. You can easily bend the sides by pushing them, but smash it hole side first and the sides are suddenly much stronger.
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that you can't even figure out that layman physics when trying to shoot this down demonstrates how naively you approach this and how easily you buy into bullshit videos about it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Regardless of speed? Do you even fucking math?

       In some rare occasions it's so obvious that a commenter is blowing hot air, and is so wrong on every point, so arrogant and vapid in their presentation, that it saves me the effort of having to respond, because to do so would be merely to reiterate what you've just demonstrated, which is that you haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about. This is one of those occasions, for which I am thankful.

       I didn't attack or ignore. I clearly adumbrated why it's physically impossible for a 100 ton hollow airliner, the kind that is seriously disfigured by colliding with a small bird in flight, to melt seamlessly into a 500,000 ton steel and concrete mass without even slowing down.

       You're right, the problem is that I just cannot match your towering intellect and not that I think anyone who denies the reality of a tragedy, such as those being discussed, is a delusional sick little fuck. I don't know if you do this stuff to protect yourself from the harsh reality of the real world or if you do it because you're a bit slow and this stuff makes you feel like you're not most of the way down the wrong side of the bell curve but either way you should just fucking stop, you have a sickness, seek help. I won't debate with you because I don't make a habit of encouraging those with mental illnesses.

       Sure, this is the quickest way I know to explain it, even though it's not all-inclusive.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is quickly seen that there was no plane crash at the Pentagon or in Shanksville, so this must beg the question: why wouldn't all 4 crash sites be faked instead of half of them?
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a massive steel support column like the ones that made up the twin towers standing by itself in an open field. We can all imagine a passenger jet crashing into it and what would obviously happen: the column would remain relatively intact and the plane would be sheared in half in a horrific fireball.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yet on 9/11 we are supposed to believe that a hollow aluminum passenger jet was able to penetrate all the way into several of these solid massive steel columns, which are configured together and reinforced with steel trusses and concrete. Not only this, but they don't even slow down at all as they melt all the way into the buildings like Wile E. Coyote through a canyon wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flying a jet into a skyscraper like the twin towers would only result in one thing: the jet being destroyed external to the building with its contents violently splattered down the building. What we saw on television is physically impossible therefore did not happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I said, this is the short version but it's sufficient to explain why what we saw on television was just tv special effects. Anyone who watches even the first 30 minutes of
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gORu-68SHpE">
        September Clues
       </a>
       can easily see that there was video fakery going on that day, coordinated between multiple news outlets.

       That is reasonable enough an explanation. To be honest I've always avoided conversation about the planes hitting the towers because the attacks hit very close to home, but I've always been outspoken regarding the video released from the Pentagon. It very much looked to be a cruise missile, and to only leave a 6' hole in the exterior wall??

       Yeah and where there should have been a few dozen different camera angles we were only shown a few frames without even a plane in them.
      </p>
      <p>
       The trajectory would of course have been impossible because the story goes that the plane took out some street lights or other poles on the way towards the Pentagon, but of course if it hit even one of them then the fuel would have spilled out of the wings leaving a fiery mess all over the lawn, yet there's nothing like this. The main question at the Pentagon and Shanksville is
       <em>
        where's the plane???
       </em>
      </p>
      <p>
       Once you get past the "there were thousands of eyewitnesses" myth, it's simply not physically possible for a jet to penetrate into a solid mass of steel and concrete without first being destroyed. Newton's 3rd Law states that running a plane into a building would have the same result as smashing a building into a stationary plane. But we're supposed to believe that the plane just melts into the building like a knife going into butter....
      </p>
      <p>
       All it takes is looking carefully at the
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7RMhRIjXV8&amp;amp;t=53s">
        Hezarkhani footage
       </a>
       (for example) to see how glitchy it is, how it's nothing more than a video composite with a plane sprite.
      </p>
      <p>
       There's so many other ways to tell it was faked too, like the witnesses who saw "no plane" or who insisted it was a bomb, the fact that the videos aren't consistent with one another (shown by September Clues), and the lack of vortices in the smoke that would have been left by the wingtips and remained spiraling for maybe even as long as several minutes after the plane passed through the smoke.  Ace Baker might have been the first to describe this. He has also offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who has an original quality plane strike video.
      </p>
      <p>
       And most everyone knows that the government has failed to even prove that the alleged terrorists were on the planes, 2 of which (planes) were not even in the air on 9/11 and the other 2 of which were not decommissioned until years later!

Both are fringe claims (even in conspiracy groups) with evidence against them. Due to "no one dying on 9/11" beeing a fringe claim even in conspiracy communities, he shouldn't be surprised about being downvoted.

       When 2 of the highest skyscrapers in major metropolitan city collapse after an upper part of the building was cut of by a jetliner impact there is no possibility of no casualties. In addition to that people jumping from the building were seen and filmed on their way down.

       We are discussing theories, often times when proof positive is unavailable.  Often times the proof will become available later on, and that's when something goes from conspiracy theory to conspiracy fact, but absent that no one can prove which theories are truly damaging to the establishment.

       This means more fringe believes will be pushed aside and dismissed as they don't align with peoples worldviews, no matter if the believes are valid or not.

       It's more oblong than sphere shaped. Edit: I should speak more precisely. I mean it bulges at the equator and isn't perfectly spherical.

       Well you should tell NASA that so they start generating oblong shaped Earth images. Oh wait, its just so small of a bulge that you cant see it right? Just like the alleged curvature of Earth? Get a better username, satan.

       Aight so I wanted to see if NASA images do or don't show the Earths bulge so I did a very crude experiment.

       I grabbed

        this photo of Earth

       Lol why would it matter at all if it has a bulge? For literally all purposes its still a sphere. The bulge is negligible and doesnt change anything. Like seriously, why do you care if people properly call it an oblate spheroid? Thats harder to say.  We shorten shit in every aspect of our life to make it easier to say.

       So lack of evidence is evidence to you? Yes we should ask WHY there's a whole in our data, but not say WHAT it means before having said missing data found (or something that explicitly explains the data gap, such as a request to purge records or asking them not to be submitted).

       The frist premise that the videos were edited is reliant on the entire world media being in on the conspiracy too. I saw the impact live on german television who had their own feed live from New York.

       Is the german media controlled by the CIA and FBI too?

       The rest of "fake pictures" is debatable at best. For example Nestor Citron is not a mirrored picture. The angle of his head is different in both pictures. Also he scrolls past 10 pictures that look very different and stops at one pair that's similar to prove a point.

       So you are rejecting all mainstream held beliefs like space exploration, nuclear armaments and terrorism existing. And this because a group of people somehow, somewhere benefit from doing it.

       Yes that is my conclusion and I'm far from alone to have reached it. It seems some people with the power of global media have been able to lure the human race into the deepest rabbit hole ever. Medieval times are nothing compared to present day.

       I mean just stop for a minute and think. NYC is one of the most populated places in the world. Thousands of people worked in the buildings of the WTC. And thousands more work around the area and walk by that place every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are telling me that someone they got all those thousands of people to be in on a conspiracy? Because to avoid any death you are talking controlled demolition and removing the people from the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again you can probably go there and still talk to people who where there on the day of the attacks and saw it happen. There are HUNDREDS of first responders (medical personal, police, firemen, good samaritans that were passing by) that went there that day and saw people die. You are talking a conspiracy so big that they somehow paid off the whole city.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can discuss if the attack was an inside job, or if they let it happen, you can discuss the politics that comes with such an attack, but I find it downright crazy and disrespectful to flat out say "nobody died". It defies all logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you can make an argument that there where explosives in the tower I find it impossible to believe they somehow evacuated all the thousands of people working at and around the towers and then went on and put a circus using a lot of human resources as first responders. You can't keep a secret when thousands need to shut up for it to work.

       The things you are referring to is hearsay. It's like saying Jesus walked on water because you heard of thousands of people that saw him do it and most people beleived that a couple of hundred years ago. The difference here is that we have hard evidence, the imagery, and the only sane conclusion from investigating that imagery is that it's fabricated.

       Nono. The official news archives is what I'm talking about. But I'm wasting my time here. You are the type that considered the case closed if your preacher told you Jesus walked on water back in the day. Must be convenient. Merry Christmas.

       You make quite a few analogies but the thing about analogies is that they completely lack context. You should really be addressing this portion of his argument:

       I didn't meant to dismiss his claim by linking it to flat earth. I meant to compare the dismissal of his claim to the dismissal of flat earth.

       Both are fringe claims (even in conspiracy groups) with evidence against them.

       Due to "no one dying on 9/11" beeing a fringe claim even in conspiracy communities, he shouldn't be surprised about being downvoted.

       In fact one could say the same people who created flat earthers created the most ridiculous claims about 9/11 for the simple purpose of dismissing all questions about 9/11.

       People downvote things they disagree with.  I enjoy researching conspiracies, but I still think it is almost certain that people died in both events.  Every bit of evidence I have seen points to these deaths occurring.
      </p>
      <p>
       The places where I look for conspiracies are where the evidence doesn't match the assertion.  I don't believe everything is a conspiracy within conspiracies.

       The funny thing about evidence is that while I can (and would be glad to) produce videos of people at the scene saying the gunshots are fake and another video of someone looking out over the area and saying "there doesn't seem to be anybody actually injured," and also prove a "witness" is actually an actress from Dr Phil, all of which suggest this was a fake drill scenario, no one can do me the simple courtesy of showing a bullet hole from the scene, let alone the plethora of bullet holes there should be, or anyone on the scene receiving actual medical treatment, or video of bullets hitting anything, all of which would suggest a real shooting.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the evidence is massively in favor of a hoax.

       I've seen 40 people
       <em>
        on this sub
       </em>
       make the claim that they know someone who was injured or killed at Las Vegas. To me, this might as well be a mathematical proof that it was fake. There's just no way that many people would ostensibly be "into" conspiracy theories and yet still have that personal connection shared only by an infinitesimally small percentage of the country.

       I wish people would be as skeptical of the people who make these claims as you are that I might have made 34 alt accounts for some reason. Unless you really think all of those people are telling the truth, it should cast serious doubt on the Vegas event.

       Well, mathematically it's probably not that unprobable.  I admititly didn't read any of those links but I'm going to count that some of these people know or are related to someone who knew someone that was killed giving them another degree of separation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I see it like this, how many people would be able to claim to know me if something like this happened to me?  Everyone in my small hometown (times 2, moved when I was young), everyone in 18 years of school, a hundred or so I met in college, 1000's that have worked in the same places at the same time I did.  Add all of those up and I'm in the 10s of thousands.  now consider that is just me in a small town and working at a largish company in a employee facing position, expand that by saying we know each other (and you are claiming to know someone shot), now I can claim it happened because you said it did.  Now if you take any 1 of the victims and they are going to have the same 10,000+ plus people that can claim they knew someone shot.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, when victim's families hear that there are people going around claiming something never happened, those families have a way of finding their way into these conversations, artifically inflating the number of people claiming to know someone shot here, possibly enough to sway to make you think they aren't real people.

       I invite you when you have time to look at a few of the conversations and see for yourself if you think those people are telling the truth. Often they are people claiming to either have direct connection or two degrees of separation from a victim. It's not just someone who knows someone who knows someone who knows someone. And furthermore none of them can prove their claims in any way.
      </p>
      <p>
       I will go ahead and assert: no way they are all telling the truth. By your logic the odds would be fair that I myself would know someone who has some connection to the event, but I do not, nor does anyone I know. The odds that 40 users within 3 months on a conspiracy forum would claim to have such connections are impossibly vanishingly small.
      </p>
      <p>
       And if one is lying, they are probably all lying. Otherwise why would anyone need to lie about this at all?

       I don't have to go even 1 degree and I have probably 30-40,000 myself, 2 degrees would probably give me a million.  That puts me at about .5% of the US population, plus these people come out of the woodwork when you try to tell them their friend/family isn't dead, skewing your preception of the event.  I know I'd make an account and tell you about how you are wrong if someone I knew died there.

       Having actors involved at all makes it way riskier. Actors leaking the reality of what occurred is a riskier way of having your plans fall apart than anything concrete coming up about the shooting being expertly and covertly engineered. It would be easier to have innocent people die and innocent people respond than get any actors at all involved dude. You're missing these points.
       <strong>
        If
       </strong>
       there's a goal, you can bet it's a lot more like "for the greater good" than "don't kill people".
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't seem to be aware of how easily State Funded Terrorism is considered. The declassified CIA docs are a great resource for this, there are for example detailed plans, including the hijacking, covert destruction and staged missile attacking of a commercial airliner full of innocents, as a trigger to instigate American intervention in Cuba. The plan was never utilised so was allowed to be released, but it was an actual option they came up with and discussed.
      </p>
      <p>
       So what do
       <strong>
        I
       </strong>
       think about all this in the end? I don't fucking know, I'd just be making assumptions, and fuck that

       Ok so it is risky that someone might "leak" that a staged event occurred but there's no risk in committing mass murder and protecting oneself from investigation. How the fuck that makes sense is a mystery, but then again you know nothing about Las Vegas because I hate to break it to you, dude, but actors were definitely involved.

      <p>
       The difference is scale. If it was all made up with all actors in the venue, then you'd have a conspiracy involving at the very least 550 people.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it's just the FBI who radicalized the perpetrator(which they've been caught doing loads of time) then you're down to something like 10 people. It's way easier to contain, especially if you manage to "suicide" the person you radicalized.
      </p>
      <p>
       Of course both carries a risk, what if the perp realizes he is being played, and will be killed in a staged suicide and instead turns on his "co-conspirators", that's a risk, but it's a lot smaller risk than having 550ish people knowing it was a staged event.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't buy the whole "crisis actor" thing, mainly because it'd be much easier and safer to just radicalize someone they know is unstable or easily manipulated, and then have them do all the dirty work and just mop up the trail as they go.

       Yeah man I'm aware of these things, but I don't think they're involved in creating false flag terrorist events. Possibly at the worst it's studied to know how to create as much impact as possible.

       How is this supposed to be faked exactly? There was a concert with tens of thousands of attendees. They weren't all crisis actors. There are dozens of videos of the shooting happening. Is the sound of the gunshots faked in all of them? The shooter himself is certainly dead, we saw a picture of him with his brains blown out, or was that a hyperrealistic prop? The dead and bloody bodies on the ground, props? How about the hundreds or injured that flooded all the area hospitals? Were all those people crisis actors? Were the nurses, ambulance drivers and surgeons in on it?

       Again, answer any of my questions. There are videos showing the crowd running and the sound of gunshots. Were those gunshots fake? Who exactly was flooding ERs after the shooting, and were they actually injured? If not, how was the hospital staff made to cooperate with the 'hoax'?

       There are many videos of people running and the
       <strong>
        sound
       </strong>
       of gunshots. There are also videos of people saying "fake gunshots" and "it doesn't look like there's anyone actually injured." There are also videos where the sounds of gunshots are going off and yet people are not even flinching.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is one video of an ER, of civilians bringing other civilians into the waiting room,
       <em>
        no blood anywhere,
       </em>
       and no actual medical staff doing any sort of actual medical activity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If there are no real victims, there is obviously no real need to get much hospital staff involved. Hospitals certainly take part in mass casualty drills, however. They can always appeal to HIPAA and thus remain quiet about the number of victims they had.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the gunshot sounds were played over loudspeakers and/or added in post-production to the videos.

       Ok, so again to clarify, you are saying the hospital staff were also in on it. So, when say,
       <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/las-vegas-shooting/las-vegas-shooting-wave-after-wave-wounded-test-hospitals-n807131">
        Dr Scherr
       </a>
       talks about the hundreds of patients he treated with gunshot wounds, he is an actor? or paid off? Same with nurse Mullen from a different hospital, also quoted in the article? And the victims interviewed in the accompanying article. Because we already have dozens of people now who would have to be lying in reference to hundreds of peoples injuries. Really, which do you think is likely, even in a false flag scenario: A mass hoax involving tens of thousands of people, or a single trained shooter?

       Even if I thought there was a real shooter I wouldn't believe it was Stephen Paddock acting alone.  So people are lying regardless. What difference does it make what they are lying about? Yes there are fake doctors and people acting like hospital staff, you act like this is unprecedented. Do you think Adam Lanza shot 20 children at Sandy Hook or something?

       Sure: most salient right now - the conspiracy between Trump and Russia. UFOs are another Im particularly interested in. 9/11 being known ahead of time by the Bush administration (though I do not believe in controlled demolition, for the same reasons I don't believe sandy hook or vegas were hoaxes). There are some.

       Yeah brohann, simply out of the fact that way way more people are now involved. I like how you put words in my mouth there about "no" risk. That's a pretty common tactic with people like you who just tunnel vision and effectively block out reality. I said there was
       <em>
        greater risk of plans failing
       </em>
       if you use actors. Not "no risk". But I'll check the vid
      </p>
      <p>
       Edit: uh ok, this vid is of someone who was at the Las Vegas event, who also happens to be an actor? Big story
      </p>
      <p>
       Look, do you really think that if it was all staged, that actors such as this lady would be entrusted with keeping quiet during the following chaos and potential legal action? But it's ok now I understand you're another person who just tunnel visions. Essentially a brick wall who spins all inflowing information to fit your little narrative. There's no point in us conversing other than it being visible to other readers. So.. good luck with your endeavors 👍

       I encounter the same exact lack of logic when it comes to super crazy conspiracies. I like to read about them, look into them, but if there is a huge lack of logic involved I get skeptical. If you were smart, you would not hire a bunch of everyday actors for an event like this. It would get out. If you did this repeatedly, the truth would get out in such obnoxiously concrete ways. It would absolutely make more sense to actually plan a shooting, no question.

       No question. Okay then. Maybe the question of why there's no evidence of anyone or anything having been shot, but who cares about little questions like that.

       That’s a claim. I’m just pointing out statistical logic. Is it really that absurd to think that people are violently killing each other? It happens constantly all over the world. Just seems like there’s no logic to it at all. If the anonymous omnipresent powers that be wanted to increase security or deprive freedoms, they would just do it. Why do you think public opinion would stop them in this regard? WTF do you think they have the power to organize such a thing but cannot organize a new backdoor policy without mainstream approval? There’s already plenty of mass murders, crime, drug trafficking. They already have all the excuses they would need. So until someone can give me motive that makes sense, rather than lack of motive altogether, it’s going to remain illogical to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you think the internet is the end-all source of knowledge, you’re wrong. Maybe the evidence exists it’s just not uploaded, I don’t know. Maybe you just don’t trust any of it. But when arguments are specifically illogical, I think it’s worth mentioning. Trusting digital evidence is a different story, but saying there is no evidence, also a different story. Pointing out the entire argument being illogical is still valid.

       Interesting vid. Thanks for sharing, how would I go about validating the interview itself? Couldn't that be someone trying to push the conspiracy theory agenda, themselves? Or could it be she just happened to be at the shooting and they got her to do an interview because she had already been on tv?

       She's obviously an attempt to push the notion of multiple shooters to cause misplaced discussion and tail-chasing among conspiracy circles.
      </p>
      <p>
       Is it more likely that she was chosen because she was an actor who happened to be at a real shooting, or that she is an actress who is acting at a fake shooting?
      </p>
      <p>
       Then to her performance, add Mike Cronk. Does he seem authentic to anyone on earth?

       I just read a reply in one of the threads you linked saying that posters like yourself have a purpose, whether by design or not to discredit the conspiracy community by making highly outlandish claims.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can see their point, though ultimately I'm sympathetic to you. I'm sympathetic to all you authentic people out there just trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. Personally I'm not going to engage much further in all this, I'll just sit back and wait till general AI emerges, see what will happen to the world in the times after.

       This is me saying there's no video of anything being shot (objective fact that no one can disprove) with -33 downvotes, and a random person saying "my friend got shot in the arm" with +35 upvotes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could not be more obvious that there is a frantic effort to gaslight about Las Vegas with the main thrust of the argument being that no matter what, any conspiracy theories are on the table but people
       <em>
        must
       </em>
       believe people are actually getting shot at these FEMA drill scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
       By the way I'm up to 38 users who have claimed they know someone who was shot.

       So lack of evidence is evidence to you? Yes we should ask WHY there's a whole in our data, but not say WHAT it means before having said missing data found (or something that explicitly explains the data gap, such as a request to purge records or asking them not to be submitted).

       The frist premise that the videos were edited is reliant on the entire world media being in on the conspiracy too. I saw the impact live on german television who had their own feed live from New York.

       Is the german media controlled by the CIA and FBI too?

       The rest of "fake pictures" is debatable at best. For example Nestor Citron is not a mirrored picture. The angle of his head is different in both pictures. Also he scrolls past 10 pictures that look very different and stops at one pair that's similar to prove a point.

       I mean just stop for a minute and think. NYC is one of the most populated places in the world. Thousands of people worked in the buildings of the WTC. And thousands more work around the area and walk by that place every day.
      </p>
      <p>
       You are telling me that someone they got all those thousands of people to be in on a conspiracy? Because to avoid any death you are talking controlled demolition and removing the people from the scene.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again you can probably go there and still talk to people who where there on the day of the attacks and saw it happen. There are HUNDREDS of first responders (medical personal, police, firemen, good samaritans that were passing by) that went there that day and saw people die. You are talking a conspiracy so big that they somehow paid off the whole city.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can discuss if the attack was an inside job, or if they let it happen, you can discuss the politics that comes with such an attack, but I find it downright crazy and disrespectful to flat out say "nobody died". It defies all logic.
      </p>
      <p>
       Even if you can make an argument that there where explosives in the tower I find it impossible to believe they somehow evacuated all the thousands of people working at and around the towers and then went on and put a circus using a lot of human resources as first responders. You can't keep a secret when thousands need to shut up for it to work.

       Because it gets attached to anything credible which then gets immediately discredited. It's cointelpro 101. So many people these days are falling for it hook line and sinker.
