<p>They want to live to see their New World Order come to fruition. Life is a big lavish party for these assholes, and they have access to clean water/food/air, while we are crammed like sardines into polluted cities, forced to eat GMO food and drink fluoridated, dirty water.</p>

<p>Yes, you can try to eat organic and filter your water, but what else are we ingesting/dealing with on a daily basis that compromises our health? Things we may not even be aware of.</p>

<p><strong>We need to get healthy</strong>, and address our current situation. The quality basic human rights (clean water, food, air) have been soiled. </p>

<p>At the end of the day, this should piss you the fuck off. Who are these self appointed cunts that think they are so deserving and special of this luxury? They are human beings just like the rest of us, yet they see themselves as divine beings or something, deserving of the best quality life resources.</p>

<p>FUCK. THEM. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Plastics disrupt your endocrine system, which is super important to regulating your hormones. Fucked up hormones = fucked up firtility. Check out BPA in plastic. It was originally synthesized to be a female birth control but wasn&#39;t strong enough. Someone figured out it made plastic stronger so now we live in a time where men are being exposed on a daily basis to a chemical that mimicked estrogen (mainly female sex hormone) </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well sort of. Europe really doesn&#39;t use gmo crops like North America does. They have a shrinking population because of radical feminism and cultural Marxism. Men are becoming more feminine and women are becoming more masculine by design. The basic family unit has been under attack for awhile and Europeans have been guilt tripped into thinking they were the only group of people in the entire world that practiced slavery and waged wars. It&#39;s controlling ones emotions and teaching them not to use logic and think for themselves </p>

    <div class="md"><p>And being over excited to the point of nervousness, social anxiety, neurosis/psychosis by toxic culture, toxic diet/hydration, toxic discordant music and irritating/DNA interfering electro magnetic freqs., toxic academia and toxic celebrity worship, toxic financial models causes increases in prolactin along with cortisol which seriously, underratedly impair fertility and sexual performance/the ability to perform or feel inclined to. </p>

<p>Prolactin is dumped in huuuge amounts after you follow through all the way to climax and is introduced to dampen your further drive and induce sleep but the Taoists and many other Tantric or sex focused sects and guru weirdo cults knew of the power of delaying or never following through and learning how to control the effect and completely inhibit prolactin release full stop. </p>

<p>Prolactin is closely linked with dopamine in the sexual drive cycle as you can tell by how big and issue sex is for people and how successfully it can be used to literally take control of peoples minds. </p>

<p>So when Rasputin and his ascended fractal ripple protégé future incarnation Charles Manson found drugs, rituals, mind control, hypnosis, stardom, notoriety, prestige and groovyness could all be worked in together with occult, sex, blood, magic n drugs well it looks like all of Holy Wood we&#39;re already turned on. </p>

<p>The Tzar and Tzarina Romanov were par for the course, as their peerage throughout Europe were too, deeply turned on to the black arts, divination, shamanism, miracles, healing, wandering sexually depraved Siberian nomads so Rasputin fit right in. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Did your grandma stress at at 60 hour a week job at a sedentary desk job and get shitfaced every evening after a dinner consisting of a highly processed and unbalanced diet, then got up the next day to do the same thing again after 4 hours of sleep? Probably not.</p>

<p>My grandparents also lived in an adobe hut and lived into their 90s.  They only ate &quot;organic&quot; since they grew their own food and drank unfluoridated water because they drank from the well.  They got a lot of exercise from working the farm and hiking up and down the hills.  They were unstressed and well rested.  I&#39;d like to think their longevity was genetics but I think the main thing that killed poor people in the past was infectious disease, which we&#39;ve solved through basic medicine.  The main thing killing people today is the modern cosmopolitan lifestyle.</p>

<p>&quot;How many workers in positions of influence presently were abused as children or products of this foster system went on to become influential personnel and remain willing participants in sustaining of the immoral practices they were taught?&quot;</p>

<p>Missing words. You need a signifier somewhere to connect the subject (&quot;workers&quot;) to the predicate. &quot;Presently were&quot; is awkward phrasing. &quot;In sustaining of&quot; is incorrect grammar.</p>

<p>&quot;Collaborating with &#39;counselors&#39; and &#39;psychologist&#39; who specify behavioral safety and advocate for medicating behavior rather than sourcing the cause.&quot;</p>

<p>Sentence fragment, not a complete thought. Also, what does it mean to &quot;specify behavioral safety&quot;?</p>

<p>I could go on. I have trouble understanding more than half of the sentences in your initial comment. I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;re so offended. There&#39;s really no nice way to tell someone that the way they write is a chore and a half to follow (and seems like a bot trying to formulate an intelligent and relevant response).</p>

<p>And he said &quot;No, none of us are. It&#39;s better this way.&quot; And I asked him why, and he said that, if a rich mafia guy, needs a transplat or something, they pay people in hospitals for those lists, and then they make it look like an accident for someone who has a compatible organ.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve long suspected that they have access to treatments that the rest of us don&#39;t. Things like stealth medical clinics in Panama and Switzerland where they can get cutting edge treatments for their problems.</p>

<p>Things like stem cell treatments to rejuvenate failing organs, transfusions of young blood from healthy donors, next gen immune-based cancer treatments (like the one that cured Jimmy Carter&#39;s &quot;untreatable&quot; melanoma at age 92).</p>

<p>The irony here is that they all still die anyways, just a few years later. Why ironic? Because when you&#39;re 90, an extra five years feels more like an extra five months.</p>

The elite have a simple system to stay a bit healthier than the rest of us but they don&#39;t have much more available to them than us. They do blood transfusions with pre-pubescents. They have farms of kids underground that they milk for blood. They feed the kids well but I don&#39;t know where they go or what happens when they get too old.</p>

<p>They obviously have better access to top notch doctors but besides that, there isn&#39;t any miracle drug or diet that gets then to these ages - it&#39;s simply young blood.</p>

<p>Have you seen all the above now?  No matter how rich, eventually you turn into a dementia ridden bumbling idiot pissing/shitting yourself.  The rich have a <em>temporary</em> advantage on this world and they know it, that&#39;s why they <strong>cling</strong> to life til the end.  With great wealth comes great responsibility or greed, these lot suffer from greed and will be questioned on their unachievements.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In the body, teeth and bones are made primarily from calcium - it&#39;s used elsewhere too, but you&#39;d have to research it&#39;s full spectrum. In order for the body to utilize calcium a sufficient amount of vitamin D is required. </p>

<p>Vitamin D is synthesized through absorption of sunlight. People with high melanin content living in the northern hemispere are not able to produce sufficient vitamin D for optimal health and calcium use. In addition, those with poor diets or people who don&#39;t go out very much have the same issue. You can check the correlation of this by examining statistics of bone fracture by ethnicity.</p>

<p>Fluoride is very similar to calcium but doesn&#39;t require vitamin D for the body to use it. It is added to help strengthen the teeth and bones. The problem is, however, that calcium in teeth and bones creates a uniform lattice, when fluoride takes its place that lattice is non-uniform and the result is a weaker structure, which can be seen in cases of fluorosis.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, while this can help those with vitamin D deficiency and poor diet, it also has consequences in the rest of the body where calcium should be present, but is displaced or replaced by fluoride. I&#39;m not fully aware of these consequences, but no doubt there are a number.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But fluoride and calcium are radically different on a chemical level. How is calcium and fluoride similar? Literally they are on opposite sides of a periodic table because their chemical properties are different.   Calcium in the bone forms a lattice structure with phosphate because they have opposite charges. Phosphate and fluoride cant form a lattice structure together because theyre both anions. If you tried to argue that fluoride displaces phosphates thatd make more sense but chemically a calcium fluoride lattice would be stronger than calcium phosphate</p>

<p>I&#39;m not quite sure what I think, but I do think that having it in water supply seems like a bad design because it could totally skew dosage depending on how much water you drink/use in cooking. Seems like keeping it only in toothpaste would be more controlled, and giving people the ability to opt out. Also prevents doubledosing with water+toothpaste. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Right skeletal fluorosis is a thing but if you read the same research used to write that article, even in harsher conditions like in india fluorosis occurs when fluorine is in the water at 1 to 3 parts per million (ppm) but fluoride level is the US are less than 1ppm. I skeptical that with proper diet even 1ppm of fluoride would cause fluorosis as the article explains the condition in india make people more susceptible to fluorosis</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your claim was &quot;The problem is, however, that calcium in teeth and bones creates a uniform lattice, when fluoride takes its place that lattice is non-uniform and the result is a weaker structure, which can be seen in cases in cases of fluorosis&quot; and you cited the wikipedia article on fluorosis to explain how fluoride weakens bones. However the research used to write that wikipedia article that even with poor diet and harsh conditions, fluorosis occurs at around 2ppm while the US stays less than 1</p>

<p>Bromine is the worst of the offenders since it is the hardest to get out of the body.</p>

<p>Kelp tablets can also be used, but not as safely in the dosages needed to correct iodine function.</p>
