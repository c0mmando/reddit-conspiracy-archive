Sadly I think I was wrong, at least to certain extent. The following is the comment a reader posted in a WTC7 post that fire didn&#39;t bring the building down:  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>sigh
it was not the dept or the university, it was a professor who works there<br/>
the report was not sanctioned by the school and has never been published- because its not considered scholarly<br/>
he self funded the research from a website and on the website he said going in the goal of the project was to show fire didint bring down building 7- he said the results before he started<br/>
<strong>so basically people gave a crazy man 300k to say something they already agreed with and slap a logo on it</strong><br/>
nice job  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The comment received an astounding <strong>181 upvotes</strong> in five hours.<br/>
It is really worrying, sad and disappointing that such a comment would receive such a quantity of upvotes in a conspiracy reddit.<br/>
I have to point out that although that comment received so many upvotes, the conspiracy post had more than 2,000 points at the time of this writing, so maybe all is not lost. </p>

<p>In that post I never claimed it was space x&#39;s fault or that people weren&#39;t aware of the launch.  My post was about how it was convenient that the Government releases UFO info, and a couple days later people were freaking out about a UFO sighting above AZ.  Then a couple days after that, it&#39;s revealed it was just a space x flight.  It was just speculation and noting the timeline, but that user who&#39;s only a month old attacked me making up assertions I never made and insulting me.  I don&#39;t appreciate that kind of behavior on this sub and will call those out user out.  </p>

<p>Lmao, I actually just saw why you called out those specific users here. I&#39;m glad I reported this shit. Keep calling out the age of people&#39;s accounts, that totally supports your arguments. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ow shit I did. HAHA, I meant that more in the sense of the media, but yeah, it&#39;s a valid point and I&#39;m a dumb ass.  I was thinking it had to do more with this part initially:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I bet they had to pull air space permits for their trajectory, doesn&#39;t seem a little odd. They probably knew when &amp; where the flight pattern was.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways, I just figured out another aspect I confused, there were two different events over AZ and I thought they were one in the same.  There was this <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2017/12/19/unexplained-lights-valley-sky-monday-night-spark-chatter-ufos/965205001/">event on the 19th</a>, and then the <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix-breaking/2017/12/22/streak-across-phoenix-sky-wasnt-ufo/978470001/">space x flight on the 23rd</a>.   At the time of that post, I thought it had been several days without it being reported as a space-x rocket, and then all of a sudden they had an answer which made me suspicious.  O well, I&#39;m dumb from time to time.  Cheers  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are clearly unidentified flying objects. But there is also the problem that the government still has not admitted that it faked going to the moon like ten times. Even Stephen Greer acts like the Apollo missions were legit which destroys all of his credibility from the start. </p>

<p>It was. Seismologists said the collapse was also consistent with pyroclastic flows, which occurs during volcanoes and nuclear testing.</p>

<p>Seismologists said that flight 93 time of crash was inconsistent with official time. they had a std error of a few seconds, but were forced to lie and say their estimate being out by a few MINUTES was acceptable. anyone whose done STEM knows this is bullshit, it&#39;s gotta be within 3 std dev with 99.7% prob.</p>

<p>No it isn&#39;t. That&#39;s why the 14 week fires were the longest burning structural fires in history. They&#39;re consistent with the energy left by a nuke, that&#39;s why they kept burning despite being flooded with water.</p>

<p>At some point all debunkers have to move on from discussions with truthers. It&#39;s whack-a-mole, one things is addressed, and another pops up. These points about the hot-spots are not even real scientific points, barely raising to the level of bunk. </p>

<p>Why were there hot spots? Because there were fires.
Why were there fires? Because there was lots of stuff that burned and the building was on fire when it fell. 
Why was it so hot? Because fire is hot.
Why did it last so long? Because there was a lot of stuff to burn, and it was in enclosed volumes with a limited air supply.</p>

<p>Still haven&#39;t explained the thousands of people who were turned into dust, as a seismologist said, if the pyroclastic flows weren&#39;t hot. You&#39;re just inventing facts. For example, you say that the fires were normal. Sorry bro, NIST said the jet fuel burned within minutes. 14 week fires (burning thousands of degrees) that continued despite being flooded with water means only one thing: China syndrome.</p>

<p>There is no video or audible proof of CD. </p>

<p>9/11 WTC North Tower collapse by Etienne Sauret. Visible shaking 12 seconds before collapse 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM88xJX5FsA&amp;amp;app=desktop">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CM88xJX5FsA&amp;amp;app=desktop</a></p>

<p>Both towers fell in relative silence in the context there is no audible signature from pressure waves with enough force to cut steel. </p>

<p>There is no indication of a pressure wave. </p>

<p>If there was a massive explosion in the basement capable of cutting steel, there would have been a noticeable boom, windows and walls at the base of the towers buckling out. Every floor in the tower would have noticeably dropped down. Not the localized and isolated outer vertical columns bowing inward and buckling relative to the impact and fire damage. </p>

<p>The dust cloud was not pyroclastic, we have went over that.  People survived being in the dust cloud.  Your claim does not pass a reasonable persons logical powers.  If the flow was pyroclastic as you claim, it would have killed anyone it touched and ignited all the papers and such that instead fell to the ground unscathed.</p>

<p>I&#39;m aware the jet fuel burned off in a short period of time, do you think that normal office fires combustibles are some kinda &#39;cold&#39; fire? Ever seen a wallmart after it&#39;s burned? Steel beams all twisted and warped? Roof caved in?</p>

<p>In no instance did NIST report that steel in the WTC towers melted due to the fires. The melting point of steel is about 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,800 degrees Fahrenheit). Normal building fires and hydrocarbon (e.g., jet fuel) fires generate temperatures up to about 1,100 degrees Celsius (2,000 degrees Fahrenheit). NIST reported maximum upper layer air temperatures of about 1,000 degrees Celsius (1,800 degrees Fahrenheit) in the WTC towers (for example, see NCSTAR 1, Figure 6-36)</p>

At one point the video skips and shows something on the tape he was recording over, then it all goes black. But keep going, he lives. It was just a very large cloud of dust. Nothing pyroclastic about it.</p>

<p>Amazing video he&#39;s a doctor, nearly dies, then goes and runs triage.</p>

<p>A quick look any video of a building collapse will show you. Falling buildings create lots of dust, the displacement of air pushes that dust away. Air is a fluid, so the cloud of dust is the forced out air (carrying dust in suspension) violently mixing with the exterior ambient air. It&#39;s really simple fluid mechanics. Nothing similar to a pyroclastic flow at all, unless you wanna call a cloud of dust a pyroclastic flow. </p>

<p>That dust cloud from the towers wasn&#39;t hot IN IT&#39;S ENTIRETY, proven by the fact that people easily survived being engulfed in it, BUT SINCE THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE VAPORISED AND CARS BURNT THERE WERE PARTS THAT WERE VERY HOT INDEED. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Nope, not buying into your false logic.  The dust cloud was not a pyroclastic flow.  The dust cloud ignited no fires on the ground. The dust cloud burned no people when it engulfed them.  If you search pictures you will see trees with their leaves  unburned, will you use the same false logic as you did with the unburned paper littering the ground, and say the tree must have fallen to the ground after your mythical pyroclastic flow arrived?</p>

<p>I hope you know even A and E for 911 truth backed off their claims that it was a pyroclastic cloud and now say it resembled one?  What does that even mean?  Either it is or it isn&#39;t.  Any demo&#39;d building will produce a dust cloud that from a distance looks similiar.  Difference being lack of heat, kinda fundamental to a pyroclastic flow.  Without that, it&#39;s just a dust cloud.</p>

<p>ETA.  There was no one vaporized by the dust cloud when it hit the bystanders on the ground.  Not one.  That is intellectually dishonest.  </p>

<p>How do you know? The source I linked said the dust cloud contained vaporised people. They were finding their bone fragments allover the site for years to come. Thousands of victims were not identified because they had been turned to dust.</p>

<p>Right but if you look at the surroudings of a volcano you&#39;d see trees unburned as well as burned, people alive as well as dead. you get it?</p>

<p>And some people are paid to spew lies on the internet.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Former PR worker here, 99% of our job is to convince people that something that is fucking them over is actually good for them.</p>

<p>The final talking point, if someone called you out on all your counterpoints, was to simply try to paint them as a wackjob. Suggest they are crazy for thinking agencies who are suppose to protect them have been bought and paid for. Bring up lizard people to muddy the waters. A lot of people will quickly distance themselves from something if it is accused of being a conspiracy theory, and a lot of them are stupid enough that you can convince them that believing businesses conspiring to break the law to gain profit is literally the same as believing in aliens and bigfoot.</p>

<p>Do you have proof to supersede: </p>

<p>The towers were brought down by impact/fire/thermal stress leading to inward bowing and buckling of columns. </p>

<p>The damage at the pentagon was caused by a large commercial jet impact. </p>

<p>The scattering of human remains, jet wreckage, the burying of jet wreckage, and the scorching of trees at the shanksville crash site was caused by the impact of a large commercial jet.    </p>

<p>There is a reason millions are spent on the research, development, and care of structural steel fire proofing? Fire proofing knocked off by the jet impacts? </p>

<p>That Silverstein actually lost money from 9/11, and that he did not make money? </p>

<p>ThAt hours before the collapse of WTC7, its documented that WTC 7 was showing signs it would fail? </p>

<p>Can you actually refute and rebuttal this piece that explains “looks like CD” is a false narrative? </p>

<p>Don’t get mad at me because the truth movement only offers out of context arguments, hiding of facts, lies, and pseudoscience.</p>

<p>Woukd you like to actually discuss physical evidence, or civilian accounts at the pentagon by the scores attesting to a large commercial jet. </p>

<p>For the purpose of this sub, it is someone whose attempts to subvert the discussion of a specific conspiracy theory (lying, denying, deflecting, distracting etc) because they are paid to do so, or because they have some other hidden agenda.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to prove that somebody is doing this, which is why we don&#39;t allow shill accusations - they are meaningless without proof.</p>

Skepticism is the other half of being open-minded. To get the truth you have to be willing to consider new ideas or even ideas you have previously rejected in the light of new evidence but then you also have to test these new ideas skeptically. Only then should you begin to form an opinion, and even then you have to always be aware that on topics like 9/11 a very small number of people really have access to information to ever really know what happened.   </p>

<p>Worrying amount of fanatical anti-conspiracy readers of r/conspiracy</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I would call it &quot;annoying&quot; rather than &quot;worrying&quot; - this sub has always attracted large numbers of useful idiots who think they are providing us a service by coming here to tell us certain conspiracies have been &quot;debunked&quot; (Snopes says so!) or don&#39;t exist, and they know this because the government and the mainstream media always tell the truth...</p>

<p>When a post like the WTC7 one becomes popular and reaches many redditors&#39; front pages, it will attract a lot of anti-conspiracy rhetoric. Downvote them for not contributing anything of value, but otherwise ignore them.</p>

<p>Obviously, we do have to deal with a peculiar type of individual who lurks here constantly and then pounces on specific threads which they want to disrupt. Pizzagate is good example of this - the amount of effort some shills put in to denying/disrupting pizzagate posts goes way beyond what a normal redditor would do. If someone makes twenty comments in one thread arguing that Pizzagate (or whatever) is &quot;fake&quot;, they have an agenda.</p>

<p>Finally a piece of advice for <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> users. If a subject interests you, contribute. If you&#39;ve previously looked into it and it bores you, or you think it&#39;s plain crazy, just ignore it and move on! Less stress all round, less chance of a heated argument that will end up with one or more users getting sanctioned by the mods for rule breaking.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As far as <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> goes, no conspiracies are out of bounds, and my belief is this sub will cease to have any real value if the mods ever meddle with that policy. The userbase decides with their votes which posts make it to the front page. But that means we get many posts that most of our userbase will not ascribe to, and therefore go nowhere, but that is how it has to be.</p>

<p>Every user of this sub has a unique conspiracy belief pattern, and nobody believes every conspiracy, if only because some conspiracy theories about specific events/issues are mutually exclusive. </p>

<p>I think the best policy is NOT to post or comment about conspiracy theories that you don&#39;t believe in, unless you have genuinely pertinent factual information that will take the debate forward. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve given their <a href="https://www.nist.gov/el/faqs-nist-wtc-7-investigation">site</a> a good read. They are very clear that they think the fires caused the collapse.</p>

<p>&quot;Probable collapse sequence&quot;, in context, means the sequence they calculated in which the building most likely would have collapsed internally. Those words do not in any way counter the fire hypothesis or the reliability of the report. The reason collapse sequences differ is probably down to complexity, but again, that doesn&#39;t detract to the consensus of the cause of collapse, the fire.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As you could probably guess I don&#39;t have much respect for the conclusions of NIST regarding WTC7. </p>

<p>Just FYI here are the main issues I have:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The only support for their theory are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;amp;v=TNEKtvB80us">these computer simulations</a> which do not resemble what happened in real life</p></li>
<li><p>They failed to make public the entire duration of the collapse simulations, cutting them off (I presume) before they departed too obviously from what&#39;s visible in the actual collapse videos.</p></li>
<li><p>Lead NIST investigator, Shyam Sunder, at the press conference following the release of  the WTC7 draft report, dismissed the notion of free fall during the collapse by stating, &quot;Free-fall time would be an object that has no structural components below it...&quot;, but the final draft released weeks later detailed 2.25 seconds of free fall acceleration during the collapse and stated that it was &quot;consistent with their models.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>NIST ran an expensive computer simulation audio analysis that indicated that if the collapse were triggered by explosives a loud boom would have been heard by witnesses or recorded on tape just prior to the collapse. They used this as their excuse to ignore National Fire Protection Association standards which required the testing for explosives or incendiaries in <em>any</em> structure fire where a &quot;high order of damage is observed.&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>NIST also ignored recorded audio evidence of explosions coming from WTC7 like <a href="https://youtu.be/jKtU01qcZBM?t=1m39s">this</a>, and testimony from witnesses like Barry Jennings and Micheal Hess who experienced explosions firsthand while trying to evacuate WTC7.</p></li>
<li><p>NIST&#39;s stated reason for not testing for incendiaries like thermite was that they couldn&#39;t imagine that the required amount (they estimated 100lbs) to fail the column 79 connection and trigger the collapse could have been transported and placed without detection <em>even though the building stood empty for hours prior to its collapse.</em></p></li>
<li><p>NIST investigator John Gross participated in the FEMA investigation which <a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1512-20490-8452/403_apc.pdf">documented melting and high temperature corrosion attacks of steel beams and columns at WTC7</a>, then later dismissed the notion that steel melted anywhere at the WTC by saying that you can&#39;t achieve temperature high enough in a fire. </p></li>
<li><p>NIST investigator John Gross also expressed the belief that no one witnessed any molten steel at the WTC complex even though he had to have been aware of testimony like <a href="https://youtu.be/7KzAp962t2Q?t=46s">this</a></p></li>
<li><p>NIST&#39;s computer simulation of the column 79 connection lacked critical structural elements that would have prevented the failure had they included them. Most notably the partial height web stiffeners clearly present in the Frankel drawings were absent in their simulation. <a href="https://youtu.be/XvFjxhtxGGw">Here&#39;s an excellent video on the topic</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>NIST calculated that thermal expansion displaced girder A2001 5.5 inches to the west which, absent web stiffeners, was just enough to push it off its 11 inch seat on column 79 and trigger the collapse. When it was later conclusively established that the bearing seat was actually 12 inches wide and that 5.5 inches of displacement was therefore insufficient to cause a walk off, NIST, without explanation, simply came out with a new, higher figure for the displacement (6.25 inches) which was again just enough to have caused a walk off.</p></li>
<li><p>NIST has refused to make their computer models of the collapse publicly available paradoxically stating that doing so would &quot;jeopardize public safety.&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

In this case, I wonder why the commenter said that the study was unpublished because it was considered unscholarly, when the study completion date is slated for April 2018 (<a href="http://ine.uaf.edu/wtc7">http://ine.uaf.edu/wtc7</a>), so it is a work in progress and probably that would be a good reason not to publish it yet -not that it is unscholarly.<br/>
I would have a hard time studying the &quot;disproofs&quot; of tens of thousands of equally capable people. I haven&#39;t read in depth about the subject, but I saw the video of the building coming down, which  looks suspicious, and my first uneducated thought is that a building probably would collapse in stages and not suddenly in a 10 second free fall like if it is a controlled demolition. </p>

<p>And that is the crux of the issue. You think it shouldn&#39;t, while in reality it should. And not a founded argument in the world will sway your &quot;uneducated opinion&quot;, because you think &quot;it looks suspicious&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe, just MAYBE some people who are interested in conspiracies are also interested in facts.</p>

<p>I, for one, am not here to agree with everything posted.  I am not alone.  I find conspiracy theories to be intriguing and entertaining.  Some of them really flesh out and have legs.  Others are just silly.  The post you are referencing is just someone saying &quot;hey, one guy who may have been paid by &quot;truthers&quot; is obligated to the full truth of the matter&quot;.  It&#39;s hardly worth a post.</p>

<p>I see in the comments, as usual, people talking about shills.  But honestly, the kind of people who bite onto conspiracy theories as absolutely truth are shills way moreso than people who want the facts.  If facts debunk a conspiracy theory, that&#39;s what the community should rally around.  If facts PROVE a conspiracy theory, that&#39;s what the community should be about.</p>

<p>But a lot of shit posted here is baseless accusations, and I, as well as others, get called &quot;shills&quot; and are downvoted to shit for pointing that out.  It&#39;s like a large part of community is less interested in the actual truth, and more interested in buying stock into shit that isn&#39;t, in any way, real.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Look, I don&#39;t buy every conspiracy theory and mark it outright as truth. I&#39;m a skeptic. But as you say I also require proof and that comment that was very much rambling without verifiable information. If I had written a comment expressing doubts about the impartiality of the researcher and the study, as well as casting accusations and pointing out purported actions taken by the involved parties, I would try at least to include a couple of links to back up my claims, and not just say that the report was never published because it was not considered scholarly. That&#39;s the first apparent falsehood right there, because the project website says that the project ends in April 2018, so it is work in progress (<a href="http://ine.uaf.edu/wtc7">http://ine.uaf.edu/wtc7</a>), consequently it seems a very good reason why it hasn&#39;t been published.

<p>At the end, I wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;worrying&quot;, but &quot;irritant&quot; (don&#39;t know if this word really fits here), it&#39;s just that people accept what the government says as &quot;facts&quot; and just because of that think the theory is bullshit or something.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have not looked too much on the report, but is there any truth to these statements? It did seem like they went in to prove their assumptions rather than to figure out what happened.</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible to believe that conspiracies happen all of the time, without believing in all conspiracies. It&#39;s also possible, and probably a good thing, to look into claims to find out truth behind them. People here will say that others are just spoon fed by the Mainstream media, without any critical thinking. This is a bad thing of course, but it&#39;s also bad to be spoon fed by alternative media without any critical thinking.</p>

<p>In addition, there are active disinformation campaigns on the internet, particularly related to conspiracies that touch on truth. You will find that there are a number of people talking about those conspiracies, but with an altered detail here or there. Not all of those altered details can be true.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t read it either, but the study has a completion date of April 2018, so it is still a work in progress. What I&#39;m critical about in this case is that the commenter said that the study wasn&#39;t published because it was unscholarly, which seems to be false. After all if the study havent been finished, why would it be published?</p>

<p>This didn&#39;t happen. You&#39;re just cranky that they called you out for not knowing about something. Did they do it in a very kind way? Nah. But they didn&#39;t &quot;make any points up&quot; in that thread like you&#39;re claiming. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It very well could be.  I was just commenting on the overall attitude that a lot of people in this sub have.  If you don&#39;t agree with a conspiracy theory, you&#39;re a &quot;shill&quot;.  That said, the comment in the OP has specific content that seems easily verifiable.  I agree that someone making a claim should back it up, but sometimes a finger pointing in the right direction can be just as helpful.</p>

<p>and my first uneducated thought is that a building probably would collapse in stages and not suddenly in a 10 second free fall like if it is a controlled demolition </p>
</blockquote>

<p>And that is the crux of the issue. You think it shouldn&#39;t, while in reality it should. And not a founded argument in the world will sway your &quot;uneducated opinion&quot;, because you think &quot;it looks suspicious&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the problem with this sub in a nutshell; Most don&#39;t wonder if something is a conspiracy, they <strong>want</strong> it to be a conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you just stop using &quot;pyroclastic&quot;, and instead describe what it actually was?</p>

<p>Why not? That&#39;s the crux of the matter here. Why keep trying to shoehorn it into an inaccurate and obscure word? What&#39;s the reason?</p>

<p>The only conceivable reason is to mislead. To make it seem like something it is not.</p>
