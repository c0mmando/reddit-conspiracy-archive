<p>“What is honor compared to a woman&#39;s love? What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms . . . or the memory of a brother&#39;s smile? Wind and words. Wind and words.

<p>Spend five minutes watching kids instantly play, share, cooperate, and curiously engaging each other and its stupid easy to realize that is our default human nature.</p>

<p>The world of adults we have today is the result of thousands of years of violent indoctrination by cowardice beings that despise our free will and so have “helped” each one of us to destroy it.</p>

<p>Wether right or wrong, I always kind of sickly listen with interest to the story told in War Pigs by Black Sabbath.</p>

<p>All the War Pig cowardice (MIC + intelligence agencies) think they are worshipping Satan while he allows them to destroy the world, and then when it backfires and they start to burn.. they crawl to him begging for salvation that he laughs at.</p>

<p>Who really knows how it works, but if they destroy our world, well then I do truly hope they see their own erroneous ways to the tune of laughter.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Maybe I’m missing something here but what does a book have to do with anything. </p>

<p>Written language is much older than 1890s. </p>

<p>That’s not even my point though. Humans have been indoctrinated to some extent by those “in charge” throughout our entire history. </p>

<p>The ability to herd the weak and apathetic has always been there. Ruthless leaders are as old as we are. </p>

<p>Granted, it’s a new brand of indoctrination these days but in no way do I think it’s a new phenomenon. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe that it is not that people are apathetic- they do care about what&#39;s going on. However, most people are too caught up in their own shit to have the energy or time to do something. We have bills to pay, deadlines to deliver on, and families to take care of- oh and a few hours of time to ourselves would be nice for a while too. When our basic needs are met we crave the path of least resistance. An inconvenience becomes the entirety of our consciousness and we crave rest. The week is long.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>We all contribute to the problem. Guess what? We are all contributing to it now by even using Reddit. We keep ourselves busy musing about what things are or could be, conspiracies and whatnot. Instead of getting to the real scenes and just seeing with your eyes. We see with our brain. That&#39;s our problem as humans. It hinders us just as much as it helps us because we rationalize everything. Everything has to make sense. And when it doesn&#39;t, we start to fill in the holes with theories. Who are we kidding? We know nothing. You can know nothing for sure unless you see it and witness and experience it. Question everything. It is true that people have built lives in this system though, and that it is either impossible or hard to get out of it. And I get that. But there is more we can do. They only dish what we will swallow. Stop eating the dirt info you are given and they&#39;ll stop feeding it to you. It&#39;s only gotten this bad because we&#39;ve made it easy.</p>
