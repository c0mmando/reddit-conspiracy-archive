    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s even crazier than this. I have had 34 people (actually now the number is up to 40 since I made this post) tell me they know someone who was injured or killed in Vegas, just on this subreddit:</p>

<p>However, no one can provide the basic visual evidence necessary to establish that real shots were fired:</p>

<p>Kind of funny when you think that it&#39;s been this long after a record-breaking &quot;mass shooting&quot; but it&#39;s unclear that anything was even shot.</p>

<p>It could have been something much more complex than anyone could imagine. Something went wrong and they needed a cover story? They’re hiding deep state details involved in the reasoning behind the shooting? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah somethings fishy all right. There&#39;s a theory floating around the interwebs that it was a botched assassination attempt on a Saudi prince.

    <div class="md"><p>People really died. Let&#39;s get that out of the way
I think it has something to do with the Saudi prince and his hotel inside the Mandalay. Only a few floors up. Cops came from down and never went up. Could have been a hit attempt that went bad. Or the prince sponsored it. And just like 911 we hide it because the American public wouldn&#39;t stand for our alliance with them if that came out. Pretty odd a couple months later he gets picked up and a few others do too and some dudes die in helicopter crashes. </p>

<p>It could also be as simple as Mandalay Bay buying influence to keep stuff out of the press so juries aren&#39;t prejudiced </p>

<p>Casinos run Vegas and that includes the Vegas FBI shop </p>

    <div class="md"><p>There’s a whole world of possibilities and nobody really knows the truth. </p>

<p>He could’ve been a guy who got in some really bad shit with some really bad people, he’s an older guy with no family, lots of money, gambles, and drinks a lot (sounds like a depressed man to me who may not be mentally stable) and decides to take out as many people as he can before taking himself out.</p>

<p>It could’ve been an arms deal gone horribly wrong. They needed to pin it on someone so Stephen paddock is their patsy. </p>

<p>Another possibility, which I think gets overlooked, is that the reason it looks so fishy is because is because LVPD/ FBI etc completely mishandled the situation resulting in dozens of people dead. They could be trying to cover their own asses which is why it looks so bizarre.</p>

<p>We can speculate all we want, but the whole thing is just bizarre, it doesn’t add up, and there’s other factors or entities at play here. The fact that the media just kinda said “oh well” and moved on is strange. We know nothing about the guy or why he did any of it, and it seems like people want it to stay that way.</p>

<p>&quot;His fortune is not big enough — perhaps $5 million, according to some estimates — to make a significant dent in the likely payouts from lawsuits and claims against Mr. Paddock’s estate. But it is enough to prompt an unusual legal strategy by lawyers for some of Mr. Paddock’s victims, who want to make sure the money is not depleted by legal expenses.</p>

<p>The lawyers have asked a Nevada court to set up the estate so that the money can be distributed, without lawsuits, to families of the dead and those who were wounded in the attack. One idea being discussed is folding Mr. Paddock’s assets into a fund already set up for victims, which has raised about $22 million.&quot;</p>

<p>This is very disturbing to me how quickly this has been disappeared by the MSM.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of the reasons this might have &quot;disappeared&quot; from the media is to not give the killer any more headlines for his act. It is not uncommon for copycats who seek the same sort of attention to carry out similar acts as those being talked about in the media.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How little I actually understand about what happened and why.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Do you think it&#39;s possible nobody really understands why this happened because the one person that can tell them why killed himself? You&#39;ve been told <em>how</em> it happened - a crazy guy with powerful weapons shot at a large crowd of people. Why you think you have not been told what happened is beyond me.</p>

<p>Is it because you refuse to believe it?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To anyone capable of critical thinking you know for a fact we are being lied to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m capable of critical thinking, and I do not know that at all. In fact my critical thinking leads me to the conclusion that you are simply in denial and refuse to believe the truth because the truth makes you uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The truth is, you could be killed at any time by a madman with a gun, because madmen can easily get guns.</p>

<p>Merry Christmas.</p>
