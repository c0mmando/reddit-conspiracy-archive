       This is very disturbing to me how quickly this has been disappeared by the MSM. How little I actually understand about what happened and why. Can someone please give me some peace of mind and say this isnt all I'm ever going to hear about what happened? I'm almost afraid to live in the states knowing something this shady has happened again. This is like 9/11 to me. killing all these people and a bunch a bullshit spewed on us from the media. To anyone capable of critical thinking you know for a fact we are being lied to. I just seem to not have the time of day to play detective and connect the dots. Somebody please shed some light on this. I need to know what really happened.

       It's even crazier than this. I have had 34 people (actually now the number is up to 40 since I made this post) tell me they know someone who was injured or killed in Vegas, just on this subreddit:

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       However, no one can provide the basic visual evidence necessary to establish that real shots were fired:

       Kind of funny when you think that it's been this long after a record-breaking "mass shooting" but it's unclear that anything was even shot.

       It could have been a false flag. For what though?
      </p>
      <p>
       It could have been something much more complex than anyone could imagine. Something went wrong and they needed a cover story? They’re hiding deep state details involved in the reasoning behind the shooting?
      </p>

       Anything. Something is up, but I don’t necessarily think that it didn’t happen or that it was just for fun to push some sort of laws.

       Yeah somethings fishy all right. There's a theory floating around the interwebs that it was a botched assassination attempt on a Saudi prince. Wasn't too long after the shooting that shit got real in Saudi Arabia. Haven't really delved to far into it to be honest though. Somethings not right though. This was too big to have just disappeared.

       People really died. Let's get that out of the way
I think it has something to do with the Saudi prince and his hotel inside the Mandalay. Only a few floors up. Cops came from down and never went up. Could have been a hit attempt that went bad. Or the prince sponsored it. And just like 911 we hide it because the American public wouldn't stand for our alliance with them if that came out. Pretty odd a couple months later he gets picked up and a few others do too and some dudes die in helicopter crashes.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could also be as simple as Mandalay Bay buying influence to keep stuff out of the press so juries aren't prejudiced
      </p>
      <p>
       Casinos run Vegas and that includes the Vegas FBI shop

       There’s a whole world of possibilities and nobody really knows the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
       He could’ve been a guy who got in some really bad shit with some really bad people, he’s an older guy with no family, lots of money, gambles, and drinks a lot (sounds like a depressed man to me who may not be mentally stable) and decides to take out as many people as he can before taking himself out.
      </p>
      <p>
       It could’ve been an arms deal gone horribly wrong. They needed to pin it on someone so Stephen paddock is their patsy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another possibility, which I think gets overlooked, is that the reason it looks so fishy is because is because LVPD/ FBI etc completely mishandled the situation resulting in dozens of people dead. They could be trying to cover their own asses which is why it looks so bizarre.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can speculate all we want, but the whole thing is just bizarre, it doesn’t add up, and there’s other factors or entities at play here. The fact that the media just kinda said “oh well” and moved on is strange. We know nothing about the guy or why he did any of it, and it seems like people want it to stay that way.

       There’s one going around that says it was a botched assassanation on Trump.  The Saudi’s were in on it and we got word. The new crown prince was the whistle blower and to save face with America he gave up all the bad actors.

       i'll let you come to your own conclusions but not everything Bill says is 100%.   just know propaganda and psyops are to confuse and cause demorality.   if you can somehow step back for just a bit from all the drugs pushed on us and take a good look it is obvious nothing is right.  Even under the influence you can tell but you are toothless to help.    this isn't just to you but to the masses. "Get Sober and get Ready for a Fight" you will not have another chance i promise.

       "His fortune is not big enough — perhaps $5 million, according to some estimates — to make a significant dent in the likely payouts from lawsuits and claims against Mr. Paddock’s estate. But it is enough to prompt an unusual legal strategy by lawyers for some of Mr. Paddock’s victims, who want to make sure the money is not depleted by legal expenses.
      </p>
      <p>
       The lawyers have asked a Nevada court to set up the estate so that the money can be distributed, without lawsuits, to families of the dead and those who were wounded in the attack. One idea being discussed is folding Mr. Paddock’s assets into a fund already set up for victims, which has raised about $22 million."

       I get your point, but CNN and others are never at a loss to get talking heads to go on and on adding nothing but speculation while arguing among themselves. I'm a bit surprised people aren't wtf'ing about it more unless its so high up, as people are speculating here.

       I'm in Vegas on a trip at the moment. A tour guide the other day said he knew an officer who resigned over this shooting, giving up his pension.
      </p>

       I still think it was just a psycho with a gun, but what would make a guy with 20+ years quit and lose his pension?

       I've said this a copuple times, but People died bud, thats a fact I know 100%. I too am skeptical but you are sniffing around in the wrong direction and I would like people to point there focus somewhere else because people did die. I am from Canada and I have an old facebook friend who lost a sister in the shooting.

        This is very disturbing to me how quickly this has been disappeared by the MSM.

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       One of the reasons this might have "disappeared" from the media is to not give the killer any more headlines for his act. It is not uncommon for copycats who seek the same sort of attention to carry out similar acts as those being talked about in the media.
      </p>

      <p>
       Do you think it's possible nobody really understands why this happened because the one person that can tell them why killed himself? You've been told
       <em>
        how
       </em>
       it happened - a crazy guy with powerful weapons shot at a large crowd of people. Why you think you have not been told what happened is beyond me.

       Is it because you refuse to believe it?

      <p>
       I'm capable of critical thinking, and I do not know that at all. In fact my critical thinking leads me to the conclusion that you are simply in denial and refuse to believe the truth because the truth makes you uncomfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       The truth is, you could be killed at any time by a madman with a gun, because madmen can easily get guns.

       It’s clear that, at least at first and maybe still, the actual perpetrators were still at-large. The best explanation that I have heard is that the arrests in Saudi Arabia that included the Prince who owns the top four floors of the hotel were related at least in part to the shooting.
