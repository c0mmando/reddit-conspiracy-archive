<p>How convenient it is for you to make a link like that.</p>

<p>What he did was throw an outlandish idea to make those who would react... react.</p>

<p>How many have been killed before this, no action of his?
How many will be killed, no action of his?
Perhaps he is only attempting to bring light to a subject that needs more light shown upon it.</p>

<p>Puppet or not, it really doesn&#39;t matter. The Versailles treaty and the balfour declaration are clear. Israel wants the land and genocide is how they&#39;ll get it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I won&#39;t reply directly to OP, as of this moment his are the only 2 to mine.
What I will say in response to his:</p>

<p>How do we know his paymasters are Zionist? He isn&#39;t an intriguing president. But he still questions, and he still makes everyone question. Another pawn in the game, for the masses abound in bubbly ignorance, is not a burden, but a necessity.</p>

<p>I could give you the post history of my many, many, other accounts, call me a Trump boy, you wouldn&#39;t find any footing. I stick up for Truth. Fact. Credulity.</p>

<p>You tell me you believe something and you are not self, but righteous in your belief, I will stick up for you.</p>

<p>You&#39;re not English. You speak it.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t give a fuck about who runs YOUR country, because you know it isn&#39;t lady Windsor.</p>

<p>To your mind, we&#39;ve all been slaves for a long time. That isnt a difference of perception.</p>

<p>Now, get over your bias, muddle through your ego, and tell me I am right. You get paid to say what you do.</p>

<p>Where as I find pleasure in knowing its my duty as a human being to defy you.</p>

<p>I hold no debt. I hold no power. I praise no lord.</p>

Lady Windsor is actually German - don&#39;t give a fuck about them. If you&#39;re standing up for truth then explain to me how moving that embassy is draining the swamp, a new kind of president that can&#39;t be bought and all that other bullshit I&#39;ve been subjected to since he won the fucking presidency of a country that causes more global problems than any other - by miles! Same old shit, same old America - Trump lovers told anyone who would listen that he was the real deal - the new way - and you know what, America just seems to be getting worse...</p>

<p>And as for ego, bias and all that baggage - look at my post history, look at my comments - I despise EVERYTHING about US politics and foreign policy - your leaders are useless and Trump is just one more on the fucking pile.</p>

<p>My original post said one thing really - 12 Palestinians dead so far because Israel basically runs America. Sick of the rest of the world having to deal with it. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Okay... I&#39;ll stoop. Save me now.</p>

<p>The mighty Donald doesn&#39;t pay homage to your lady Windsor. Laugh.</p>

<p>She&#39;s been at it for 80 years and counting, so she knows the game better than anyone on the stage. Applaud.</p>

<p>Him saying he&#39;s moving the embassy isnt draining the swamp. It&#39;s making the snakes show themselves. Is that hard to understand?</p>

<p>Again, no Trump supporter, nor affiliate, but sometimes you gotta say some outlandish shit to know who you&#39;re dealing with.</p>

<p>So, you&#39;ve confirmed you&#39;re a Brit, hello cousin! Yes it does cause more global problems. But how are global solutions made? Done?</p>

<p>America hasn&#39;t gotten worse in the passed year than it did the 15 before it with the advent of fucktardery of Bush Jr, his daddy&#39;s ideals, his presidency was a long waited continuation, and the guise, that means a sheep in wolf clothing, that was Obamaramadingdong, only for people to actually get fed up enough to have someone speak what they wanted to say. Yes its brash. Yes its not PC.</p>

<p>I skip your 2nd paragraph. </p>

<p>Then why comment on our politics and not your own? Statistically you have it worse. So put in to practice cupcake.</p>

<p>Your original post was sensational to American politics in that Trump is directly responsible for the death of 12 Palestinians. Israel doesn&#39;t run our country. The Zionist Jews who run the global cabal do. They just happen to have Israel at the top of their list.</p>

<p>I am sick of the rest of the world having to deal with their petty insecurities too. But don&#39;t place blame elsewhere until you take care of your immediate circumstances.</p>

Trump came out with this move and it has caused alarm amongst other nations and unrest thousands of miles away.

    <div class="md"><p>According to MegaAnon it&#39;s a part of the swamp draining.</p>

<p>&quot;He said he wants to put our Israeli-based “Embassy in the city where Israel’s MODERN GOVERNMENT will operate from”, right?! That’s exactly the type of shit y’all should be listening and looking for. That’s purposefully telling you that the admin of yesterday’s of Israel’s SWAMP-fueled government will NOT be what relocates with a fresh start, to Jerusalem. Benji knows what he has to do. His swamp knows what’s coming, just like ours does. We should be happy we won’t recognize the world anymore the way we’ve grown to know it. Everyone’s swamps know what’s coming.&quot;</p>
