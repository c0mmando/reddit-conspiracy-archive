       He might have all this following - telling each other he's 'draining the swamp' but to me, he's an arsehole and this move was just to appease his zionist buddies - is he different or is he just another fucking puppet!

       Edit 1: come on trump-boys - take me on - I'm in the fucking mood to slap down your bullshit tonight!!

       Edit 2:pretty much as expected - half-assed answers and insults - pathetic really - this sub is fucked....

       Don't want to forget, meant what I wrote after reading the article printed in a newspaper in my native country. Not drunk either - quite lucid actually - but this is what you yanks do - divert attention from the actual topic with inane, karma grabbing bullshit.

       How about the two of you actually address my initial post rather than sitting in your basement flapping to CNN! Losers, absolute utter losers. You need to wake up or fuck off.

       Puppet or not, it really doesn't matter. The Versailles treaty and the balfour declaration are clear. Israel wants the land and genocide is how they'll get it.

       He did what his zionist paymasters told him to do - same as everyone else - I'm starting to think he's not an intriguing president at all - just another pawn in the game - another pussy to be whipped.

       I won't reply directly to OP, as of this moment his are the only 2 to mine.
What I will say in response to his:
      </p>
      <p>
       How do we know his paymasters are Zionist? He isn't an intriguing president. But he still questions, and he still makes everyone question. Another pawn in the game, for the masses abound in bubbly ignorance, is not a burden, but a necessity.

       I actually am English - born and bred. I can't understand any other reason for the mighty  Donald to even offer to move the embassy other than he was told to. Lady Windsor is actually German - don't give a fuck about them. If you're standing up for truth then explain to me how moving that embassy is draining the swamp, a new kind of president that can't be bought and all that other bullshit I've been subjected to since he won the fucking presidency of a country that causes more global problems than any other - by miles! Same old shit, same old America - Trump lovers told anyone who would listen that he was the real deal - the new way - and you know what, America just seems to be getting worse...
      </p>
      <p>
       And as for ego, bias and all that baggage - look at my post history, look at my comments - I despise EVERYTHING about US politics and foreign policy - your leaders are useless and Trump is just one more on the fucking pile.
      </p>
      <p>
       My original post said one thing really - 12 Palestinians dead so far because Israel basically runs America. Sick of the rest of the world having to deal with it.

       Him saying he's moving the embassy isnt draining the swamp. It's making the snakes show themselves. Is that hard to understand?

       Again, no Trump supporter, nor affiliate, but sometimes you gotta say some outlandish shit to know who you're dealing with.

      <p>
       So, you've confirmed you're a Brit, hello cousin! Yes it does cause more global problems. But how are global solutions made? Done?
      </p>
      <p>
       America hasn't gotten worse in the passed year than it did the 15 before it with the advent of fucktardery of Bush Jr, his daddy's ideals, his presidency was a long waited continuation, and the guise, that means a sheep in wolf clothing, that was Obamaramadingdong, only for people to actually get fed up enough to have someone speak what they wanted to say. Yes its brash. Yes its not PC.
      </p>
      <p>
       I skip your 2nd paragraph.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then why comment on our politics and not your own? Statistically you have it worse. So put in to practice cupcake.
      </p>
      <p>
       Your original post was sensational to American politics in that Trump is directly responsible for the death of 12 Palestinians. Israel doesn't run our country. The Zionist Jews who run the global cabal do. They just happen to have Israel at the top of their list.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sick of the rest of the world having to deal with their petty insecurities too. But don't place blame elsewhere until you take care of your immediate circumstances.

       You brought up lady Windsor - God knows why - your paragraphs are little more than swirly bullshit wrapped up in yet more bullshit. Trump came out with this move and it has caused alarm amongst other nations and unrest thousands of miles away. The way I see it, he isn't doing a great job at all, he's a sociopathic mysogynistic bellend whose presidency will benefit no-one.

That’s exactly the type of shit y’all should be listening and looking for. That’s purposefully telling you that the admin of yesterday’s of Israel’s SWAMP-fueled government will NOT be what relocates with a fresh start, to Jerusalem. Benji knows what he has to do. His swamp knows what’s coming, just like ours does. We should be happy we won’t recognize the world anymore the way we’ve grown to know it. Everyone’s swamps know what’s coming."
