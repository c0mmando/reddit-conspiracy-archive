They do not care that everything has become a fucking Truman show. They do not care about your facts and research on your claims. They&#39;ll nod, they&#39;ll oooh and ahh and then go right back to social media. I give up. Fuck this. I&#39;ll walk right back onto the set and live in this society they had created for us, for their benefit. I no longer care about freeing anyone or spreading awareness. I just don&#39;t fucking care anymore. Bring on whatever they have prepped for us. I&#39;m going back asleep. This is my white flag. I&#39;ll go by the script. I give up. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The trick is to learn balance and be selective of who you talk with about what. </p>

<p>There are many interests I have from poetry, music, and novels to privacy, netsec and conspiracy, that I can&#39;t convey to certain people. Rather than give up in disgust, I FIND people of similar interests and talk to them about whatever is at hand. That&#39;s the beauty of the internet. </p>

<p>Stop trying to save people. It can&#39;t be done, but you can save yourself a lot of headaches fussing over it. </p>

<p>&quot;You can&#39;t spend your whole life holding the door open for people and then being angry when they don&#39;t thank you. No body asked you to hold the fucking door.&quot; Orange Is the New Black</p>

    <div class="md"><p>And can I add this. Look, I&#39;m not 100% defending these people that you&#39;re talking about. Yeah, I get how it&#39;s frustrating they don&#39;t see repeat patterns. But these are also people that have a lot on their plate personally. You have a hard time running around the human hamster wheel and being able to do much besides coming home and falling onto the couch or bed.</p>

<p>And nobody suggest telling the hamster wheel to go fuck itself. This is something I&#39;ve said on another thread. An individual might be able to stick their finger up at the system. Shit changes if you have a family that you support. You&#39;ll keep your head down and keep running around the wheel. You&#39;re not gonna put  your family&#39;s ass on the line.</p>

Reading your words though, and what I want to say off the cuff is, no. No...you don&#39;t want to be blind. The truth fucking hurts but being awake to this painful reality allows for preparation, even if only mentally. Once the shit all falls down...you will adjust better than the 95% of sheep population.
