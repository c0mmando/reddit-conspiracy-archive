       With all the talk of UFOs in the news I've been thinking about aliens more than usual. Funny how that works. I was wondering where the idea of shiny metal flying discs came from. If you were an advanced alien species looking to travel the cosmos, wouldn't you want a ship that blends in with its surroundings? Maybe a ship that looks like a meteor or asteroid?  That way you could potentially travel through space undetected, especially if you travelled with other space debris for extra cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       Or why not have your ship look like another planet's moon?  Have a look at
       <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_(moon">
        Pan
       </a>
       .  It's one of Saturns moons. If you operate under the premise that alien spacecraft would want to have some camouflage you can kind of see how this could be a ship.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know these moons and meteors etc follow specific orbits. There's no reason a craft couldn't assume a planetary orbit in order to establish cover for itself. An interesting line of observation, one beyond my abilities, would be to track any asteroids or meteors that have orbital anomalies.

       We don't, which is why it is not

        impossible

       we are the only intelligence, but with the total number of star systems, the likelihood that we are a one off is exceedingly small.

       I would say it’s very probable. What I find implausible is that they have traveled here, abducted people and/or chose to tell Greer that they’re here to save us from ourselves.

       i agree with this, the issue is, considering what we know about the difficulty of space travel and the distances/timelines involved, the idea that we've been visited by intelligent life seems much less probable. makes me sad that there could be other planets with their own unique ecosystems and we'll likely never know about each other :(

       The idea of shiny metal discs zipping through the air... I would say it isn't old, or new ( 40s Roswell onward new ). A few painting from the supposed renaissance seem to depict them. Stone etchings from Egypt, India, unverified but possibly central/ south America.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tangible evidence to their story, and not being a "Smithsonian"-esque narrative are hard pressed to find solid ground. We can be sure of monuments. We can't be sure of their origin, or how they came about, let alone the exact purpose. That's a link, even if there isn't a direct word of testimony. No link can be an incredible link.
      </p>
      <p>
       The moon of Saturn named Pan has a known and obvious form, structure, and how it got to be that way. It's unlikely, not impossible, that said shiny metal saucers were derived this way.
      </p>
      <p>
       Meteors and moons do follow specific orbits, although it's not as simple as circular, oblong, or even regular.
      </p>
      <p>
       Spherically spiralized, or spiralizingly spherical. Best way I can describe it. A multidimensional vector in perpetual motion with multiple points of synchronicity.
      </p>
      <p>
       Imagine a slinky toy. Now imagine one of those desktop swinging ball pendulum that transfer kinetic energy from end to end. Now imagine that slinky coming to a vortices, a point in the center; now stretch it out. Now imagine that slinky in a "perfect orbit" around "desktop ball pendulum". That is the Sun. Now imagine, to their own degree around that sun, all the planets, moving in continuity. Now imagine all of their respective moons, in perpetuity, the same.
That is cosmic motion. On a scale of billions and billions. In our own "backyard".
      </p>
      <p>
       Back on track: There is no reason, assuming a level of knowledge, understanding, spirit/will/constitution, and, over all, wherewithal that a craft could not assume a planetary orbit. What that entails is, a question, above all - for what purpose? That makes it overwhelmingly unlikely to derive outside of this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       There is nothing new in our solar system. There is everything old. If it seems new it is only because it has only come to our attention as it previously wasn't within our realm of knowing.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it looks anything like something a man could make, a man did it. We are no longer strangers to computerized cinematography. We are no longer strangers to having someone else tell us a story that logically makes no sense, entertsining it may be. Before our eyes we can straight up tell them their liars, our brains think it. Our mouths rarely utter it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, my postulate, what makes this, and these headline "disclosure" stories any different?
      </p>
      <p>
       1 thing. Someone is having a go at you and anyone else willing to accept ignorance, or same 1 thing, their own ignorance accepting that someone else wants to direct it.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I were to be given evidence, even short of meeting a Vulcan myself, I would ponder it, but most likely accept it. Why? Having no direct evidence? Because it is more likely true than it is not. The problem is, we have only "what if" and "I know I saw" and grandiose stories against a more immediate narrative; one that SHOULD be paid attention to. But that would make what happens in the real world something you could directly control. And that's what they don't want.

       I want to rebut, but cannot but few words, but for what purpose?

       OP for a reason. Ask yourself what the line of thought, linear progression is.

       Life does exist elsewhere. Life hostile to this world, outside this world, doesn't exist. This world, those within it, are hostile among themselves, to those of their own kind.

       We, all else, want peace.

       I don't think this would work, since asteroids and comets only travel so fast.  Any species capable of interstellar travel would be traveling much faster than any asteroid or comet.

       I personally think if Aliens exist, flying saucers just seems like a stereotype, looks very outdated and i imagine it would be impossible to fly let alone intergalatic travel.

       UFOs often park out in front of stars as cover.
      </p>
      <p>
       I believe the reason why we are seeing them is because they want us to see them.  They are ready to make contact to help us through the Poleshift.  It's our governments and wealthy elite who are refusing their help, so they are connecting directly with people.  If they wanted to hide from us, they could, and I'm sure many still do...
