         The 12 page document goes in detail over how Bill Clinton monetized the foundation. The basic context is that, at some point in 2011 there was a civil war inside the foundation, with Teneo/Doug Band on one side, and Chelsea Clinton on the other.  In this attachment, Band tries to justify himself by going over how much money he has made for the Clintons. It also dispels and puts to rest the notion that the Clintons don't make money from the Foundation. In fact, it demonstrates that the Clinton fortune and the Foundation are indistinguishable and essentially the same, and that donations to the Foundation come with kickbacks for all involved.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The Clinton Foundation even hired a law firm to find out if their pay-to-play scheme would jeopardize their charitable status with the IRS.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Doug Band (who was to Bill what Huma Abedin is to Hillary) described his work as running "Bill Clinton Inc." Essentially, the memo describes Teneo as the revenue-generating arm of Clinton, Inc. - for Clinton speeches, foundation money, etc. It also details quite a bit of offshore money that came in.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Band was selling his clients on idea that giving to the Foundation was a way to bolster their influence.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The second link is more discussion on the infamous Doug Band memo about Teneo, which revealed corruption and inurement by the Clintons. They were using "charity" to personally enrich themselves to the tune of tens of millions of dollars. Doug is worried that if the "story gets out" Teneo, the company involved in the scheme will have to be shut down completely and that they "would be screwed."
