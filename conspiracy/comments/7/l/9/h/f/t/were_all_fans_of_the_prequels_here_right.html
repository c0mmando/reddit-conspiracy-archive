<p>We all know it&#39;s an allegory to international politics in our real world, right? </p>

<p>George Lucas makes a movie you have to be smart to understand but it gets shat on all the time. The force awakens you have to be actually dumb to enjoy, and it&#39;s breaking box office records. Sad.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I can sympathize. I really like The Untouchables but have since learned that this is not a widely enjoyed movie. Also really enjoy League or Extraordinary Gentleman. Though that&#39;s not Costner, the movie is pretty hated on but I think it&#39;s fun.</p>

<p>If you haven&#39;t checked out Criminal from last year, it&#39;s not a bad Costner flick. They put ultra-moral, good dad, special agent Ryan Reynolds&#39; memories into the brain of a criminally insane Costner. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a nice rainy day activity with the girlfriend between sessions and meals, and we&#39;re far from children :D but otherwise, I completely agree. I looked back at the time I put into video games, thought of how much I could have accomplished with the same time, and have drifted ever since. </p>

<p>If ever you were to go back, you&#39;d be hard pressed to find a more approachable, intellectually stimulating game that&#39;s designed to be played in 15-20 minute installments than the Lego games. They also made an Indiana Jones game with far more difficult puzzles than those found in their various Star Wars games. Sometimes it&#39;s nice to take a break and laugh at a fun interpretation of a classic favorite. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think the Force Awakens was terrible and the prequels were terrible. </p>

<p>They are just two different kinds of terrible: tFA is terrible because it&#39;s a stale, sanitized, repackaged version of a New Hope with weaker acting, cheap emotional appeals, and a clusterfuck of unabashed, blatant self-plagiarism. </p>

<p>The prequels were an attempt at a toy commercial that had cheesy dialogue, poorly defined characters (try to write 10 sentences describing the kind of person Qui Gon Jin or Mace Windu are; they literally lack characterization), an overemphasis on CGI, and it lacked that special quality, the DNA in essence, that makes something feel like it&#39;s &quot;Star Wars&quot;. I think the third one was okay, for what it&#39;s worth, but the first two were already irredeemable. </p>

<p>I liked Rogue One though. That felt like Star Wars. I&#39;d even put it ahead of Return of the Jedi as top 3 all time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>At the theater?</p>

<p>Well i would argue that, you need to forget your first impression. The Jedi knows when to accept and when to ignore the first impression of something. One&#39;s first impression of a movie in a movie theater full of hundreds of visually distraught fans could be to follow the crowd of anger. Look at the movies, years later, with a more clear mind. Especially the second one.</p>

<p>The second one was the best of the prequels imo. The third movie doesn&#39;t give us an impression of Anakin falling into the dark side the way the second movie shows it to us. </p>

<p>The second movie also expands the world the most of all of the movies. I&#39;d argue, it expands the world of star wars the most of all nine movies. Korrino looks cool. Corscurant brings in a vivid megaopolis of beings from all over star wars universe. Tattooine is revisited, and expanded.  Geonosis is cool. The monsters in that final battle were cool. </p>

<p>Its the middle movie thats probably the best one since Empire Strikes Back. Right pace of action. Expands the star wars universe. </p>

<p>That scene with Count Dooku, played by Christopher Lee, talking to a bound Obi Wan is a lot cooler when you watch it years later </p>
