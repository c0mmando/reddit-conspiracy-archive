<p>Sort by top of all time. Find some summarizations of the issue.</p>

<p>Trump has been a potential Russian asset for probably five years. Trump has been committing financial crimes for decades. Trump was a useful idiot, not a mastermind. Trump is incapable of helping the “deep state” or Illuminati by way of total incompetence. Trump is doing nobody’s bidding except Putin’s, and only sort of.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think everything truly hinges on 2020 and the actions We The People take between now and then...the Democratic Party is slowly being taken...one state at a time, so far 8 have been captured from these Corporate Centrist fools...if Bernie or someone like him wins the Primaries in &#39;18, and a real Progressive Populist runs against Trump in 2020, I think there is hope.</p>

<p>That said, Trump must survive this partisan witch hunt until then...something I see as increasingly difficult, especially when considering the new McCabe revelations as of today...in which he &quot;doesn&#39;t recall&quot; the time at which he learned that the Steele Dossier was funded by HRC and the DNC...even though Congress has signed affidavits by him saying otherwise...though I do not support Trump, I fear he is the victim of a Neoliberal/Neoconservative conspiracy to destroy his presidency and the Republic itself...god help us... </p>

<p>I hope so friend. What it says to me is that McCabe is a partisan hack who is currently the head of the FBI, and that this counter-Trump insurgency goes very, very high up the chain of command...I hope that it all fizzles out, ultimately. But I fear that it runs too deep... </p>

<p>&quot;So no russia is not a thing you need to be worrying about. Merry christmas.&quot;</p>

<p>I think you may be oversimplifying a bit. I don&#39;t like the current narrative, the hysteria or the division this whole shit show is causing, but unless you have a time machine that can take us back to reset Korea, Vietnam, the Russian invasion of Afghanistan, the conflicts in eastern Europe during the 90&#39;s, much of the conflicts the U.S. has been engaged in in the middle east and various other lesser known conflicts across the globe since the conclusion of WW2, there certainly is something to worry about. I know it gets real deep real quick and it takes two to tango, but the tptb in the U.S. and Russia have been fucking each other at the expense of the common man for far too long. I hope Trump does have a good dialogue with Russia to help improve the entire planet and all of humanity, but it&#39;s reasonable to fear he, or any person in power suspected of colluding, may be a puppet and working from within to give our oldest foe a hell of advantage at our expense.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Dont you think if they were any we&#39;d have seen it prior to the election?  Or seen it in the year since?  Or have it leaked from Muellers investigation?  </p>

<p>Look at the Mueller investigation:</p>

<p>We have </p>

<p>Manafort indicted for crimes that predated Trump&#39;s campaign and he actually worked for Podesta, so a Dem.  </p>

<p>And </p>

<p>Flynn who was indicted for lying to the FBI.  And indicted for stuff during the transition.</p>

<p>Thats the extent of 11 months of this witch hunt.  Is that proof of collusion?</p>

<p>Not to mention Trump himself fired these 2 people.  Dont you think maybe he knew they were bad people?  </p>

<p>Dont you think if Trump really did collude with the Russians he wouldn&#39;t bring it up again and again?  Or that he wouldn&#39;t be so cocky and be willing to testify and his people ready to testify?  </p>

<p>This is a mass panic and a witch hunt.  Mueller won&#39;t find any evidence because no crime was committed and collusion isn&#39;t a crime.  Not a single person sits in prison for colluding with Russia.  Thats not a crime on the books.  As far as influencing the election they still haven&#39;t told us what that means?  Ballot box stuffing?  Computer hacking?  Which states were impacted?  How many votes?  We have no fucking clue.  </p>

<p>Trump is not Manafort or Flynn.  He&#39;s not.  He&#39;s not Papadopalous.  </p>

<p>He didnt collude with the Russians.  </p>

<p>The DNC made it up not the media.  </p>

<p>So yeah, considering we only ever hear about Mueller’s moves months or weeks after they happen, there is some serious shit coming.</p>

<p>No. Mueller is involved in something that could remove the POTUS. He&#39;s not going to be giving us updates along the way.

    <div class="md"><p>The intelligence agency that is <em>supposed</em> to keep you safe and prevent the installation of a foreign agent as your president claims to have evidence but fails to produce it.</p>

<p>They sit on it.  They keep you from knowing.  They withhold proof and just run on the &quot;trust us&quot; card.</p>

<p>How can this be?  Either they have the evidence or they don&#39;t.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of the whole process, let alone a reality show idiot.  Though, I still think he was allowed in because hilary was sick and couldn&#39;t keep it together.  Trump gets in but he is the easy target.  Though, if that idea is right it does illustrate that the process carries on regardless of who is in.</p>

<p>I think trump is only deep state as far as he is allowed in.  If he falls for tricks they can brand him anything they like through the media.  The media is still against him, I don&#39;t think he owns the media.  That means someone still does and the goal is to make him look like the fool.  I think the game can be run behind a presidents back.  I think it&#39;s been that way for a long time.  Puppets out in front, movers and shakers in back.</p>

<p>He&#39;s not exactly one of them but he has no choice but to play the game.  When the only game to play is the game played <em>their</em> way, you may be able to see how things work.  </p>

<p>This is my opinion only.</p>

Soon the media will start reporting that Trump is not doing such a terrible job after all. More and more people will come to accept him being in office.

Trump is widely despised and they know this. So they send out a hero that will bring him down. But the system likes Trump. The Trump will further the agenda.

<p>So you dont think anything will come of Seth Rich, DWS, the Awans, Podesta, the supposed Mueller is our guy theory, that Sessions has been working in secret, Hillary etc...  You dont foresee any of those people being indicted?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are correct. I think that all of those people will get off without ever seeing a minute in jail. TPTB is not terrified of their own tool. This is a game of rope a dope. I have saved your post. When it comes to election time in 3 years I will be contacting you again. I love saying, I told you so.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sorry to piggyback but I&#39;d like an explanation from someone:  why is Trump and his team meeting with Russians a potentially criminal/impeachable act when meeting with Israelis and pledging support at AIPAC an accepted rite of passage for presidential candidates?  Is it that the potential lying and cover up is a crime and that&#39;s the target of the investigations or what&#39;s the difference?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When Kennedy accused the Russians of putting missiles in Cuba, he showed the evidence. Even the Iraq War sham involved at least revealing some shitty sources that they had WMDs, even though it was really about Saddam threatening the petrodollar.</p>

<p>The intelligence agencies have produced absolutely no evidence to support the Russian collusion claims. None at all. And it has been thoroughly debunked by independent, reliable sources like <a href="https://www.truthdig.com/eartotheground/item/william_binney_ray_mcgovern_intel_experts_russia_hacking_20161213">William Binney and Ray McGovern</a>.</p>

<p>Now, let&#39;s go one step deeper. Why are they doing this? Partly to try to control Donald Trump, and partly to cover up the fact that the previous administration was taking bribes from the Russians as part of the Uranium One deal. But mostly to control geopolitics, and keep the United States and Russia apart. </p>

<p>Woke level: The British are behind it, just as they sought to divide the US and Russia with the Cold War because FDR nearly broke up the British Empire at the end of WWII, and they didn&#39;t want anyone else getting any ideas.</p>

<p>Really woke level: Just like the British were behind Hitler. And the Russian Revolution. Which was punishment for the Russians supporting the US during the Civil War, when the Confederacy was supported by the British.</p>

<p>Ultimate woke level: this kind of things has gone on for thousands of years. The British instigating the French Revolution. Venice instigating the crusades. Roman intelligence&#39;s strategy of &quot;divide and conquer.&quot; The Persians against the Athenian Republic. And so on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The truth probably lies somewhere in the middle. My personal guess is that Trump&#39;s team was inexperienced and sometimes incompetent which resulted in them making lots of small blunders in terms of proper procedure when handling foreign contacts. A few of them were also dirty as hell but mostly in their personal dealings. For their part, Russia was more than happy to oblige and make contact - no skin off their nose.</p>

<p>I doubt there was some grand conspiracy where Trump made some agreement with Putin to help him win the election. Russia definitely tried to influence the election, or at least sow discord, and they may very well have been involved in the various email scandals. But they were probably doing it our of their own geopolitical preferences and not at the behest of anyone in the Trump team. There were probably inappropriate contacts, but no quid pro quo.</p>

<p>My guess is that Mueller with bring down a number of more people for doing stupid shit and it will make Trump look bad, but in the end there will be no evidence of outright collusion. No fire, just lots of smoke from a fire that never quite got started.</p>

<p>Because there is so much smoke it can be presented in whatever what your personal ideology wants. Trump supporters can believably claim that there was no collusion since there is no hard proof. Anti-Trumpers can point to the various lesser wrongdoings and paint a believable picture of a larger conspiracy. We&#39;re in the Witch&#39;s Darkness right now and reality is malleable.</p>

<p>My advice for now is to ignore all speculation. If a report says &quot;sources say&quot;, ignore it - it may or may not be true. If someone claims there is no evidence, ignore it - the investigation is still ongoing. Until Mueller comes out and says or does something, assume any other information is a narrative being pushed.</p>
