       I have been infatuated with ufos since a very early age. I still remember the first time I saw a documentary on it and instantly it resonated with me. I also remember seeing documentaries on usos. If I remember correctly these were actually on the history channel and this was LONG before the dawn of ancient aliens. There was a lot of sightings coming from naval ships and many claimed they tend to come straight out of the oceans more often than not. Of course it is just a possibility that they either hide there or perhaps set up bases. But what if they have been there long before us? What if they developed here on land and chose to go into hiding long ago when destruction wiped the slate clean? There seems to be a lot of evidence that there is in fact bases at the bottom of the ocean. I really want to know others thoughts on this. Or perhaps there are interdimensional gateways or portals down there that they use. I have no idea and am suspicious of anyone who claims to know without a doubt. However I do love to here different views and opinions. The recent release or soft disclosure if you will has brought up many questions in my mind. Questions that have been floating around in my noggin for nearly decades. I don't have many people in real life to converse with so I am highly appreciative of this community and the open minds that vacate it. Thank you for reading my post and I am excited to hear all of your views and opinions!

       Im legit hitting the same shit you are at the moment. But aliens are a cover. Let me ask you, what if the reason they hid alien shit and antarctica, because people wouldn't be able to  handle that demons and hell was real and under our feet the whole time. You think people won't panic now?

       Well shit man... Lol I don't discount anything. Nothing whatsoever. The deception is indeed massive. That is all I know. However could they be evil beings? Of course. Do I believe they are actual demons? No. But that doesn't mean they aren't. It just doesn't seem to fit. Not for me or my views atm anyway.

       My view is always changing, no doubt. All I know is that there is Innerspace. Outerspace at this point is unclear. With the many frauds the space agency has given us. Many shots of clouds showing up through the moon, the lunar wave, etc. There is clear there is a deception being played when it comes to outer space. I did figure out a pattern. When they say "right" look left, when they say "look up" look down. Also look at the connection between the occult and alien research. The lines are getting blurred.

       Absolutely! I've thought about all that and then some. By saying maybe they were here long before us I was kind of hinting at the inner earth thing. Who knows what's really going on.. I don't even think our government knows the full extent and I believe that is part of the reason we've been kept in the dark. I do believe they know a whole lot more than us though. It's just so fascinating that all of this is going on right under our noses and all we can do is ponder and come up with possibilities. I find it very frustrating. I don't think there's anything that I desire to know the truth about more than this.

       Your second to last sentence is funny- vacate means to leave a place. I think I know what you meant to say though.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to factor in the pyramids and what that might mean for aliens or our ancient society. It's possible aliens developed along a different evolutionary path and are interested in our DNA among other things.

       Oh I have factored the pyramids and many other things in. I just couldn't even begin to put all my ideas down because it would take me way too long. I just wanted to get the basic gist of how others felt on that one aspect in particular. We did have a major leap in evolution. This is in the record. We made a big jump... what about 150,000 years ago? I do believe there is a good chance we have been altered. Shit... maybe this entire planet was seeded, intentionally. What do you think the building of the pyramids indicates? That's a very broad question I know. If you look at different ones around the world on different continents they were all aligned in the same way to the same star system. If that doesn't tell us all something then I don't know what will.

       I agree. Or maybe under there they have chambers that open into vast caverns possibly even an inner earth type scenario!! I can tell you're excited by the particular idea as well. I'm with you bro! Lol. Thanks for finding the show. I believe you are right but I will have to watch later to see. Do you think they were here way before us? Do you think we could be there pet project on the surface world. God it's creepy yet astonishing. It would be like living your entire life in a glass room and they're all one sided mirrors. You think you're alone but you're really always being watched.

       My craaazy pet theory is that we were not the first intelligence evolution spawned. And what was dominating the earth before mammals? Reptiles. 500mil years or whatever of dinosaurs...And you mean to tell me intelligence
       <em>
        never
       </em>
       occured? How long did it take mammals to throw out smarts? 50mil? And there wasn't just 1, Neanderthals were also conscious and intelligent creatures imho.

       Couldn't agree more with you my friend. I could see higher intelligence taking longer to evolve or develop for reptilians but they did rule the earth for an incredibly long period of time. See this is why I love these discussions. I have thought about all of this many times but I never thought about it like that. Very interesting indeed. I always had the feeling that if there truly was reptiles that have surpassed us in evolution then they would be from a different planet. The earth back in that time practically was a different planet in terms of our atmosphere and how much oxygen was in it. It allowed very different things to flourish. You very well may be on to something there. Maybe they knew a cataclysm was nearing and they used their tech to disappear into the earth.

       I think there's a 99.9% chance that UFOs are advanced US military aircraft.  What are the odds that an alien spacecraft would even look like a spacecraft?  Think about what an airplane looked like 100 years ago, vs a military jet today.  Now imagine what one would look like in 100 years.  Or 1,000 years.  Or a million years.
      </p>
      <p>
       If an alien spacecraft visited earth, for all we know it would be invisible.  Or maybe they travel through some kind of wormhole and they can see us but we can't see them.  Or maybe they don't even travel at all, but just do some type of remote viewing.  I just think its ridiculous to think they use actual aircraft similar to ours but a little different shape and more quiet.

       I mostly don't believe alien encounter stories, because, from the aliens point of view, their actions don't seem to make any sense.  If you can travel across interstellar space, we don't have anything you would need or want.

       Any intelligent being must possess curiosity as it is one of the main driving forces of innovation and learning new things right? Why must they need something in order to come here? Cant they just be curious and wanting to check things out? If things were flipped and we were on the other side, does it seem that unlikely that we would want to just observe wether it was for personal gain or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, technology is increasing at an exponential rate. Im not saying that we will be interdimensional travelers anytime soon but any intelligent being, especially one who presumably already has reached this technological level would be mindful of other species technological progression throughout time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also just to clarify, While I do believe other life is out there, I dont necessarily believe or disbelieve that these UFO's are extraterrestrial. Just throwing some things out there to think about.

       Very solid points. You are absolutely correct. We always put Aliens through a lens of things that we know which is why they are humanoid and fly in objects similar to ours yet with advanced propulsion methods. In an infinite universe there will exist aliens that are nothibg like we could imagine or maybe even comprehend with our relatively limited brain capacity. Super advanced aliens from this dimension could even be so small that we couldnt see them. Why their size need to be somewhat similar to ours. On their planet they could be normal size and here they are in land of mega giants.

       Well I don't think their craft is similar to ours in any way shape or form. I've seen some weird shit on one single occasion and it was nothing like what we have. The simple fact that they appear to fly doesn't mean shit. Obviously these craft have a very different propulsion system and capabilities we are not familiar with. So in essence, I'm agreeing with you. But I also think most others would. Who do you know that has ever said they saw an alien jet? Lol... the craft are never said to look like what we have.

       I think it's a very strong possibility. It would certainly make sense and it lines up with many things I've heard many people say, people who I feel I can trust or people who "committed suicide" shortly after.

       Yes the Egyptians seem to depict them. Also who knows about all the lost remnants of society before the Egyptians. Maybe back then they lived side by side and interacted. I believe there is more than a grain of truth in the old mythical tales of God's.
      </p>
      <p>
       In regards to why just fly around? There could be a million reasons. One I find high probable is that we are their science experiment.

       It's possible, certainly.

       I think 'military kerfuffle' accounts for some of these.

       Dude I hope you're right. Personally my favorite theory! But even if it was... does that mean none of the craft could be coming from another dimension or wormhole from another part of our own universe?

       It’s not a binary choice - many main stream outlets make it out to be, both intentionally to obfuscate and unintentionally out of general scientific illiteracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some percentage of the vehicles observed by civilians are ours (the USA had Aurora, other govs have similar programs). These contain earthly design elements (think nuts and bolts) as well as reverse engineered alien tech. Other sightings are truly alien, either Greys conducting normal ops and probably bored out of their minds or more exotic Vehicles passing through our system and sometimes completely disregarding the normal protocol. The Zimbabwe schoolyard landing and the Phoenix Lights are a great examples of this.

       I'm sure of one thing: The governments of the world do NOT have any contact with aliens, nor they posses any alien technology. The evidence shows they are just trying to appear "superior" or "invincible" but that's just a lie.

       Any intelligent being must possess curiosity as it is one of the main driving forces of innovation and learning new things right? Why must they need something in order to come here? Cant they just be curious and wanting to check things out? If things were flipped and we were on the other side, does it seem that unlikely that we would want to just observe wether it was for personal gain or not?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, technology is increasing at an exponential rate. Im not saying that we will be interdimensional travelers anytime soon but any intelligent being, especially one who presumably already has reached this technological level would be mindful of other species technological progression throughout time.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also just to clarify, While I do believe other life is out there, I dont necessarily believe or disbelieve that these UFO's are extraterrestrial. Just throwing some things out there to think about.

       Absolutely! I've thought about all that and then some. By saying maybe they were here long before us I was kind of hinting at the inner earth thing. Who knows what's really going on.. I don't even think our government knows the full extent and I believe that is part of the reason we've been kept in the dark. I do believe they know a whole lot more than us though. It's just so fascinating that all of this is going on right under our noses and all we can do is ponder and come up with possibilities. I find it very frustrating. I don't think there's anything that I desire to know the truth about more than this.

       What do you think is most plausibly the culprit?

       Everything is possible though I don't share your belief. Especially the just created hype part. I hope they don't use it for some FF bullshit. My entire life I've been enthralled. I need something real god damn it.

       I am not on board with Icke 100% or anything, reptilian theory ain't my thing. But
       <em>

       we are on the subject, I totally believe this could have been how it happened.
