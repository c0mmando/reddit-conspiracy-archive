       Astral world is what we don't know. How the universe expands infinitely but is constantly being consumed. The stars and planets we can't reach. The mathematical functions found in every nook and cranny of our universe.
      </p>
      <p>
       Astral is used to relate between a collective conscience. Dreams. Alternate realities. Parallel universes.

       We could be a simulation. We could all be connected through the collective mathematics of quantum particular holding within then their own universe. We could be anything and everything.

       Elementals are interesting. They are amoeba like beings that exist on the astral plane. Certain ones feed off certain emotions. If you are prone to anger you would be surrounded by these beings and they would be syphoning your astral energy, feeding off your negative emotions. Rudolf Steiner spoke of this. He said you would be rather disturb if you could see these beings.
 Charles Ledbetter has a book that is amazing on the subject. He worked with a women to paint the images he saw on the astral plane. The gigantic octopus creature that sat atop the churches and sucked in all the praise and worship was quite memorable.
 He also mentioned that fairies breath emotions like we do air and they find the thoughts of human to be for the most part quite disgusting and that is why the live far out in the forest.

       I like this idea. I don't know shit and this is just something that I imagined, but is in similar vein.
      </p>
      <p>
       As the hermetic saying goes, as above so below. We're a small and fleeting blip among the cosmos, but also rare and fundamental. I imagine us conscious beings being like little rhizobial bacteria in the root nodules of astral trees beyond our comprehension. We turn suffering into love, fear, hate, etc... some messy mixture of it all.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm not saying this is the way stuff is or anything like that, just a thought I try to keep in mind, that helps remind me to focus on love and understanding.. all that nice stuff. That's the kind of bacteria I'd want to be :3

       When you die, you will live. Our living  world is a world of death. All of this exists in the mind. Life is a subjective experience, experienced objectively. Or vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
       When you dream, there are many characters. When you wake, you realize that all if.the characters in the dream were you. So it is with life.
      </p>
      <p>
       This world is a dream within a dream. The body stops functioning and dies, the dream continues. Maybe in the dream you fall asleep. Then you're born again. Maybe here. Maybe there. Maybe everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>

       The astral world is the world behind the veil, ie the spiritual world. It is inhabited by the Falllen Angels and the Nephilim. Not beings you want to deal with. Unless you wanna be a part of the same cult as the elites are.

       Hi. Let me start by saying my experiences are being done by other people around the world. The Astral Dimension is EXTREMELY similar to this one. The belief that it is "non physical" is incorrect. I prefer to call it "semi physical" and compare it to about 70% of the "solidity" of this dimension. It is expanding and forming an overlap/overlay at certain Ley Lines and Vortex Points that it can almost be entered through meditation at this point. Astral Projection and Advanced Lucid Dreaming are occurring in the Astral.
It would be easiest to divide it to three sections: 1)The "Lower Astral" which is the world of horrific nightmares. Deceased murderers, and people of extremely violent and hateful nature like to congregate in this area. It is also the realm in demonic entities and the sadistic satanic behaviors originated from. 2)The "Middle Astral" looks incredibly similar to here. Houses, Buildings, Restaurants and Bars. Yes, I have eaten food, as well as gotten drunk drinking beer there. It seems there is a massive concentration of bars and strip clubs. Because sadly most deceased people tend to gravitate towards addictive and perverse behaviors. Constant Sexual Relations are commonplace and caring relationships seem to be few.

       3)The "Upper Astral" is rarely seen and would be described as similar to a multi colored, brightly lit Monet Painting. Although it looks like the most "Heavenly" in appearance it is still currently controlled by the Alien Archon/Illuminati Group. Most people will be routed into the Middle astral. Although they may consider themselves anti establishment, most quickly give into their lower chakra stimulations and become mezmerized by constant food, booze and sex. I have seen Grey Aliens as well as 9 foot tall Reptilians in the middle astral. Although rarely seen, these beings make no attempt to hide their existence. The Astral is actually their home base and where earth and its tribulations are plotted. Living members of the Satanic Global Elite have the advanced tech and ritual to enter into and visit with these beings if they choose.

       The Archons/Illuminati have most of their dirty work eagerly done by deceased humans who work for them. Most of these people have no idea of the massive deception and actual agenda of the Control Group.  These humans have are called "counselors" and wear khaki pants and white polo shirts and sort of look like clean cut mormons. Their primary job is the long term "Programming" being done on the deceased. You will notice many large buildings that are almost exactly like a university lecture hall. David Icke calls these places the "Halls Of Programming". Large numbers of the deceased are constantly told of their "failures". How they accrued "Karmic Debt". The targeted human will be told this relentlessly for many years, while also being told to "let go of the past" and to "completely forget their friends and loved ones". This causes the targeted human to become a semi blank slate. Experiences and relationships are almost completely forgotten. They are distracted with the non stop food, alcohol, sex and violent behaviors that are encouraged. This is all leading up to the eventual day of reckoning: Many years later the targeted human is now ready for the process of FORCED REINCARNATION and MEMORY ERASE.

       There are some very fascinating abilities that can be used in the Astral. 1)Flying (although I usually float upwards or sideways). 2)TELEKINESIS is my favorite. You can open doors, lift or slide cars, giant rocks etc. Telekinesis is also the best for self defense. I have thrown objects at people. Made people punch themselves, or throw objects at the people they are with. You can also levitate people and throw them into the distance, or against objects such as walls etc. Telekinesis appears to be illegal and extremely frowned upon by the control group.

       Nothing really. I've heard stories here and there. Was interested in what people knew here. I really enjoyed reading the CIA report that was commented.
