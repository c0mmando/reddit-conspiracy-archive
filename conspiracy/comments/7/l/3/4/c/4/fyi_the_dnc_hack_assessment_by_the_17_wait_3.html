       I just wanted to document this, because I have seen MSM news outlets now report that the DNC was hacked by Russians as fact, and they use this assessment to make those claims.  The report makes it clear on page 13 that it is based off of judgments that aren't supported by proof:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        “Estimative language consists of two elements: Judgements about the likelihood of developments or events occurring and levels of confidence in the sources and analytic reasoning supporting the judgements.
        <strong>
         Judgements are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be fact
        </strong>
        . Assessments are based on collected information, which is often incomplete or fragmentary, as well as logic, argumentation and precedents.”
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       Not to mention the other report where they list RT coverage of fracking and third parties as attempts to undermine the US.  Both of those items are absurd. And I keep trying to stress to people how absurd they are, and to ask people why the govt would include such things in an official report.

       The DNC email hack is not the issue being investigated.
      </p>
      <p>
       The issue Mueller is investigating is did the Trump campaign co-ordinate efforts with the Russians.  That is also the question the House and Senate investigation committees are busy trying to cover up.

       I think it's a huge factor who actually hacked the DNC and provided it to Wikileaks.  You can speculate all you like about how it went down, but it's not fact.  How hard would it be for the NSA to provide the facts/proof that would be needed to support that assessment?

       Dawg look at that dudes comment and post history. Clearly all in on the “muhhh Russia stole the election”. Year later not a shred of proof and a literal mountain of evidence that the “investigation” is a political witch hunt.

       ok, let's say that's accurate - explain how emails which the report itself said contained valid info "meddled the election" because they didn't really make that clear
      </p>
      <p>
       (and btw saying something like "well wikileaks didn't release info on Trump" doesn't really make sense, because one had to seek out the info in the DNC emails &amp; it's not like there was any reporting on them in the mass media. There was plenty of pre-election info  about the Trump admin for people to find as well, and I'm not talking about Russia)

       Didn't this whole Russia delusion begin from the DNC and Podesta leaks? And then the evidence fell through, so the cultists like you have moved on to other vague and mysterious suspicions?

       Some conservative sites blame it  on the original Washington Examiner ordered Steele Dossier.

       The real investigation began very early in the campaign when the intelligence agencies of our EU NATO allies notified U.S. intelligence agencies that, meetings were happening between the Russians and  Trump campaign people.

       i think assange's life circmstances have made him willing to engage in
       <em>
        realpolitik
       </em>
       and thus engage in temporary alliances with people to his own benefit, as evidenced by his qualified support of president trump over hillary clinton during the 2016 general election i have yet to see any evidence that vladimir putin is one of those people, but would love it if someone pushing the "russia! wikileaks!" angle were able to produce something substantive and compelling.
      </p>
      <p>
       for now, i have resigned myself to continuing to be bored by this narrative and disappointed in the people pushing it.

       I haven't seen any comments from specific government agencies, except to say it was/has been very difficult to determine how the DNC emails were stolen.

      <p>
       And no evidence has been provided about who phished the Podesta emails.

       The fact that the public has not been updated with information Mueller is gathering does not mean there is no evidence.

       Right. Mueller is not doing his job to independently investigate and prosecute anyone for the “supposed” Russian hacks. He is also just relying on that weak document with the flimsiest conclusion that OP pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is no crime or “meddling/interfering” exists without the hacked dnc emails given to wikileaks.

       At this point there is no proof that would convince you guys that Russia interfered in our election.  You live in a world where Russia is just a friendly country the mean old Democrats want to start a war with.  Anything bashing Trump is fake news and anything bashing Democrats is part of the great liberal criminal conspiracy to fuck children.

       I don't think it's as partisan as you would like to think I think it is.  I think it's the deep state/establishment that were uneasy about Trump and helped fabricate this whole situation.  With that said, I think the media/establishment are using this 'narrative' to keep from talking about real issues, like raising troops in Afghanistan, staying in Syria, US &amp; SA's blockage in Yemen, the Tax Bill, Net Neutrality, the 800 Billion dollar military budget.  If anything, this story is helping Trump from having to deal with real criticism on foreign &amp; domestic policy.

       Totally fair points.  I agree that the Russia thing gets pushed at the expense of real news, I just think that Russia did interfere in the election to help Trump.  I doubt Trump will be taken down by it, but maybe Kushner.  But yeah, I'd like it if we could focus on other things.  Every time Mueller does something it doesn't have to be front page news.

       I don't claim to know whether Russia did or not, but the examples that have been given has been over blown when you look at them on their face.  The Facebook ads is a joke, they claim Russia paid 50k in ads between 2015-the election and pushed propaganda like
       <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/11/01/22/45EB3FB900000578-5040715-image-a-33_1509574863860.jpg">
        Bernie Sanders in a thong
       </a>
       .  A lot of it is laughable at time, especially when you consider Trump (Cambridge Analytics) &amp; Clinton (CTR) were both paying millions for social media manipulation.  Yet, some how 50k in russian propaganda, which if you look what was presented at the hearing on it, was the saddest propaganda I have ever seen.

       Trump Jr has given every indication he was trying to collude.  Kushner was in the room so he was certainly open to the idea as well.  Whether or not they did, or what comes of it, no idea.

       Sure, he may have tried, I don't know.  But I do know that the DNC &amp; HRC campaign worked their back channels to get Intel from Russian Officials to build the Dossier.  Oddly enough, no one blinks any eye at that, because it's supposedly normal Oppo research, even though they lied about until it was revealed.

       I despise Trump. But I also think it's completely fabricated that Russia had any impact on the election. All evidence to this point suggests Israel was spying on the DNC, Israel was manipulating US media, Israel was colluding with Kushner/Trump.
      </p>
      <p>
       But because Russia destroyed Netanyahu's plan in Syria he's pulling strings to try and shift the blame to Russia/Putin.

       I mean, fair enough, like I said, I believe Russia interfered with our election, but we are certainly doing some strange pro-Israel things.  But I believe whether or not the Russia investigation comes up with anything doesn't matter, because it is getting pushed at the expense of actually trying to win voters.  When Clinton first lost everyone was like, why did this happen?  Was it the Russians, was it Comey, who's to blame?  And now it seems like the media has settled on the Russians, and they're counting on this investigation to 'fix the mistake the voters made'.

       That's definitely true.  The GOP has been laying the groundwork on Clinton hate for decades, as well.  A million things went wrong in that campaign, and Hillary didn't fix anything by being the robotic, always-playing-it-safe politician that no one felt was authentic.

       Ok, do you see my point?  There is a popular subreddit devoted to Donald Trump, so how did Hillary followers fall for a "personality cult", she has no popular subreddit, she doesn't have thousands of people come to rallys.  Your nitpicking this by saying
       <a href="/r/The_Donald">
        /r/The_Donald

       still makes it to the top 50 on /all once in a while.  My point that Hillary Clinton has no cult of personality around her and it's ridiculous to claim she does when Donald Trump clearly has one.  He has a rabid fan base and a fairly popular subreddit on this site.  You're not even debating my point, you just grabbed the fact that donald is on the front page all the time.  And whether or not leftist shit hits the front page all the time, which it does, pro-Hillary Clinton stuff never does.  There's never a Hillary Clinton did this great thing, isn't she great, post on the front page.  Fuck, they call Trump a godking emperor.  I'm not even defending HRC because I don't like her, I want her to stay out of politics for the rest of her life for the good of the country, but I have no idea why you're calling me a liar unless name calling is all you have.

       Hmm, interesting read. I'm not sure who the mystery 17th US intelligence agency is, op, or why US Coast Guard intelligence really needs to chime in on this matter, but maybe we should wait until we hear what the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency has to say about things before we do anything more... You quote the appendix/"disclaimer" from the report that states that judgements are not intended to say they have proof. Ok. But, they also don't say that they don't have proof. Groups like these tend to hold their cards close. They do offer in the report that they assess that the GRU did hack into the DNC networks and that they did releases the information obtained through Wikileaks. I guess it comes down to if you trust the assessment of these intelligence agencies or of you think they are lying.

       They aren't even investigating the hack with relation to Trump.  It's also pretty clear the NSA could easily produce the data that proves the DNC was hacked, but have chosen not to.  Maybe they're just putting out reports based on opinion and deciding to hold off on producing the actual data to back it up.  I mean, it's not like the Intelligence Agencies have ever lied to the american people before.

       How is our pretty clear that the NSA could easily produce the data showing that the dnc was hacked? Like I said, most likely the agencies are not going to confirm or deny they have proof of anything because that is how these agencies operate. It really comes down to whether one believes the assessment or not.

       I'm going to need a little more than a, trust us.  I trust them about as much as I trust Trump, which essentially means, I need fact and proof to support a claim... And even then I'm probably still going to question it.  If it wasn't the CIA, FBI &amp; NSA lying to the american people for decades on tons of different shit, maybe it wouldn't be such a issue for me.

       Hack, hack, hack. There was no hack. Not by Russians, not by aliens. It was a leak! Seth Rich LEAKED those emails to Wikileaks and got killed for it. Even Podesta said he wanted someone punished , proof or not, to be made an example of what happens when you cross Hillary.  Anything else is bullshit

       I'm not claiming that Mueller's investigation has to do with the DNC hack.  I'm pointing out the assessment in it's own words is based off judgments that "are not intended to imply that we have proof that shows something to be fact".

       Right. Mueller is not doing his job to independently investigate and prosecute anyone for the “supposed” Russian hacks. He is also just relying on that weak document with the flimsiest conclusion that OP pointed out.
      </p>
      <p>
       The point is no crime or “meddling/interfering” exists without the hacked dnc emails given to wikileaks.
