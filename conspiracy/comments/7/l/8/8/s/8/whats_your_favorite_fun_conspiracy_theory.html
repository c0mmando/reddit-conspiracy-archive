<p>What&#39;s your favorite fun conspiracy? Like, for example, the idea that Coca-Cola secretly made New Coke bad on purpose, to drive up sales of regular Coke. Or, that Michael Jordan&#39;s &quot;retirement&quot; was actually a cover-up for his gambling addiction, which had resulted in him point-shaving. Or that Taylor Swift paid Tom Hiddleston to fake a brief relationship specifically timed to overshadow Kim Kardashian&#39;s rebuttal of Tay-Tay&#39;s lies regarding Kanye&#39;s song &quot;Famous.&quot;</p>

<p>Personally, I think my favorite might  be the idea that Alex Jones is actually Bill Hicks. The fact that he&#39;s responded to it is <em>hilarious.</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>The post is gone now, sadly, but Snopes has the text of what was said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Avril is not dead…</p>

<p>The blog was a way to show how conspiracy theories can seem real. Many people believe everything they see on the internet, but is it right? There are many conspiracy theories about many things, but some seem no more convincing than theories that are not real. Avril Lavigne never died and was replaced by a lookalike, I created this theory to see if people would believe it, and thousands of people believed it was a fact. An important point is that I created this theory with no intention of lying; all I did is offer arguments that anyone could search for information about and prove. I used information to form a real theory that is in fact unreal. I apologize to people who believed that she was dead and feel disappointed about this revelation, but this was an exercise to teach to become more skeptical cand not believe everything you see! It was never my intention to offend anyone, just to create a theory and test people’s reaction to it. You will observe I left some clues that it was all just a theory and not a fact, for example when in the beginning of the blog I referenced the “supposed death of the singer Avril Lavigne.” In other words, it is just a guess! If you want to believe that she is dead, that is your choice, but I say that it was all just a theory created by me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree, &#39;course, that all conspiracy theories are hokum, but it&#39;s pretty funny that this experiment worked so well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the earth is flat because, forget about what you were told in school it&#39;s hard to imagine a globe holding water onto it. Since we dont have any small scale experiments we can do to prove that. Also we can&#39;t see the curve, definitely not from the ground. The horizon looks flat and the word horizon is in the word horizontal. Don&#39;t forget we don&#39;t feel the spin of the globe. The stars still have the same constellations configurations the ancient cultures told us about thousands of years ago. Yet all of these stars and &quot;planets&quot; are flying through space. We don&#39;t feel it we just trust that our predecessors knew what they were doing. I mean, they must have right? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you have a tall object to look at in the horizon, then move backwards, the visibility of the taller object in the distance becomes less. The bottom portion of the tall object should start to disappear from bottom to top as distance increases. This proves there is a curvature to the ground you&#39;re standing on.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My current favorite one is that the the online FPS game Overwatch
<a href="https://playoverwatch.com">https://playoverwatch.com</a></p>

<p>has a forced 50% win/lose rate for it&#39;s competitive mode. As in the game&#39;s match maker deliberately sets up a person to lose games, to keep them at around a 50% win rate so that person can&#39;t &quot;rank up&quot; into higher tiers of player skills. </p>

<p>As a fan of conspiracy theories in general I find it fascinating to have watched this one build over  the last year or so the game has been out. It has everything you would expect in a real conspiracy but all over a BS video game. People track all their data, team data, time they play and results to try to prove it. Developer posts get misquoted or what is said is taken out of context. </p>

<p>When the devs came out and flat said it&#39;s not happening some players did classic conspiracy 101 move of just claiming that was a lie. Being the devs are in on it. Anyone who tries too hard to prove there is no 50% forced win rate is called the video game version of a shill, as in a fanboy who sees nothing wrong with the game. </p>

<p>Why artificiality keep players down? Some feel it&#39;s to sell more accounts, the only way to &quot;reset&quot; you rank. Being they claim the ranking system &quot;locks&quot; you into a given rank due to past game play and it will never, ever let a player out. No mater how much better you get the game just will not let you win games. It does this by some how finding you horrible team mates so you lose vs a team of good team mates. </p>

<p>it&#39;s everything you expect from a conspiracy. It even has the brutal truth 100% over looked in that if you hand your gutter rank account in the 500-2500 range over to a decent player who is over 3000 rank they will BUST out of the low rank like it&#39;s nothing. The same lower rank the player claims is impossible to get out of due to the conspiracy. </p>
