       thread that pops up to ask about paranormal experiences, tens of people talk about seemingly supernatural phenomena like dreaming about a loved one passing, waking up and knowing they had passed - and they actually had. There are many variations of this type of story. We mostly chalk up this type of thing to selection bias / pattern recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many other people have had ‘mystical experiences’ whether induced through psychedelic exploration or meditation practice. However, most people don't allow themselves to entertain certain ideas regarding the reality of their experience simply because the current paradigm dominating Western society simply doesn’t allow for it - for most people in the West the way we believe the Universe and reality are constructed simply precludes certain ideas and concepts from even being entertained.
      </p>
      <p>
       A basic way to think about this paradigm in dualistic terms is sometimes called left vs right brained thinking. We’ve all heard this - essentially, left-brained being logical and rational, and right-brained being intuitive/emotional, expansive, and interconnected.
      </p>
      <p>
       What if there was a ‘left-brained’ logical and rational way to understand the Universe that can seamlessly merge with these ‘right-brained’ experiences that are looked at as unimportant, unreal/imaginative, or wishful thinking?
      </p>
      <p>
       This is not to say these experiences are not sufficient for understanding on their own, but for some, integration may only happen when viewed in a framework that could physically support the conclusions gleaned through subjective experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       One thing is 100% certain - our understanding of the physical Universe is completely incomplete. Our physics has at it’s core an immediate and extremely important missing link. We all know this to be the incompatibility between relativity and quantum theory. Put simply, we cannot describe the large stuff by the small stuff that we know it to be made of.
      </p>
      <p>
       Did you know there are mainstream quantum theories that describe a Universe which is completely entangled? I.e. every piece is instantly connected to each other piece by what Albert Einstein called ‘spooky-action-at-a-distance’?
      </p>
      <p>
       What if something like this was the piece that unified these two theories? What then could we allow ourselves to learn from our consciousness experiences or intuition that defy our textbooks and our culture’s domineering paradigm?
      </p>
      <p>
       Even modern physics is showing that we live in a Universe that is intimately connected. Am I spouting woo?
      </p>
      <p>
       The vast, vast majority of our Physics revolves around the .0001% of what makes up the Universe - matter. Let’s take an atom. All we know about an atom is that there’s a tiny bit of charge in a massive region of space. In fact, the atom is 99.9999% empty space - and we study the .00001% - this tiny ‘charge’. We feel that the ‘empty space’ is insignificant - but in fact, it’s actually the dynamic that’s casting the shadow of itself into matter.
      </p>
      <p>
       Matter is a result of dynamics of space, particles aren't real, they are a phenomena of space itself - spatially extended charges.
      </p>
      <p>
       When we think of quantum fields we think of a pervasive jiggle that pervades the entire Universe. Even when something is cooled to 0k - completely still, there are still vibrations in this field - the zero point field. We can actually calculate how much jiggling would be happening when something is cooled to 0k - and we get something astounding. We get 10
       <sup>
        93
       </sup>
       grams worth of jiggling energy in a cubic centimeter of zero point empty space.
      </p>
      <p>
       Many physicists don’t take this seriously to this day - its figuratively swept under the rug and is imagined to have no physical effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       But some very real physicists have taken this value extremely seriously. One of the preeminent scientists of the 20th century, one who greatly advanced our understanding of quantum mechanics and one of the first to teach Einstein’s Relativity - John Wheeler - took it very seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
       John Wheeler imagined what this massive energy would do in empty space. He started realizing that this energy in space would cause space to curve, just like a black hole curves empty space. In fact the energy is so massive, that it creates what’s called a wormhole - it curves space so much it stretches it to having no physical distance.
      </p>
      <p>
       He imagined this as extremely turbulent and short-lived. Spacetime coordinates connecting, disconnecting, with no apparent order or rhythm - but still very much happening at the most fundamental level of the cosmos - everywhere. He called this field, space at it's most fundamental level - the seat of the most violent physics.
      </p>
      <p>
       This means that at the most basic level of reality - spacetime is not a regular three dimensional space with time causal interactions in a linear dynamic - it means that the most fundamental level of reality is both multiply connected in space and multiply connected in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       One coordinate somewhere in the Universe is connected to another coordinate that could be across the Universe - one coordinate in time could be similarly with another coordinate in time.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is the
       <em>
        mainstream
       </em>
       view of quantum foam.
      </p>
      <p>
       What researcher Nassim Haramein has done, however, is found structure to this quantum foam - structure to the empty space. It’s not random and chaotic quantum foam - it’s highly ordered and geometric quantum foam. This is what is the basis for this Unified Spacememory Network or Holographic Information Nexus in which the Universe ‘uses’ to construct form, engender awareness, and evolve into incredibly complex information networks such as the human body.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is this structured and ordered quantum foam that allows us to begin to understand the mystical experience - one wherein an observer is not separate from it's environment, in fact the observer
       <em>
        is a dynamic
       </em>
       of the environment.
      </p>
      <p>
       We live in a holofractal reality. Waking consciousness is on the surface level of things in a very physical way, but right underneath is a quantum information network that engenders a Universe that is talking to itself, evolving, growing, learning, and complexifying.
      </p>
      <p>
       As a thought experiment, try and imagine the difference between the traditional 'dead' universe made of billiard ball analogous particles that randomly bounce together enough until mankind forms. Then imagine a Universe which works as a single evolving, interconnected machine, engendered with a non-local morphic field which allows feedback to be a fundamental aspect of reality. The Universe in this perspective is always learning and sharing information non-locally. Life has to be only made
       <em>
        once
       </em>
       for it to be more easily made, through resonance, anywhere else.

       Interesting stuff. I find it amusing that modern science is basically proving (in general terms) what the ancient gurus and spiritual masters such as Buddha said thousands of years ago. There is no separation. The separation you experience is an illusion and you are the entire universe.  I think the next step in our development as a species is to find a way to combine science with spirit and eliminate the dualistic way of viewing things. I could be wrong though.

       Thank you for this post, it feels like you discribe the nature of our "reality" and i agree with your thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Before the question "why is this in conspiracy" is asked i will say: Every true conspiracy is used to keep people from finding this out and start to use the natural power we have within to create our desired "reality" instead of "theirs".

       First I'm hearing of it, but the wiki sounds right up the alley of Nassim's theory, which describes space as volume bound quantized bits of spacetime that evolve in planck time frames, and due to the entangled nature of space is both pulled from the future and pushed from the past in an ever present eternal moment.

       I wrote this a while ago with more reference towards spirituality and enlightment but maybe someone will find it interesting. its basic and just theorizing/rambling.
      </p>
      <p>
       the nucleus of an atom is actually the akasha or "nothingness" being pushed into this reality from a mental(energy/holographic) side of the dimension to the material physical side of this dimension. And the surrounding electron cloud is the energy left on this side from what was used to make that transfer. I believe depending on the amount of energy used during the transfer of energy different atomic structures are created.
I also believe that "as above so below, as below so above" that means that this should also be the case for humans and plants in some sense
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe someone will find this insight interesting
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        That's why we have auras
       </li>
       <li>
        That's why they are circular or avoid shape (our energy rotates and creates angular momentum thus bending the energy )
       </li>
       <li>
        That's why we have different bodies (maybe similar to atomic electron shells)
       </li>
       <li>
        energy needs to be spent to move an electron from one shell to another (why it's hard to move bodies) not enough energy
       </li>
       <li>
        The outside of the electron shell is the most reactive part (I'm tying it together with the physical body)
Because we can easily interact with other things, but the closer you get to the middle (the singularity) the closer we are to the akasha or "THE ALL" and if you are at that point it is when you are able to "see the light" or be enlightened
       </li>
