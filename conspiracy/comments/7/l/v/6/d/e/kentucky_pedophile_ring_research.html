       These are obviously worrying developments, another recent news item from Kentucky caught my eye -
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Kentucky State Rep. Dan Johnson dies of self-inflicted gunshot wound in Mt. Washington
       </p>
      </blockquote>

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       This guy had just been exposed by local news for some disturbing behaviour including inducing minors to drink, sexual assault on a minor, multiple lies about his history and involvement in 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some info on his background :
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        But the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting has, in a thoroughly reported account, revealed much more about Johnson, who calls himself “bishop” and “pope” in his role of the presiding minister at the Heart of Fire Church.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now 21, Maranda Richmond says she attended Johnson’s church and was a friend of his daughter. After a wild, boozy New Year’s Eve party —
        <strong>
         heavy drinking parties including juveniles appear to be a regular part of the “worship” at Heart of Fire
        </strong>
        — she stayed over with Johnson’s daughter
        <strong>
         only to wake up in the wee hours with Johnson kneeling over her. She says he kissed her, fondled her, forced his hands under her pants and penetrated her with his finger.
        </strong>

       Abuse allegations
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Danielle Elmore, now in her mid-20s,
        <strong>
         was underage when she attended some of these parties.
        </strong>
        She considered herself a regular at the church and the bar.
       </p>
       <p>
        “Yes, there’s times when it got crazy,” Elmore said. She recalls feeling uncomfortable when a boozy
        <strong>
         Johnson would sometimes kiss her and other young women on the lips.
        </strong>
       </p>
       <p>
        Elmore knew something wasn’t right. But she didn’t know that the liquor and partying would serve as a backdrop to something much more serious: alleged molestation in Pope’s House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Often, weekends meant parties at the Pope’s House. Sometimes there’d be concerts. Other times just booze and camaraderie.
        <strong>
         Some of the antics — the scantily clad women, the dancing on the bar, the body shots, the costumes — have been documented in pictures posted to Johnson’s Facebook page.
        </strong>
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       These two incidents occurred roughly around two large cities, Cincinnati and Louisville, two cities close to each other and with good transport links.
      </p>
      <p>
       I suspect there is a larger ring operating in this area, possibly within local government channels.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm posting this to try and gain some help looking for connections, cheers.

       In the car, can't research, but I live in Louisville. Very fishy stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       NPR was airing a miniseries about him when he committed suicide,  The Popes Long Con. He made a Facebook goodbye post early in the day, which was scrubbed after his suicide made the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also kind of weird, his wife is trying to replace him as state representative. Can't follow her logic there.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cincinnati is in Ohio.
      </p>
      <p>
       Sorry I can't do the research here, I'm in a vehicle, but I hope this adds to the bizarre.

        But his absence was short-lived; SGM’s board quickly restored him, over the objections of Harris and others, and SGM moved its headquarters to
        <strong>
         Louisville, Kentucky
        </strong>
        in April 2012. Since then, several churches have voted to leave SGM,including CLC and Sovereign Grace Church of Fairfax, the other church named in the lawsuit.

       He deserved a trial and a fair hearing, no doubt. I'm not saying he's guilty or innocent. But that's a lot of space dedicated to God and satan, not a lot explaining how he's be wronged.

       Something about the Dan Johnson case that jumped out at me immediately was the name of the Bullitt County sheriff who pronounced his death a suicide: Donnie Tinnell. Bev Harris, who started the anti-electronic voting movement, documented the 2006 election that brought Tinnell to power in
       <a href="http://blackboxvoting.org/docs/moonshine2.pdf">
        part 2 of her "Moonshine Elections" series
       </a>
       . Here it is, with my bolding added in.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        In the 2006 election that installed Donnie Tinnell as the new sheriff, outgoing Bullitt County Sheriff Paul Parsley was in there helping with the Election Night e-vote tallying, and Parsley's granddaughter, whom nobody can recall being on the payroll or appointed to any official position, was seen
        <strong>
         handling the poll tapes - results from each individual voting machine - which by the way didn't match up to the official results
        </strong>
        , but nobody did anything about that.
        <strong>
         Paul Parsley had already announced that the new sheriff in town was going to be Donnie Tinnell
        </strong>
        - in fact, he announced that Tinnell would be chosen by the voters some months before the election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another person getting up close and personal to the e-vote counting was Linda Tinnell, the sister-in-law of Donnie Tinnell. No one could actually view the counting of the evotes of course, other than noting that someone was doing something to computers. So here we have Donnie Tinnell running for sheriff, and we also had Donnie's cousin, Sherman Tinnell, running for mayor.
        <strong>
         Here a Tinnell, there a Tinnell, helping with the votes a Tinnell, and all the Tinnell people won
        </strong>
        , including relatives like Donnie's niece, a schoolteacher named Melanie Roberts who happened to land the most powerful position in the county. (3)
       </p>
       <p>
        The mantle was duly passed from Sheriff Parsley to new Sheriff Donnie Tinnell, who now also sits on the Bullitt County Board of Elections. (4)
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Evidently, there's a serious corruption problem in Bullitt County involving the Tinnell family. If Dan Johnson was part of a sex ring, this network of local corruption might serve as the backdrop for that ring. And if his "suicide" was actually a murder, it's not surprising that Sheriff Tinnell would quickly label it suicide.
