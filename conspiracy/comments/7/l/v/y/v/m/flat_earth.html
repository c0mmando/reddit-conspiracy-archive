I have two friends that I do not consider dumb that whole heartedly believe that the earth is flat.  Personally I find this the easiest debunk-able conspiracy out there.  Yes, I have looked into it for about 6 months and have watched every video they have sent me.  I however can’t find any of the “evidence” credible.  I’m just looking for opinions from the conspiracy world.  I have my own conspiracies but this one I can’t find any merit.</p>

<p>There are going to be people that believe it just based off of the idea that NASA and all of science are lies.

    <div class="md"><p>The only way that I could see any of it being &quot;credible&quot; is if you want to get waaay into speculation. Like, and this isn&#39;t something I&#39;m endorsing, but if there was an incorporation of simulation theory and Flat Earth I&#39;d be willing to concede some of the points they try to make.</p>

<p>This is all on the spot, but if there was an argument that we live in a simulation that is made to look like we live on a globe but we actually live on a generated plane, I&#39;d be willing to look at the points they make with that in mind. I understand the idea behind questioning everything and all that, but the only real way I&#39;d be willing to drop the evidence that the Earth is round (that you can see with your own eyes) is if there was an argument that our eyes and science is being deliberately misled by the &quot;Creator&quot;</p>

<p>As I got to know her better, I saw it was just part of her way to seem all edgy. She just wanted to be the weirdo with weird beliefs, she loved being seen that way. </p>

<p>In addition to those AR bloopers, we also have evidence that we faked all our images of earth on our journey to the moon (actually it was the day before we &quot;landed&quot; on the moon. Our most famous pictures of earth are proven to be a forgery.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you take it a step further and believe that NASA is faking gravity, then ask yourself, how do we prove gravity exists? There is no proof of any massive object forcing an attraction due to it&#39;s mass. If everything behaves according to the laws of buoyancy and density, then how do we know that gravity actually exists? That is why gravity is considered a theory - don&#39;t ever forget that.</p>

<p>Anything less dense than air floats. Anything heavier than air falls. Are objects that float not subject to gravity? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I aint talking hypotheticals, im talking logicals, how can the earth be the only that would be flat in the first place if every planet is experiencing the same force?ok pretend its not gravity, how can this mystic interaction act different just for earth?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You assume the the moon is round. But listen to all of these coincidences. The moon is a sphere that rotates at a speed a bit slower than Earth&#39;s rotation, but it matches Earth&#39;s rotation so perfectly that we do not ever see the moon rotate. You have only observed one side of the moon my friend. We are also told that the moon is farther away than the sun, but they appear the same size because although the sun is 500x farther away than the moon is, it is 500x bigger. </p>

<p>Pretty amazing coincidences. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>What I&#39;ve found is that there are explanations that make it seem like it is almost a certainty that the Earth is flat and other explanations that prove the Earth is round. I just want someone to prove mathematically with video evidence that our earth is curved. Or send me into space. That is about the only two things that will convince me. Until then I will always wonder what type of planet we live on and what the meaning of life really is about. </p>
