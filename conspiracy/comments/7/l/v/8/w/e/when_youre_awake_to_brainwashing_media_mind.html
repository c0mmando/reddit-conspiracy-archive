    <div class="md"><p>Show others the information. </p>

<p>A few links on mainstream media propaganda:</p>

<p>The Bush Administration used the &quot;Pentagon Military Analyst Program,&quot; which was a way to manipulate information on American television news. This affected Fox news, CNN, NBC, ABC, New York Times, and CBS. It also affected radio, magazines, and websites. Some outlets failed to check out their &quot;military analysts&quot; for conflicts of interest. Others that knew decided not to disclose that to their audience.</p>

<p>One analyst described it by saying “I’m an old intel guy, and I can sum all of this up, unfortunately, with one word. That is Psyops.&quot; This was exposed in 2008, but it&#39;s still news to a lot of people. See here:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/us/20generals.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/20/us/20generals.html</a></p>

<p>Here is a shorter article by Greenwald who goes into detail about how the propaganda program affected news coverage of Gitmo, and how much of the news media decided not to tell their audiences about the propaganda program when it was exposed. This is why a lot of people to this day don&#39;t even know this program existed.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.salon.com/2008/05/09/cnn_abc/">https://www.salon.com/2008/05/09/cnn_abc/</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are still a lot of examples recently  of mainstream media allowing &quot;analysts&quot; to spew propaganda without informing the audience of the analyst&#39;s connections to military contractors or the government, but here&#39;s one: <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/media_criticism/comments/6xq4bl/watch_fox_news_allow_independent_director_of/?st=j9c5gk3u&amp;amp;sh=0439ac62">Fox News allows Independent Director of General Dynamics John M. Keane to advocate for defense spending on &quot;5 ships in the House&#39;s budget,&quot; which would benefit the defense contractor General Dynamics, without disclosing his relationship to the company.</a></p>

<p>And from 2011, Michael Hastings reported: <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/another-runaway-general-army-deploys-psy-ops-on-u-s-senators-20110223">Another Runaway General: Army Deploys Psy-Ops on U.S. Senators in Afghanistan.</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. Army illegally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in &quot;psychological operations&quot; to manipulate visiting American senators into providing more troops and funding for the war, Rolling Stone has learned – and when an officer tried to stop the operation, he was railroaded by military investigators.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Operation Mockingbird: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCfTIapds0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDCfTIapds0</a></p>

<p>Before NDAA 2013, when the government pulled back restrictions on domestic consumption of US-made propaganda, they had to use private military contractors to produce the propaganda if it was determined that it could be seen in the US:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In his 2011 article “Covert Intelligence Provision in Iraq,” Segell notes that U.S. law prevented the government from using propaganda on the domestic population of the U.S. In a globalized media environment, the Iraq operations could theoretically have been seen back home, therefore “it was prudent legally for the military not to undertake all the… activities,” Segell wrote. <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/pentagon-paid-for-fake-al-qaeda-videos">http://www.thedailybeast.com/pentagon-paid-for-fake-al-qaeda-videos</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In response to Russia&#39;s manipulation of social media, the US government revamped the &quot;Global Engagement Center,&quot; which was previously being used to post comments targeting potential terrorists (to demoralize, change their minds, etc) without the accounts identifying themselves as working for the government. They use sophisticated data mining to spot targets. In my opinion, the original intention of the Global Engagement Center was obviously a pretty good idea, but as is usually the case with government programs, it was expanded. It&#39;s now being used to &quot;counter-message&quot; what they believe is Russian propaganda on social media. Here are a bunch of sources on the <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/5yuk53/information_on_the_countering_foreign_propaganda/?st=j6ppg95f&amp;amp;sh=ad715a64">&quot;Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act,&quot; a US government operation to counter Russian propaganda online,</a> which was part of the NDAA 2017.</p>

<p><a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/shills/comments/4kdq7n/astroturfing_information_megathread_revision_8/?st=j93f9ob4&amp;amp;sh=c410e77b">Here are a bunch of sources on &quot;astroturfing,&quot; or fake grass roots movements on social media.</a> Many governments are involved in this, such as Britain, Russia, the United States, China, Israel, Turkey, etc. They use accounts that seem real and submit posts and comments online. Some large corporations have been caught and fined by the FTC, but since this is technically illegal for a corporation, what we see is obviously the tip of the iceberg. </p>

<p>Even though we are kept very much in the dark about online propaganda, we can still see little bits of information that could shed some light on it. </p>

<li><p><a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/article/robot-propaganda">In 2015 we will also see the first results from initial field tests of the US IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) project to deploy propaganda bots in South America in an attempt to influence local political opinion. It is still early days -- many of the bots deployed in 2015 will be programmed to use relatively simple heuristic techniques to imitate intelligence. But, powered by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, propaganda bots will soon run on genetic algorithms that let their ideas and messaging evolve, based on the resonance and effectiveness of previous messages. We are likely to see versions of these bots deployed on US audiences as part of the 2016 presidential election campaigns, and not only by the traditionally more tech-savvy Democrats.</a></p></li>

    <div class="md"><p>I expect to get downvoted to hell and back for this one. Americans think they&#39;re special. They&#39;ve got their heads up their asses. They&#39;re so far in denial. &quot;Ohhhhhhhhh, that won&#39;t happen here!&quot; &quot;We&#39;re America, land of the FREE!&quot; </p>

<p>It bothers me that people just take this as a given. &quot;We&#39;re free, always will be free and there&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot; How many people really wonder about freedom and truly ask themselves if they&#39;re truly in a free country? </p>

<p>It&#39;s a mental gymnastic game that never ends. And I apologize if my post comes off smug sounding. I don&#39;t mean for it to be. I realize there&#39;s a lot of traps set out for people to fall through and a lot of people fall through them. To realize you&#39;re in a trap is pretty incredible in itself. Digging your way out of a trap is like being buried alive and digging yourself out of your own coffin. So in a way I can&#39;t blame people some of the time for believing the bullshit over the truth. Other times I do get frustrated that it&#39;s a repeat pattern and people still won&#39;t look and think for themselves.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I started to notice the way people think compared to the way the media words things was circa 2007 when the media started throwing the word bigot around a lot. Before then I never actually really heard the word used so much. Once the media started labeling people as bigots I noticed people started to use it to label those they deem different as a bigot. </p>

<p>I know it sounds silly but it&#39;s just a small thing among other things that caught my attention. The media pushes things and regular ignorant people who watch the news like a sitcom regurgitate it. Independent and critical thinking is gone in today&#39;s media driven world. </p>

<p>the media and deep state could literally make up stories for an agenda and have zero proof or facts that something happened. They can make false names and events happen. It&#39;s up to regular people to always be vigilant and alert about bullshit around them. Film EVERYTHING!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The doublethink is crazy. I love pointing out to people who use the word bigot that a bigot is someone who is intolerant. It doesn&#39;t say a bigot is someone who is intolerant of societally approved notions. It says a bigot, plain and simple, is someone who is intolerant of the viewpoints of another. So people who are intolerant of fags are bigots, but people who are intolerant of bigots, are also bigoted. Just like the people who say &quot;no hate&quot; have no problem hating the people they&#39;ve decided are okay to hate. No hate should mean no hate for anyone. Apparently it&#39;s a tough concept to grasp.</p>

<p>No one is an island and no large business was made by just one person. If you use US infrastructure and our educated workforce you should pay what you can towards it&#39;s maintenance and improvement. I can clearly see Trump&#39;s contempt for the law and the public good.</p>

<p>I am against most taxes. We should tax unearned wealth (investing / interest / silver spoon) far more than working. Get rid of all the nickel and dime fees in soceity, close the loopholes and make it simple. Also every taxpayer is owed an invoice or other documentation clearly explaining how <em>our</em> money is being spent.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, if you do not constantly question yourself you will most likely end up in some other layer of bullshit. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;ve noticed but conspiracy culture is a little too diverse. There are people believing all sorts of shit. So, thinking you are &quot;waken up&quot; is dangerous.
Second, if you base your attitude on that &quot;waken vs zombie&quot; dichotomy, you will trap yourself in a communication bubble and you will not be able to bring anybody out of darkness.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I personally think its because we are on the front end of an awakening. Call me crazy but there are a few who think the great awakening is occurring and I think something about our journey lead us to seeing things more so for the way they are instead of the black and white way society views things. We are all here because to some extent we are open minded, thats the problem most people have is being able to think for themselves and putting their ego aside for a second. Anyways I just think we are on the front end of a paradigm shifting wave that will inevitably wash over everything whether people wanna grasp it or not.</p>

Creating the illusion that the majority of the public has adopted a particular view/interest is nearly as effective as actually making them adopt it.<br/>
It makes people who have not adopted the view/interest feel like they&#39;re vastly outnumbered by people who have, and it keeps everyone from calling <em>fraud</em> whenever a person is elected or a law is passed that, in virtually every way, is against the best interests of all common citizens.<br/>
