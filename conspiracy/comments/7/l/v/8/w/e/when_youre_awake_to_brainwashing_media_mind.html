       Yessir, didn't even know who the guy was and suddenly I was told that I'm obligated to hate the person because I advocate further investigation in Pizzagate and similar phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
       I reviewed his actions and condemn what has been put forth. I can't vote for the guy or his opposition, but his actions are openly being discussed and he was being scrutinized accordingly. The same cannot be said for others which is why they have a spotlight of discussion, rather than allowing myself to be fervently couped into sponsored outrage against someone who is already in the spotlight.

       It’s even more disturbing when you factor in divide and conquer and see people identifying with one side of a belief and opposing those on other side.  The best way to garner 50% support for an issue that has 0 support is to politicize it, so they wash people this way.

       ouch, this hurt to read because it way too accurately describes the mindset of 90% of people i talk to.

      <p>
       the question is where does this lead?  we just go on living in a majorly propagandized society or will there be a mass awakening at some point?  surely the endless lies from the media is not sustainable in a country so set on letting freedom ring.

       Well on the other hand all their power relies on the existence of idiots. That is shaky ground for them as well, I believe we will start to see major affects due to higher number of awakened people.
      </p>
      <p>
       They rely on lies and a population of idiots, we rely on human ingenuity, spirit and truth. I`m not pessimistic about future because their entire empire is based on lies and it will inevitably collapse.

       A few links on mainstream media propaganda:
      </p>
      <p>
       The Bush Administration used the "Pentagon Military Analyst Program," which was a way to manipulate information on American television news. This affected Fox news, CNN, NBC, ABC, New York Times, and CBS. It also affected radio, magazines, and websites. Some outlets failed to check out their "military analysts" for conflicts of interest. Others that knew decided not to disclose that to their audience.
      </p>
      <p>
       One analyst described it by saying “I’m an old intel guy, and I can sum all of this up, unfortunately, with one word. That is Psyops." This was exposed in 2008, but it's still news to a lot of people. See here:

       Here is a shorter article by Greenwald who goes into detail about how the propaganda program affected news coverage of Gitmo, and how much of the news media decided not to tell their audiences about the propaganda program when it was exposed. This is why a lot of people to this day don't even know this program existed.

       I'm sure there are still a lot of examples recently  of mainstream media allowing "analysts" to spew propaganda without informing the audience of the analyst's connections to military contractors or the government, but here's one:
       <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/media_criticism/comments/6xq4bl/watch_fox_news_allow_independent_director_of/?st=j9c5gk3u&amp;amp;sh=0439ac62">
        Fox News allows Independent Director of General Dynamics John M. Keane to advocate for defense spending on "5 ships in the House's budget," which would benefit the defense contractor General Dynamics, without disclosing his relationship to the company.

       And from 2011, Michael Hastings reported:

        The U.S. Army illegally ordered a team of soldiers specializing in "psychological operations" to manipulate visiting American senators into providing more troops and funding for the war, Rolling Stone has learned – and when an officer tried to stop the operation, he was railroaded by military investigators.

       Before NDAA 2013, when the government pulled back restrictions on domestic consumption of US-made propaganda, they had to use private military contractors to produce the propaganda if it was determined that it could be seen in the US:

        In his 2011 article “Covert Intelligence Provision in Iraq,” Segell notes that U.S. law prevented the government from using propaganda on the domestic population of the U.S. In a globalized media environment, the Iraq operations could theoretically have been seen back home, therefore “it was prudent legally for the military not to undertake all the… activities,” Segell wrote.

       In response to Russia's manipulation of social media, the US government revamped the "Global Engagement Center," which was previously being used to post comments targeting potential terrorists (to demoralize, change their minds, etc) without the accounts identifying themselves as working for the government. They use sophisticated data mining to spot targets. In my opinion, the original intention of the Global Engagement Center was obviously a pretty good idea, but as is usually the case with government programs, it was expanded. It's now being used to "counter-message" what they believe is Russian propaganda on social media. Here are a bunch of sources on the

       Many governments are involved in this, such as Britain, Russia, the United States, China, Israel, Turkey, etc. They use accounts that seem real and submit posts and comments online. Some large corporations have been caught and fined by the FTC, but since this is technically illegal for a corporation, what we see is obviously the tip of the iceberg.

          In 2015 we will also see the first results from initial field tests of the US IARPA (Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity) project to deploy propaganda bots in South America in an attempt to influence local political opinion. It is still early days -- many of the bots deployed in 2015 will be programmed to use relatively simple heuristic techniques to imitate intelligence. But, powered by rapid advances in artificial intelligence, propaganda bots will soon run on genetic algorithms that let their ideas and messaging evolve, based on the resonance and effectiveness of previous messages. We are likely to see versions of these bots deployed on US audiences as part of the 2016 presidential election campaigns, and not only by the traditionally more tech-savvy Democrats.

       I expect to get downvoted to hell and back for this one. Americans think they're special. They've got their heads up their asses. They're so far in denial. "Ohhhhhhhhh, that won't happen here!" "We're America, land of the FREE!"
      </p>
      <p>
       It bothers me that people just take this as a given. "We're free, always will be free and there's nothing to worry about." How many people really wonder about freedom and truly ask themselves if they're truly in a free country?

       It's a mental gymnastic game that never ends. And I apologize if my post comes off smug sounding. I don't mean for it to be. I realize there's a lot of traps set out for people to fall through and a lot of people fall through them. To realize you're in a trap is pretty incredible in itself. Digging your way out of a trap is like being buried alive and digging yourself out of your own coffin. So in a way I can't blame people some of the time for believing the bullshit over the truth. Other times I do get frustrated that it's a repeat pattern and people still won't look and think for themselves.

       When I started to notice the way people think compared to the way the media words things was circa 2007 when the media started throwing the word bigot around a lot. Before then I never actually really heard the word used so much. Once the media started labeling people as bigots I noticed people started to use it to label those they deem different as a bigot.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know it sounds silly but it's just a small thing among other things that caught my attention. The media pushes things and regular ignorant people who watch the news like a sitcom regurgitate it. Independent and critical thinking is gone in today's media driven world.
      </p>
      <p>
       the media and deep state could literally make up stories for an agenda and have zero proof or facts that something happened. They can make false names and events happen. It's up to regular people to always be vigilant and alert about bullshit around them. Film EVERYTHING!

       The doublethink is crazy. I love pointing out to people who use the word bigot that a bigot is someone who is intolerant. It doesn't say a bigot is someone who is intolerant of societally approved notions. It says a bigot, plain and simple, is someone who is intolerant of the viewpoints of another. So people who are intolerant of fags are bigots, but people who are intolerant of bigots, are also bigoted. Just like the people who say "no hate" have no problem hating the people they've decided are okay to hate. No hate should mean no hate for anyone. Apparently it's a tough concept to grasp.

       You're playing with words, trying to be technical and clever. You seem to want to conflate racists with people that don't want to be around  shitty attitudes. So it's impossible to condemn bigotry without being a hypocrite? Give me a break. This is a false equivalence. The bully is not identical to the victim or the victim's defender.

       I don't know, I have said stuff like "I oppose all forms of bigotry" for a long time. Knee jerk insults to discredit ideas aren't cool, but there are plenty of cruel discriminatory assholes to go around. Getting shrill and sloppy won't make them go away or change their minds. If you want to be listened to, listen to them first.

       I researched during the Ferguson protests two years ago, and found that the FBI had discovered out that white supremacists were specifically infiltrating locality police departments since the 60s in a long range plan to control the black population.

       No no no. If you trust statistics you can see clear advantages for Caucasians... but also orher ethnic groups such as Asian-Americans. There are intangible social circumstances and injustices which are harder to measure. But when people want to get in an

        individual's

       face because they have a problem with a group they can be lumped in, we have a problem.

       Today I read a post about pedophile Beat icons. It was titled "Beat Writer Pedophiles and the White Male Leftists Who Love Them." Just fucking absurd. Opposing child rape has nothing to do with gender, ethnicity, or political leaning. This is our world now?

       The media and most people I knew who were panicking about it, too. It's quite revealing IMO how much of a short-lived "fad" it was. I don't mean to imply that it isn't a legitimate concern, because it is, and I don't doubt that there were people talking about it before and after the brief hype. But you've got to question the sincerity and frankly the autonomy of the people who were only talking about it when the media was and then moved on with the spotlight -- and it's alarming to me how many of my American friends that included. And it
       <em>
        really
       </em>
       shows just how powerful the media is in setting the public narrative.

       Some people actually care about helping their country, and don't like to sleaze their way through life. A tax cheat should not be writing tax code.

       In practice our money is wildly misused, but we still need to pay for basic services. Are you telling me I have to pay taxes but a multi-millionaire doesn't? What the shit. We're a country with more homes sitting empty than homeless people.

       Tax evasion is illegal and means an underfunded government. Kinda strange to have it encouraged by the top representative of the US government.

       No one is an island and no large business was made by just one person. If you use US infrastructure and our educated workforce you should pay what you can towards it's maintenance and improvement. I can clearly see Trump's contempt for the law and the public good.

       I am against most taxes. We should tax unearned wealth (investing / interest / silver spoon) far more than working. Get rid of all the nickel and dime fees in soceity, close the loopholes and make it simple. Also every taxpayer is owed an invoice or other documentation clearly explaining how
       <em>
        our
       </em>
       money is being spent.

       Tax evasion is illegal. Trump has never been accused of, charged or convicted of tax evasion.

       I actually believe most of these gilded comments that get 3,000+ up votes are actually astroturfed accounts that are used by companies pushing a narrative. I'm reading 'Manufacturing Consent' (and watched the documentary) and it has opened up my eyes on how creepy the mass mainstream media works. Factor in agencies such as NSA, DoD, FBI, CIA, DNC, RNC, and you'll find that each of these are all vying for control of the narratives.

       It's only gotten worse since MC was written. I don't trust Chomsky on everything though, he is called a gatekeeper by some. He denies 9/11 theories that aren't mainstream media or government explanations. So that's a puzzle.

       What about when you are woke but that stuff still comes out of you. A couple days ago I read the best post I have ever read by u/Tillazack . At the end of the post it mentions someone who a narrative says I should hate, an I reacted like a good part of the herd. The worst part is that I may have discouraged others from reading it.

       Fox news is absolute shit though, seriously. CNN and MSNBC are as well.
      </p>
      <p>
       But it's very dangerous to lump in shit cable television news with actual journalism like the New York Times. Is everything they say gospel? No, it isn't. Do they have an agenda? Sure, but it's nowhere near the level of cable TV. A lot of fact is still published by the NYT. Actual journalism is still alive believe it or not and abandoning it all together is something we just can't do as a society. Carefully scrutinize it, but don't dismiss it out of hand.

       First, if you do not constantly question yourself you will most likely end up in some other layer of bullshit. I don't know if you've noticed but conspiracy culture is a little too diverse. There are people believing all sorts of shit. So, thinking you are "waken up" is dangerous.
Second, if you base your attitude on that "waken vs zombie" dichotomy, you will trap yourself in a communication bubble and you will not be able to bring anybody out of darkness.

       That's the thing, we are brainwashed as well. We are just brainwashed differently than most. We are brainwashed to see conspiracy everywhere even though seeing them everywhere doesn't actually help.
      </p>
      <p>
       Being a conspiracy theorist is still a form of control. It still keeps you from being free. All your time is taken up with figuring out these puzzles but it ultimately gets you nowhere.

       I personally think its because we are on the front end of an awakening. Call me crazy but there are a few who think the great awakening is occurring and I think something about our journey lead us to seeing things more so for the way they are instead of the black and white way society views things. We are all here because to some extent we are open minded, thats the problem most people have is being able to think for themselves and putting their ego aside for a second. Anyways I just think we are on the front end of a paradigm shifting wave that will inevitably wash over everything whether people wanna grasp it or not.

       "Virtue Signaling" is the conspicuous expression of moral values done primarily with the intent of enhancing standing within a social group. The term was first used in signalling theory, to describe any behavior that could be used to signal virtue—especially piety among the religious.

       Shills &amp; human impersonation bots are more abundant than most people on this sub realize.
       <br/>
       Creating the illusion that the majority of the public has adopted a particular view/interest is nearly as effective as actually making them adopt it.
       <br/>
       It makes people who have not adopted the view/interest feel like they're vastly outnumbered by people who have, and it keeps everyone from calling
       <em>
        fraud
       </em>
       whenever a person is elected or a law is passed that, in virtually every way, is against the best interests of all common citizens.
       <br/>
       No doubt the illusion does manage to sway the dumbest amongst us; the pack followers, but there is never even remotely as many people duped/brainwashed as we're led to believe by the bots &amp; shills.

       10 years ago the media constantly fear-mongered viewers into hating muslims. Today the media goes like #notallmuslims

       10 years ago Putin was out friend. Today we are supposed to hate him.

       10 years ago conservatism was mainstream. Today it is the counter-culture according to PJW.

       You're playing with words, trying to be technical and clever. You seem to want to conflate racists with people that don't want to be around  shitty attitudes. So it's impossible to condemn bigotry without being a hypocrite? Give me a break. This is a false equivalence. The bully is not identical to the victim or the victim's defender.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bigotry is not a class or group you are born into. It's an ignorant asshole mindset.
