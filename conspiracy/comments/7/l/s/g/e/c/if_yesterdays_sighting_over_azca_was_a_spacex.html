<p>I then did a quick cross reference to see if the narrative MSM offered the public in 2015 matched the statements released concurrent with yesterday&#39;s sighting.</p>

<p>And wouldn&#39;t ya know, there&#39;s a huge difference between a rocket that installs satellites and visible air confrontation via missile launch?!!! *and is it me, or was there more than one mobile object involved?</p>

<p>*Today&#39;s 2017 explanation: <a href="https://www.livescience.com/61267-spacex-spectacular-rocket-launch-views.html">https://www.livescience.com/61267-spacex-spectacular-rocket-launch-views.html</a></p>

<p>Then again, how many civilians do you know that would point up at the sky above them and knowingly call missile launches over a heavily populated area a &quot;dazzling display&quot;??? I guess, if by dazzling the writer meant catastrophic, then yes. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me started on what air-born contaminates could be involved that are now actively settling (falling) on top of the same densely populated metropolitan areas, but I digress.</p>

<p>Actually, the 2015 launch was a test of an ICBM... the first satellites put in orbit were put there on slightly modified ICBMs.</p>

<p>The only difference between a nuclear warhead on an ICBM and a communications satellite is that nuclear warhead is put into a partial orbit rather than a full orbit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Or what about this same thing that happened in Norway, i believe if you look up Norway angel or something you&#39;ll see it. Im just saying is this an unique phenomenon only to SpaceX rockets and ICBMs? Otherwise we should&#39;ve seen these sort of formations before 2015. Also i second the concern about this being over densely populated areas. Is that protocol to launch these things over such an area and have there jettison parts fall into towns and cities? I fully accept that this was a rocket launch however i do not fully believe we told the entire truth about this. Again there are more examples of these weird after effects and everyone said they were missiles. But no one ever came forward and took responsibility for it just arm chair rocket scientists who claim &quot;nothing to see here&quot;.  We should be able to have a civil discussion about this. It is a conspiracy board.  </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy. It was announced. I was watching the livestream. It was a Space X launch.</p>

<p>There was just a 10-15 minute lag between when those who DIDN&#39;T know about it saw it, and when they learned it was the Space X launch. </p>

<p>Now: in that 10-15 minutes, many people appear to have had the idea that it was a UFO or deeper conspiracy lodged in their minds <em>so tightly</em> that learning what it ACTUALLY was, even within the hour couldn&#39;t ever dissuade them -- scary stuff. </p>

<p>Like, <em>apparently</em> all it takes is 10-15 minutes of personal uncertainty about a current event and these people are then <em>forevermore incapable</em> of learning the reality of the situation even minutes later, even when there&#39;s no actual dispute -- they just weren&#39;t aware that it was happening and got confused. That is <em>horrifying</em>, when you think about the implications.</p>

<p>Just one more thing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and is it me, or was there more than one mobile object involved?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You just clued EVERYONE into how little you know about the subject.</p>

<p>Yes, there WERE two mobile objects involved. That&#39;s true. It&#39;s also ENTIRELY expected that this would be the case.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Space X rockets have two stages. The switch to a different type of &quot;exhaust plume&quot; or whatever you want to call it was when the main booster separated (then turned around, and landed back on Earth, which was the light dot that seems to stall and then turn around in the videos), and the <em>orbital</em> booster engaged.

<p>That was the main booster slowing itself, then turning itself around. This is one of the main technological advances that Space X has made -- reusable boosters. </p>

<p>You can say &quot;I don&#39;t trust like that&quot;, but your trust has nothing to do with it. You&#39;re looking for reasons why it&#39;s a conspiracy instead of evidence of the truth. There&#39;s nothing that can jar you out of that mindset, apparently? So you&#39;re not going to figure it out, because you&#39;re stopping yourself.</p>

<p>It was certainly a Space X launch.</p>

<p>This is like, if we left a glass of water overnight outside in 25¬∞F cold, and it froze, and the next morning you got yourself convinced that someone with a superweapon made the water solid.
