       Did a quick search thru Youtube and found a grade-A specimen of a video-clip taken by some Target shoppers with their camera phone in Southern California on 11/7/15.
      </p>
      <p>
       2015 Sighting HERE:

        https://youtu.be/yu7mNmqJJ10
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       I then did a quick cross reference to see if the narrative MSM offered the public in 2015 matched the statements released concurrent with yesterday's sighting.
      </p>
      <p>
       MSM's 2015 Story HERE:

       And wouldn't ya know, there's a huge difference between a rocket that installs satellites and visible air confrontation via missile launch?!!! *and is it me, or was there more than one mobile object involved?
      </p>
      <p>
       *Today's 2017 explanation:
       <a href="https://www.livescience.com/61267-spacex-spectacular-rocket-launch-views.html">

       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Then again, how many civilians do you know that would point up at the sky above them and knowingly call missile launches over a heavily populated area a "dazzling display"??? I guess, if by dazzling the writer meant catastrophic, then yes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don't get me started on what air-born contaminates could be involved that are now actively settling (falling) on top of the same densely populated metropolitan areas, but I digress.

       But... op did google searches. he must be correct. it makes complete sense for our government to launch a missile over a heavily populated area, especially when all those rural bases in the middle of nowhere are way to busy to do it. jeez, THINK ABOUT IT AND ITLL MAKE SENSE. üóø

       Actually, the 2015 launch was a test of an ICBM... the first satellites put in orbit were put there on slightly modified ICBMs.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only difference between a nuclear warhead on an ICBM and a communications satellite is that nuclear warhead is put into a partial orbit rather than a full orbit.

       Or what about this same thing that happened in Norway, i believe if you look up Norway angel or something you'll see it. Im just saying is this an unique phenomenon only to SpaceX rockets and ICBMs? Otherwise we should've seen these sort of formations before 2015. Also i second the concern about this being over densely populated areas. Is that protocol to launch these things over such an area and have there jettison parts fall into towns and cities? I fully accept that this was a rocket launch however i do not fully believe we told the entire truth about this. Again there are more examples of these weird after effects and everyone said they were missiles. But no one ever came forward and took responsibility for it just arm chair rocket scientists who claim "nothing to see here".  We should be able to have a civil discussion about this. It is a conspiracy board.

       I am not sure what you are trying to say here, Just because the title of the post threw me off. 2015 was Military, The one in san diego a couple of nights ago was as well. Elon is behind it and he had announced it prior, it was also shot live and displayed on diff media platforms.

       Gaaaaaaaah...

      <p>
       This isn't a conspiracy. It was announced. I was watching the livestream. It was a Space X launch.
      </p>
      <p>
       There was just a 10-15 minute lag between when those who DIDN'T know about it saw it, and when they learned it was the Space X launch.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now: in that 10-15 minutes, many people appear to have had the idea that it was a UFO or deeper conspiracy lodged in their minds
       <em>
        so tightly
       </em>
       that learning what it ACTUALLY was, even within the hour couldn't ever dissuade them -- scary stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like,
       <em>
        apparently
       </em>
       all it takes is 10-15 minutes of personal uncertainty about a current event and these people are then
       <em>
        forevermore incapable
       </em>
       of learning the reality of the situation even minutes later, even when there's no actual dispute -- they just weren't aware that it was happening and got confused. That is
       <em>
        horrifying
       </em>
       , when you think about the implications.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just one more thing:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        and is it me, or was there more than one mobile object involved?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       You just clued EVERYONE into how little you know about the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes, there WERE two mobile objects involved. That's true. It's also ENTIRELY expected that this would be the case.

       I don't know. I've seen space launches before, and no doubt this one was going on at the same time, but that shit was weird. The smoke trail or whatever it was was brightest thing in the sky. And the weird pulsating light behind that cone light. I don't know. The ufo that shut down that airport in China looked a lot like this.

       Space X rockets have two stages. The switch to a different type of "exhaust plume" or whatever you want to call it was when the main booster separated (then turned around, and landed back on Earth, which was the light dot that seems to stall and then turn around in the videos), and the
       <em>
        orbital
       </em>
       booster engaged. Because of the exact time of day and atmospheric conditions, this created a very distinct and isolated

       Sounds logical but I still have my doubts. I don't trust like that. That weird spirally pulsing thing looks just like the "failed Russian missle test". I don't think anyone has ever been to "space" more than low earth orbit so I may not be the best person to try and convince, but I certainly don't know what that was.

       That was the main booster slowing itself, then turning itself around. This is one of the main technological advances that Space X has made -- reusable boosters.

       You can say "I don't trust like that", but your trust has nothing to do with it. You're looking for reasons why it's a conspiracy instead of evidence of the truth. There's nothing that can jar you out of that mindset, apparently? So you're not going to figure it out, because you're stopping yourself.

       I just don't believe in anything enough to conclude what it for sure was. But its not certainly a space x launch, its not certainly some dew, its not certainly anything to me cuz I'm not an expert. But my opinion is, I don't think they are telling us the truth. and even if there's no convincing me either way I'm not gonna be all "in your face about it" so my opinion shoudnt be taken more srs than "I dunno. Some cool shit tho."

       You're like...  The definition of someone failing to pick an internet fight. This thread began and the first thing I said was the most non side joining thing, I even made the point that I'm probally not worth talking to cuz I don't really care enough, I just never trust space shit. Yet everyone is like "What!!! That guy possibly may not believe the official narrative is 100???!!!! Rape him!"
      </p>
      <p>
       I never said what it was. Y'all assuming you know what it is, cuz you chose to believe the nassholes, is just as silly to me, as you probally think i am to you. There's no convincing me of anything on either side. I have no opinion other than "they ain't telling us the full truth" you should probally care less about my opinion if it bothers you instead of trying to change it.
