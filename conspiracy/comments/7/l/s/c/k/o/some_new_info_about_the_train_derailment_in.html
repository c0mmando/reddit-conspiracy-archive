He told me that he got into contact with old friends that still work there about it. And from what I thought about the speed being 50 mph over the limit did not pass the smell test. He said that he agreed with that and he said that you would never go over the limit be even 10 mph for safety and timing. And on a inaugural run that would never happen no way no how. Also he said that the train was a government train and that they would eventually blame Burlington Northern for it like normal. And they would never bring a trainee along on the first run because of a lack of experience.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll take a stab at it. I don&#39;t know how I really feel on the conspiracy of the accident. It&#39;s not like Amtrak accidents are a rare thing. However, look at Trump&#39;s first tweet on the incident. He was immediately pushing his infrastructure plan. What better way to gain support for a handout to the highest briber. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The AmTrak cascades are Spanish-built high speed trains capable of going up to 150 mph comfortably. That isâ€”if the tracks they ran on weren&#39;t totally shit. </p>

<p>My coworker&#39;s Father-in-Law was on that train. He was able to get out of the train unscathed. </p>

<p>The timing of the drill and the derailment sure is off-putting. However, do you have insight or ideas as to why the train would be purposefully derailed? Certain passengers onboard?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I rememeber reading a passenger&#39;s account that the train had been 0.5 hours late at the previous station. This was also where all the press and dignitaries had gotten off the train after celebrating its inaugural run.</p>

<p>Thay corner looks as though it could accommodate a speed of 45 mph max. I think 80 mph is what caused the derailment. </p>
