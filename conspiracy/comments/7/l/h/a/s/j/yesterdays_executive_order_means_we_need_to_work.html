<p>If any link can be proven, I would like to start by suing them under my states anti cyberbullying laws. </p>

<p>Not necessarily interested in winning. Just hitting them in the bank account. Lawsuits mean they hire attorneys. I don&#39;t. Dozens of lawsuits could shut them down. </p>

<p>Just one possible tactic. If a website accepts their illicit money to become complicit in the bullying of its users, would RICO laws implicate those running the website for conspiracy to perpetuate felonious activity?</p>

<p>Who knows? One way to find out. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>We have bot-busting software that is currently in development for multiple platforms (incl. Reddit). It&#39;s sole purpose is to detect bots, shills, and astroturf profiles. It&#39;s a beast that we have been working on for the past 2 years. Suing the people sponsoring is a great idea, but getting rid of the profiles these entities are operating through is an ideal first step. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Absolutely. :) However, the deeper we get into this, the more we find out how dangerous this kind of work actually is; especially when considering that a large percentage of bots, shills and astroturfing profiles are from corporations and government entities (running Persona Management Software). This makes threat modeling extremely hairy, due in no small way to the fact that these entities don&#39;t want to be shut down; it would inevitably result in a huge monetary loss, which is bound to make them angry and/or vengeful.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Since our threat model includes state actors, it has stretched the timeline and added a bunch more user stories and created technical debt, which is why it&#39;s being designed with security baked-in from the beginning, as opposed to added as an afterthought. This has to be securely designed in every way because if it is not, the project will utterly fail and the people who designed it will be at extreme risk of retribution, even though this is the right thing to do. Shills, bots and astroturfing profiles have absolutely no place in a free and open society- they dilute dialogue, cause forum sliding and prevent intelligent civil discourse on important topics that affect all of us. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>&quot;If a website accepts their illicit money to become complicit in the bullying of its users, would RICO laws implicate those running the website for conspiracy to perpetuate felonious activity?&quot;</p>

<p>This question stands out to me and I want to attempt to answer it: Based on what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s unlikely that the website owner would be complicit and if they were, it would be difficult to prove due to the level of control the owner exercises over the site itself, and the systems it runs on. </p>
