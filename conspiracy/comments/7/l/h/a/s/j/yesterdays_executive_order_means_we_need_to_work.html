       Human Rights Campaign classifies cyberbullying as a human rights violation. Shills are paid with dark money to bully.
      </p>
      <p>
       If any link can be proven, I would like to start by suing them under my states anti cyberbullying laws.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not necessarily interested in winning. Just hitting them in the bank account. Lawsuits mean they hire attorneys. I don't. Dozens of lawsuits could shut them down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just one possible tactic. If a website accepts their illicit money to become complicit in the bullying of its users, would RICO laws implicate those running the website for conspiracy to perpetuate felonious activity?

       Also, he could file a qui tam lawsuit, since RICO statutes allow for it. The gaming of political campaigns would be of particular interest to the government, because they would be able to recover damages and the OP would share a portion of whatever was recovered with the government, regardless of whether or not the government was involved with said "gaming". Money is money, period.

       It wouldn't be as difficult due to the uniqueness of the case. More than likely the OP would have fantastic luck with several attorneys offering to help pro-bono. Yes, it would be an extreme uphill battle, but one that would definitely be worth it. That "extreme uphill battle" scenario alone should not dissuade anyone from doing the right thing.

       We have bot-busting software that is currently in development for multiple platforms (incl. Reddit). It's sole purpose is to detect bots, shills, and astroturf profiles. It's a beast that we have been working on for the past 2 years. Suing the people sponsoring is a great idea, but getting rid of the profiles these entities are operating through is an ideal first step.

       Absolutely. :) However, the deeper we get into this, the more we find out how dangerous this kind of work actually is; especially when considering that a large percentage of bots, shills and astroturfing profiles are from corporations and government entities (running Persona Management Software). This makes threat modeling extremely hairy, due in no small way to the fact that these entities don't want to be shut down; it would inevitably result in a huge monetary loss, which is bound to make them angry and/or vengeful.

       Since our threat model includes state actors, it has stretched the timeline and added a bunch more user stories and created technical debt, which is why it's being designed with security baked-in from the beginning, as opposed to added as an afterthought. This has to be securely designed in every way because if it is not, the project will utterly fail and the people who designed it will be at extreme risk of retribution, even though this is the right thing to do. Shills, bots and astroturfing profiles have absolutely no place in a free and open society- they dilute dialogue, cause forum sliding and prevent intelligent civil discourse on important topics that affect all of us.

       "If a website accepts their illicit money to become complicit in the bullying of its users, would RICO laws implicate those running the website for conspiracy to perpetuate felonious activity?"
      </p>
      <p>
       This question stands out to me and I want to attempt to answer it: Based on what I've seen, it's unlikely that the website owner would be complicit and if they were, it would be difficult to prove due to the level of control the owner exercises over the site itself, and the systems it runs on.

       Also, the circumstance in your question would create a case that would definitely set a legal precedent.

       Thanks. Just ideas but it's sad that's the first thing I thought when I read the Executive Order yesterday. "Holy shit, this could apply to shills."

       I never considered it until now. 
Anyone else notice there's a severe lack of coverage on this topic?
I understand it's kept away from the bought out subreddits  but I don't see much here either.

       The topic of shills and harassment has taken place every day, nearly every hour on /new here but the posts are always asteoturfed to 50-60% ratio within an hour. Wonder why.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the executive order it's because it's a universal "good move" by Trump, the only places you will ever hear about those are outside the mainstream goulog of media and mainreddits.
