        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>If anybody is familiar with 9/11 conspiracies then you have heard about the missing 2.3 trillion dollars that Donald Rumsfeld announced days before the 9/11 attacks occurred. A theory that has floated around regarding the Pentagon attack was that people and intelligence involved with the knowledge of this missing money were targeted. </p>

<p>Fast forward to today. Earlier this year Dr. Mark Skidmore and his team discovered a whopping 21 trillion dollars in unaccountable funds used by the Department of Defense and the Department of Housing and Urban Development from the years of 1998-2015. Two weeks ago the DoD announced its first ever audit that was to be conducted by independent public accounting firms. &quot;Papers supporting Dr. Skidmore&#39;s study briefly went missing just as an audit was announced.&quot; Some more relevant information I will explain later is that the DoD must come to a new budget decision by December 22nd or face a shutdown. </p>

<p>If somehow this missing money is a continuation of the missing funds from 2001 then who is to say measures wont be taken to silence this information from getting out again? If unconfirmed esoteric history repeats itself then somebody is going to try and halt this budgeting crisis from becoming common knowledge. To achieve the destruction of this new found evidence or distract the public&#39;s eye either a large scale false flag event would have to occur or clandestine accountability measures would take place. </p>

<p>I imagine that three possible scenarios could take place in the near future. </p>

<p>Scenario 1- The web of information regarding the missing money and perhaps nefarious uses of it has already gone immutable. Too many people have shared the knowledge and it has become impossible to operate in a clandestine fashion when recovering the information. If this is the case and there are potentially unfathomable projects that the powers that be/fifth column wish to go unnoticed then a major world event would have to occur for eyes to shift focus. Possibly project bluebeam or nuclear detonation? </p>

<p>Scenario 2- The information found out has been tracked and witnesses are known. A false flag attack on pinpointed targets would have to take place to stop the information from leaking and also create new reasons for international aggression. Perhaps boogiemen like ISIS, NK, or Iran would be used as scapegoats if the Department of Defense was targeted. If Housing and Urban Development was targeted a Oklahoma City bombing-esque scenario would be a nightmare. </p>

<p>Scenario 3- The DoD faces a shutdown and 700,000 civilian workers are no longer able to go to work in two days. This provides an environment within the establishments where only Military personal are required to be stationed. A ripe environment for a sanctioned &quot;clean up&quot;. This would also cause the independent   civilian accounting firms to temporarily halt their auditing which would result in them becoming sitting ducks for targeted assassinations and information sweeps. </p>

<p>This is all speculation and I invite anyone to share relevant information in regards to this concept. </p>

<p>Some Questions to Consider
- How similar are Defense Secretaries Rumsfeld and Mattis?
- What black budget projects was this 21 million funneled into?
- What independent Accounting firms are conducting the audit?
- What happened at the Atlanta airport recently and is it connected to potential future events?
- Why are UFO articles becoming so mainstream in the past month?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>A partial disclosure will be used in order to distract the masses when the Elite&#39;s crimes against Humanity are being revealed. Possible distractions are UFOs, outright Alien contact, or the revealing of knowledge of prior advanced civilizations in the Earth&#39;s history, such as Atlantis. The anti-NWO faction is definitely winning, however, you must remember to pray.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Actually a lot of that money is used to control and fuck up Americans quite heavily. The only difference is its with chemicals, wealth acquisition, indebted slavery, propoganda. It&#39;s more of an attempt to destroy Americans souls rather than physically as is the case with the middle east. That&#39;s how they keep a population that allows them to continue to do so without revolt which would normally happen. </p>
