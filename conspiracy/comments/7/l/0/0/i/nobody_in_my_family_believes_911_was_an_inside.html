       Have them watch building 7 collapse - then ask them to explain how it fell.

       No plane hit it, and it came down at near free fall speed.

       Ya, because whenever there is a fire the entire building collapses into itself just like a controlled demolition. Why don't they just leave a cigarette in a garbage can when they want to level a building?

       Is a cigarette in a garbage can how the fire in the WTC started?  Your post provides a text book cause of a Non-Sequitur.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        This is the final report on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) investigation of the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 (WTC 7), conducted under the National Construction Safety Team Act.  This report describes how the fires that followed the impact of debris from the collapse of WTC 1 (the north tower) led to the collapse of WTC 7; an evaluation of the building evacuation and emergency response procedures; what procedures and practices were used in the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the building; and areas in current building and fire codes, standards, and practices that warrant revision.  Extensive details are found in the companion reports, NIST NCSTAR 1-9 and NIST NCSTAR 1-9A.

       I love how you can just dismiss the entire report based on your cigarette analogy.

       I find it interesting that all your post reinforce the status quo with such smug authoritativeness. You speak as if authority figures know everything and would never lie to us because they are such kind and benevolent leaders and are deserving of our utmost respect and devotion. I'm not an expert like you seem to think you are, but hundreds of

       would disagree with you. One thing strikes me, why did WTC 7 implode when WTC 6 and WTC 5 were closer to the Twin Towers and more heavily damaged by falling debris, yet,

       My posts don't reinforce the status quo.  You simply respond to what people type.  For instance, with no evidence you seem to be implying that NIST is lying to us, presumably part of a much bigger cover up.  Do you have evidence of that? To this point I have heard dozens of claims of NIST lying, nist starting with a pre determined conclusion etc, yet with all their data and models being made available
evidence of this has not been forthcoming.

       I'll repost something I posted earlier in the week with regards to AE/911 Truth

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        "We all know that truthers like to say that there are over 500 members of Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth (537 right now, to be exact). However, what truthers don't do is put this number in perspective against the number of architects and engineers overall. As someone who recently changed his major to mechanical engineering, I was just looking on the website for the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that the number of engineers in America is even larger than I'd thought.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2006 (the last year that this survey was done), there were about 1.5 million employed engineers in the United States. I did a search for architects and found that in 2006, there were about 132,000 architects employed in the United States. Sources:

        That adds up to 537 out of about 1,632,000 employed architects and engineers who support 9/11 truth, or 1 in 3,039. But wait, the key word here is EMPLOYED. If you look at the members list of the 537 provided on the website for AE911Truth, you'll find that many of them are retirees, people who once worked in architecture or engineering but left the field decades ago (like Jeff King) and professors who teach architecture or engineering. So we have to include these as well in our overall number. There's probably no way to get an exact number on any of these, but to use a conservative estimate the number would probably easily bring the total up to over 2,000,000. But wait, there's more. AE911Truth has members from countries all around the world. The 2,000,000 figure includes only those in the United States. The U.S. is 5% of the world's population, but I doubt that the number of architects and engineers is proportionate to population worldwide. Still, when we include the number of architects and engineers worldwide, using even a conservative estimate would multiply this by about 5 times, bringing the number to 10 million. Finally, we end up with 537 architects and engineers out of 10 million who support 9/11 truth, or 1 in 18,622. Truthers, still want to brag about the number of architects and engineers who support your ideas? Is 537 still an impressive number to you? "

       There is no evidence of any explosives at Ground Zero. Gage has claimed to have this evidence for 5 years, yet no one has seen it. Does that not strike you as odd? Isn't is also odd that his theory keeps changing ad hoc as it is debunked.

       Neither WTC 5 or 6 remain.  They were both damaged far beyond salvage.  They are also constructed much differently than WTC 7 (1+2), and are much smaller.

        "Five World Trade Center was a 9-story low-rise office building built in 1970-72 at New York City's World Trade Center. It suffered severe damage and partial collapse on its upper floors as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks. The entire building was demolished by January 2002 as part of the WTC removal project."

        "Six World Trade Center was the U.S. Customs House: a 537,693-square-foot (49,953-m²), 9-story building in Lower Manhattan, New York City, part of the World Trade Center. Construction finished in 1975. It was destroyed on September 11, 2001, from the collapse of 1 World Trade Center and 2 World Trade Center.

        Debris from the North tower covered the area near 6 WTC digging a deep crater into the building's basement. The building's ruins were demolished to make way for reconstruction. AMEC Construction handled the demolition,[1] in which the building was weakened and then pulled down with cables. "

       Cynice! There are two sides to any argument! Ya gotta ask yourself which one holds more water.  Now let me refer you to the architects and engineers for 9/11 truth

       "We all know that truthers like to say that there are over 500 members of Architects &amp; Engineers for 9/11 Truth (537 right now, to be exact). However, what truthers don't do is put this number in perspective against the number of architects and engineers overall. As someone who recently changed his major to mechanical engineering, I was just looking on the website for the U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics and found that the number of engineers in America is even larger than I'd thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 2006 (the last year that this survey was done), there were about 1.5 million employed engineers in the United States. I did a search for architects and found that in 2006, there were about 132,000 architects employed in the United States. Sources:

       </a>
       (architects)
      </p>
      <p>
       That adds up to 537 out of about 1,632,000 employed architects and engineers who support 9/11 truth, or 1 in 3,039. But wait, the key word here is EMPLOYED. If you look at the members list of the 537 provided on the website for AE911Truth, you'll find that many of them are retirees, people who once worked in architecture or engineering but left the field decades ago (like Jeff King) and professors who teach architecture or engineering. So we have to include these as well in our overall number. There's probably no way to get an exact number on any of these, but to use a conservative estimate the number would probably easily bring the total up to over 2,000,000. But wait, there's more. AE911Truth has members from countries all around the world. The 2,000,000 figure includes only those in the United States. The U.S. is 5% of the world's population, but I doubt that the number of architects and engineers is proportionate to population worldwide. Still, when we include the number of architects and engineers worldwide, using even a conservative estimate would multiply this by about 5 times, bringing the number to 10 million. Finally, we end up with 537 architects and engineers out of 10 million who support 9/11 truth, or 1 in 18,622. Truthers, still want to brag about the number of architects and engineers who support your ideas? Is 537 still an impressive number to you? "

       Has Jones presented any evidence for his Thermite/nano thermite thermate, or what ever he is peddling these days?
      </p>
      <p>
       There is no evidence of any explosives at Ground Zero.  Gage has claimed to have this evidence for 5 years, yet no one has seen it.  Does that not strike you as odd?  Isn't is also odd that his theory keeps changing ad hoc as it is debunked.

       What do my links have over a911? Verifiable facts and evidence.  It appears you've succumb to the argument from authority.  Instead of arguing from this perspective, look at the links, argue facts.

       Cynice, I took the liberty of reviewing your redditing. If you'd like, I can give you my Perl script that automatically detects every 9/11 truth reference posted to any forum in real-time, so you can be sure to 'inform' the internets and be a superhero.

       None of those security videos, nor any video from the Pentagon (do you

       They have been released.  None of them show anything of any significance.  Remember we are talking 2001 surveillance footage, you know the type that records a frame once per second or less, and is stored to a tape, and re written every 24 hours. Just look at the vides that have been released. Not to mention what are the odds of it/them being focused on the exact spot to catch an object moving at 500 mph?
      </p>
      <p>
       "do you really believe the seat of military power has no external video?"
      </p>
      <p>
       Like I have said before, I was at the Pentagon this summer, and there are 2 maybe 3 cameras per side.  The primary reason being there are men with machine guns at key points.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why would a building need external surveillance when there is an armed security detail, and all the entrance points to the building are monitored and guarded?  Do you really think there are years of footage of the pentagon lawn stored some where. Really to record footage (high FPS, high resolution) that you demand it would require a highly impractical amount of storage even today.  Think about the storage/hardware requirements today 2008/2009 and go back 7 years.

       Besides the superficial issues (Avery's smug and whiny narration, the soundtrack) with the LTW boys' "film", there's the major problem I had with it: it's a propaganda piece that plays fast and loose with the facts. My first exposure to LC was a clip from the first version, showing a flash as UA175 entered the south tower and alleging that the plane fired a missile "seconds" before impact. It could only be "seconds" with how they slowed down and stopped the video; even still, it was clear from looking at it, even digitally zoomed and blurry as a result, that the "flash" was the nose of the plane penetrating the outer wall of the building at full speed. Hard to imagine that a flash corresponding with that could be explained as anything but a plane entering the building at full speed.
      </p>
      <p>
       I watched the second edition, then the first edition... and noticed they were completely different save for the topic covered and the gist of their claims, with version 2 put out as though version 1 and its included theories never existed. I followed up with
       <a href="http://www.loosechangeguide.com/LooseChangeGuide.html">
        the LC2 viewer's guide.
       </a>
       Right there, every claim covered and explained, every "expert" revealed as a fraud... just in case I were to start believing it at face value, which I didn't. Any trust I would had for what they were saying went away with their rather obvious misinterpretation of the flash, then discovering they did more than one version of the same film, on the same subject, with wildly different accusations "proved" with different "evidence".

       I believe that Kennedy, MLK, Bobby Kennedy, and 911 were all done by the same group. Unfortunately they run everything and allowed us to choose Obama as the next president. It is a done deal.

       Who "replied" ... You?? ... Was that supposed to be a joke!! ... I didn't say "replied" I said "showed up" ... Big difference ... And I never said "visit my blog" mostly because I could care less ... I said "Why don't you come talk to the professionals themselves ... there's two on my blog right now" you know the professionals you should be calling cooky flakes to their faces if your such a %#@$ing know it all... Another big difference ....

       Your just an uneducated pussie who needs to tell himself he's special by talking down to people who don't know any better eromitlab(and that goes for the rest of your buddies here to) ... If you were the kind of guys who really knew what the @#$% you were talking about you would have showed up and said something!! ... But you didn't ... Did you??

       This comes from a guy who was an asshole to me FIRST ... Has a single "debunker" ever stopped for even a second to wonder if maybe, just maybe, they might pull in more members if they weren't complete goddamn fucking assholes to everyone who doesn't believe everything they say? ...

       The first guy who commented on my first post here asked me if I sucked my own cock ... You called me an idiot what six or seven times now ... again first ... Give me a @#$#ing break ... If you would have "shown up" and actually read MY BLOG, MY BLOG, MY BLOG(asshole) once and you would have seen where I had said ...
      </p>
      <p>
       "Well … are you here to learn something and teach me something in the process or would you rather sit there and laugh your ass off … I’m here to learn something … From YOU … I’m a nobody from the middle of nowhere but for what it’s worth I’m interested in what you have to say about it … REALLY …. So I would appreciate it if we could cut the bullshit and get to the point … and that goes for everyone … That’s all am trying to say …."
      </p>
      <p>
       To Trollsuck AKA "masked man" who had said ....
      </p>
      <p>
       "ha ha hah, Ah Hah Hah! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
      </p>
      <p>
       You’re an idiot JD." ...
      </p>
      <p>
       Later I went on to say ...
      </p>
      <p>
       "I’m not the one who was being a douchebag to begin with … I WAS replying … I’ve already said that I’m willing to be civil If YOU stop being a douchebag … Or is that all you and your friends there are really good at?? … I usually don’t waist my time with ANY of it because that crap can go on all day only to get us no where and quite frankly I don’t like you guys enough for that …. but it was my first time there ….."
      </p>
      <p>
       So let's @#$@ing compare apples to apples here my friend .... &gt;:(
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm willing to talk turkey if you are ... But if all you want to do is insult ... I can do that to ....

       Cynice! There are two sides to any argument! Ya gotta ask yourself which one holds more water.  Now let me refer you to the architects and engineers for 9/11 truth

      <p>
       over 560 licensed and/or degree'd architects or engineers who believe the official story of 9/11 is false.  What credibility do your links have over these guys? None.
