These nations won&#39;t give up sovereignty to the West that easily. The world will probably remain Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia... I mean the West, Russia, and China. It&#39;s possible that it&#39;ll be used to end democracy in the west but it seems way easier to let the slow creep of surveillance and social media do that slowly. At the current rate we&#39;d have something pretty dystopian by 2030-50 (think the Insta episode in Black Mirror). What&#39;s the incentive to make such a big gamble and possibly ruin everything to just save a mere few decades? </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Honestly the &quot;blue beam crowd&quot; are missing a whole lot.</p>

<p>The blue beam story has advanced from faking the second coming to alien false flag. And from its inception until today there hasn&#39;t been a single shred of evidence backing it up.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not one to say never or impossible but given its origin and historical context it seems very unlikely. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t know what you don&#39;t know. And in this case you don&#39;t know a whole lot. There&#39;s the famous Reagan quote &#39;Hurrdur I sometimes imagine how quick our differences would vanish if we were faced with an outside alien threat&#39;. There&#39;s the Kissinger quote Today, America would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order. Tomorrow they will be grateful! This is especially true if they were told that there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence. It is then that all people of the world will plead to deliver them from this evil. The one thing every man fears is the unknown. When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by the world government. There&#39;s the odd snippet of Juncker talking about &#39;our leaders from other worlds&#39; in the EU parliament. There&#39;s trillions in funds unaccounted for (went into covert projects). There&#39;s decades of alien desasterfilm propaganda, and decades of space scifi propaganda. There&#39;s the fact that science is largely a construct built on axioms established by Jesuit priests. There&#39;s the play &#39;War of the worlds&#39; which was an experiment in goy-mind control way back in the days. There&#39;s the quote by Werner von Braun about how &#39;they&#39; will use communism, then russia, then terrorists, then meteorites from space, then fake aliens in order to advance their agenda. And that&#39;s all I can think of atm...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not hearsay so much as it is repurposing the already explored technology but I do understand what you&#39;re saying. I meant only to shine a little light on the principle of holographic projection in a military application. Personally, while I remain skeptical, </p>

<p>I find the entire prospect very exciting. 
We are either lurching towards the disclosure of UFO (and potentially extraterrestrial life) or we are heading for a grand deception the likes of which humanity has never seen, and that&#39;s very interesting. </p>

<p>The best part about this particular situation is all we have to do is wait and see. Sorry if I came on strong, I just felt it inappropriate to outright dismiss something given the current number of unknowns. I&#39;m enjoying the ride and hope you are as well </p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to a military physicist given the task of looking into the hologram idea, the feasibility had been established of projecting large, three-dimensional objects that appeared to float in the air.</p>

<p>But doing so over the skies of Iraq? To project such a hologram over Baghdad on the order of several hundred feet, they calculated, would take a mirror more than a mile square in space, as well as huge projectors and power sources.</p>

<p>Blue Beam is more involved than simply a &quot;space Messiah&quot; and to discount it outright is to ignore the notion that the plan has actually been publically disclosed in part. I see little harm in entertaining the idea, true or not, as it will either come to fruition, or it won&#39;t. Now we wait and see</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This is very important, America (just using as an example and could go beyond the US) has always thrived on the notion of having an enemy to be better than. During the Cold War Russia was this enemy and it lead to basically a huge competition that can be best seen it the Space Race, very interesting how this dynamic actually seems symbiotic. Flash forward to the end of the Cold War, America enters a time where it is truly left as the worlds super power.... this is something important and it&#39;s as if we have been searching for the next adversary ever since. I&#39;ve always wondered if the invasion of Iraq was brought on by this over whelming notion that we as a nation need something to.... hate? Destroy? Manipulate? Compete?</p>

<p>I always said Blue Beam is a probably a govt op, but not how we think. I thought it was a backup plan in case of actual alien contact, to buy leaders a little time to react to the problem, while the public thinks it is a holograms or some shit.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of people talk about Project Bluebeam lately. What people need to realize is that space fakery is closely related to the possibility of Bluebeam and has indeed been laying the groundwork for it. So if someone still thinks the moon landings, Curiosity rover, and ISS (for example) are authentic, they have no business speculating about Bluebeam because they have already been duped by space hoaxes. However once you realize that space hoaxing has been going on for decades already, you will realize that China and Russia are &quot;in on it&quot; and have been working with the US and NASA to deceive. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Anyone who thinks Project Blue Beam would happen verbatim, as described by Serge Monast, is not seeing the bigger picture.</p>

<p>What Project Blue Beam needs to become is a colloquial term that pertains to a fake &quot;alien&quot; event of some magnitude.  Whether that&#39;s a discovery, purported contact event, message in radio format, invasion (highly unlikely), or mass sighting of some kind.</p>

<p>An event as described above would beg a bigger question; cui bono?  Who benefits from the event?  Globalists?  The rich?  The super-wealthy?  The masses?  Arguments could be made either way.</p>

<p>I think the fact that a private organization soliciting investment funds from the public is releasing this information.  Oh and by the way, the company releasing this information openly defines their DBA as an &quot;entertainment&quot; venture.</p>

<p>Disagree. It would be planned and orchestrated by all the superpowers and precisely coordinated. It would be the most highly planned event in history and the opposite of chaotic. </p>
