    <div class="md"><p>Fuck if I have the astrological knowledge to test this guy&#39;s theory, but shouldn&#39;t he have taken into account that the book of revelation is supposed to be a forthcoming prophecy and therefore the things told in it are going to happen and haven&#39;t already happened? As for the commercialization of Christmas. Yeah it is definitely commercialized. Christmas is just as much as a cultural holiday as it is a religious holiday. Nothing wrong with that, though. One can celebrate both aspects without getting caught up in a consumer frenzy. Finally, the Christmas tree... Christian symbol or pagan holdout?!? Both, actually. Pagans originally brought evergreen into their homes around the winter solstice to remind them of upcoming spring. Christians adopted and adapted the practice. I&#39;m going to blow your mind here, man, so brace yourself. It is almost like one religion took accepted and practiced aspects of another and then molded them into their own practices. Boom! As for Jeremiah saying not to have a Christmas tree? I dunno. Maybe one could interpret it that way. I don&#39;t see many Jewish people with Christmas trees and Jeremiah was a Jewish prophet so maybe they did interpret it in such a way. I&#39;m not Jewish, though, so, I don&#39;t really follow Jewish protocol. </p>
