       The Gregorian calendar is loosely coupled to the motion of the Earth through space, as is the Christian holiday, or Holy Day. Our days are out of sync with the universe by 4 days.

       No wonder, Xmas was based on the festivity of Sol Invictus. Even Mithra was born on the 25th. They just recycled pagan festivities and gave them a veneer of christianity.

       How exactly is it to mock Jesus? And where are you getting that Jesus was born on 9/11? Most historians and scholars think that it was most likely in the early spring around March based on the sheperds.

       How does commercial consumerism and Xmas trees (which are against the bible) go at all with what Jesus taught?

       Fuck if I have the astrological knowledge to test this guy's theory, but shouldn't he have taken into account that the book of revelation is supposed to be a forthcoming prophecy and therefore the things told in it are going to happen and haven't already happened? As for the commercialization of Christmas. Yeah it is definitely commercialized. Christmas is just as much as a cultural holiday as it is a religious holiday. Nothing wrong with that, though. One can celebrate both aspects without getting caught up in a consumer frenzy. Finally, the Christmas tree... Christian symbol or pagan holdout?!? Both, actually. Pagans originally brought evergreen into their homes around the winter solstice to remind them of upcoming spring. Christians adopted and adapted the practice. I'm going to blow your mind here, man, so brace yourself. It is almost like one religion took accepted and practiced aspects of another and then molded them into their own practices. Boom! As for Jeremiah saying not to have a Christmas tree? I dunno. Maybe one could interpret it that way. I don't see many Jewish people with Christmas trees and Jeremiah was a Jewish prophet so maybe they did interpret it in such a way. I'm not Jewish, though, so, I don't really follow Jewish protocol.

       The bible really doesn't have anything to do with Judaism, not until the scofield bible.  Jesus did not like Jews, or the Pharisee's(same people). Xmas was banned here in the states until the late 1800's.  Decorating trees is not merely pagan, there are legit bible verses saying don't bring a tree into your house and decorate it.

       if you mean what is causing al the problems, indeed money does create like 95% of all the problems.

       If you say Jews cause all the problems you are just stuck in the same jewish conspiracy thing europeans have been stuck in for centuries.  (according to you those are not even jews but Azkars)

       Not European.  It's too late for the kvetching, the jig is up.  Jews are responsible for almost all the bad shit that's been happening to this planet.  Whether it's all the wars for the Oded Yinon plan, their dominance of media and banking, their direct role in the transatlantic slave trade, the USS Liberty ,9/11, JFK being killed, Palestinians being genocided, the invasion of Europe.  All Jews behind it, so don't give me that conspiracy bullshit.  Wherever they go, they subvert their host nation.  They are truly a parasite to this earth.

       Cool story bro.  You're the one being thrown under the bus by your own "people".  Hitler was right though, he wasn't trying to genocide anyone.  How was Hitler racist?  There were Nazis from all walks of life, they just wanted Jewish supremacists to stop fucking with their countries(hello 2017 US). That holohoax BS is being destroyed now too, what other BS stories are they going to use to get sympathy?

       Nice rebuttal.  Can't discredit anything I say, just try to throw some low brow BS insult.  Typical from your kind.  With the way the worlds going, i wouldn't be so sure about your future:)

       I'm sure you masturbate thinking about giant 14 inch black cocks penetrating you 88 times. Just like your hero, Hitler. After he saw Jesse Owens dominate all his beautiful suoerior darlings, he just wouldnt shut up about that big black stud. It broke Himmler's heart. But he always was a pussy. You understand. So he blamed the Jews for the Fuhrer's craving for that delicious king-sized chocolate bar. There's no fury like a drag queen's scorn.

       You've got problems.  Whatever you fantasize about, keep it to yourself.  But speaking of Jesse Owens, you know what he said about Hitler and Nazi Germany right?

       That isn’t even secret.  I thought it was common knowledge.  That is how the church assimilated pagans; they just took existing holidays and turned them into Christian ones.

       I’m trying to understand what the lunar based Jewish colander has to do with their culture.  They have no solar based agricultural festivals that I can see, perhaps due to a pastoral based lifestyle? I’ve been looking around but I can’t find the right source for information on this.

       How exactly is it to mock Jesus? And where are you getting that Jesus was born on 9/11? Most historians and scholars think that it was most likely in the early spring around March based on the sheperds.
