       This was the Space preservation act of 2001. He also moved to ban a lot of very (and oddly) specific weaponization models in this bill. Particularly: use of land-based, sea-based, or space-based systems using radiation, electromagnetic, psychotronic, sonic, laser, or other energies directed at individual persons or targeted populations for the purpose of information war, mood management, or mind control of such persons or populations.”

       As far as traditional politics go, I don't care for most of his policies. I do think he was a good guy who strived to do the right thing, which probably has a lot to do with why he got redistricted out of congress.

       I was enthused about this bill until I really looked into it. It turns out it was written by a couple of Kucinich's friends who are big UFO enthusiasts. Kucinich claims he didn't even read it before submitting it.

       Contrails don't linger in the air the entire day and dissipate dozens of miles wide. It's very easy to distinguish between the two. Cloud seeding is something you can google and find results about it's no secret they're doing it we just don't know exactly what or why they're doing it.

       That's not the case.  I see the persisting "contrails" year round.  I live in a place with cold winters and warm summers.  You can't tell me that when I see them all the time, its actually opposing temps in the air during both seasons.

       Besides this, the sheer amount of sundogs that show up just when planes pass over my area shows that light diffraction is the goal.  Though, paired with aluminum there is nothing good about this process.
      </p>
      <p>
       Refractive indices of water vapor and the garbage in chemtrails is what gives this away.  They are different.  Light bounces through these materials differently and that is why we now suddenly see sundogs, which used to be quite rare, quite often.

       You mean halos and rainbows? IE Extremely common phenonomena. Sundogs are not halos and rainbows, but the chemtrail crowd can't seem to tell the difference. I've seen Roddie's videos. They show halos and rainbows.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at a true sundog

        here
       </a>
       . Roddie does not record these regularly. He records halos and rainbows. These are average, every day phenonmena.
      </p>
      <p>
       But step back for a second. Think realistically about the logistics that would be required. No chemtrail believer has ever been able to explain to me how this massive deception has been executed. Realistically - how would you even explain that?

       Are you speaking for me?  I'm not sure why you have to put words into my mouth here.  I understand what a halo or a rainbow is, don't insult my and other people's intelligence here.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have personally seen many, many sundogs and have them on camera and on video that result from trailing left over my city.  They are not a rare thing any longer.
      </p>
      <p>
       I specifically have the rainbow effect captured coming through only a trail left by a plane and not through any other cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
       <a href="https://imgur.com/a/V5HDX">
        Here is an example, not mine own but I'm sure you can see what I'm talking about here.
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       Before you go putting more words into my mouth, I understand that example is not of an entire "sundog".  I don't have my personal pictures up just yet.  I have many that show a full sundog around the sun coming through trails specifically.  This example is part of the same effect but the trail is clearly refracting light as you can tell.
      </p>
      <p>
       Patrick Roddie is not just taking about rainbows, btw.  Again, almost speaking for him and telling us that what he's is capturing is actually something as mundane as a rainbow.  Give me a break.

       Sundogs are naturally ocurring. Taking photos of them doesn't mean ANYTHING. How do you not get that?
      </p>
      <p>
       My point was that sundogs are not super common, so when a guy has a video of 20 sundogs and almost all of them are NOT ACTUALLY SUNDOGS you have to question his motives.

       Well, then you might want to do more research because that's exactly what they are doing. Albeit, not so much chemicals, as it is particulate metals, such as aluminum, barium, strontium, and other metals that pollute the environment, our air, water, and soil.

       You can as easily explain the presence of these metals from other sources - manufacturing, pollution. You know things we can point at and say "Hey! That's really bad pollution!"
      </p>
      <p>
       By obsessing over chemtrails, you're actually losing touch with REAL environmental concerns. Heavy metal particulates in soil/water are not good...how are they getting there? Probably a polluter in your area. Deal with those polluters! Stop blaming the government for things when the actual polluters are right in front of you...mostly companies that manufacture goods.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean you have actual pesticides being sprayed all over crops...maybe you should look closer at those rather than this insane theory that the GOVERNMENT is plotting against you.

       I think you missed my point. Geo-engineering as a whole is going on. The metals they are spraying allow them to influence weather. This is happening, and your post is trying to downplay this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have multiple military whistleblowers that have come forth documenting these facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Yes heavy metal pollution is terrible. But I'm not going to divert my eyes from geo engineering just because other people are polluting our environment too.
      </p>
      <p>
       All the environmental concerns should be taken into account.
      </p>
      <p>
       And geo-engineering is one of these concerns that need to be looked at more closely and it's affects on the environment. Not something that should be brushed off.

       What evidence do you have? Almost all theoretical papers on geoengineering are just that, theoretical. Most attempts to control the weather have been abject failures. Yes contrails change the temperature of the below them, but that is the closest thing you can point to and call it "geoengineering"

       There just isn't any credible proof. Contrails are natural phenomena, so that's gone. No one has ever been able to show the spraying mechanism, or uncover any documentation of what would be the worlds biggest logistics program (and one that has run for over a decade). People whose records are not verifiable, their job descriptions completely unrelated, or just general kookiness or willingness to be a "sacrificial lamb" to further some crackpot theory and get semi-celeb status with some whackos on forums do not count as "military whistleblowers"

       The goal of "chemtrails" aka geo-engineering is a multi faceted program designed to not only "suppress" the Suns rays from hitting earth but also as a tool to help control weather patterns. Even cloud seeding alone can be used to bring rain to crops and even during the Vietnam war it was tossed around as a potential idea to make it harder for enemy troops etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are many articles, papers, videos, testimony, on the subject it's really not hard to arrive to these conclusions.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some of the better research done is in the documentary "what in the world are they spraying" and provides the answers to all of your questions

       Politics suck like that. Honestly it seems like Harry Reid was doing something shady with aliens as an excuse. I would like to believe otherwise but he seems slimey anyway

       Look into "Operation Fortitude". The reveal with Harry Reid to me just looks like a "pseudo secret" department they created to hide the real work and which can be used to satisfy the public political front at best.

       Reid's program was likely some sort of slush-fund/tax write-off, some other easy way to hide funds.
