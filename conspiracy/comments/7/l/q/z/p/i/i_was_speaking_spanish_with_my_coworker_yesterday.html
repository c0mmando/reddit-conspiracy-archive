<p>Before the new blade runner movie was coming out, I never was interested in it. I didn&#39;t look anything up about it once, had no idea of its release date, didn&#39;t care who was staring in it.</p>

<p>Well, my colleague at work brought up that it came out and asked if I was interested in it. My general response was I thought they were going to &quot;Total Recall&quot; it and I was not interested. Later that day I got a pop up alert on my phone with show times for Blade Runner. This was like the first pop up I got in months. </p>
