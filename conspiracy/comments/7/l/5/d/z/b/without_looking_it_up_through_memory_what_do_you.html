       Don't forget that the very back seat was designed so it could be raised roughly six inches or so to make it easier for the person in the back to be seen.

       Yes, the whole bench lifted up. However, looks like still 7 seats. 1 bench fits 3, so 3 on bench + 2 in middle row + 2 in front = 7. So EVERYONE is wrong! YAY!
      </p>
      <p>
       I personally recalled 2 rows, 1 bench in front, one in back. Could be an interesting idea to throw at r/MandelaEffect, if nothing else.

       You're not far off.  Normally, the car would only have two bench rows.  However, a pair of jump seats could be placed in the floor in front of the rear bench, giving a total of eight, not seven.  Three in front, two in the removable jump seats, three in back.

       In theory, then, you could replace the driver seat with a bench, the middle with a bench, and the back as a bench making it a 9 seater, right?

       In theory, yes.  The limousine in question was designed to be customized depending on the need of the person inside it. When Ford created the idea behind the limo (The car was a Lincoln type, which there's kinda some irony there if you consider what happened to Abraham Lincoln) wanted to offer people who bought it a number of options.  Like you noted, you could put a bench in the middle, the two jump seats, or nothing.  I believe that if you had the middle  bench in place, then the bench would face the rear of the vehicle.

       In my brain it is two front seats and then two big bench seats, so it would be a 6 seater I guess... But I played a bit of JFK Reloaded so I might have been brainwashed by that.

       The back seat would have had room for 3 as it was a bench, the front seats were buckets...so as I recall, neither. It was a 5-seater.

       I remember 2 rows of seats, as well. We are wrong. There were 3 rows. JFK and Jackie in the back. Texas Governor &amp; wife in the middle. And I'm guessing Secret Service (two men) in the front.

       Six. It was a limousine convertible. It’s not a Mandela effect, people just have bad memories.

       It also had a pair of removable jump seats which could be placed on the floor in front of the rear bench seat.  Kennedy, in the few times he used the car, tended to have these removed so he could stand in the floor and be seen better.  On the day of the assassination, however, the two jump seats were present, with the one on the right occupied by Governor John Connally, and the left by his wife Nellie Connally.
      </p>
      <p>
       Due to these being removable jump seats,  the connallys were effectively sitting right on the floor, while Kennedy was raised a good six to seven inches higher in the back.  (The rear bench seat raised and lowered, to make the president more visible. Kennedy preferred it raised, so he could be seen by everyone; while Johnson tended to keep the seat lowered as much as possible due to his height (among other reasons))

       I didn't look it up but might it not have been a 5 seater? 2 in the front and a "bench" in the back? Or isn't there a theory that someone in the car shot him. That may mean it was a 6 seater.

       6 seater. There is a picture of a white convertible from the funeral that is a 4-seater. It was a prominent headline photo.
