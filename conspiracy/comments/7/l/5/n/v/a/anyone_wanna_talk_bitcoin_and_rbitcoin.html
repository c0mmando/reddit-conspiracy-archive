    <div class="md"><p>So there is no scaling plan. Saying it will scale as needed is the same as saying we’ll worry about it later. Doesn’t seem like a convincing reason to support a coin that has no obvious advantage over Bitcoin. In fact, I think BCH is the result of the desperate attempts of a small group of elites to gain control over a space that’s meant to be decentralized. The entire economy of BCH is controlled by a centralized group, which probably includes Coinbase now as well. That’s the real conspiracy. </p>

<p>If they spam 100000 transactions with 0.3$ fee, and .01$ value,</p>

<p>they fill the mempool, and they make everyone else use higher transactions.</p>

<p>And they can push the fees a littler higher, because the biggest mining pool, is owned by who? JiHan...yea, Bcash advocate...so they get the fees back, when they mine the blocks. not to mention the bigger fees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Blockstream propaganda again.</p>

<p>$0.3 fee for a single input transaction is A LOT and most (~80%) of these fees would get collected by other pools. Nice way to go bankrupt quickly. $0.005 (half of a cent) fees for Bitcoin (Cash) work very well and nobody considers such transactions &quot;spam&quot; on Bitcoin (Cash) network. That&#39;s compared to $30-50 BCore fees (for a single transaction!). Even Satoshi Nakamoto originally intended to allow some transactions to be processed without any fees at all. Fees were always meant to be very low in the original Bitcoin protocol, exactly like it is now in Bitcoin (Cash).</p>

<p>1MB cap on block size is something BCore came up with to be able to introduce sidechains so that Blockstream can profit from this.</p>

<p>Your &quot;transaction spam&quot; narrative is so fake that even BCore lead dev Greg Maxwell disagrees with you:</p>

<p><a href="https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-December/015455.html">https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/bitcoin-dev/2017-December/015455.html</a></p>

<p>He says he&#39;s &quot;pulling out the champagne&quot; because of the current fee situation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And they can push the fees a littler higher, because the biggest mining pool, is owned by who?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re lying again. Yes, AntPool is one of the biggest pools but it mines only ~18% of BCore blocks:</p>

<p><a href="https://coin.dance/blocks/thisweek">https://coin.dance/blocks/thisweek</a></p>

<p>This means ~80% of transaction fees would go to other miners and that&#39;s just economically unfeasible nor there is a reason to do that.</p>

<p>By the way, even if &quot;transaction spam&quot; propaganda was true, all that basically says is that your protocol is shit if it can be manipulated that easily. Note that Bitcoin (Cash) is immune to that.</p>

<p>BCore is basically dead (merchants are dropping support) and Bitcoin (Cash) is here to stay. Deal with it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Market manipulation ? Is this a joke?</p>

<p>Are you just trying to save face or something?</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m gonna get downvoted for this, but here it goes, my experience as a long term bitcoiner:</p>

<p>1) Bans on r/bitcoin? Yes. A lot. Most of them well deserved. You need to understand, a sub, is made for a specific topic. If I enter your house and start telling you that you are stupid, while shiting on your carpet, will you not kick me out? Yea.</p>

<p>2) All the talk about market manipulation, is related to the latest event, of Coinbase implementing Bcash sell/buy , and RogerVer going to cnbc and prmote his coin. When Coinbase &quot;pumped&quot; up the price to 9k $ while all other exchanges were 3.5k tops, and people started to massive sell, they closed the ability to sell. </p>

<p>3)Bcash has low fees now because nobody is using it. There are no vendors accepting it. Just increasing the blocksize, is not a solution. It&#39;s simple math. To have global scalability you would need huge blocks.</p>

<p>4) I&#39;ve really tried to be inpartial, and sometimes visit r/btc, but ALL they do, 9/10 posts just try to shit on Bitcoin , no real news about their coin or anything whatsoever.</p>

<p>5) r/bitcoin is not any better, my personal opinion, cause lots of newcomers, and all they talk about is their gains/should have bought sooner/How to wallet. All without even checking the stickies. </p>

<p>To end this message, There are tons of people coming everyday spamming the sub with stupid things, Imo, they deserve to be banned.  And if you stay there a while, you will see that there are a lot of negative posts, that reach hot in there, where people actually engage in conversations and whatnot. If you place a pertinet question, you don&#39;t get banned, but if you come with this kind of accusations. yea...diffrent story</p>

    <div class="md"><p>First, &quot;bcash&quot; is a term only used by scammers. Proper name is Bitcoin Cash.</p>

<p>There are 285000 unconfirmed transactions in the Bitcoin Core mempool:</p>

<p><a href="https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions">https://blockchain.info/unconfirmed-transactions</a></p>

<p>Each Bitcoin Core block every ~10 mins contains ~$160000.00 worth of transactions. If you think that&#39;s spam then I&#39;m sorry but you&#39;ve been brainwashed by Blockstream propaganda.</p>

<p>The future for Bitcoin Core is not looking good.</p>
