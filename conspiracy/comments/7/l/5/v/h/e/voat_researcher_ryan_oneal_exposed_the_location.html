       Here is the original video/post that Ryan Posted. It's my understanding that many of you have yet to see this, so I figured it would be a good idea to post this first for context.
       <strong>
        Go to 7:20 if you simply can't be bothered with the rest of the video. The front of the row of buldings near property (google earth view), is spraypainted "Kids" with an arrow pointing down.

       Now, here is Ryan's (one of the most active and respected users on Voat), account of the events that transpired AFTER James found out about the post linking to his Pegasus Museum property.

       "I will kill your wife, your son, your mom, and I will sue your dead body" - a paraphrase of what JA said to Ryan IF didn't remove the post.

      <hr/>
      <p>
       How many innocent people do you know, who would flip out and threaten to kill somebody who exposed one of their properties? Was James Alefantis up to something nefarious?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, Ryan filed a police report after this threat.

       Yeah, I don't buy this at all. It's not even in the public eye. It makes 0 sense. It does make sense however, to attack it now while information about aliens is being quietly disclosed whilst slipping John Podesta's emails in to cover him with the alien story and keep beating the drum that Pizzagate is a hyperbolic conjecture when its not. There's evidence for it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please, I'm asking you to show me how public pizzagate it is right now. Since according to you that's what triggered you to come here. What you're saying doesn't even make sense Jane Doe.

      <p>
       What witch hunts have carried over in to the real world? The shooter than went there was a hoax flat out, the guy even had an IMBD profile. You're saying you've all been here... but you're waiting for this to spill in to the real world. So I'm back at what I said, pizzagate is not a public issue. The claim being made that you're here as a reaction to it affecting the real world doesn't make sense to me. Since the brave defenders of John Podesta only showed up after users point out that his emails have a lot more than a few mentions of UFOs.

       These people are relentless in their absolute ignorance and refuse to do anything except complain that more thoughtful people don’t read the garbage from Russian media outlets they so frequently source and see it as scripture.

       Feel bad for them as they are victims of gaslighting, their weak minds have easily succumb to mind control and only they have the power to find the way out. We do nothing but feed their fragile egos.

       You spent an awful lot of time attacking something you think is so logically false. Whats the point here, you aren't going to change the minds of people who have seen that it's true. You're calling Pizzagate mind control? It's not even in the public realm, I'm sure you understand what mind control is right? It's being able to get someone to believe something so concretely that they do not question the official narrative and attack all others.
      </p>
      <p>
       Pizzagate is the narrative being attacked the fact that fake news was coined for it should tell you how dangerous sifting through that information is. The term fake news was created to discredit this theory. Now you see, what many of us that believe and follow this theory have a huge problem with is that it's never been officially investigated. Except the DC Police Department that investigated nothing, claimed it was fake based on their initial decision that it was nothing. Despite gigabytes upon gigabytes of online evidence that warrants a further look, nothing was ever done.
      </p>
      <p>
       So not only was this issue silenced by mislabeling it in the media, it was not investigated officially at all and any time this subject has been mentioned anywhere publicly outside of the massive shill effort by Megyn Kelly and Alex Jones its destroyed and ridiculed. This issue has never been in the public eye remember, despite the mounds of sound online evidence, despite the gigabytes of information collected, despite the fact that missing children dissapear in the area outside DC at a rate alarmingly higher than the rest of the country, despite claims from Haitian's that Hillary Clinton stole entire villages and ran an organ harvesting operation nothing has been done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then we come here, to Reddit and other online forums and once the issue reaches peak visibility the sub reddit is nuked due to doxxing. Fine, get rid of the sub. Then when the issue is posted here it is also visibly attacked to the point that they effectively disperse any conversation that would draw in the "normies" to sites like voat, 4chan and 8chan. On voat the site is regularly attacked, 4chan constant army of bots nukes the issue there too and I don't visit 8chan except CBTS because even 4chan is a risk click.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now, seemingly out of nowhere, the issue is being assaulted anytime you are reminded that John Podesta's name is not synonymous with aliens or disclosure instead it is synonymous with vicious child molestation under the name of Skippy.
      </p>
      <p>
       The very best part of this my friend, is that since I hold the truth and I know that I do there isn't anything you can do to stop it from spreading.

       Sounds like the gigabytes of evidence you have is probably child pornography.
      </p>
      <p>
       DO NOT CLICK THERE LINKS, all links they post are either pedo education, child porn which will control your mind instantly, or gaslighting videos that will capture you within 30 seconds with a huge lie that leaves you unable to tell truth from reality.
      </p>
      <p>
       You will not get away with covering your tracks in this manner, they type in circles about "evidence"
      </p>
      <p>
       These pizzagate investigators are the ultimate form and pedo educators and only seeks to recruits more into their ranks! Be careful!
      </p>
      <p>
       A fox affiliate once showed a segment regarding pizzagate, in this he literally taught the pedo language and showed symbols for the pedos to look for, this is real. Large pedophiles movements are happening online and it's because of posters like this and we must stop the cycle!

       The links are all to Voat and the State Department website.
      </p>
      <p>
       We do not type in circles called evidence, all the evidence was pulled from instagram, facebook, their own public websites as well as publicly available information.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's funny that you believe the people trying to stop it by raising awareness are the one perpetuating it. This shifting focus tactic is recognizable and in line with the "fake news" tactic. By your logic, everyone here is also promoting terrorism by talking about 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here's a video by Ben Swann, shown live, legally since none of the information shown anywhere is child pornography. I don't store any of this information on my PC myself, since it's all publicly available online. That charge is ludicrous.

       You people are creating a false flag when in fact the pedos live in your neighborhoods and seek the information you post, it allows them access and you continue to not see what is right in front of you.
      </p>
      <p>
       Look at your neighbors, pedophiles are there and you help them get what they want and it's actually sick. Most new pedophiles will never be caught because of the pathways you people have created in your fake investigation

       Baselessly deferring to someone being a Trump supporter when nothing has indicated this, and further when this is the polar opposite of the truth, altogether has to be one of the most tell-tale signs of a lost argument these days in this sub.

       Wrong.  Trump co-opted the term "fake news" after corrupt CNN coined the term in reference to the Wikileaks regarding Hillary and Podesta emails.  Any thread about Alefantis has people like you come out of the woodwork every time without fail.  We all know he's a pedophile and involved in very dark things.

       Your efforts to derail the topic only make people more sure that pizzagate is real.  There is a mountain of evidence that Comet Ping Pong and Besta Pizza were involved in child trafficking for DC elite.

       If this is truly your post, you should take that which you have clearly seen as evidence of endangerment of a child and report it to the authorities. Unless you don’t even believe it yourself?

       I refuse to watch this as pizzagate once caught me in it absolute mind control, and once you believe the initial lies of pizzagate it then becomes easier to accept more of it lies that will cause you try and destroy the lives of other people. Everything else in your life is questionable but you can always find truth in Pizzagate.

       Seriously, don’t just DO NOTHING, if you think a kid is in danger the do the right thing otherwise stop spewing ignorance and hate. These people you claim to be evil are actual victims of this web you help to weave.

       Forgive me, but this just comes off as you trying to control the minds of the viewers and lurkers, and discourage them for even looking into the information before they get a chance to.

       I've told you 3 times now, the pizza place in under investigation, Ryan reported this to the police, and CPP's child porn found on their password protected server has also been reported.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe law enforcement sometimes protects powerful DC elites? Or is that too much of a pill for you to swallow...I mean, this is r/conspiracy after all.

       You actually believe yourself which is very sad, I saw someone said Ryan may not have filed a report. I think you should look to your morals and ask if you should take a positive action that may save a child.... you are claiming this is a “kill” room. I am from the DC area and work in the city, this is a proud city of color and local authorities are not afraid to stand up for justice unlike you. That is a pathetic argument honestly lol, tell me again how I should succumb to your fear mongering while you continue to post your how-to guide pedophiles to communicate in code

       You're clearly not from here or live in Georgetown because most of the cities employees are local, this city has reduced crime and helps to promote trust in the neighborhoods the serve. Mayor bowser is very responsive and holds investigative power from here office, why not let her know about the missing children?

       See, you do all accuse him of satanic pedophaelia and child murder. Someone else here tried to claim you guys don't accuse him of that, only "look at his instagram" and connect dots or whatever.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for the "evidence", I should have specified. I mean "direct evidence". You have none. Zero. Nil. All of the "evidence" you pizzagaters have "found" is what's called "circumstantial evidence", and it alone does not at all hold up in court. The only way your "evidence" points to ritualistic child sacrifice is if you assume A LOT. And that's not how legitimate investigations go

       There is no need for investigation if there is no evidence of criminal activity. In this case, literally the only "evidence" you have is that he's "weird." That's not even close to enough to warrant an investigation.

       If you were able to read you'd see the "". Weird is artwork of bent children and children in cages. Weird is instagram picture with commented insinuating trafficking and pedophilia. Weird is events organized by
       <em>
        weird
       </em>
       people saying things like "after all, we all have our
       <em>
        preferences
       </em>
       here". Weird is one guy shooting exactly the HD and saying he was wrong after it. Weird is email with coded words (which due to the circumstances you can imagine what the code is for).

       Understand this is speculation, but all of this information that amazing people have researched and pulled together, paint a very disturbing picture(no pun intended).  I still don’t know what a “handkerchief with a map on it that seems pizza related”means? John Podesta is quick to call Pedogate bullshit while never explaining the leaked emails(which were verified 100% by wikileaks).

       I didn't bring up his behavior, the OP did. Look down towards the bottom of the original post, were it begins "How many innocent people do you know..." and then proceeds to link his behavior with guilt. It's right there, I assume you read it right? Where he talks about his behavior and how it must mean he's guilty? Right?

       so what?  you made a statement implying he was innocent because of his reactions.  the same reactions a guilty person would have if they were trying to cover up their crime.

       In hindsight, "lie" was way too harsh a term, and I apologize. I wrongfully read your comments as being in agreement with OP that the behavior points to guilt. I think you were playing devils advocate, and I didn't quite get that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Anyway, I didn't bring up the behavior-guilt/innocence link, the OP did. He finished his post by asking r/conspiracy, basically, "do you think this is the behavior of an innocent man?" And I replied that yes, it could be. So I don't have any flawed logic, I'm playing devils advocate to the OP. You've made it sound like pointing out logical flaws in the OP is itself a logical flaw, which makes me think you're misunderstanding the situation too

       And where's the evidence he didn't make it up? All we have is this guy claiming Alefantis threatened him and that he was really scared as a result. So scared he went straight onto Youtube to make a new video about it.

       If he made it up, why isn't James Alefantis suing him? You can easily sue somebody for false allegations.

       He provided screenshot evidence, and another user here yesterday confirmed that was Infact his phone number.

       Depends what the lies are. President Johnson said he wanted to accuse his opponents of having sex with animals. Didn't matter of it was true or not.  Said he wanted to see them disprove it.  Sometimes disproving some bad shit just put terrible publicity on you.  Most defamation of character or slander cases only spotlight the exact shit you don't want people to believe.  A good lawyer would tell you to hold off unless it is really fucking you up.

       Screenshots can be easily faked and I doubt it was hard to find his phone number.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ryan says he reported it to the police but again, you're just accepting his word.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why Alefantis hasn't sued, suing costs a lot of money. And a judge or jury may look at O'Neill's videos and decide that, because he's just pushing an outlandish conpaircy theory, Alefantis's reputation has not been seriosuly damaged. (In that most people know pizzaagte is rubbish.) And so, he might not get awarded much. Also, there's the Streisand effect to consider.
      </p>
      <p>
       In short, just because someone doesn't get sued does not mean they're telling the truth.

       The conspiracy itself is that there's a big sex trafficking ring that's connected with the government. Alefantis is one of their suppliers in the chain, allegedly.
      </p>
      <p>
       It exists in the Catholic Church, it existed in the British government and still does yet is covered up. We know Dennis Hastert the former speaker of the house, and Jeff Epstein, the list goes on. There are legit concerns and it makes sense that these are covered up.
      </p>
      <p>
       So forgive me when I find it fishy when there is not even a formal investigation into some very nefarious shit related to comet ping pong and pedo bands and pedo imagery on the Instagram, it was right out in the open.

       Of course I've seen the Intsagram pictures. I've been following the pizzagate claims for over a year now and I've read a lot of the claims (probably no one could keep up with them all). I kept reading the posts on voat after the sub here got banned. And I've still to see anything credible.
      </p>
      <p>
       As for why I'm in this sub, it's because its goals are "a fairer, more transparent world and a better future for everyone". You don't get that by throwing baseless accusations around.

       There was never even an investigation. How about the guy who called the DC PD and they said the investigation was closed but the guy looked into it and there was never one done.
      </p>
      <p>
       Could the Pedosta emails and the creepy art in the Pedosta house, and then being friends with convicted pedophile Dennis Hastert, and James alefantis Instagram and the Comet ping pong art and creepy tied up kids pics --- these could all be totally a coincidence. But it also couldn't be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Believers in pizzagate want a real investigation and it makes it very peculiar when this is shut down prematurely without even looking into it, much like the Catholic Church sex scandals until one day it pops.
      </p>
      <p>
       So I find your concern naive.

       No, they didn't say the investigation was closed. A media officer replied to an email from YouTuber Brian Rich saying there was no "ongoing investigation regarding those false allegations headquartered at the comet ping pong restaurant". Rich then asked them how they could determine they were false if they hadn't investigated them. A media officer replied "After investigating those claims, we have determined those allegations to be false." So, Rich filed an FOIA request for the investigation reports and an FOIA officer said they didn't conduct an investigation. So, yes, you could justifiably claim that a DC media officer lied about an investigation being conducted or you could also justifiably claim that a media officer just used "investigating" when they should have used "reading". After all, the police deal with real child abuse and they don't have to conduct a formal investigation into pizzagate to see that it's bogus – they just have to spend an hour reading the "evidence" to see that it's baseless.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Podesta emails are utterly unremarkable. I bet if you gave me access to thousands of your emails I could find words that I could replace with terms like "little boy" or "little girl" and then claim that proves you're a child abuser. That's what was done with Podesta's emails.
      </p>
      <p>
       Tony Podesta didn't say he was friends with Hastert, he said he had kept in touch with him (and this was before the accusations of abuse were made public). And of course he would have kept in touch – Podesta was a political lobbyist and Hastert was a major political figure. He wouldn't have been much of a lobbyist if he didn't utilise his contacts. [Edit added:] And what about Donald Trump saying Epstein was a "terrific guy" and "a lot of fun to be with"? Why do pizzagaters make so much of Podesta keeping in contact with Hastert but deny that Trump knowing Epstein means anything?
      </p>
      <p>
       James Alefantis's Instagram shows no criminal activity at all. There are no "tied up kids pics" – there is one picture of a happy looking, healthy looking child with her hands taped to a table.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Believers in pizzagate want a real investigation

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       So go to the police of FBI and make a complaint. Have you done this? If not, why not?
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm okay with you finding my concern naive. I find those who believe in pizzagate gullible.

       pizzagate is real and is bigger than we can see. If you go to youtube and search :sasha lord you will find a video of a girl who is the woman in charge of chosing the bands that play at comet ping pong, the woman looks like an actress who is reading a script,she even mentions that she worked for the girl scouts,orphanges and stuff like that. It really looks like a very fake video. It remind me of the video of Laura Silsby talking about that she was trying to help those kids in Haiti, what a lie... that woman was busted by trafficking kids in Haiti. There are videos of people in Haiti who protest against the Clinton fundation because they kidnapp the kids.. those videos are in another language are from local news and obviously have a low ranking of views.
      </p>
      <p>
       Comet ping pong and those clinton orphange charities are defintely related.. what about the doctor who was murder that worked for one of clinton charities? what about chris cornell and chester benigton ?they were also conected with the clintons charities.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to be very skeptical about murder conspirancies but I think that there is something fishy out there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I read the reviews about people that went to comet ping pong and a vast majority of people talks about the weird atmosphere in there,not a kids friendly place at all. People also mention how rude the waiter stuff is and that the place its always full of kids ith no parents around.The posters on the website of the restaurant that promote the bands are so weird.... look like a pattern for something if you pay close attention.
To me this restaurant probally is a cover of something pedo related for sure, maybe it is a place that it is used to blackmail important rich pedo people. Sorry,English is not my first language ...

       ps: I tried to post this message in a couple of pizzagate subs but what I wrote it dissapear( twice).

       If that is the case then you should report it, if only to protect those who cannot protect themselves. By knowing this info exists, knowing where to find it, and not saying anything because you chose to bury your head in the sand is 100% on you. It's unfortunate you wouldn't report dangerous material due to your own hangup and fear of actually doing the right thing.

       Sure, if you think others would be willing to report it if it contains material that is dangerous. And yes, spreading pedo messages is a danger to those who cannot protect themselves. Namely children, but not always.

       I don't even know what doxxxxing is so I won't be accusing you of that. But I will continue to point out the ways that you help enlist pedophiles into what will be the biggest pedo ring ever, all while your ignorance blinds you to the massive blunder you have helped to create

         He claims he

         to record their conversations
         <em>
          twice
         </em>
         . One of the times he had a "buddy" next to him and neither of them thought to at least video-record the conversation. The next time, Alefantis gives him a warning before the supposed call, but Ryan still doesn't record the conversation (despite having allegedly been threatened before).
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         He claimed to have reported Alefantis to the FBI and that they told him not to

           If the FBI is "in on it" and/or he were really threatened by Alefantis, why would he continue to sell pizzagate merchandise and vlogging about pizzagate?

           It doesn't look like he took the threat very seriously.

       So if you're being threatened by a sociopathic DC power player, who gives you a 10 second countdown, maybe you can forgive him for not being able to rig up a recording of the call on the spot?
      </p>
      <p>
       Why the fuck didn't James sue Ryan then if he made this whole thing up? Sounds like he doesn't wanna be
       <em>
        anywhere
       </em>
       near a court proceeding or police station regarding this information...

        The next time, Alefantis gives him a warning before the supposed call
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Like I said, watch the video; He gave him this little "countdown" of 10 seconds. He said "you have 10 seconds to call me".
      </p>
      <p>
       Then he showed him a bunch of pictures of his mom and son and family from facebook...
      </p>
      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Are you new to this sub? You must be new to the concept of conspiracy culture, the idea that law enforcement is largely compromised and would protect people like James, who is one of the most powerful people in Washington DC by the way.
      </p>

      <p>
       Ryan's voat username is "IsThisGameOfThrones". He hasn't posted shit in months. Where are you getting your information?
      </p>
      <p>
       Also, if you watched the video (again), you'll see it was James' idea to craft the "you're a profiteer just looking to sell t-shirts and make money off of this" hoax in the text conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have spoken to Ryan before on Voat. He was one of the best investigators and users on that sub, I have no reason to doubt his story, and he has done nothing for me, not to give him the benefit of the doubt of being honest.

       Meanwhile gq is a source on why the fbi won’t investigate this matter, maybe if enough people called to report this matter... have you called to report this room where children are murdered? Have the authorities seen your tape? Why note reach out to the DoJ, they will not stand for this and would love to bust something like this up, since it would destroy the political enemies of the president... no?

       I have addressed it as potential mind control linked to russia interests that infringes on the rights of a private American citizen and is also linked to a larger conspiracy which is aimed at cultivating and educating pedophiles, also known as pizzagate. I have also said multiple times that if this evidence indicates a child is in danger you should take some kind of real world action to protect them as they may be unable to themselves. Meanwhile you continue to ignore the content of your post and use it as a prop to promote ignorance of all American morality.

       You are the one hurting others and honestly it's awful what you are doing. If you believe what you see, call the police please. I am not able to watch this video and therefore am unable to provide the relevant information to police. Seriously what is the point of all of this?

       How can you say what the point is (to you personally) in the first sentence, and end saying "what is the point of all this?", especially if you didn't even watch the video. SMH.

       First you have to prove people are pedos. You can't just call them that and then pretend like they are defending other people becauae they are both pedos. You have to prove it first.

       I have no idea. But my friend please listen... join me in reporting this thread, i have just found that it is littered with actual cues for pedos to pick up and use, names relating to repositories of pictures can be found here and the pizzagate investigators are admitting to “researching” I am actually horrified by all of this, scrub this abomination from being seen by anyone who may find pleasure in its content

       My point is that it doesn't mean it didn't happen and either side of the argument is pure conjecture. It's pointless to even say "well there's no proof".

        So if you're being threatened by a sociopathic DC power player, who gives you a 10 second countdown, maybe you can forgive him for not being able to rig up a recording of the call on the spot?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That was the second time. He mentions in his video he had already thought about recording the first time. Why didn't he record the
       <em>
        second
       </em>
       time?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Why the fuck didn't James sue Ryan then if he made this whole thing up? Sounds like he doesn't wanna be anywhere near a court proceeding or police station regarding this information...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       No need to bold so much of your text or use foul language. I'm trying to look at the evidence objectively. Aren't we all looking for the truth?
      </p>
      <p>
       There are no damages Alefants could sue for. Ryan's defense could easily be that he was trolled. The case is virtually impossible to prove. No lawyer would suggest wasting money suing someone for this. Try to look up similar cases. You'll see how difficult it is and how high the standard of proof is. It would be a waste of money and would only amplify the voice of his accusers (Streisand effect).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Like I said, watch the video; He gave him this little "countdown" of 10 seconds. He said "you have 10 seconds to call me".
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That was the second time. He had already been threatened before. He had already thought about recording before. Why didn't he record?
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Then he showed him a bunch of pictures of his mom and son and family from facebook...
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Consider this: The conversation only includes personal pictures of Ryan, yet none of Alefantis. If Ryan is making this up, he wouldn't have access to any personal pictures of Alefantis, but he
       <em>
        would
       </em>
       have access to pictures of himself/his family. Thus, this is not evidence of his claims, but rather reinforces the idea that he is lying.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Are you new to this sub? You must be new to the concept of conspiracy culture, the idea that law enforcement is largely compromised and would protect people like James, who is one of the most powerful people in Washington DC by the way according to GQ magazine.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         There is no evidence that GQ would have any kind of special knowledge or access to the inner workings of DC
        </p>

       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Alefantis was dating David Brock at the time, a DC political operative. Dating powerful people usually puts you on lists. Melania Trump would also be considered powerful, despite her own personal accomplishments amounting to not much more than modeling. Her power comes from who she dates.
        </p>

      </ul>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Ryan's voat username is "IsThisGameOfThrones". He hasn't posted shit in months. Where are you getting your information?

      <p>
       I provided links. I'm getting the information from his words.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Also, if you watched the video (again), you'll see it was James' idea to craft the "just tell them you're a profiteer just looking to sell t-shirts and make money off of this, that should discredit you. Also tell them youtube removed the video." hoax in the text conversation.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, consider the possibility that Ryan is making this up. This leaves him the opportunity to pursue making money of this scandal while maintaining his aura of integrity.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        I have spoken to Ryan before on Voat. He was one of the best investigators and users on that sub, I have no reason to doubt his story, and he has done nothing for me, not to give him the benefit of the doubt of being honest here.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Forgive me, but I don't think he's a very good investigator. He didn't even think of recording his calls. Twice.

       Ryan says he "tried" to record the conversations, so this this reasoning doesn't really hold water. Also, most PG proponents I've seen care very little about whether the law is broken when conducting their investigations (e.g. Edgar Welch). I don't think anyone in the PG movement would fault him for recording if they really believe Alefantis is raping and murdering children. Regardless, Ryan was in Texas when this incident happened. Texas and DC need only one party to consent to a recording.

       Texas is a one-party consent state. So while it would be illegal for a third party to record (without a proper warrant), it is legal and would be admissible for O'Neal to record his own calls.

       I think it would be slander actually. Regardless, Alefantis would have to prove damages in court
       <strong>
        and
       </strong>
       that Ryan
       <em>
        intentionally

       lied. Ryan's defense could easily be that someone simply trolled him ("Enough said").
      </p>
      <p>
       There's a reason people in the US can get away with lying so much. There'd be virtually nothing Alefantis could do to prove Ryan intentionally lied, and that those lies caused Alefantis harm.

       James could defintely sue for defamation. Anyone who thinks otherwise is in denial. He's on record saying James threatened his wife and family. That's no laughing matter matter or "troll". He has been implicated in child trafficking and child abuse, in which James claims "it's all true what they say about me, except I hate kids".
      </p>
      <p>
       The fact that Ryan had his video taken down by James proves he was aware of the accusations.

       I think you misunderstood my reasoning. I said Ryan's defense could be that he
       <em>
        was
       </em>
       trolled. That is, his defense could be that he legitimately thought Alefantis was threatening his life. That's literally all he would have to say. Similar to how a cop only has to say they were afraid for their lives, a defendant only has to say they legitimately believed what they said.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis would have to prove that Ryan lied on purpose. Proving what someone
       <em>
        believes
       </em>
       is very difficult without admission. Try to find a similar defamation suit in which the plaintiff won. You'll see how high the standard of evidence is in cases like this.

       We have a robust 1st Amendment right to say pretty much whatever we'd like. Nobody here has shown that Ryan has anything to lose (I'd be happy to look at a similar defamation case in which the plaintiff won).
      </p>
      <p>
       So, yes, I think he'd be willing to risk little-to-nothing in order to monetize and/or gain attention/views/etc (there are people out there who would say pretty much anything to attract

       ).

      <p>
       Anyway, I feel like I've pretty much gone over this and laid out my reasoning. Let's just agree to disagree.

       Actual shills will do things like Gish gallop, poison the well, or concern troll. Someone calling pizzagaters derogatory names probably just think it's a stupid conspiracy theory that takes an inordinate amount of attention away from truly compelling ongoing conspiracies.

       I'd love for that to be true, but the people that have frequented and contributed to this subreddit rarely call people names, and if those "name-callers" actively contributed to promoting compelling conspiracies I'd believe you, but they don't.  Shoot, most don't have accounts old enough to contribute to anything at all, besides derogation.

       Is the intended effect of constant pizzagate propaganda designed to make me love and support pizzagate?  Not only do I hope James Alefantis is raping kids, I'm glad he's so fucking good at it that he'll never be caught.  Congrats, you've officially made me a pizzagate supporter.

       Here's the Facebook chat they had, supposedly, read this and tell me it's not role playing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Just the Pegasus video. Figure out how to do it — no waves.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: I am a super reasonable guy. You don’t have to scare me like that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: You can keep your kill room shit about the rest of it. Fix this and we are reasonable.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Alefantis then sent a picture of O’Neail and his mom].
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Thanks. Feel ok?
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Not really. Just threatened to kill everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: No need for all of that.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Deleted the video.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Good. Blame YouTube.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Delete the thread on Voat too?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: They are taking things down. I think be more creative. Say you think it’s nothing or something — it’s your culture. CAlm down and think about it first.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Ok.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Let’s look and discuss. This might be ok. Thank you. Let me know when you have calmed a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Give me a week.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Ha. Welcome to my world. Call me quick I’ll be nice this time. I appreciate you taking down.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: I’m riding around with somebody. Gimme a minute.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Alefantis then sent a picture of O’Neal and his girlfried].
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Cute
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Is that you being nice?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Not yet. So call quick then I can go to bed with less worries.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Mods deleted posts on Voat. 5 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Ok. What’s mods?
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Moderators.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Humm draws attention?
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: They deleted because my content was removed I guess. Reason: 1 2 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Humm. Looks there.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Says deleted. “It looks like you are trying to make money off this.” Link doesn’t work.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: That’s on Voat. ?.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: About to call.
      </p>
      <p>
       [At this point O’Neal called Alefantis back and said that “he was nicer” but still assured him he “would die” if he did not pull the video down].
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Ok. One more thing this “happened to me.” YOU — created this. You can uncreate.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: It’s an interesting subject. Just doing research on a hobby basically. I would never want myself or family to have any harm done because of this.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Meaning — you created it for yourself — you can uncreate. Yeh well it’s good you didn’t end up like Welch — in jail for 35 years. Or everyone who ‘s getting sued. You can find a much more profitable and beneficial hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: I mean nothing I did was wrong but wrong or not it’s just not worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Actually lots of what you did is illegal. And punishable. But it’s expensive to sue. So people don’t do it. I can explain it to you someday. There would also be criminal — state charges on some of it. But you would need someone smart enough and connected who wanted to make sure it was enforced. And so far you don’t have that.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Took down the video. You win by a landslide.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: So go to sleep. Thank you for that. It’s appreciated. And by the way this story is a pack of lies.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: What is it then? Pure garbage?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Yup. I mean that wall is the same wall.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Oh I confirmed that lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: But what the hell does that mean. And our families deserve to be safe.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: No doubt. What y’all building in the room? Why the trenches?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: You are too much man. On the edge of total destruction — still curious?
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: I’m curious for myself. No worries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: FBI liked your videos. So there is something. And. PLUMBING. Have you ever run plumbing?
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: lol.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: To build a room it’s not trenches. Any basic construction moron would see the differ next.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: So the kill room stuff was just a joke?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Difference
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: IDK about that stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Ugh.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Sorry sorry I’ll stop.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: You don’t know what. It’s a freaky room.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Construction.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: that’s why people put shit on Instagram.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Alefantis then texted a photo of an old job in which O’Neal worked on]
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: You never moved pipes I guess. You are a decorator.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: I designed a few bars. You like? You’re quite the designer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: One more thing. If one of these assholes gets near my mom or her house that’s it for you. That’s bethesda fellows is driving over tomororen. I’m sure nothing will happen but if it does.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: They’ve been talking about Pegasus for awhile.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Everything they say about me is true. Except I don’t like kids. At all. You should soon take all your shit down. Busted for profiteering.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Will do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Night.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Goodnight. Take it down now or later?
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: It’s your culture.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: heard.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Maybe all. Prob best. Disappear. Profiteer gone. I’m going to protect my family now. Now or soon.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Will do.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: And I don’t really want to hear about you again from anyone. Night Ryan.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: I’m telling you I’m done. Way too real.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Cute gf.
      </p>
      <p>
       O’Neal: Thanks man.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alefantis: Lucky boy. Keep your Voat profile though. Xo.
      </p>
      <p>
       [Alifantis then sent a few emoticons: Two ping pong paddles, kissy lips, painted nails, and some money].

       He is pretty much a complete idiot for contacting him directly with his personal Facebook account and then willingly giving him the links to his other social media accounts. Seriously how stupid can one person get?

       Here is the police report from when Ryan claims James harassed him.

       Search Case # 17-000111
      </p>
      <p>
       Or if you Google "Case # 17-000111 Galveston Police Dept" it was top result for me.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read the report Ryan didn't mention James Alefantis' name to the police, didn't show the officer the texts/Facebook messages.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's almost like he phoned the cops out, made some vague claim he was being harassed then... Nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Now it gets brought up occasionally and Ryan still tries to earn money from pizzagate gear.com and so on.

       Any chance you could post a screencap of the “kids” thing at 7:20? I watched the video around that point (and a minute or so of the beginning) but I’m not seeing this.

       It all started when Oneil innocently asked Alefantis if he would do a Ask me anything session on Twitter or FB, I don't remember, I'm not on any of those platforms. Alefantis began his bullying Oneil, by answering back something like "Why the F__ would I do that?", to paraphrase.
      </p>
      <p>
       He threatened Oneil frequently, and Oneil has a personality that is not exactly commanding, I won't say childlike, but it just verified that this is how Alefantis speaks to his child prey, he gets the upper hand by talking down to them to make them do what he wants. You can see the same tactic with Podesta, his bullying speech. They try to instill fear in their victims. Oneil should have realized that as long as you have a paper trail or any kind of record, they can be detected, and they'll move on.That's why he wanted this and that to be deleted by Oneil. Oneil should have said 'shove it'.

       It's funny, if this was someone accusing Spacey or Weinstein of this, you all would believe it in a heartbeat. O'Neal has provided more evidence than Spacey and Weinstein's accusers combined.

       I want to believe this, I really do. The dialogue between the conversation with Ryan and JA just doesn't seem to be a conversation normal people have. It seems staged or pre-meditated. But the OP does bring up a good point. Why wouldn't JA sue Ryan for false allegations? I'm no expert on legal matters but those allegations if false, would probably warrant legal action.

       I wouldn't of been too worried. The things james was saying are the kinds of things an angry confused man would say if he didn't know what the hell to do. Shit even I've been thinking of making a fresh account just to fuck with him, see how much 'power' he really has to find an 'anonymous' person on the internet.
