       With flat earthers, I always want to just send someone they trust up in a rocket to see for themselves...but then it seems like SUCH a gift to give to someone for NO reason, when SO many people would cherish that chance.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think the only answer flat-earthers could give is "the void", since in the end it's a concept at its root based on the Old Testament (not that every flat-earth adherent is religious), and so because of its provenance I'm not sure what else they could say without having Earth being the only flat and domed frisbee flying up into "space" in a 3-D world of spheres.
      </p>
      <p>
       But the Earth isn't flat. It's an oblate spheroid.

       If it weren't a sad condition where they had to be the "smart" ones in order to give their lives the meaning they refused to give it, rich or poor or with a degree or not (LOTS of people can be smart on their own terms, money or degrees are pointless for that), I'd agree.
      </p>
      <p>
       But these are lost people who have latched onto this idea that they're the "elite" because they, among the masses,
       <em>
        know
       </em>
       the Earth is flat.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that is not helpful.

       Be a working-class hero. Be a self-educated libertarian. Learn how to fix cars or plumbing or roofing! That's useful for your fellow man! Or go to college and study philosophy or history or engineering. GREAT! That can be less or more useful, depending, but it has a point and a goal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Just don't absolve yourself in the nihilism of laziness, and cling to "flat Earth theory" as your golden ticket out of doing a damn thing one way or the other, and oh aren't you so great since you don't believe things that everyone else does?
      </p>

       Well, that was a thesis that didn't need to be. But there it is.

       I understand there are psychology studies that claim so-called "conspiracy theorists" do so out of a desire to be recognized as someone extraordinary. I'm personally into researching state sponsored corruption because we really need it to stop, things just get worse and worse when not exposed to the light - like black mold.
      </p>
      <p>
       Flat earth people are on a whole other level though. It wasn't some "conspiracy theory" that has been gaining steam over a long period  of time, it seemed to appear out of nowhere a couple years ago ...almost as if it were some organized, coordinated effort to lump "conspiracy theorists" in with imbeciles. "Oh, you think so-and-so had people killed? You must be one of those flat earth kooks! No point in looking that up."

       i love asking falt-earthers this and what are we moving up in...?
      </p>
      <p>
       most flat feathers believe that gravity is not real and the reason stuff falls to the ground is because the flat earth is moving up at 9/8m/s they also beleive there is no space/universe... so i ask them, what is the flat earth moving up in, then? an infinite hollow cylinder the exact diameter of the earth??? i think not...

       Wrong. That concept is espoused by the Flat Earth Society whom Obama ridiculed in one of his speeches. "Most" flat-earth believers do not believe this about the effect called gravitational force. If you don't believe me start a thread asking them. It should make people wonder why there are disinfo agents within the FE movement to derail and discredit other flat earth subscribers.

       Its the only reasonable explanation besides gravity. Seriously EM, buoyancy or density are way worse than acceleration theory.
      </p>
      <p>
       We can easily debunk those 3 but when formulating gravity Einstein literally referred to it as the law of acceleration because accelerating at 9.81m/s
       <sup>
        2
       </sup>
       is identical to gravity.

       Its still ridiculous but its actually less ridiculous than other theories.

       Dude.  Did you even study Greek mythology in grade school?  It's Atlas.  He's holding up a plate on his shoulders.  Wait.  Nevermind, I just realized I'm the idiot.  You're in fact asking what's on the other side of the plate.  The obvious answer is nothing.  Why?  Because it would all fall down.  So all that stuff would be lying around Atlas's feet.  So, now are you gonna ask what's lying around Atlas's feet?  I don't know but I'm sure a large percentage of it are spinners.  That's the only explanation for where those trillions and trillions of spinners went after the first 6 months of 2017.

       Not a flat earther, but the whole point of the FE charade is to only trust your own experiences. There would be no way of knowing what is on the other side unless you somehow experienced it - the only thing that matters is that their experience of the earth they perceive is flat.

       Obviously this is not known, and it is not known whether we live on the other side. The ocean floors are not entirely mapped. Humans have dug only 7 or so miles underground yet you believe scientists who tell you the earth has a molten iron core that shifts poles every once in a while? At least flat earth people have the humility to say "I don't know" rather than appealing to some charlatan they think is a magical scientist with all the answers.

       The day/night difference is explained by the flat earth model, which also has an explanation of the seasons that is more satisfying than the one we are told, where winter is occurring when the earth is literally millions of miles closer to the sun than in summer.

      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         We know how big the Earth is because we can measure it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We can measure how strong gravity is.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Combining those, we can figure out Earth's mass.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Combining mass and volume, we can figure out the Earth's average density.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The density you get from this is immediately weird - 5.5 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         . When we measure all the rocks around us, the density is more like 3 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         . In order for the
         <em>
          average
         </em>
         density of the Earth to be 5.5 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         , there's got to be a lot of something even more dense so that Earth averages out to a density of 5.5 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Here's where earthquakes help us: Shear waves won't travel through liquid. When we measure
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XPYsXd5.jpg">
          which parts of the Earth actually receive shear waves
         </a>
         we see a big shadow zone, so we can tell there's a big ball of something liquid at the core.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Based on the size of the shadow zone, we can figure out the radius of the core.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In order for the average density to come out to 5.5 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         , using the core's radius we can calculate its density must be somewhere around 7.9 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That incredible close to the density of iron, so that's a good candidate for the core material.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We also know that iron is super common in the universe (thanks to our understanding of how stars undergo fusion), so that further strengthens the case of iron as a good candidate.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Finally, we can measure how strong the Earth's magnetic field is. Based on our knowledge of how quickly Earth rotates and how dynamos work, we can determine that a rotating ball the size of our core and made of liquid iron produces a magnetic field that's just about the same strength as the one we measure.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
       : Earth's average density, earthquake shadow zones, and the strength of our planet's magnetic field.

       Please explain this to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without having to do any astrological research or mathematical equations or any real heavy lifting, I feel like I can be quite confident the earth is round with a pretty basic line of research.

       Here we go.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in New York.  I can fly from New York to LA.  Then I can fly from LA to Sydney, Australia. Then I can fly from Sydney to Singapore. Then I can from Singapore to Moscow.  Then I can fly from Moscow to Paris. Then I can fly from Paris to New York again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can from any one place in the world to any other place in the world and at no point come across an edge or a bottom.  From New York to LA by flying east. I can fly from Cape Town South Africa to Cape Horn, Chile by flying north all the way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even have to actually make the flights. You can just look at the flight tables.
      </p>

       I might not understand your question, nor am I a full-fledged "flat earther," but are you familiar with the flat earth map? All of those flights are still achievable. No flights go over the north or south "poles."
      </p>
      <p>
       Speaking of flying from New York to LA, one might think that this flight would be a lot quicker than flying from LA to NYC, due to the eastward rotation of the earth. But this is not the case. The way people explain this is to say that the atmosphere is somehow "stuck" to the ball earth so that it rotates with it, and all motion is relative to that.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another point about flights: If the atmosphere were round to cover a round earth, we might expect that airline pilots have to dip the nose of the plane to avoid traveling in a tangential line all the way into space, and to stay on a curved flight path with the round earth. But they do not do this.
      </p>
      <p>
       I think these are interesting contentions, at least.

       But I just looked at it and unless there are more than one, it wouldn't make sense that you can fly from Chile to Sydney direct on a flight in less than 15 hours. (And not see land at all despite the crowded flat earth map).  Yet a flight New York to China is about the same flight time yet is about 1/3 the distance on the flat earth map

         As Admiral Robert Byrd testified during his mission in Operation High Jump, he said after hours of flying inland on Antarctica (which surrounds the earth on a FE model with 200 to 300 foot icewalls) he started to see fresh water lakes and green trees and grass everywhere. Land yet to be known to mankind. He saw more but I would encourage you all to look it up. Operation Highjump

       So on our plane(T) it will be hard to ever know due to the Antarctic treaty. So civilians can't just go explore, yes you can possibly go after permission is granted but the powers at be control where you go.

       Why did the Pope meet with the head of the Russian Orthodox Church in Antarctica recently (1-2 years ago)? This was the first time in history these two elected positions ever met.

       We get all our space pictures and information from NASA ( In latin NASA means too deceive) which is a  Government organization founded by former Nazis due to Project Paper Clip.

       I've never seen the curve and never felt us spinning. Gravity is a theory (even though its the only argurment used)  The force the makes some things fall and some things rise is simple Buoyancy and Density (things heavier than air fall, things lighter than air rise).
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, the fact that all the Agent Smiths come out of everywhere when its mentioned the Earth is flat is a sign that the centuries long brainwashing worked.

      <p>
       But, who really knows right. Its a conspiracy!!

       We can observe curvature blocking objects from view and increasing elevation will bring those objects back into view like so:

       Can you explain why you would feel motion? I fell asleep recently on an airplane doing 600+mph I didnt feel the motion but I did feel the acceleration and deceleration. The Earth is pretty consistent in its rotation, you wont feel it.

       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Well you cant have buoyancy or density with an existing attractive force... We call it gravity. Gravity is a theory because the mechanism hasnt been shown.
      </p>
      <p>
       Another way to debunk buoyancy is with a vacuum chamber. Put a brick on a scale in a vacuum chamber. Does it change weight when there are no other volumes to be buoyant against?
      </p>
      <p>
       If the reason the brick falls is because its heavier than air then why does it still have weight in the absence of air? It must be a force that permeates the chamber and attracts the brick down.
      </p>
      <p>
       Same with EM. We have very robust EM shielding. Put a brick in an EM shielded box on a scale. Does the brick change in weight? No, therefore we know that there is a force that is unaffected by EM shielding.
      </p>
      <p>
       We call this force gravity.

       I believe the implication would be that the earth is a plane that expands infinately in the x and y direction.
      </p>
      <p>
       The negative z axis (underground) is an eternally deep stone chasm. Above would be an eternally high expanse of "space".
      </p>
      <p>
       The x and y coordinate plane would be a flat sheet of ice, with occasional spheres of plasma melting the ice to reveal the land underneath.

       This explanation fixes the "disk" problem and the centrifugal force problem, but not a litany of other proofs of spherical geometery.

       <li>
        <p>
         We know how big the Earth is because we can measure it.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We can measure how strong gravity is.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Combining those, we can figure out Earth's mass.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Combining mass and volume, we can figure out the Earth's average density.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The density you get from this is immediately weird - 5.5 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         . When we measure all the rocks around us, the density is more like 3 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         . In order for the
         <em>
          average
         </em>
         density of the Earth to be 5.5 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         , there's got to be a lot of something even more dense so that Earth averages out to a density of 5.5 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         .

         Here's where earthquakes help us: Shear waves won't travel through liquid. When we measure
         <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XPYsXd5.jpg">
          which parts of the Earth actually receive shear waves
         </a>
         we see a big shadow zone, so we can tell there's a big ball of something liquid at the core.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Based on the size of the shadow zone, we can figure out the radius of the core.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In order for the average density to come out to 5.5 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         , using the core's radius we can calculate its density must be somewhere around 7.9 g/cm
         <sup>
          3
         </sup>
         .
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         That incredible close to the density of iron, so that's a good candidate for the core material.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         We also know that iron is super common in the universe (thanks to our understanding of how stars undergo fusion), so that further strengthens the case of iron as a good candidate.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Finally, we can measure how strong the Earth's magnetic field is. Based on our knowledge of how quickly Earth rotates and how dynamos work, we can determine that a rotating ball the size of our core and made of liquid iron produces a magnetic field that's just about the same strength as the one we measure.
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       <strong>
        TL;DR
       </strong>
       : Earth's average density, earthquake shadow zones, and the strength of our planet's magnetic field.

       No. FEers tend to say they know rather than heres what I do know and what we can prove.

       Please explain this to me.
      </p>
      <p>
       Without having to do any astrological research or mathematical equations or any real heavy lifting, I feel like I can be quite confident the earth is round with a pretty basic line of research.
      </p>
      <p>
       Here we go.
      </p>
      <p>
       I live in New York.  I can fly from New York to LA.  Then I can fly from LA to Sydney, Australia. Then I can fly from Sydney to Singapore. Then I can from Singapore to Moscow.  Then I can fly from Moscow to Paris. Then I can fly from Paris to New York again.
      </p>
      <p>
       I can from any one place in the world to any other place in the world and at no point come across an edge or a bottom.  From New York to LA by flying east. I can fly from Cape Town South Africa to Cape Horn, Chile by flying north all the way around.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even have to actually make the flights. You can just look at the flight tables.
      </p>
      <p>
       So how is that explained away?
