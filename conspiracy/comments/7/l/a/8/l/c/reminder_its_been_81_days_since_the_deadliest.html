THOUSANDS of people are claiming to have PTSD because of this event, the lawsuits will span decades, what do you want from the investigators? There is nothing that would satiate you. And just what the fuck &quot;media&quot; is being silent? I just went to the Vegas Journal Review site and their fucking headbar is a link to articles and updates about the shooting. Get fucked, this is just to distract from actual conspiracies like banks and their minions dissolving public assets like schools and roads. But that shit has evidence and paths to correct, where as here you can all play Sherlock and know more than everyone.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>haha..Rick and Morty is for smart people only.  i mean dumb people watch it but they like the farts and burps and not the epistemological aspect of it. of course i comprehend it.  The series touches on topics from Sartrean existentialism to Nieztchean nihilism.  Like...everything in philosophy.  also Rick is obviously a Trump kind of guy.  Trump and Sam Harris will complete the system of German idealism, and Rick and Morty is basically the dissertation on how.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The president. Trump would be the person to address this. Or you could pressure the AG or FBI director. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re skeptical that Trump and his appointees will do anything you could pressure the Nevada governor, Brian Sandoval. He seems to be very opposed to gun control and has expressed support for the death penalty. With that in mind I assume he&#39;s probably tough on crime.</p>

<p>You could also try to pressure the Nevada AG, Adam Laxalt. He&#39;s a pretty strict law-and-order Republican. Moreover, he&#39;s got some conservative/GOP pedigree. His mother Michelle is often a talking head on Fox News and he is the son and grandson of two western GOP stalwarts. Senator Paul Laxalt (Nevada) is his grandfather and Senator Pete Domenici (New Mexico) was his father. Of course his parentage is somewhat scandalous.</p>

<p>I made a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/7jbmcn/complete_this_sentence_or_meet_your_doom_the/">thread</a> asking for visual evidence, preferably from the scene, that shots were fired -- images of bullet damage, bullets striking anything, gunshot wounds, or real medical activity -- and the best I got was a photo I call &quot;girl with blood on leg.&quot;</p>

<p>The dozens of people who reported shots fired, the people who were shot, the people who treated the people who were shot for gunshot wounds, the sound of gunfire, the bullet holes, the sniper&#39;s next filled with guns, expended rounds and rounds of unused ammunition doesn&#39;t give you at least enough information to ascertain shots were fired?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing:  You have to take all of the information available in context.  Selecting one bit of information and holding it up as definitive proof is going to lead you to wrong conclusions.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t ignore the thousands (literally thousands, that&#39;s not hyberbole) of reports, photos, videos and accounts in favor of one that proves or disproves a hypothesis.  </p>

<p>Looking at the evidence that is publicly available, the police audio, the videos, the photos, the witness interviews, the obituaries, and public statements made by officials and other witnesses, I conclude that shots were fired and people were killed.  </p>

<p>I consider ALL of the information.  I can&#39;t pick out one piece of information and call it more or less compelling than any other. In compiling and reviewing evidence and information (and I encourage you to do this for a lot of things, not just major events), an investigator needs to consider not just what the item is, but also the context in which it is presented.  </p>

<p>Random video shot by cell phone by a person at the scene as the event is happening is very compelling.  We have dozens of them corroborating each other all released around the time this event is alleged to occur, some within minutes of the event.  Police body camera footage matches some of those videos, those people have been identified in subsequent interviews.  There&#39;s injured people, dead people, damage to property, clear panic on a large scale.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t believe the same thing I do, that&#39;s fine.  That&#39;s your right and I respect that.  I just encourage you to expand your realm of possibilities a bit.  Don&#39;t start your investigation with a conclusion.  And that&#39;s kind of what you&#39;re doing when you say &quot;I don&#39;t believe shots were fired.&quot;  </p>

<p>Good investigators refrain from drawing a conclusion until they&#39;ve seen all the evidence.  Now, if, as you say, you&#39;ve seen all the evidence and you still don&#39;t believe shots were fired, well that&#39;s your opinion.  It&#39;s wrong and it&#39;s contrary to the overwhelming amount of evidence that shots WERE fired, but it&#39;s your opinion and you are entitled to it.</p>

<p>Question the official story, demand answers, but don&#39;t outright deny something happened when there is so, so much evidence available that it did.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>No one does, they just say &quot;I&#39;m not doing your work for you.&quot; They assert that it&#39;s <em>obvious</em> this was a real shooting but can&#39;t even show the basic visual evidence that would support this. </p>

<p>Even in some videos people have sent me, I&#39;ve taken the effort to freeze frame and take a still image of what they are saying shows a gunshot wound or whatever to show that no, it doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>Las Vegas hoax was all about the psychological trick known as the power of suggestion. Show a bunch of random running and screaming and the sounds of gunshots and let everyone&#39;s imaginations run wild to fill in the blanks. </p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not insisting on footage of bullets striking, even though if this were a real shooting there would be <em>plenty</em> such video. There is not even imagery of real

<p>Could it be that people were more occupied with helping the wounded than filming them that night? What about the hundreds of witnesses? So you expect people who were shot to upload pictures of their wounds online because you have trouble excepting this event as a reality? </p>

<p>And google “Vegas shooting ambulances”. C’mon dude.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right that this is the &quot;most convincing&quot; content, but let&#39;s be honest -- it shows literally nothing. A cup being kicked over, wow. As for the second video, first of all that crowd of people would certainly not be casually loitering around if there were real gunfire happening; this alone is enough to know that is a staged scene. Secondly, one impact? We are talking about thousands of rounds being fired. You can even hear the sounds of many &quot;gunshots&quot; going off. Yet we see one impact? No, it doesn&#39;t work like that. Where are the other bullets?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have been thinking that same thing lately -- it&#39;s so easy to discern truth from disinformation because of these dim-witted shills using the same excruciatingly silly playbook. You&#39;re right, speaking of the sheer volume, it&#39;s basically just a mathematical proof of the hoax at this point  - I have, no exaggeration, had going on thirty people tell me on this subreddit they personally know a victim. Just earlier today someone told me they know a girl who was shot in the eye:</p>

<p>Once they decided they were going to ceremoniously up the body count with each new shooting, I tuned out.</p>

<p>IMO it’s pretty evident that average people are skeptical as well. Maybe they won’t call it an outright conspiracy yet, but I sure hear a lot fewer conversations about how “incredibly sad” it all is. </p>

It&#39;s the local jurisdictions who probably have never experienced a situation like what is happening to them at that moment. They are human beings. They are scared, amped, and shocked. They want answers and they want to give answers, especially since they have a press pool they probably have never seen hounding them for any but of info they can give to their subscribers. They offer answers, time lines, anything to the best of their knowledge. They make mistakes and have to back track. This happens.

    <div class="md"><p>I would caution you to do a little research (which you obviously haven&#39;t) before making a statement like this. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>After a mass shooting gun sales sky rocket. Every single time. It&#39;s a fact and any research will show that. </p></li>
<li><p>The best thing possible for the gun lobby is to have a candidate running on a pro-gun control platform.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Whether or not you believe in gun control doesn&#39;t matter to me, but don’t ignore the statistical facts that the best thing for the gun industry is someone threatening to ban guns.  Take this shooting as a discussion point. Shortly after the shooting (as in the next morning) stock prices for gun manufactures shot up overnight then after things started to settle down gun sales start to taper off. Now why would that happen? Oh wait there is a Republican President in office that poses absolutely no threat to gun owners currently.  People buy guns for 2 reasons, they either think they are going to be taken away or they feel threatened end of story. </p>

<p>Now in order for your statement to work you should spin it and use the facts to your advantage. If you follow the money the NRA stands to gain a hell of a lot of money by scaring gun owners and making them think that their rights are going to be infringed on. The NRA actually loves when there is an event like this. Its scares one portion of the population in to thinking they should buy a gun to protect themselves.  It also give the Democratic party a chance to push the gun control agenda and this also drives gun sales. </p>

<p>The story is being suppressed there is no doubt about that but I would assume that its being suppressed by someone with something to lose not an industry that booms any time something like this happens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your argument was that the NRA was responsible for suppressing the story. I don&#39;t think the NRA has anything to lose at this point; guns aren&#39;t going anywhere and as long as these types of attacks happen every few years when sales dip. Trust me their profits will be just fine. I admire your passion about trying to expose the NRA and I don&#39;t disagree with you. As a gun owner myself I don&#39;t need them to do my bidding the Bill of Rights did that for us. it is a right of every American to own and arm themselves as they sit fit and just like any other right granted to Americans we should do any and everything we can to make sure the government (Rep or Dem) doesn’t start stripping them from us. If it starts with our right to bear arms what comes next?  Free speech (happening now)? Illegal search and seizure (happening now)? States Rights (happening now)? Noticing a trend?</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is maybe shift your thinking a little bit and don&#39;t fall victim to the opinions of others who have just as much to gain financially and politically by attacking the NRA. The NRA is a weapon used by both sides of the political fence and they only hope that you pick a side and don&#39;t realize that they are both getting filthy rich off of posing an argument that divides us.   </p>

If he had used explosives to kill and injur all of those people the discussion would be different but because he was found with more guns than he could possibly use we are going to sit here and say guns are the problem and we shouldn&#39;t let people use them. It couldn&#39;t possibly be that it was staged to enforce stricter gun control and security measures.

<p>It’s clear the media does not want to talk about Vegas. That doesn’t mean the only explanation for them covering sexual assault and pedophilia is to distract from Vegas. There are other perfectly good explanations.</p>

<p>It’s also possible the media has caught wind that there are multiple criminal investigations into sex crimes of powerful people. Particularly in Hollywood. The media realizes that they need to hurry up and report on these things before indictments to reduce public outrage about the decades long cover up.</p>

<p>I understand thinking one thing is more important than the other and wanting to know more about it. But that doesn’t mean other stories should be ignored. It’s up to the public to get to the truth on all of these things.</p>

<p>The best explanation I see is that networks are being told it’s a national security issue and part of an ongoing investigation.</p>

<p>The only people failing to recognize that are the people who post in this sub. This goes one of three ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The shooter is part of some conspiracy, or a fall guy for the same. The conspiracy includes all or most of the media (which is literally hundreds of thousands of people) and they aren&#39;t <em>allowed</em> to report on anything. There is nothing to report, and so the News Monster goes elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>The shooter is part of some conspiracy, or a fall guy for the same. There&#39;s nothing to report on, because contrary to popular belief government agencies are overwhelmingly competent and their work can stand up to literal decades of scrutiny. There is nothing to report, and so the News Monster goes elsewhere.</p></li>
<li><p>The shooter is a lone psychopath. There&#39;s nothing to report on, because real life isn&#39;t hollywood and people don&#39;t become violent and mentally unbalanced for good reasons that make sense to the public, they become violent and mentally unbalanced due to hormonal issues or tumors or ingesting heavy metals or maybe they&#39;ve always been that way but they never had the means to shoot up a concert. Either way the reasons are unmarketable and as such not newsworthy. There&#39;s nothing to report on, and so the News Monster goes elsewhere.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Occam&#39;s Razor dictates that it&#39;s #3. Simple as that. If you believe something else then #2, which doesn&#39;t make much sense without a motive, still isn&#39;t a colossal leap in logic. #1 is an idiot trap, nothing more, nothing less. This sub seems married, however, to #1. It hits the front page every single day.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s why I&#39;m not subscribed to <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>i can&#39;t answer your first question, so I won&#39;t, but I can offer speculation for your second question.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s assume that the police believer there <em>was</em> a second shooter. Even if he isn&#39;t on video, any small detail, like how much of a specific door was damaged, or where certain bullets were shot, could be exposed in the video.</p>

<p>For example, and again this is all speculation and fiction, let&#39;s say the 2nd shooter used a shotgun and it blew off the top right corner of the door to an adjacent room. This hasn&#39;t been reported, but maybe it&#39;s captured on tape.</p>

<p>During the course of their investigation, they&#39;ll know which details are public and which are not. If a suspect can confirm any of the non-public details, they are more certain that he or she was actually part of the attack. Once these details come to light through the release of public videos, however, you run the risk of grabbing the wrong suspect as anyone can now pretend to have been there, pulling bits of information from publicly released documents.</p>

<p>Assuming it was a weapons deal gone bad, what does committing mass murder serve? I could see that they meant to “out” whatever three letter agency was allegedly responsible, but by that logic the whole episode has been covered up.</p>

<p>But, the FBI believes it was a lone act, which is even more of a reason to be transparent about it. Instead, they say it was a lone gunman but are acting like the opposite.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Obviously, investigations take time.</p>

<p>I get that expecting real-time updates on this event is unrealistic to say the least. It’s a symptom of our era.</p>

<p>But, another symptom of the era is our shady government doing what it wants and keeping the people out of the loop. Questioning the conduct of this investigation is the duty of the people and the press. </p>

<p>This wasn’t an unmotivated attack. In the past, information on these shooters has usually been released in a timely manner. This case is the exception to the rule, and we should be staying on it and asking the hard questions. </p>

<p>Why the secrecy?  If there were co-conspirators I&#39;m pretty sure they know they are being looked for.  Telling us the FBI is checking that out is not going to ruin that investigation.  Anybody involved in one of the biggest mass shootings ever <em>who got away</em> is running hard and fast and isn&#39;t going to be lulled into a false sense of security by a tight lipped FBI.

<p>There’s no explanation yet for how he got the firearms into the room. There’s no genuine rebuttal to the speculation of there being more than one gunmen. Despite the fact that ISIS claimed the attack, the officials continue to say he worked alone without explanation. </p>

<p>What’s the follow up on the room not being owned by the casino? If he worked alone then what’s the harm in divulging more of the findings? Why did it take over 75 minutes for the police to engage the (already dead) suspect? Where were the security cameras he allegedly installed streaming to? </p>

<p>There are plenty more questions that could be answered without ruining the investigation. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Then tell me their preliminary findings, like we always get in these sort of mass shootings. Tell me about the time line. Tell me about the potential motive. How did he get the weapons to his room? Why didn&#39;t the hotel notice the barricades and cameras he put up in the corridor? We did get three different time lines  in three days before all information stopped. Nothing strange  there. Why are there so many people online trying to shut down any discussion about the shooting? Because it&#39;s a COVERUP! What are you even doing on this forum? Just trying to stop people from asking questions and thinking?</p>

<p>Yeah, we always get three conflicting timelines in as many days before all information flow to the public is completely stopped for 3 months - we still don&#39;t know ANYTHING about what happened in LA! Or if you do, tell me! In lieu of official explanation I and real conspiracy theorists will speculate ourselves, deal with it.</p>

<p>WHAT IS MY BULLSHIT CONSPIRACY?!?!?! ALL I AM SAYING IS NO ONE KNOWS AND THUS WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE/SPECULATE!!! If you disagree with that I legit wonder wtf you are doing here, just trying to shut people up who actually ask hard questions???</p>

<p>So I take it you don&#39;t believe in 9/11 or JFK as inside jobs?  If you don&#39;t think the government covers stuff like this up and does not tell us the truth, wtf are you doing here?!

<p>All I ask is we keep asking questions about LA and attempt to figure out what happened there. HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY DISAGREE?!?!?!?!? And that there are so many of you only emboldens me to search harder btw, If you imagine you were stopping me you are beyond delusional.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not angry. I just wish you directed your anger to something way more important; the reasons behind these mass shootings: oppression, mental health issues, gun regulations, the police state.</p>

<p>How is this harassment? I&#39;m trying to have a discussion. Am I not allowed to disagree with you?</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t get why you&#39;re so aggressive. Maybe you&#39;re the one trying to keep me away from looking too much into what causes these mass shootings. Hmm...</p>

<p>What is it you want to investigate? Look at YouTube videos about the shooting? There&#39;s nothing you can expose. If there was anything going on the only way we would ever find out is a whistleblower. That&#39;s the reality, so why bother.</p>

<p>You keep insulting me and calling me crazy for pointing out really just common sense, the hotel does not decide what information and footage is released. I no longer think you have any wish to actually discuss rationally. You are one dude, but a lot of other people have responded exactly as you have, very emotionally calling me names and claiming I am crazy for... What? Pointing out that the hotel does not decide if the police release the footage or not. No wonder I get frustrated eventually. Why are you so angry though?

<p>Again, they usually do release footage and motive and a lot of information in these large mass shooting cases, as it is of large public interest and demand.

    <div class="md"><p>There is a close relationship with metro and the casinos. There likely was shadiness from the casino which they are trying to cover up. For instance what if they guy ran an escort service and/or drug dealing operation that casino management knew about but knowingly turned a blind eye towards because he’s a high tipping high roller? That they effectively knew he bangs under age prostitutes or something and hosts parties but management ignores him because he gives everyone good kickbacks? Maybe he was an arms dealer? So when he went up to his room to unload all those guns they gave him a VIP transport of his stuff without realizing he was going to go on a rampage. So if they give the details it would show how the hotel was facilitating his other non violent activity. </p>

<p>Stuff like that is a reason why they’d try to hide details on this guy because that could result in a huge scandal that costs the locals tons of jobs and tax revenue. Vegas is a huge boys club of leadership and the top guys can make the police be quiet. </p>

<p>Why use this sort of language in a conspiracy sub? It is designed to shut down independent thought and debate. Furthermore, you did agree there is a coverup, didn&#39;t you? If it isn&#39;t, tell me the timeline and motive... We have no idea, as there is a complete information blockade, that is a coverup, especially when people keep arguing that we should just forget it and just trust the government to do what&#39;s best and find the truth, using CIA designed language to shut down JFK truthers.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well the allusion people are drawing is the cover up is government related or something more related to false flags or something. I’m arguing that sure there is intentional information blocking going on and covering up, but it more has to do with protecting the industry. </p>

<p>Why this guy did it? I have no idea. But that doesn’t mean it’s state sponsored. The default can’t be every time there is something tragic that the government is behind it </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know this post is old, but unfortunately, it&#39;s hard to enforce the law on the law. They will fuck you around, destroy your stuff, even not return it at all, and there&#39;s just about nothing you can do about it. Good luck trying to sue them lmao.</p>

<p>Isn&#39;t that kind of the whole point of this subreddit though? Pointing out that the rich/powerful don&#39;t have to hold up their end of the bargain?</p>

<p>I was watching this video of some guys who were filming personal video in a public space. Cops came and arrested them (threw them around, were agressive) and confiscated all their expensive videography equipment. They hadn&#39;t done anything wrong, didn&#39;t resist. The cops said they couldn&#39;t film commercially without permission, but it was for YouTube. When they went to retrieve their stuff, the police refused, saying it was evidence. When they went to go get proof from where they were filming, there were new &#39;no trespassing&#39; signs put up, and the security cameras on a business right by there were removed. When they asked the business, the owner said the cops told them to take it down, and was spooked to give them the footage because police were involved. Obviously just didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with it if he didn&#39;t have to.</p>

<p>After months, they finally get their shit back, but their sd cards with the footage of the arrest were destroyed and one of the cameras were completely destroyed. Like 10k after the body and the lenses. </p>

<p>Point being, sure, there are regulations in place that are supposed to force the police to return &#39;evidence&#39;, but it doesn&#39;t matter a bit when they don&#39;t have to follow those regulations. When the definitions of evidence are so loose, and people are (rightfully) scared of the police, there&#39;s really nothing stopping them from just taking whatever they want and you or the public will never see it again.</p>

Public property does not meant that it is publicised on the internet, it means it CAN be shared on the internet or elsewhere by the state, if they want to. In this case the state has decided to cover the largest mass shooting in US history up instead of releasing the material to the public at large - the hotel cannot make that decision for the police/state, as the videos are not their private property.</p>

<p>But if you asked me right now what the carpets or walls looked like in the Mandalay Bay, I couldn&#39;t tell you, and I stayed there years ago. If I watched the videos repeatedly, I wouldn&#39;t be able to forget.</p>

<p>Point in case: I went to New York City as a kid and I don&#39;t remember the WTC, but I&#39;ve seen the 9/11 videos enough that I can picture those buildings in my mind like I had driven past them all my life.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>By your logic the military should share all of their covert plans with the public, because they&#39;re funded by the US taxpayer. I don&#39;t think I need to explain why a military making their maneuvers public is poor strategy.</p>

<p>Just pretend there <em>were</em> multiple shooters. Let&#39;s assume that something happened in the room that the public doesn&#39;t know about yet. Maybe a few shots went through a TV, and they tried to break out a window in the bedroom but gave up and tried elsewhere.</p>

<p>As long the busted TV and scratched bedroom window can&#39;t be seen in the limited photos that have been released, then law enforcement knows that only someone who was in the room would be privy to these details. This helps to weed out false confessions, and helps LEO&#39;s to know when they have picked up the <em>wrong</em> suspect.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more reasons why investigators don&#39;t make every detail of an ongoing investigation public, but the point is that just because someone is a civil servant doesn&#39;t mean that they have no privacy or access to classified information in their workplace.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hahahahahaha!</p>

<p>You clearly don&#39;t know anything about Paddock or gambling. So please stop talking like you&#39;re some expert on until you bother to get out of your self imposed bubble of information and research the other side. </p>

<p>First, there are countless Vegas regulars who know him and have personally witnessed him winning and gambling large sums of money. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-gambler-20171009-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-gambler-20171009-story.html</a></p>

<p>There are plenty of people who literally make their living by gambling. Second, Stephen Paddock made most of his fortune from his companies and being an accountant. While Paddock was a Vegas whale, he also was losing a lot of money lately according to the records. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.casino.org/news/stephen-paddock-was-on-gambling-losing-streak-prior-to-shooting">https://www.casino.org/news/stephen-paddock-was-on-gambling-losing-streak-prior-to-shooting</a></p>

<p>So yes, he got his money from somewhere. It&#39;s called being an accountant and owning several companies. It&#39;s dumb easy to find out exactly how Stephen Paddock made his money. I don&#39;t understand why people pretend like this isn&#39;t readily available information. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t you know? There&#39;s no real reason for them to release any footage like that. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re crazy enough to believe that Stephen Paddock didn&#39;t bring his guns down to Mandalay Bay and rent that room, and order that room service, and fire those shots from his own guns and ammo and then kill himself in it, then you&#39;re never going to trust some CCTV footage anyways. You&#39;ll dismiss it as a creation on a sound stage or something equally silly. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re sane enough to understand that Stephen Paddock was actually there and of his own accord, seeing some random footage of him eating a hamburger doesn&#39;t interest you one bit. We already know he was there. His motives are the real interest which an easy answer from a dead man. </p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in things that make sense, like an analysis of his electronics. I don&#39;t give a single shit about watching him scratch his ass in some lobby. Everyone who isn&#39;t insane knows he was there. </p>

It could be something as simple as the casino illegally turning a blind eye towards one of their high rollers, not realizing he’d do this. Maybe just typical shady shit like turning a blind eye expecting him to deal drugs or something.  But they can’t admit that. So the press and pretty much everyone in the state rather just be quiet and let it die out rather than risk killing off the blood supply of an entire state. </p>

<p>Think about other similar situations. When a crime takes place in a big business like a bank or hospital footage is typically only released before the trial if they are looking for a suspect. </p>

Some people think that he may have been an arms dealer and they used the casinos to launder money and it was a deal gone wrong. Some people don’t even think that the person that died was Steven paddock. If you look at the pictures of him dead the bullet shells don’t have any blood on them. Almost like they were planted after the fact. Other people think that the MGM CEO knew about it. Hence the reason he took out 80% of his stock weeks before. It’s just so fucked up that nobody from the government has said anything since. Not one single thing. Basically. They know that we as a culture are so used to it and our A.D.D is so fucked that they know the world will forget and well. Two months later and nobody except you guys are talking about it. </p>

There&#39;s not much of an alternative to the Vegas experience. It&#39;s specific to Vegas. This isn&#39;t surprising in the least. Even if a lot of people decided they didn&#39;t want to visit, that would only lead to more deals for rooms which would immediately attract a boom of visitors who don&#39;t want to waste the opportunity.

I’ve ran the scenario in my head how that could happen and it doesn’t make sense. How did they land on top of a puddle of blood with not a single drop on the casing themselves.

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, plus brain shots from a handgun don’t create like, a firehose of blood like in the movies. Shotguns, sure, but the brain tissue sort of corks up the hole a lot of the time and you just have a small amount of ejecta and that’s it. Heart stops, blood pressure drops to nothing, no bleeding.</p>

<p>It varies, of course, but it’s more likely than not that there’s not gonna be a gallon of blood fountaining out of dude and creating visible staining on the brass within a few feet of him.</p>

The person would go limp and fall down, and once they are lying on the floor the rest of the blood contained in the body would through gravity pour out of the exit wound and soak the carpet. Seeping up underneath and around the casings that are already on the carpet.</p>

<p>Since by the photo it looked like he ate a bullet with his mouth, the splatter would be behind him, not in the front where the casings were seen in the image.</p>

<p>casings laying in a puddle of blood, that don&#39;t have any blood on them</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Liquid always takes the path of least resistance. Blood is not going to crawl up the side of the shell casing or anything, least of all on carpet. Go lay out a bunch of stuff on you kitchen counter and then pour whatever you want on the counter near it. It will just creep under all the stuff. Soda, corn syrup, cooking oil, it&#39;s not really going to mater being nothing will climb up the items. </p>

<p>So the casing with out blood on them is not really a shock. Even less so if he popped himself in the chest vs the head. People keeps saying head/mouth but we don&#39;t know that. If he shot himself in the chest and fell face down blood would pool out of the mouth/nose anyways. </p>

<p>Tactical hits the room, kicks the gun away and rolls his body over from right to left and at some point someone snapped a pic. That pretty much lines up with everything we see in the crime pics. The older deep soak on the right side, the fresher blood on his face/left side of the pool, the bullets with out any blood on them. We just need to wait for an offical report for more info. Yet I&#39;m willing to bet he died to shots to the chest, not head. </p>

<p>After describing the <em>very</em> suspicious put option trading in the days before the 9/11 attacks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (also known as the “9/11 Commission”) investigated these rumors and found that although some unusual (and initially seemingly suspicious) trading activity did occur in the days prior to September 11, it was all coincidentally innocuous and not the result of insider trading by parties with foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks.</p>

<p>Oh good, the 9/11 Commission investigated... thanks for sharing that unbiased truthiness Snopes.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was very much around for Bush&#39;s first term, they actually did numerous recounts, which went back and forth on who won the election until Katherine Harris and Jeb&#39;s government stopped the recounts. It wasn&#39;t that people couldn&#39;t believe he won, it&#39;s that it was so close that they weren&#39;t exactly sure <em>who</em> won. Then you had each side trying to tilt the table in their favor, such as the discarding of ballots with &quot;hanging chads&quot; aka holes that weren&#39;t punched all the way through. </p>

If he was an agent of Syria it would give the perfect opportunity to start another war. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a red flag.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I subscribe to the theory that it was an assassination attempt on the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>The very condensed version is:
* Saudi politics: King is likely to abdicate soon, named his son (the crown prince) as successor - skipping over the King&#39;s brother.
* Brother is unhappy, plots assassination. Finds out crown prince is staying in the US; organises team to pull it off.
* Crown prince is supposedly staying in the Mandalay Bay, one or two floors above the arms deal.
* Team needs weapons in very short time, so they organise an arms deal. The CIA/FBI/ATF provided the guns, going for a sting operation.
* Thus, only a couple of guns are loaded, as evidenced by the time between bursts of fire. If you intended to go on a killing spree, you would ensure all your guns are loaded.
* Team finds out crown prince is not in his room, but in another casino. They panic, as without achieving their goal, they and whoever ordered the hit will be fucked.
* Thus, they start opening fire on the crown below, as the target is not contained, they must search for him. Much easier to do when there is so much panic on the ground.
* Crown prince gets away
* Somewhat later, the son of the brother of the King is killed in a suspicious helicopter crash. Dissidents are rounded up.</p>

<p>Turns out our target isn&#39;t in the casino?

    <div class="md"><p>So, the plan was to get guns a couple of floors below, then go kill the prince. That would have been far, far, far easier to cover up than if the target was elsewhere.</p>

<p>Also, without the panic, emergency services and counter terrorism forces would have had a much easier job. If the assassins needed to search Las Vegas, they need a &quot;smokescreen&quot;.</p>

<p>And I didn&#39;t really explain point 8. But the suggestion is that the prince was escorted out of the Tropicana, where he was at the time, by heavily armed personnel. There is video footage of this on YouTube, but I cannot confirm that it is the crown prince in the video.</p>

<p>Along the way, they ran into groups of the terrorists, and reportedly had a firefight at the airport. Crown prince was unharmed and whisked away to safety.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>OK... now, assuming this was a hastily organized operation of the cia/fbi/mossad/etc... If the target isn&#39;t where he is expected, and is in an unknown location at that! The very last thing the ops would do is to force a situation of chaotic movement by everyone in the vicinity. That, perhaps, is what might happen if a counter-op (protecting the target) were able to penetrate the original assassination op at the last minute.</p>

<ol>
<li>Relocate the target.</li>
<li>Infiltrate the armory/staging room.</li>
<li>Create an unavoidable conflict away from the target.</li>
<li>Evacuate and secure the target.</li>
<li>To the extent possible, destroy the infiltrated operation and the operators&#39; capabilities on scene.</li>

<p>I imagine it would have slightly more impact than the recent report proving US and Saudi official programs armed ISIS, but slightly less outrage than the border patrol purposely delivering guns to mexican drug cartels.  Which is to say, it would fall far short of an IRAN-CONTRA sort of operation and be generally accepted as &#39;win some lose some&#39; and &#39;no one could have predicted this madman&#39;s plan&#39;.</p>

<p>&quot;Can I take a look at that.... hey... wait a minute... is that even loaded? what the fuck? When I go buy black market guns, and by black market I mean illegal, and untraceable, because I don&#39;t want any reason for anyone to know I have these guns, my first thought is &quot;I know we&#39;re in a hotel room buying illegal arms, but I gotta see this thing in action! blow out that window and lets see what she can do!&quot;&quot;  </p>

<p>Shit, lets one go one baby step further.  </p>

<p>&quot;Thanks for the inquiry into the firearms I am selling, Since I am in a high-rise hotel suite I will obviously be loading these guns with live rounds for no logical reason, and handing a loaded gun to somebody that wants to illegally buy assault weapons is in no way something a paranoid shutin would shy away from doing.&quot;</p>

<p>Did you see the video? It was pretty clearly the sound of one shooter from a distance. Untrained people don&#39;t expect the gunshot, bullet crack, and ricochet to be three different times/directions but if you take the time to think about the individual shots in the video it&#39;s clearly just one.</p>

<p>As for the motive, there have been a few times where a mass shooter meets with the parents of a victim they shot and it&#39;s always a disappointing conversation: I thought God told me to do it, I wanted to make the world hurt like I hurt, only God will judge me, I now know it was wrong, etc. We want there to be useful information so we can act on it, but that doesn&#39;t mean there is any - other than the fact that we need some sort of way of dealing with the epidemic of untreated mental health issues in America. </p>

There are plenty of reasons one shooter might have two different volumes in one video - shooting a different direction, camera in a different position, shooting out another window, changed guns, finger over the mic, etc. The fact that he spends all this time to just get to his climax of zooming in in the waveform and showing that one is louder shows that there&#39;s really not a lot there - you&#39;d have to show that it&#39;s <em>not</em> any of a miriad of reasons, which he doesn&#39;t do. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>When I was out hunting this year I was getting lead flying over my head. Didn&#39;t even realize it until I heard a ricochet &quot;laser&quot; past me.  I totally didn&#39;t expect what sounded like bottle rockets to be bullets over me. I heard a crack like a 22, then a pop.  Rattled me a little realizing that wasn&#39;t a 22 but a round meant to take down something as big as me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If my reading of the SEC form 4 is correct he didn&#39;t sell 80% of his shares, he sold 80% of his direct stock.  He still has over 1.4 million indirect/direct shares. So he only sold about 16% of his stock.  </p>

<p>He sold 259,760 + 34,390(294690 shares) on the 8th and 9th of September but if you look at column 5 on the SEC form 4 he still owns 637,909 + 603,519 + 175,329 in indirect shares and 71,442 in direct shares equaling 1488199 shares.</p>

<p>294690/1782889 = 16.5%</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing the 80% figure was derived from the direct stock only.</p>

<p>294690/366132 = 80.5%</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000112760217027217/xslF345X01/form4.xml">http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000112760217027217/xslF345X01/form4.xml</a></p>

<p>So if he was selling his shares to avoid losing money after the stock tanked why would he keep over 80% of his shares?</p>

<p>Also the stock tanked only about 4 dollars after the attack, only about a 1.5million dollar loss. So it would be pretty foolhardy  to out yourself like that to save 1.5million dollars. </p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not an expert on SEC forms but that&#39;s what it looks like to me.</p>

There were so many funerals in the months following it was exhausting. I will grant you the possibility of trained &quot;spokesvictims&quot; and fake plane manifests, but there were absolutely real victims that day.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>While the &quot;official&quot; story may not line up with the rest of the witnesses or evidence we have all seen, I can assure you, that my step sister was indeed shot in Las Vegas, at the concert that was shot up, when it was getting shot up. </p>

<p>If you are going to say that this never happened, I&#39;d have to wonder what else it think about the world around you. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen many conspiracies about Sandy hook, aurora, and a few others that have definitely made me question the validity of certain things, but I believe my sister when all of her evidence (being there, pictures, videos, fuckin bullet wound) points to the goddamn thing happening. </p>

<p>Do I believe there may be an attempt by the media to cloud or muddy this? Sure. With everything else that we&#39;ve seen, why not? Why wouldn&#39;t they?</p>

<p>But do I think it&#39;s all a hoax? Fuck to the no. My sister was shot. In Vegas. At the concert. My father drove the 4ish hours in the middle of the night to pick her and her friend up (rather than let her and her friend face it all alone) waited at the hospital with her until she was released, and drove them both back after retrieving their belongings from the hotel they were staying at. </p>

<p>That shit happened, dude. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve agreed with you and everyone else that there are major problems with the story. I have not reviewed the link you posted and will take the time to look into the cluesforum. My sister has been contacted by a few different people, organizations, and groups, about telling her story and what happened that night. When she is ready to talk about it openly, she will. I will also pass on the link just above so she can contact them directly, when she is ready to. </p>

<p>I hope you understand the anger directed at you. You&#39;re basing your point on there not being any victims, and I have to vehemently disagree. </p>

<p>That is because I know where my sister was, based on what she showed the world via her Instagram/Facebook pictures and check-ins, as well as the Snapchat video of the chaos happening around her, and my father making the drive to Las Vegas, to bring her and her friend back home, and the wound I have seen. That&#39;s before I take anything she has said, into any sort of account. That&#39;s just physical evidence without any form of opinion attached. I will be more inclined to believe the evidence I have witnessed, and will have to disagree with you and your point, wholeheartedly. </p>

<p>For the record, I am not disagreeing that crisis actors may have been used on interviews and around situations like Sandy Hook, Aurora, 9/11, and other major events. I have seen different pictures of what looked to me, like the same people at these different situations, in different capacities. I believe there is a possibility of some truth in that point, and do believe there is a lot more going on than any of us really know. </p>

<p>To say that there aren&#39;t any real victims in this instance, is infuriating. </p>

Hows james holmes doin these days batman? $500,000 spent to investigate 9-11, but i read yesterday on godgle 21 TRILLION just disappeared, missing on u.s. military spending? Just now found... Californias wild fires line up with blue prints submitted to san jose expantions plans from two years ago? Coincidentaly? 2014 flu outbreak pinpointed to bio engineering warehouse. Happens to be right smack in the middle of kansas where scheduled bio tests are to be done on our own citizens....By force and most dont even know about it... The fracked up land everywhere windmills for going green that utilise the worst design at the highest costs to us....fuck it the only thing that surprises me anymore is peoples ability to lay down and happily have not only our own asses fucked but the children we say we are so commited to, creating a better life for are fucked too.</p>

<li><p>Why was Jesus Campos unlicensed at the time of the shooting?</p></li>
<li><p>David Hickey, President of Jesus Campos&#39; Union, states licensing wasn’t required, is this true?</p></li>

<p>I don’t agree with it because I believe the benefits of release outweigh the potential risks that you outlined. I suspect the FBI was involved in an arms deal gone bad (remember Fast &amp; Furious), and now they’re trying to control the narrative as much as possible. </p>

<p>Separately, imagine the engine placements on the wings of the plane, and ask yourself how those could possibly fold inward into the fuselage of the plane and squeeze through a single hole.  There should be impacts/holes where the engines hit the structure.  There are not.</p>

<p>Using Google Maps, I used the &quot;measure distance&quot; tool to measure the distance between silver ridge on the roof (left side, perpendicular across all of the roofs) and half way in on that inner wall - I got about 50 feet.</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.boeing.com/resources/boeingdotcom/company/about_bca/startup/pdf/historical/757_passenger.pdf">this</a> drawing of a Boeing 757-200 series aircraft that shows the distance between the landing gear to be 24&#39;. Assuming the drawing is dimensionally accurate, doubling that would fit the engines nicely - 48&#39;.</p>

<p>I&#39;m unconvinced that the engines would strike outside of the hole shown.</p>

<p>There should be a lot of debris. And there <a href="https://kendoc911.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/pentagondebris2.jpg">was</a> a lot of debris. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you for choosing to look at the evidence objectively. </p>

<p>When looking into it, be sure to check the (pictures)[<a href="http://postimg.org/image/v2npgcmf5/">http://postimg.org/image/v2npgcmf5/</a>] which are before the collapse of the exterior ring.  They are harder to google but you&#39;ll find there is around a 22&#39; hole and no penetrations where the engines should have been.  If you examine the buildings face, prior to its collapse, it is hard to believe a plane impacted it.  There are also some additional groups such as Pilots for 9/11 Truth that speak to the impossibility of either the equipment or even a highly skilled pilot pulling off that approach. &quot;The highjackers&quot; could barely pilot a Cessna much less execute a 270 degree rapidly desending corkscrew that levels off less than 50&#39; above ground level before hitting the accounting section of the pentagon. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re still curious, Google &quot;WTC 7 freefall&quot; and see a 47 story, NYC-block sized, steel-frame building, collapse into its own footprint due to office fires on the afternoon of 9/11.   Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth are also a group of professionals who are experts in structural engineering and have concluded that the 3 NYC collapses are physically impossible.</p>

<p>There are lots of questions about that day.  Some of the events that comprise the official story are physically impossible and are questioned by the top professionals in their fields.  It&#39;s important for people to look at the evidence and keep asking questions.</p>

<p>I am very sceptical of A&amp;E911. Their member roster seems to be made up of many types who would know little about structural engineering - it&#39;s not hard to get a civil engineering degree, but it&#39;s very hard to be skilled in skyscraper structural dynamics. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>It sounds like you&#39;ve done some solid homework on the subject.  I&#39;m a sceptic of most things myself, so I appreciate your position.  The thing that I do like about A&amp;E911 is that they do open sourced studies and show their methodology and calculations (unlike NIST who will not show their calculations). </p>

<p>Have you looked at the WTC 7 collapse footage?  In my view WTC 7&#39;s total collapse (having not been hit by any plane) is the simplest proof of a controlled demolition. For a steel frame building to collapse in seconds, something has to make the tons of welded steel infrastructure fail simultaneously.</p>

<p>If total collapse of the WTC 7 structure was a normal consequence of simple office fires, you would imagine the building codes would need to be rewritten and improved.  Of course, no such changes are forthcoming because steel beams do not  simultaniously fail due to office fires.</p>

<p>While I don&#39;t have any illusion that America has the fortitude to bring the perpetrators of 9/11 to justice, it is important for science to continue to challenge the lies which we were told. </p>

<p>They may have gotten away with it, but if more people examine the facts and know it was staged, it will make it that much harder to lie America to war again.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The alt media storm was brewing and normal people were starting to get restless and ask questions. </p>

<p>I believe that is one of the main motives of the Boston bombing. It pushed things along and Sandy hook was suddenly forgotten. </p>

<p>I wonder if It was rushed or the date pushed up, and that&#39;s why Boston bombing was so poorly done. </p>

<p>There&#39;s an image of a guy with totally shredded jeans in the Boston bombing. Famous image. The pants look comically torn. Looks fake. </p>

<p>On youtube I saw a video of the bombing half a block away, from the second floor. The guy laid an iPad against a window and recorded the street. When the bombing goes off, you just see people run by. Then you see the guy with the pants go up to, I think a fire truck. An older guy in uniform then uses a knife to shred up his pants, and the guy runs back in the direction of the bombing!!</p>

<p>Stuff like this pretty much establishes the fraud, but no one focuses on the right things. If I knew about reditt back then I would have made a post about it.</p>

<p>Also, they interviewed the victims at the new unopened hospital (suspicious) they were all recovering at, and it was bizzare. They played video, like green screen stock video, in all the windows in the background. It gave the impression that the interviews were filmed on a stage. </p>

<p>I  think there&#39;s people in the intel. Agencies that are tasked with pulling off these false flags that don&#39;t really agree with the agenda, and they are trying to drop hints for us to pick up on. </p>

<p>My personal theory is this- the CIA is largely Mormon and Jewish. Robbie Parker of sandy hook for example comes from a big shot Mormon family. Easier to spot are the jews. These false flags have an improbable amount of Jewish people involved. Anyway, my theory is that the Mormons are not &#39;with&#39; the agenda of disarming America, and they are sabotaging these false flags.</p>

<p>The beginning of sandy hook false flag awareness was always Robbie Parkers devilish grin on camera....</p>

The logistics of how many killed and injured is a whatever. 10 more than 50 and 10 more than 60 doesn&#39;t change the news for the person on their couch watching the report on a TV.</p>

There is no need for a conspiracy for EVERYTHING! For fucks sake sometime people, a person does something truly fucked up. Stop feeding your head with crap, learn some critical thinking and get back to making a positive difference in the world instead of wasting your time inciting fear and suspicion!</p>

<p>As a former auditor of DoD contractors, I&#39;m sure his privacy would be related to his required security clearance.  He also owned multiple homes in mutliple states and was a millionaire with a gambling addiction.</p>

<p>Very simple life.  Very normal person.</p>

<p>Good point with the sniper.  How many weapons would a sniper bring to a nest like that, especially if they wanted to be undercover during the setup?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I really think people just needs there to be a greater reason then accepting some people do really bad things just because they want to.</p>

<p>No phenomena ever occurs without reason.  If we understand the reason, we can predict and prevent that phenomena from occuring again.</p>

<p>We just happen to be against mass shootings of fellow Americans.  That&#39;s why we care enough to question.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So here&#39;s a question - shouldn&#39;t this kind of thing have a storyline in place <em>before</em> it happens? Why the hell is it taking this long to figure out why this happened? If this were a government-driven thing I would expect the reasoning to have been established ahead of time. Our culture has such a short attention span that simply saying &quot;this guy killed a bunch of people because he was mad about this thing we want you to feel bad for&quot; should be a nice simple way be to inspire a groundswell of whatever emotion is desired. This, though, seems like it went off without a clear reason why, which is what I find the most troubling.</p>

<p>Unless, of course, the whole point was just to make people afraid of &quot;random acts of violence&quot;, which of course would make people clamor for more gun regulation.</p>

<p>Basically the FBI Chief of Las Vegas believes that there will be answers uncovered before a year anniversary of the tragedy, but at the time they still don&#39;t have much. Seems weird to me, almost like they&#39;re planning out when to release &quot;information&quot;. Strange. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why not stick with conspiracies that someone gains from or make sense like big pharma corruption.</p>

<p>Like, so what could they be covering up, absolute worst case? Because it&#39;s not like his shooting led to stricter gun regulations, or more lax ones, in fact as you say the media is silent so if it was orchestrated it was done so shittily that they then back peddled and toned down coverage of their own thing?</p>

<p>At least you can say orchestrating 9/11 gave an excuse to go for oil and war and shit, not that I think they did, it&#39;s just at least there&#39;s a motive there, groups in power don&#39;t do anything at random with no motive like a crazy old angry man might.</p>

<p>The footage might not be released or stuff reported because they still hope to catch someone related and it could botch an active case, either that or he&#39;s actually an escaped government agent and it was actually stolen super soldier serum that made him get roid rage and shoot all those people!</p>

<p>But seriously, what possibly do you think is going on? What dark sinister plot? What motive?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here’s an interesting comment I found on Facebook. I can’t find the source, so I don’t know... one thing that I do know is, most of the claims this person makes are verifiable with a couple quick google searches. Here it goes. </p>

<p>&quot;Last night, someone was on radio discussing the Las Vegas shooting and the connection to what is happening in Saudi Arabia.  They are connected.  I&#39;ll start at the beginning.</p>

<p>There was a King named King Fasal who has named a son, Prince AL Waleed, Bin Talal.  King Fasal took ill and named his brother Salman as king in his place.  King Salman has named his son as heir to the throne, instead of his brother&#39;s son Prince Al Waleed.  Al Waleed is a Wahhabi. Salman is Suni.  Wahhabi is extreme Islam.  Salman wanted a more modern, non extreme Islam for Saudi.  That&#39;s why he named his own son as heir.</p>

<p>In Las Vegas, Prince Al Waleed owned the upper floors of the Mandalay Bay resort including the 32nd floor.  That was one of the points of shooting at the strip.</p>

<p>I say one of the places, because the witnesses were all correct. There were other locations.  The Mandalay Bay has a Heli Pad on the roof.  That is important, because that was the escape route after the carnage.</p>

<p>Paddock was a pilot.  He was also a gun runner between the Philippines and the US</p>

<p>He was running guns for Prince Al Waleed. He didn&#39;t win at the casino. Those millions came from smuggling.</p>

<p>On the night of the attack, I found out that King Salman was in Las Vegas. (I didn&#39;t know that part until after the show and I received a missing piece of info.)  Salman was at the Tropicana.</p>

<p>The FBI knew Paddock was running guns.  They were tipped off.  They didn&#39;t know there was going to be an assassination attempt on Salman by Al Waleed (Salmans brother) just down the strip.
Paddock brought the guns as he usually did.  Instead of getting paid this time, he was killed.  He was victim one.  The guns were used to shoot at the country music venue.  That was to create chaos and distract from the real target over at the Tropicana.</p>

<p>Al Waleed&#39;s assassins shot from Mandalay Bay, but they also were at the Tropicana trying to kill Salman.  That explains why there were shooters on the ground as well as in the air.</p>

<p>Remember the videos of the helicopter fly over.  I asked why a helicopter would be there when there was a shooter high up.  It wasn&#39;t news, or cops.  It was the assassins who ran up the stairs to the roof from the 32nd floor.  Remember they sealed the door to the stairwell?  Paddock had access to the service elevator, because the boss said he could use the elevator, nobody questioned him.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the assassination attempt on Salman failed.  Now we are seeing the result of the failed attempt.  It was not only an assassination attempt and a terror attack, but an attempted coup in Saudi.  This is why everyone shut up in Las Vegas.  The response is still ongoing.  You are watching it play out.  As I said I spoke on air about this.  I will post links in comments to prove my story.  Las Vegas was definitely a terror attack.</p>

<p>Paddock was the gun runner.  Al Waleed, the owner of the suite was who is behind all of it.  All the witnesses citing multiple shooters all told the truth.  There were shootouts along the strip and in Mandalay Bay &amp; Tropicana Hotels.  The reason nobody is talking is it&#39;s not over yet.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some say Al Waleed was meeting with Trump when all this went down! That&#39;s why Trump went to Asia (under the guise of a holiday) which was really to &#39;lay low&#39; outside of the US (as he couldn&#39;t be sure of his safety there <em>until</em> all those involved were &#39;rounded up&#39; and arrested</p>

<p>Or, as with those like Waleed who tried to run, <em>coincidentally</em> died in a helicopter crash when trying to flee SA a few days later ... (afaik the helo was shot down by SA jets after refusing to stop)</p>

<p>Within a few weeks they had arrested 90% of those involved and DT returned to the US ... and the shit&#39;&#39;s continuing to hit the fan!</p>

<p>I&#39;m not an American and I watch what&#39;s going on with a reasonably objective eye ... I could understand how Trump got elected but I had no idea what kind of POTUS he&#39;d make ... and I&#39;ve been surprised</p>

<p>I&#39;ve come to the conclusion the guy is a Major Patriot who <em>really is trying</em> to MAGA! And he&#39;s Not in it for the money or the &#39;fame&#39; (which he&#39;s already got and which imo played a huge part in his electoral success, as &#39;the people&#39; kinda felt they &#39;knew him&#39;  and there&#39;s no comparison between him and the Cuntons who were deservedly well despised</p>

<p>Sure he&#39;s made a few mistakes BUT he&#39;s also done some impressive stuff when it comes to &quot;draining the swamp&quot;</p>

<p>As for dealing with shifty cunts, Trump&#39;s a guy who&#39;s had the mafia try to &#39;shake him down&#39; <em>every time</em> he built a hotel and he&#39;s built a few ... and he&#39;s survived that, which gives me confidence he&#39;s quite capable of &#39;seeing through&#39; the liars around him. </p>

<p>Plus he&#39;s got a group of &quot;old trusted friends&quot; who are not in the government But I have no doubt they advise him well and have a lot of influence of their own and want to help him &#39;drain the swamp&#39; .. they just never had a POTUS who also wanted to do the same!</p>

<p>IMHO he&#39;s doing a pretty good job for such a difficult position ... and he&#39;s smarter than many give him credit for, but the &#39;proof is in the pudding&#39; and we&#39;re beginning to see changes of the good kind thanks to him</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting theory, thanks for sharing what you saw.  I do have some questions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Let&#39;s say they were going to buy some weapons from Paddock as was mentioned.  Do people REALLY think they would haul many, many guns up to the 32 (or whatever) floor, to presumably inspect them and then they need to transport them ALL back DOWN the hotel into their vehicles.  It was admitted their target was in another hotel so there was no reason for Paddock to risk making multiple trips up to his room to load the guns, only for the Saudis to have to bring them back down.</li>
</ol>

<p>Second, as someone else mentioned, if they really wanted to escape using the helipad why create the chaos and have so much attention on this building?  I don&#39;t think hiding in plain sight works on this one.  Totally counter-intuitive. </p>

<p>Third, in Vegas there are MANY helicopters used to take tourists down the strip and sightseeing.  The activities took place so quick I doubt they were able to issue a &quot;land immediately&quot; alert for aircraft.</p>

<p>I still doubt the multiple shooters too.  With so many tall, glass buildings around the echo would be horrendous and be impossible to tell where the shots would be coming from.</p>

<p>I really think the Saudis and our government have involvement here.  There is little doubt of this.  I just can&#39;t connect the dots very well.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This keeps me up at night. There is a major piece of the puzzle I rarely see discussed.  Paddock went to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport on September 19th and rented an intermediate sized car and drove it back to Las Vegas in the same day.  How did he get to Phoenix?  Did he leave his vehicle?  Did he fly?  Why did he go?  What other stops did he make?  Who on the FBI&#39;s most wanted list flew into Phoenix around that time? Did any Saudi Nationals fly into Phoenix? Where did he go when he dropped the car off in Vegas at nearly 1am?  </p>

<p>Take step back and think about this.  A guy is planning a mass murder and 10 days prior he takes a day trip to another international airport to rent a mid size car only to drive back to where he came from?  </p>

<li><p>We have a Republican as president.

I think that is what&#39;s bothering everybody in this thread and around the country the most; you just can&#39;t accept the fact that he may very well have done this for kicks.</p>

<p>Sure he may of had some personal issue, or mental illness, but then again he may not of had anything wrong with him. Just because someone is a criminal, or a murderer, it doesn&#39;t mean they have something wrong with them to begin with. Most of the time, yes, but it&#39;s not a guarantee.</p>

<p>Accept the fact that some people just don&#39;t give a fuck. They realize that their existence is ultimately insignificant and regardless of their choices they are going to end up in a state of oblivion. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t believe that human sacrifice that has occurred over the span of human history simply stopped just because we got airplanes, cars, and the internet. I believe that spells, incantations or rituals have been passed down over the years involving highly secret societies that involve the ultimate sacrifice.  </p>

<p>And the worst part about it is I believe these &quot;spells&quot; actually work. There is a world behind the curtain that is metaphysical in nature that can be tapped into and manipulated through intention and rituals. </p>

<p>These mass killings that seemingly have mkultra patsies with vague details imo are designed to look like false flags so people are thrown off what really happened. Plus the timing and numerology etc...</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is footage where you can hear a helicopter and then see it duck behind the hotel and once shooting commences it flies out to the side. Would explain multiple shooters and would be in check with the bullet angles. Not to mention the concert gave a useful distraction that would ultimately contribute to the confusion of a crowd who for a good 9 mins have no idea what the hell is happening, leaving the shooters to open fire. Tactical. Cold blooded. Helicopters.  Planes...getting familiar..Given a risk management agency ETS owned 5 floors of the hotel ( that is owned by Saudi elites including Bin Talal - a recently deposed elite in a coup where 11 of his fellow princes who were also either told to resign, die in a mysterious helicopter crash etc and were mostly all in line to be king - it does seem very likely that extensive weapons cache is theirs and were in the hotel for an discriminate period of time. Given Trump condones  the new regimes  leader and a  public call out of the  Deep State  and his statement that 9/11 was perpetrated by Saudis (as was 93 WTC bombing), and the evidence that Obama ignored Saudi warlords in exchange for weapons sales, oil and land, it feels plausible that this is a false flag designed to keep the military industrial complex on path for perpetual war. America should have a powerful military. They just need it directed at the right people, Which includes saudi elites and their very own deep state heads. The attack could also have been An attempt at Khalid, the brother of Mohammad Bin Salid, who I believe had residence in Vegas. Did hardliner Saudis want to send a message and try kill their way back to power? Paddock was a patsy. He has to be. His brother I&#39;m sure got smeared with peadophile charges which I don&#39;t care if they&#39;re true, they helpfully diminish the paddock name and cement the idea that paddock was an unstable, possibly radicalised individual. .yeah right. And he also did it because he hates rednecks...yeah I&#39;ve actually seen that said on the news. The Saudi connection is too hot and couple that with the owner who withdrew stocks beforehand screams suspicious. The lack of coverage of a Saudi connection tells me trump&#39;s probably in negotiations with the new princes on how to deal with this. It&#39;s likely there&#39;s more attacks planned and I don&#39;t see exposing the Saudis as the Mandalay bay shooters as a useful national security tactic. I&#39;d rather see the deep state and Saudis BINNED and then release the information while it&#39;s safe to do so. </p>

<p>Forgive me if I got any minor details wrong..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I keep hearing the same old meme about how the media doesn&#39;t cover Vegas anymore from friends and podcasters.</p>

<p>Fact: There was wall-to-wall coverage for a week and it was still a hot story for one month. 
Fact: Tucker on Fox still occasionally mentions it, but he&#39;s not an investigator reporter, he is an entertainer.
Fact: The Vegas PD, FBI, hotel and the workers union are afraid of lawsuits (already had them) and do not want to give us all the info. It is technically still an open investigation to see if Paddock had help.
Fact: The best news we got came from Vegas newspapers and TV news outlets. Australian news also had good intel because of Marilou&#39;s connection there. The national news had its hands tied to dig further and sued because of it: <a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-las-vegas-lawsuit-20171101-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-las-vegas-lawsuit-20171101-story.html</a> 
Fact: Vegas PD said Paddock did it due to gambling debts. I know that it just as bad a blaming &quot;swamp gas&quot; for UFOs, but that was the sign for the media to drop it.
Fact: We will live in 24/7 clusterfuck news cycle in which the media focuses on Trump&#39;s Twitter feed and #metoo. Why does the media not cover the Halloween terrorist anymore? Even the NYC subway bomber is forgotten about. It&#39;s because there&#39;s nothing more to say and we live in a compressed timeline now where things happen faster. Leave it for alt news and opinion pieces. News implies &quot;NEWs&quot;, except when the MSM talks about the Trump Russian Collusion fake news every day.</p>

<p>I guess you guys want ace cub reporter Lois Lane to get to the bottom of the mystery? The conspiracy forums and blogs cover Vegas as much as they can. Even 4chan gave up on digging for new info. Local Vegas news still covers any time a survivor dies mysteriously. Paddock did it because he could. His whole family is warped.</p>

<p>Is there more to this story? Yes. But stop crying over the &quot;mainstream media&quot; not paying attention to it or is being &quot;silent&quot;. Fuck MSM. They ought to be &quot;silent&quot;. The police and hotel will not talk to local reporters. The story is dead but &quot;new&quot; facts will emerge once the civil suits go to court.</p>

<p>I mean what the fuck do you want Cooper Anderson to say? &quot;Breaking News: We have no new leads about the motives of Las Vegas Shooter Stephen Paddock. His brain autopsy was negative, his brother got arrested, 5 survivors died since then, not sure if Jesus Campos ever got that bullet removed, and a sheriff went missing for 18 hours. But we will let you know everyday that there is no new news.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-gambler-20171009-story.html">http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-vegas-shooting-gambler-20171009-story.html</a></p>

<p>There are plenty of people who literally make their living by gambling. Second, Stephen Paddock made most of his fortune from his companies and being an accountant. While Paddock was a Vegas whale, he also was losing a lot of money lately according to the records. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.casino.org/news/stephen-paddock-was-on-gambling-losing-streak-prior-to-shooting">https://www.casino.org/news/stephen-paddock-was-on-gambling-losing-streak-prior-to-shooting</a></p>

<p>So yes, he got his money from somewhere. It&#39;s called being an accountant and owning several companies. It&#39;s dumb easy to find out exactly how Stephen Paddock made his money. I don&#39;t understand why people pretend like this isn&#39;t readily available information. </p>
