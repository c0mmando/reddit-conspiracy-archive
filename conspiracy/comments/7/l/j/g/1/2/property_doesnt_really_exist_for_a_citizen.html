       Just a thought/thought experiment that came to my mind today.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't really own anything as a citizen. How could you. There is no way you can realistically protect what you "own", which I think is something that is a significant component of owning something.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I pluck an apple from a tree, I could be said to own it. But if someone comes along who is stronger than me and just takes it away from me, am I really the owner? Or am I just someone who believes in an illusion?
      </p>
      <p>
       Though, the one strong enough to take it away AND keep it, I think that one can realistically be called an owner. That person really owns the apple.
      </p>
      <p>
       My point is, I think that we don't really own anything. In reality, it's the government that owns everything. And our role in it? Our role is just to be temporary caretakers of it. We are, at the mercy of our rulers, granted the liberty to manage our so-called property.
      </p>
      <p>
       But if the government decides that we should no longer have it, there is not a single thing we can do about it. What does that mean? It means we don't own it. We have absolutely zero means to stop a government from taking "our" stuff away. So in no realistic way is it actually "ours". In my opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
       And when someone steals from you? In most places the only thing you can do is go tell the government about it. To inform them that someone has taken the governments property away from you, the manager of that government property, despite you having been promised that you would be the manager. In other words, the only thing you can do is go cry to momma and hope she fixes it.
      </p>
      <p>
       So the only person that can realistically make sure that you get to keep "your" property is the government. You aren't allowed to take care of that yourself. Then you would be considered a vigilante, or worse.
      </p>
      <p>
       Again, the only reasonable conclusion imo is that it's not really "yours" in any meaningful sense.
      </p>
      <p>
       Rather, it all comes down to a trick of language/our ideology. Our ideology has invented the term "ownership" and delusionally distorted it to something that will make a citizen feel good, motivated and effective. The idea that they have power over their "property". Yet of course they don't. They only borrow the government's property, and then they only get to use the government's power to "protect" their so-called property.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the very same sense it could be said that the government owns us as people. When it comes down to it, we have absolutely zero autonomy. The only autonomy we have is an illusion granted to us to make us more efficient and motivated, and of course very limited and with strict constraints and conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
       This ties into something else that I've been thinking for a while ... when people are motivated to whine about their "human rights" and stuff like that - I always have to cringe a little. Why? Because it's pathetic and has zero dignity. The only reason you can cry about your "rights" and your so-called "freedom" is because the government allows you this illusion of "rights" and "freedoms". Yet while you are led to believe these rights are somehow inherent to who you are, they are really much more inherent to what the government wants you to be.
      </p>
      <p>
       To cry "I am free! I have rights!" is to assert your freedom by referring to your slavery (your submission to the concept of "rights" that you have been indoctrinated with and made to rely upon since your birth). And that's just ridiculous. It's like screaming "I have submitted myself completely to the belief system you demanded me to submit to, and now I expect you to abide by it!" It's an exclamation of complete powerlessness. If you aren't powerful enough to control your own thoughts and belief systems and are required (with no exception) to submit to what you're told, how can you possibly delude yourself into thinking that you have any power whatsoever to change how you are being treated? When the only reason you even dare to speak up is that you've been told that that is expected of you?
      </p>
      <p>
       But maybe that's the whole point ... one is so powerless and in such utter submission that one is not even allowed to recognize that one is not free. One is so much a slave that one is powerless to NOT believe in one's own freedom. Powerless to NOT protest and cry wolf and demand one's "rights". It's not you demanding your rights because you have some - it's you throwing a temper tantrum because that is what the puppet player wants you to do.

       Slavery still exists, everyone is a slave if you think about it.  Before the abolishment of slavery, slaves were provided housing and food, in exchange for labor.
       <br/>
       Well, that's what we do almost everyday of our lives, we go to work to make money to pay for food and housing.
       <br/>
       And those completely on government welfare are provided housing and food but dont foot the bill really, the taxpayers do, which go to work and have money taken from paychecks to pay for those programs. The "working class" are the true slaves.  The wealthy do not pay taxes, and certainly do not provide their own labor.

       Alright, how bout this. If slavery is "someone stronger" taking 100% of someone's earnings and/or property at what percentage can it no longer be considered slavery? 50% ? 33% ?

       The point is that you are helpless to stop that person from taking something from you. That is the part where it's slavery. The rest is just negotiating comfortable terms of being a slave.

       Agreed. I've had trouble explaining this very point in the past to those who are true believers of the idea that "We live in America, we're free"  yet also feel the need to arm themselves. I'm all for the 2nd amendment and all, but boy do they get defensive when their worldview is challenged. Clutch your  gun all you want while you're over that barrel by all means. ;)

       I'd love to be able to own a gun (I live in Germany), but I am in no illusion about the fact that the only reason I'd have it is because someone is letting me have it. (Unless I go full-retard revolutionary/outlaw, that is)

       That's kinda my response, without the full retard bit, saying "what are you goining to do start an armed rebellion? who do you know that would have your back? " because thats what it would take. I bet nobody knows more than 3 people no matter what country. Despite the testosterone and bravado everyone has a vested interest in the life they've built for themselves and they love their servitude. If you don't you're easily marginalized as defective in some way.

       All ownership is maintained by force. Private property is an inherently violent institution, the "private" in particular means stopping other people from using it. It doesn't grant you any additional rights to "own" a piece of land, it only
       <em>
        removes
       </em>
       rights from other people when they set foot on that land.
      </p>
      <p>
       Government masses all force under one heading and makes it subservient to Law. That is, there is an impartial system of rules to govern the use and transfer of property. Law treats all people as equals and weighs claims based on a set of rules that are universal (non-universal rules would be ones like nepotism, or racism, or sexism, or any rule that changes based on the people involved). This universality of law is what makes it "fair" in the same way that Monopoly has the same rules for all players, even the banker. Is it always perfect? No, sometimes the force of government is abused and the law is disregarded. However, absent a government, you have pure might-makes-right with no law, the strongest person or groups gets everything they can steal.
      </p>
      <p>
       So:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         Property with government: fair in theory, usually but not always fair in practice
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Property without government: unfair in theory, unfair in practice
        </p>
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
       Force still governs it, but at least under a democratic government you have some say in its use. Not perfect, but better than lawless warlordism, where the strength of a property claim is equal to the strength of the person making the claim.

       The government is the warlord and the one making the strongest claim. It just realizes that people will stay more peaceful if they're allowed some - however limited - illusion of possession.

       Fair is none of it, but no one said life has to be fair. In fact, I dare argue life can impossibly be fair in the form that we experience/live it currently or to use different words, in the universe that we currently inhabit.

       Temporary caretakers indeed, one day when I'm gone someone else will be calling my home their home. Additionally, they will be paying property taxes on a house long ago paid off that will still be generating money for government till it's destroyed. Nothing goes across to wherever we go, when you get called home to dinner from the sandbox you don't get to take so much as one marble.

       I read property tax was created to make it impossible to ever own land. Don't pay the tax and the government takes your land- even if it's fully paid for. I'm sure the super-wealthy have a loop-hole workaround this that's unattainable for the common man.

       Rather, it all comes down to a trick of language/our ideology. Our ideology has invented the term "ownership" and delusionally distorted it to something that will make a citizen feel good, motivated and effective. The idea that they have power over their "property". Yet of course they don't. They only borrow the government's property, and then they only get to use the government's power to "protect" their so-called property.

        In the very same sense it could be said that the government owns us as people. When it comes down to it, we have absolutely zero autonomy. The only autonomy we have is an illusion granted to us to make us more efficient and motivated, and of course very limited and with strict constraints and conditions.

      <p>
       Uhh, you kind of skipped over the explanation there. You could just be a criminal and not be owned by the government, but I don't know what you mean by owned by the government. If you mean following the law, maybe? But then you can also use your time to speak out against the government, to fund civil rights organizations that sue the government (and even win sometimes). Glossing over your options on opposing the government, even within the law, is disingenuous when you say the government owns you.

       Speaking out against the government is a luxury granted to you by that government, nothing more. It's in no way a substantial power of yours.

       You surrender your property by being part of the system. Your birth certificate is your registration to the government, They now own you and you possessions because your deemed incapable of handing your assets due to being "dead" or lost at sea. Your taxes are payments to use the government's services, its all a corrupt system ment to confuse you with language.

       Bitcoin is going to change this.
      </p>
      <p>
       The old money system is based on debt. The Bitcoin-system is based on personal ownership. But money is just one small part of Bitcoin. It is the killer app. But the list of other applications is endless.
      </p>
      <p>
       You can directly own a fraction of your house. 1,000 shares out of 15,000 for instance. The record that you own this part is shown in the blockchain.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin is an A.I. It is a tool. It will allow us to build robots that work for us. This will bring great levels of peace of wealth to humans on earth.

       But Bitcoin is ultimately flawed. The government still controls the infrastructure and there are only about 10.000 active nodes. Easy to create the same amount of fake nodes and take over the network.

       Government needs to kill internet and keep it turned off to kill Bitcoin. Never will this happen.
      </p>
      <p>
       Bitcoin does not need hundreds of thousands of nodes to be censorship-resistant. If even half the banks in the world run a node it's done. Add Wallmarts and you're more done.
