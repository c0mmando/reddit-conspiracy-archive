        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>I was listening to star talk podcasts and a huge fan of Neil Degrasse Tyson (NDT) for several years. However, starting about a year ago, I stopped paying attention to him bc he seemed to just be saying a bunch of bullshit that had no substance. like wtf? who wants to hear about the science of basketball or whatever on a space podcast. I noticed it on his press interviews and the documentaries he made. All fluff, no stuff.</p>

<p>Now that UFOs are in mainstream media he is really showing his true shill colors. I would include Bill Nye in the same boat.</p>

<p>Both of them are prob the most popular liaisons between the overall community and the scientific communities. these guys and scientists have become like the clergy of the 21st century. Backwards and unwilling to see beyong the  paradigm they are struggling to maintain firm footing even when it is obvious that the ground is shifting beneath their feet.</p>

<p>They are demotivating and provide disinformation to teens and adults, posing as omniscient rulers of the scientific community. Scientists need to wake the F up and realize they have been manipulated and thwarted by politicans and corrupt fucks whose single aim seems to be keeping humanity in the dark ages.
We need to look carefull at the global scientific community. Scientists can peddle corrupt info same as anyone else.</p>

<p>What happens when a scientist speaks up outside of currently held beliefs? Grant money cancelled, research stops, reputation is ruined, you r done. </p>

<p>I repeat, scientists have become the clergy of today. I think it is time that we question the basic foundation on which these ppl are peddling what they call facts.</p>

<p>I just figure he is running his course and within a few years there will be a new scientist media type. Hope it&#39;s a hot chick this time.</p>

<p>I do not think a fair comparison can be made between BTSGN and NDT.</p>

<p>Between CS and NDT? Well of course. </p>

<p>If not for Carl there would be no Neil as we know him.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson">Tyson said, &quot;I already knew I wanted to become a scientist. But that afternoon, I learned from Carl the kind of person I wanted to become.&quot;</a></p>

<p>He says that science doesn&#39;t care what you think and that it&#39;ll just move on without you. He&#39;s trying to pedal scientism. He wants us to just believe the science man in the labcoat and never to question anything. Just believe.</p>

<p>He is getting paid to say what he says? Yes. It his his career   He is in public for different things but sometimes he is promoting a book.  Others the Hayden Planetarium. </p>

<p>Saying thought out pre-written comments on topics.  Scripted!!?!?! Oh no!</p>

<p>But if you think he is keeping some big fucking thing a secret you are mistaken. </p>

<p>His biggest detractors go off about the pear shaped world thing. Well this mockery is only showing their ignorance. They just don&#39;t understand why it means when NGT states this. </p>

<p>If he states anything that doesn&#39;t fit to our information as it stands his <em>peers</em> would be all over him, let alone the hordes of yootoob reesurchers</p>

<p>I just figure he is running his course and within a few years there will be a new scientist media type. Hope it&#39;s a hot chick this time.</p>

<p>I do not think a fair comparison can be made between BTSGN and NDT.</p>

<p>Between CS and NDT? Well of course. </p>

<p>If not for Carl there would be no Neil as we know him.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I understand that fully, but it’s worth noting how specifically NDT promotes the idea in Cosmos and his books that science is all about understanding that anyone can be wrong, including yourself, and to question everything, question authority especially.

    <div class="md"><p>Probably because, as a scientist, he doesn&#39;t actually have any data to work with...doesn&#39;t even know if it WAS a &quot;craft&quot; or possibly something else entirely, including even an equipment malfunction of some kind.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to get upset with a scientist for requiring more information before arriving at a conclusion, then you should probably be even more upset with people arriving at the &quot;alien&quot; conclusion with such little evidence present thus far. It&#39;s no different than religions filling in gaps of scientific knowledge throughout history with the explanation of &quot;God&quot;, before scientific understanding eventually caught up to explain certain natural phenomena.</p>

<p>Neil is just saying people shouldn&#39;t be afraid of &quot;not knowing&quot;. We should be curious, but we shouldn&#39;t just jump to conclusions...we should explore possibilities. People who think like Neil are the only reason we have modern medicine and technology today.</p>

<p>Up until this new footage had a government stamp, he would immediately shit on the idea of UFOs, and the possibility that our current physics is wrong, and that these have existed for a century almost.</p>

<p>It’s like, just because he hadnt seen it, it was pseudoscience.  Now that there are videos out he’s willing to be “curious” about it?  Whether you see something or not, it still exists.</p>

<p>He just has acted like the shit never existed until it was confirmed recently, and that’s my problem with him, and people like him claiming to be scientists.  There’s nothing scientific about ignoring the possibility of something’s existence, because the science and math and all that exists already until we uncover it.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No, that’s not what I’m saying. I don’t want him to jump to conclusions, but he failed to show any intellectual curiosity or provide any analysis whatsoever of the crafts movements on video (aka, data he COULD work with). He’s a physicist supposedly and I would expect some sort of educated commentary from him based on the established facts thus far instead of a casual dismissal of it all. His tone wasn’t skeptical, but cynical and it felt completely un-scientific; as unscientific as making assumptions about god or aliens would be.</p>

<p>“including even an equipment malfunction of some kind.”
This really shows how little you’ve looked into it- we’re way past “equipment malfunction” “swamp gas” or “fly on the lens” territory with this one. Our options at this point are: 1) extraterrestrials, or 2) humans with paradigm-shifting technology at their disposal. I am excited and concerned about either of those and I don’t see how people can just shrug it off and go about their business.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Scientists still require more data before arriving at conclusions. Footage can be doctored/manipulated/manufactured. We&#39;re in a conspiracy subreddit, after all, and this particular footage was provided by the Pentagon.

    <div class="md"><p>You’re mixing things. NDT isn’t a conspiracy sub member, he is part of the mainstream, so I’m not buying that he doesn’t think the footage can be trusted for that reason. This is exactly the kind of source that someone like him would ONLY trust. Footage can be doctored, and the pilots could have lied- but again, this implies a default setting of cynicism from someone like him and not open minded scientific skepticism. I wasn’t demanding hard conclusions from him, just very disappointed with his lack of useful analysis or anything interesting to say really.</p>

<p>Now, as conspiracy-minded people, I think it’s more than fair for you and I to question the motives behind this release. I’m more concerned in that case if it’s not extraterrestrial, because I think the deep state must be pretty desperate if they’re willing to show off some of their big guns. Don’t drag moon landing or flat earth into this, I’m neither of those people and that argument isn’t relevant to the point I’m making.</p>

<p>Just want to remind everyone to keep an open mind always. It could be aliens, or it could be something else we just haven&#39;t figured out yet. Perhaps the Pentagon had a specific reason for releasing this footage at this time (distraction from other news, or maybe part of a long term goal of convincing the public we need to &quot;weaponize space&quot; against &quot;evil alien&quot; threats?), or perhaps their hand was forced in some way...we don&#39;t know yet.</p>

<p>You asked for a modern example of the clergy exerting it&#39;s influence. Transgender ban, about face change in &quot;gay wedding cake&quot; case. Does me bringing him up in this context trigger you?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is so insulting about being compared to the clergy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I mean did you even read the post or are you just trying to attack me now? If you had read OP you&#39;d know what I&#39;m referencing here. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t project so much when trying to argue. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Guys, I guarantee that someone today was burned or stoned alive due to some religious clergy assfucks. It was probably a woman. And that society I guarantee you, doesn’t value science. Seriously grow up.</p>

<p>If you’re so concerned with corporate tainting of science, become scientifically literate and sort through obvious bullshit. Stop demonizing science because you’re afraid of higher intelligence or education. Especially considering science is literally the reason you’re able to have this conversation. To compare science to modern clergy basically means you don’t understand either groups. If scientists wanted to tell you it’s all magic and that’s why you should obey them, they could. We would have zero recourse. Instead, they are some of the most adamant educators on the planet and publish in open journals. True corrupt science isn’t even actually science, and any well tempered opinion can help you figure out what is horse shit. Jesus christ, people.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>People have very little difficulty accepting that many of the most famous movies stars have benefitted from the casting couch by letting themselves be physically exploited for career progression.</p>

<p>The exact same process exists in academia, except the exploitation is mental (both have a moral component). Academics who choose to support certain narratives, despite rational analysis clearly arguing against it will find themselves being endorsed and offered far more high profile and lucrative opportunities than they otherwise would. </p>

<p>In every field, from journalism and politics, through acting and academia, possessing moral integrity is almost guaranteed to ensure that your life is more of a struggle and that your successes fail to garner the attention they should. </p>

<p>Among the reasons this system endures:
1. The majority of people are not particularly moral (or immoral, just self-oriented) and so have little interest in those that are.
2. An ability to play dirty is almost always a benefit to career progression.
3. Immoral people focus on gaining power while moral people focus on enacting change, given the same opportunities one will accumulate influence, the other will disperse it.
4. Immoral people are more likely to conspire, and work together for mutual-advancement, moral people are more likely to work individually (career-wise) under the assumption that merit will see them get what they deserve.</p>

<p>There are no clear ways of changing the above apart from moral people to become more aware of certain realities and realise that change is impossible without coordinated action.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>My issue with NDT is his arrogance. Great minds encourage young people to think for themselves, they dont dictate their take on the facts as gospel, they encourage kids to challenge them. Science is far more advanced than it was 100 years ago, even 10 years ago. </p>

<p>The arrogance of someone who doesnt believe that 100 years from now 90% of what he knows will be laughed at as it is so far wrong is too much for me. </p>

<p>I can taste the bile on my tounge every time I hear that condescending tone he takes with people who question him. He should step back and take a few notes as to how true genius treats a challenge; true genius embraces challenge, change, and new ideas, they dont blame shame and disgrace new ideas. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem is not with science or scientists.  The problem is the amount of faith the average American has in the truth of the words that come out of the manipulation conduit (ie. television, social media).  Science is founded on questioning what is known and determining what is unknown.  Science is not concerned with ratings or profit.  Consider this; how much time does a scientist who has national/international for-profit tours, a full scale television series, makes the talk show rounds, etc. have to spend furthering the breadth of human understanding?</p>

<p>You&#39;re telling me that a guy who studies astrophysics isn&#39;t an expert on the US military or extraterrestrial crafts and that is shilling or misinformation? Maybe he actually doesn&#39;t believe that it is anything more than a black budget project. Regardless, that&#39;s not his fucking area of study.</p>

<p>Up until now,  we have been on a hero kick,  a celebrity kick.    Then we had the celebrity of the day,   making spectacles out of reality show bumblers.    For example,  Trump.   Honey Boo Boo.</p>

<p>We are coming to a point where its already obvious what the will of the people is, thanks to the databases available on the internet,  but the elites want to keep that information to themselves regardless.    So,  they keep passing laws for themselves and against us.</p>

<p>In this war,  if we had heroes,  that would be the end of it,  it would just be a repetition of the old pattern.   That mold needs to be broken.    Lets honor the experts without setting them up on pedistals,  experts like the engineers who exposed the lies of the 9/11 cover up.   Guys like Kevin Ryan are my non-heroes.    More like mentors.</p>

Given the immense distances between star systems and the lack of evidence for extraterrestrials, it is parsimonious to assume that any unidentified aircraft (if they are actually, aircraft) are terrestrial in origin.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>From my experience working in academia withing the <em>sciences</em>, people are often very anti establishment, because of all of the reasons you stated. They feel that we are not moving forward fast enough and that politicians have no interest in scientific truth. That&#39;s the beautiful thing about science, it forces one to care about facts.</p>

<p>So I don&#39;t think you will ever see academics in STEM acting like clergy. As for the social sciences, I think that is a much more politically influenced realm.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>the science delusion is a really good book on this subject. we need to take this reasoning a step further tho. you said scientists need to wake the fuck up. who are &#39;scientists&#39;? people with phds and masters degrees in biology and physics and engineering. people who can afford to go to school. as long as their chosen career path involves funding. so it should come as no surprise that the studies and scientists that govts and universities want to fund are not necessarily in line with whats best for the people. in essence telling mainstream scientists to &#39;wake up&#39; as if they are not completely aware of what theyre doing is tantamount to telling a ciswhitechadbro to check his privilege and then being shocked when he gets defensive.</p>

<p>now we&#39;ve come to the heart of the issue. what is the &#39;scientific method&#39; anyway? put simply the scientific method is observation. you make an observation, create a hypothesis based on that, test it out and observe what happens. like dipping your toe in the water to check the temperature before you jump in, every human being everywhere does shit like this every day. the people need to wake up. the people need to be empowered. you should not be surprised that the govt doesnt want to pay for health care and education. you should not be surprised that the &#39;educators&#39; and &#39;health experts&#39; that get the most attention arent really trustworthy. a healthy well educated well informed public is the most dangerous thing to an authoritarian government.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re going to get upset with a scientist for requiring more information before arriving at a conclusion, then you should probably be even more upset with people arriving at the &quot;alien&quot; conclusion with such little evidence present thus far. It&#39;s no different than religions filling in gaps of scientific knowledge throughout history with the explanation of &quot;God&quot;, before scientific understanding eventually caught up to explain certain natural phenomena.</p>

<p>Neil is just saying people shouldn&#39;t be afraid of &quot;not knowing&quot;. We should be curious, but we shouldn&#39;t just jump to conclusions...we should explore possibilities. People who think like Neil are the only reason we have modern medicine and technology today.</p>
