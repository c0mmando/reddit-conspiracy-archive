       These are governments admitting that
       <em>
        they
       </em>
       were responsible for false flag attack. The post covers a large range of plots and techniques. Since it's fairly long, here are a few extracts (everything is sourced, see the link above for the original article):
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        <p>
         The British government admits that--between 1946 and 1948--it bombed 5 ships carrying Jews who were Holocaust survivors attempting to flee to safety in Palestine right after World War II, set up a fake group called “Defenders of Arab Palestine”, and then had the psuedo-group falsely claim responsibility for the bombings.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The former Italian Prime Minister, an Italian judge, and the former head of Italian Counterintelligence, admit that NATO, with the help of the Pentagon and CIA, carried out terror bombings in Italy and other European countries in the 1950s through the 1980s and blamed the communists, in order to rally people’s support for their governments in Europe in their fight against communism.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         As admitted by the U.S. government, recently declassified documents show that in 1962, the American Joint Chiefs of Staff signed off on a plan to blow up
         <em>
          American
         </em>
         airplanes (using an elaborate plan involving the switching of airplanes), and also to commit terrorist acts on American soil, and then to blame it on the Cubans in order to justify an invasion of Cuba.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A top Turkish general admitted that Turkish forces burned down a mosque on Cyprus in the 1970s and blamed it on their enemy. He explained: “In Special War, certain acts of sabotage are staged and blamed on the enemy to increase public resistance. We did this on Cyprus; we even burnt down a mosque.”
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A Mossad agent admits that, in 1984, Mossad planted a radio transmitter in Gaddaffi’s compound in Tripoli, Libya, which broadcast fake terrorist transmissions recorded by Mossad, in order to frame Gaddaffi as a terrorist supporter. Ronald Reagan bombed Libya immediately thereafter.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         In 1993, a bomb in Northern Ireland killed 9 civilians. Official documents from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (i.e. the British government) show that the mastermind of the bombing was a British agent, and that the bombing was designed to inflame sectarian tensions.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         The United States Army’s 1994 publication Special Forces Foreign Internal Defense Tactics Techniques and Procedures for Special Forces--updated in 2004--recommends employing terrorists and using false flag operations to destabilize leftist regimes in Latin America. False flag terrorist attacks were carried out in Latin America and other regions as part of the CIA’s “Dirty Wars“.
        </p>

       <li>
        <p>
         Senior Russian Senior military and intelligence officers admit that the KGB blew up Russian apartment buildings in 1999 and falsely blamed it on Chechens, in order to justify an invasion of Chechnya.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Although the FBI now admits that the 2001 anthrax attacks were carried out by one or more U.S. government scientists, a senior FBI official says that the FBI was actually told to blame the Anthrax attacks on Al Qaeda by White House officials. Government officials also confirm that the white House tried to link the anthrax to Iraq as a justification for regime change in that country.

       <li>
        <p>
         Police outside of a 2003 European Union summit in Greece were filmed planting Molotov cocktails on a peaceful protester.

         In 2011, a Colombian colonel admitted that he and his soldiers had lured 57 innocent civilians and killed them – after dressing many of them in uniforms – as part of a scheme to claim that Columbia was eradicating left-wing terrorists.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Two members of the Turkish parliament, high-level American sources and others admitted that the Turkish government – a NATO country – carried out the chemical weapons attacks in Syria and falsely blamed them on the Syrian government; and high-ranking Turkish government admitted on tape plans to carry out attacks and blame it on the Syrian government.

         Burmese government officials admitted that Burma (renamed Myanmar) used false flag attacks against Muslim and Buddhist groups within the country to stir up hatred between the two groups, to prevent democracy from spreading.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Britain’s spy agency has admitted (and see this) that it carries out “digital false flag” attacks on targets, framing people by writing offensive or unlawful material … and blaming it on the target.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         A former U.S. intelligence officer recently alleged: "Most terrorists are false flag terrorists or are created by our own security services." He has himself admitted to carrying out a false flag attack.
        </p>
       </li>
       <li>
        <p>
         Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Ron Suskind reported that the White House ordered the CIA to forge and backdate a document falsely linking Iraq with Muslim terrorists and 9/11 … and that the CIA complied with those instructions and in fact created the forgery, which was then used to justify war against Iraq

       So true. I didn't vote for bush in 2000, but after 9/11 I was all in in '04. Started waking up in '05 thanks to Katrina. Then I discovered the truthers. Haven't looked back.

       The Russian bombings in 99.. as far as I'm aware they denied it, saying it was just a practice and that the bomb was actually full of sugar. Source in the article doesn't confirm this either, it cites an exiled former politician who makes claims about "hearing phonecalls". This is in no way officially admitted by the government as they still claim it was Chechnyans.
