<p>“There is a large ice wall around the flat earth, even if there wasn’t, the government still would not let you proceed any further, possibly hiding the truth.”</p>

<p>“There is no gravity, if gravity did exist we wouldn’t be able to jump or lift our feet up as it’s powerful enough to pull down our whole bodies, therefore we would be pinned to the ground.”</p>

<p>“Earth is not spinning” </p>

<p>As the moon is a sphere, and let’s say there isn’t gravity, how is it possible to not fall off?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Do you believe in GPS? Find out how it works. 
If the earth was flat, gravity would be greater as you got further from the centre - this is not the case.
If gravity didnt exist, why don&#39;t we just float like balloons? How could we have an atmosphere? How would she explain a black hole, neutron star etc etc. You can observe planets in retrograde motion, what explains this with more probability than our current understanding of the solar system? Why do different latitudes have different amounts of daylight? The scientific data surrounding our globe is immense, freely available and consistent.
Put the onus of proof on her, then try to apply her answer to our physical system as a whole, don&#39;t let her cop out with &#39;muh government lies&#39;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well.. let&#39;s talk about buoyancy, which is the flat earth explanation of gravity.</p>

<p>If I suck all the air out of a vacuum chamber and place a helium filled balloon inside it, what will happen? </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BYVIS7ARek">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BYVIS7ARek</a></p>

<p>What can explain why those balloons fell? They were floating just fine until the air pressure was reduced, but then they fell. The only force acting upon them was gravity. That is why they fell once the air around them became less dense.</p>

<p>That is visible physical proof of the existence of gravity.</p>

<p>Gravity keeps them afloat when the air pressure is higher than the helium pressure in the balloons by pulling the more dense air downwards more strongly than the less dense helium.</p>

<p>But gravity also makes them fall when the air pressure around them is lower than the helium pressure in the balloons.</p>

<p>Without gravity, there is no buoyancy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how does density decide which way the balloon will move?</p>

<p>Even if I accept the premise that the denser helium will cause the balloon to move in a vacuum, that doesn&#39;t explain why it <em>always</em> falls to the center of mass of the earth below it.</p>

<p>What force is acting on the balloon and why does it always fall down? Why not sideways?</p>

<p>Once you identify the force causing the balloon to fall downwards, next explain how that force is different from gravity.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your mum rocks. I recently became a flat earther, and I realize that I&#39;m seen as a total nutbag, but I don&#39;t care. I don&#39;t persecute other people for their beliefs, I&#39;ve always said that people can believe whatever they like so long as it does not directly effect me, and I don&#39;t see how believing in what is literally written in the bible causes harm to anyone. On top of what your mum has said, there are many, many reasons that strike me as interesting on this topic... </p>

<ul>
<li>there&#39;s no visible curvature, even from a plane at 40,000 feet.</li>
<li>buildings on the horizon are not tilted away from you.</li>
<li>you can&#39;t go to antarctica, they&#39;re obviously hiding something, I don&#39;t really care what, but it&#39;s weird.</li>
<li>there is no allowance for the curvature of the earth in construction (railways for example).</li>
<li>polaris is visible from Australia.</li>
<li>the moon very obviously gives off it&#39;s own light and isn&#39;t reflecting the sun.</li>
<li>the bible describes a flat non-moving earth on pillars with a dome firmament.</li>
<li>the book of Enoch, specifically &#39;the book of the course of the heavenly luminaries&#39; which describes the movement of the sun, moon, stars, and &#39;planets&#39; across a flat earth.</li>
<li>that leaked NASA video of the astronauts faking a round earth through the window of a &#39;space shuttle&#39;</li>
<li>the incredibly fake moon landings, seriously, look at that crap, the same backgrounds in every photo when they are supposed to have moved miles, or even on different mission!</li>
<li>not a single image from space is real, they are all composites and photoshop.</li>

    <div class="md"><p>I come back occasionally to scan over these threads and it&#39;s funny that you always see the same trends, &quot;I was triggered enough to take the time to not only down vote you, but also chime in to call you a retard- but not enough to give anything to refute/debunk what you said. I have proof I&#39;ve tested myself b/c said so- you just take my word for it like we all do NASA&#39;s.&quot; </p>

<p>Or the, &quot;Here&#39;s the same ol&#39; debunking lines/proofs that globe skeptics have debunked yesterday back at us- but they are true again today, b/c said so.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, the moon landings were fake- but that was a different NASA that gives us pictures today, so we can believe it now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, the globe was proven (proposed) before NASA by sun worshipping Freemasons, and the like, so it makes it true now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, look at these pictures taken through fisheye lenses that make everything round, see- everything is round!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh look at these CGI pictures of stars and planets that are round!&quot; Billiard balls are round, therefore the table must be round as well.</p>

<p>We could go on and on back and forth untill we&#39;re all tired and annoyed.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>there&#39;s no visible curvature, even from a plane at 40,000 feet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, there is. It&#39;s just exceedingly small. With a high enough definition photo, and an accurate enough &quot;ruler&quot; you will be able to measure it.</p>

<p>To put it in perspective, here is a scale image of part of the earth&#39;s surface.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/8Olk3I0.png">http://i.imgur.com/8Olk3I0.png</a></p>

<p>The scale is set so that one pixel equates to a square with sides 8 inches long. The width of the image (15,840 pixels) equates to two miles. Given the earth&#39;s known curvature, each end of a two mile line must be eight inches below the center. In this image the ends of the green line are <em>one</em> pixel below the center.</p>

<p>You can open the image yourself in paint and measure the line directly. </p>

<p>But when you look at that line, it sure as hell <em>looks</em> flat, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>That&#39;s why the curvature is &quot;not visible&quot; - its because your eyes do not have the ability to resolve such small measurements. But given the right equipment, it <em>can</em> be measured.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It has actually been known that the Earth was round since the time of the ancient Greeks. I believe that it was Pythagoras who first proposed that the Earth was round sometime around 500 B.C. As I recall, he based his idea on the fact that he showed the Moon must be round by observing the shape of the terminator (the line between the part of the Moon in light and the part of the Moon in the dark) as it moved through its orbital cycle. Pythagoras reasoned that if the Moon was round, then the Earth must be round as well. After that, sometime between 500 B.C. and 430 B.C., a fellow called Anaxagoras determined the true cause of solar and lunar eclipses - and then the shape of the Earth&#39;s shadow on the Moon during a lunar eclipse was also used as evidence that the Earth was round.</p>

<p>Around 350 BC, the great Aristotle declared that the Earth was a sphere (based on observations he made about which constellations you could see in the sky as you travelled further and further away from the equator) and during the next hundred years or so, Aristarchus and Eratosthenes actually measured the size of the Earth!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The sphere is the most common shape in the universe. Once something accumulates enough mass, it starts to sphere-ize itself. Have you ever been on a plane? You can see the horizon. Volkswagon has a test track thats supposed to be fully flat, but because the main straight is 5 1/2 miles long, you can&#39;t see the end of it due to the curviature of the earth.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to go further because I find flat earth to be ridiculous and nothing but a poke at people whom actually question things. If your research ever shows something credible, post it. Other than that my warning is that flat earth is simply there to waste your time.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a fact at all. There are plenty of images that show the earth is a sphere. It&#39;s just that certain morons refuse to believe they are real for no other reason than they have a theory and deny any evidence that contradicts it.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I bet you can&#39;t even give an explanation of &quot;the vanishing point&quot;.</p>

<p>Let me help you - as objects get further away, they take up less of our field of view, appearing to become smaller. Once they get far enough away, they appear so small our eyes can not resolve them. Hence they <em>appear</em> to vanish.</p>

<p><a href="http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width380/img/news_impact/photo/20713457-large.jpg">The &quot;vanishing point&quot; can not and does not explain this:</a></p>

<p>This ship is large enough to be visible - which is why we can see its masts. But it is also just beyond the horizon, which is why the bottom half of the ship is not visible.</p>

<p>Neither perspective nor &quot;the vanishing point&quot; can explain how we can see the top part of the ship, but not the bottom. If we can see any of it, we should be able to see <em>all</em> of it unless something else is blocking our view.</p>

<p>You can see the Antarctic ice wall yourself, from your chair. Just <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=antarctic+ice+wall&amp;amp;client=ms-android-motorola&amp;amp;prmd=inv&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwidhObK6qLYAhXCUiYKHUbFD3IQ_AUIESgB">Google Antarctic ice wall, and click images.</a></p>

<p>The main experiment that is used to demonstrate and prove gravity is called the Cavendish Experiment. All it really proves is magnetism and static electricity, but people believe it shows gravity b/c they have to for faith in their religion of scientism.</p>

<p>If the earth is spinning a thousand miles an hour, why do islands not move towards the equator do to the coriolis effect? </p>

<p>Gravity and the coriolis effect are fickle forces. Gravity acts like a giant magnet to the earth, that attracts everything, even air, apparently. It holds buildings to the ground upside down while the earth spins a thousand miles an hour, but yet butterflies can float with no problem.</p>

<p>It holds the moon in our orbit, which is said to have less gravity than earth- but yet has enough strength to affect our tides.</p>

<p>They claim the Earth&#39;s spin affects bullet trajectory, but that also doesn&#39;t make the world move out from under a hovering helicopter, or make flights shorter or longer depending on direction of flight. </p>

<p>Again, admittedly none of this proves the earth is flat, just arguments against a spinning globe.</p>

<p>People will say that the earth is so big, that like ants, we are too small to be able to see the curvature, but yet still claim that you can see ships disappear over the edge from shore. Even though that you can take modern camera zoom technology, and bring them right back into focus.</p>

<p>As for the arguments that people are giving you for, &quot;why can&#39;t you see the stars/sun from _ on a flat earth..&quot; I propose/ask you if you&#39;ve ever driven in fog? You can have a vehicle driving directly at you with their high beams on, and not see them until they are surprisingly close. Fog is essentially ground level clouds, so the atmosphere works the same way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not 100% convinced by any means that the earth is flat, but there&#39;s way more arguments for it than I ever would have thought.</p>

<p>You can see the Antarctic ice wall yourself, from your chair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The edges of ice floes are not &quot;walls&quot;.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The main experiment that is used to demonstrate and prove gravity is called the Cavendish Experiment.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One experiment. There are many others.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gravity acts like a giant magnet to the earth, that attracts everything, even air, apparently. It holds buildings to the ground upside down while the earth spins a thousand miles an hour, but yet butterflies can float with no problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Gravity is a force. If a child was pushing on one side of a door trying to hold it closed, and an adult pushed on the other side trying to open it, would you say the child didn&#39;t exist because the adult was able to open the door?</p>

<p>Gravity is a force like the child pushing on one side of a door. Stronger forces can apparently overcome gravity as long as they are acting on the object. For example, lift can keep a butterfly afloat as long as its wings are able to generate lift. Put it in a vacuum chamber and that butterfly will not be able to fly.</p>

<p>It takes a particularly stupid person to believe that gravity either doesn&#39;t exist or &quot;must&quot; be impossible to overcome.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It holds the moon in our orbit, which is said to have less gravity than earth- but yet has enough strength to affect our tides.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it affects our tides. That child and the door again. Even though the adult was able to open the door, he wasn&#39;t able to open it as easily as if the child wasn&#39;t pushing on it.</p>

<p>The earth&#39;s gravity pulls down on the oceans. The moon&#39;s gravity pulls up on the oceans. When those two forces counteract each other, the net force pulling the water downwards is reduced and the water is able to bulge upwards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>They claim the Earth&#39;s spin affects bullet trajectory, but that also doesn&#39;t make the world move out from under a hovering helicopter, or make flights shorter or longer depending on direction of flight.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A bullet is a &quot;ballistic object&quot;. What keeps it from hitting the ground is its velocity. A helicopter is generating lift. What keeps it from hitting the ground is the air around it. If the air around it is moving, the helicopter moves with it. The atmosphere is moving with the earth (in general) and as such the helicopter is too.</p>

<p>Having said that, ask any helicopter pilot whether they can simply put the helicopter into a hover and take their hands off the controls (assuming no auto stablisation system) or if they constantly have to make small adjustments to remain hovering over a single location.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>People will say that the earth is so big, that like ants, we are too small to be able to see the curvature, but yet still claim that you can see ships disappear over the edge from shore. Even though that you can take modern camera zoom technology, and bring them right back into focus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width380/img/news_impact/photo/20713457-large.jpg">No, you can&#39;t.</a></p>

<p>No amount of zoom is bringing that ship back into full view.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m not 100% convinced by any means that the earth is flat, but there&#39;s way more arguments for it than I ever would have thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I highly doubt you&#39;ve ever actually &quot;thought&quot; about them in any meaningful way.</p>

<p>You’re talking about the limits of human vision, and also the vanishing point</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I bet you can&#39;t even give an explanation of &quot;the vanishing point&quot;.</p>

<p>Let me help you - as objects get further away, they take up less of our field of view, appearing to become smaller. Once they get far enough away, they appear so small our eyes can not resolve them. Hence they <em>appear</em> to vanish.</p>

<p><a href="http://image.mlive.com/home/mlive-media/width380/img/news_impact/photo/20713457-large.jpg">The &quot;vanishing point&quot; can not and does not explain this:</a></p>

<p>This ship is large enough to be visible - which is why we can see its masts. But it is also just beyond the horizon, which is why the bottom half of the ship is not visible.</p>

<p>Neither perspective nor &quot;the vanishing point&quot; can explain how we can see the top part of the ship, but not the bottom. If we can see any of it, we should be able to see <em>all</em> of it unless something else is blocking our view.</p>
