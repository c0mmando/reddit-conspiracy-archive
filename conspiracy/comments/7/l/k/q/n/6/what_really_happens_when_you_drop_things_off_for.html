        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>My WiFi on my MacBook stopped working last weekend, so I brought my MacBook to an Apple store on Tuesday for them to run diagnostics. They were able to determine it needed a new WiFi chip ($175 fix) so I took the laptop home to back it up onto an external hard drive and dropped it off on Thursday. 
I called this morning to check in on it, to which they stated that the laptop had ‘piles of water’ in it. This laptop is used mainly for recording and no water has ever been spilled on or around it. They told me they had pictures of the damage, so I went in to take a look. 
Not only was there a massive amount of water in the picture (of a laptop that has never been wet) but they could not provide me any copies of the pictures or let me zoom in on the ones they had. (Now a $1475 fix) I opted to take it home instead of having it sent out, because details aren’t adding up.
When I got the laptop home, I notice that safari was currently open. (I closed everything out before dropping it off) but when I looked in the console, I saw that whoever was working on it, went into our calendar, address book, notes, password keychains, and a random desktop folder. I called the manager at the store to tell her this, but was merely laughed at and told that what I was describing ‘isn’t store policy,’ despite the proof I have of it. She then goes on to say that this could have been caused by looking through these things on my iPhone or iPad and it syncing to the computer.. BUT, if the WiFi isn’t working, it’s impossible that this info synced up in the first place on the exact day and time that it was being worked on. 
Corporate also seemed to think this was suspicious, and I am currently awaiting a call back.</p>

<p>They are useful idiots.</p>

<p>It’s why their Xserve died. They would send out a tech, work on the server for 18 hours and do nothing but damage.</p>

<p>I’d be called in to “save their ass” as I was asked if I’d “ever seen a fat man cry” I would charge what Appel charged on top of what they’d been charged and redo everything in three hours.</p>

<p>Yes, Apple sucks and their employees suck.</p>

<p>The local best buy would send the manager&#39;s wife in to mystery shop me. Pretty funny. </p>

<p>&quot;well why is your stuff better than ours&quot;, well for one I&#39;ve been doing this since the 70s, and two I do my best to find the right solution for the customer. Customer above profits.</p>

<p>Issue was customers don&#39;t give a shit, they just want their fucking fries.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Not trying to be a dick, but supporting apple is stupid, they hide all their profits in Ireland, and now an Island off the U.K. so they dont have to pay taxes.</p>

<p>Also anyone who is a tech nerd , like myself, has nothing to do with a company where you cant yourself go in and make changes to hardware.</p>

<p>On top of this, they&#39;ve admitted to slowing down older iphones w software upgrades when the new phones drop, a conspiuracy that came true, and they are now getting class actions suits together because of this.</p>

<p>Horrid company to support and have anything to with, and if you had an issue with your tech that you could of done yourself, chances are 100% there would be no water in there. One of the techs fucked up and spilled water and they are saying its your fault</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Read literally any of the articles that just came out and the lawsuits</p>

<p>Of course apple is going to say, &quot;it&#39;s a patch to help you,&quot; which is bullshit because it always coincides with just before the release of a new iPhone model, and the people who don&#39;t install the patch/upgrade have their phones working just as fast and as fine as when they first got it.</p>

<p>I use androids and have 4-5 year old battery in my current phone w zero slowdowns and ha e never had any slowdown or needs for any patches because of an old battery, it&#39;s complete and utter bullshit</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I took my MacBook once to repair the space bar when I initially got it. Not even a month into it and the space bar was stuck. Took them two days to remove the screws and replace the space bar. When I got it back I noticed the bottom panel was loose and realized they didn’t even put back all the screws. When I confronted the guy he said oh that’s how it came in. I’m like I just bought this. He’s like I can order the screws for you. I just walked out. </p>

<p>I’d find a local business that repairs apple products rather than purchasing apple care and having to deal with them again. </p>

<p>I was suspicious and confused when I left, but the fact they went through personal information takes the cake. I didn’t realize until later that the Apple store I took it to has a 2.5 star average rating along with numerous ripoff reports for water damage.

    <div class="md"><p>There’s no way I would be leaving that store without going up the management chain in store and on the store phone/my phone.</p>

<p>I’d make a pretty loud, but respectful noise about it around other customers too.</p>

<p>Apple phone-in customer service would at least want to see the pics and aren’t going to stick up for the store if things don’t add up, which they don’t with the ‘Callander and usage on Mac was syncing with iphone usage’ excuse.</p>

<p>I dislike Apple for many reasons, mainly high pricing and cheap slave-like labor in other countries, but my experience with Apple customer service for 10 years now as an iPhone and iPad user has always actually been great.</p>

<p>They swapped out my 11.5 month old iPad Pro for a new one after I said I was having multi-touch screen issues.  I said I was worried about getting one with a bad battery and they said all replacement devices come with official brand new batteries. Did a battery test on the new one and it was full capacity.</p>

<p>Changed multiple phones over the years too for the smallest reasons.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like the staff/management in your local store are idiots.  I’d bet the customer service chat or phone folks would want to know about it and prob have even heard about it before, if it is that store in-particular.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I tried to remain as calm and polite as I could. I asked to speak to the manager who informed me that it’s ‘not store policy’ for me to speak with the technician who worked on it. She was dismissive and short with me on my concerns. I wasn’t taken seriously. </p>

<p>When she walked away from the table, other customers who witnessed the situation actually told me they were sorry for how this entire l situation was handled. They seemed about as confused as I was and maybe a little more nervous about getting their own devices checked out. </p>

<p>I called customer service at home when it became clear the manager wasn’t being helpful, and they forwarded me to corporate. I spoke to a woman who seemed alarmed when I told her about what I saw when I opened the console. I then had to tell the same story to several others at corporate, who said I would be called back in a couple days. I guess we’ll see what happens from here. </p>
