       Introduction : About 4 years ago, I came across some haunting and disturbing photos of ragged Victorian era children, sentenced to prison and lashings for stealing food or warm clothing. It led me down a rabbit hole of human trafficking, legalized child rape /prostitution, child labor and its wretched abuses, and the complicity of the elites. The predators were found throughout Victorian society, those at the highest levels of law enforcement, parliament, judicial branches, and even royalty. Today we are called the Pizzagate Movement, back then they were known as the Purity Movement. These were a small group of fanatical activists who changed the world. As conspiracy theorists we can all find inspiration in this story. Link shows similar pictures of the children that triggered this research 4 years ago: (

        http://www.oldpolicecellsmuseum.org.uk/page_id__538_path__0p75p312p316p.aspx)
       </a>
       )
      </p>
      <p>
       Summary: History repeats itself: The Purity Movement Activists that fought for the abused and trafficked children left us a game plan that changed the course of history. The world is a safer place for children because of their contributions. This is relevant to the Pizzagate Movement because tt proves beyond a shadow of doubt that a small and fanatical group of people can fight an elite, wealthy, network of pedos and win. If not for the work of: William B. Stead, Josephine Butler, Catherine Booth, Dr. Barnard, and so many, many, more, it would be normal and even socially acceptable today to rape a child. It would be socially acceptable and legal to sell a child's virginity as a cure to syphilis. These tireless activists are responsible for the idea that children deserve a "childhood." Our cultural norms of today are due to the battle that was known as the Purity Movement during the Industrial Revolution and the Victorian Era. Factories became known as Satanic Mills and the public awareness and outrage grew. During the industrial and Victorian eras, children were considered fresh meat by elites and pimps who benefited from the cheap labor and sexual exploitation. The abuses were horrific, legal, institutionalized and even accepted by mainstream Victorian society.The aristocracy class was neck deep in the depravity and abuse of these children. None of this is exaggerated, in fact, the photos and testimony will bring tears to your eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am sharing this because it relates to Pizzagate, since it demonstrates a historical precedence that elites (members of parliament, judges, law enforcement, and aristocrats) have been abusing and trafficking children for profit for hundreds of years. It demonstrates that laws can be changed and public pressure and awareness can force the hand of reluctant and even complicit leaders to curb the abuses. It is also useful, to understand the strategies that the activists used when fighting against industrial age corporations, royalty, MP's, police, legislation, and judges. Finally, the activists won, and how they won is relevant. These activists changed the course of history and of our society today. The links below will show the strategies that the Pedo. networks used: such as legislation to protect the predators, the targeting of orphan and poor children by traffickers, the complicity of the elites in law enforcement, and in positions of authority, It will show the media black out of the time and what the activists did to circumvent it. These links will expose the strategies of the Pedo Cabal, but it will also demonstrate how the Purity Activists fought back.

       ) "Harrowing pictures of a pregnant ten-year-old prostitute and tots begging for money capture the heart-breaking poverty of Victorian street children. Eminent Victorian men would unashamedly discuss their attraction to young girlsHowever a scandal in nineteenth century England caused the government to raise the age of consent and tackle child prostitution. The age of consent was then raised from 13 to 16. During this period, the term white slavery came to be used throughout Europe and the United States to describe prostituted children."

       ) "Sarah Golding was poorly and so she stopped her machine. James Birch, the overlooker, knocked her to the floor. She got up as well as she could. He knocked her down again. Then she was carried to her house...she was found dead in her bed. There was another girl called Mary...she knocked her food can to the floor. The master, Mr. Newton, kicked her and caused her to wear away till she died. There was another, Caroline Thompson, who was beaten till she went out of her mind. The overlookers used to cut off the hair of any girl caught talking to a lad. This head shaving was a dreadful punishment. We were more afraid of it than any other punishment for girls are proud of their hair."- An interview with an unknown woman who worked in a cotton factory as a child (1849)

       "Children worked under deplorable conditions and were being exploited by the industrialists. A picture was painted of the “dark satanic mill” where children as young as five and six years old worked for twelve to sixteen hours a day, six days a week without recess for meals in hot, stuffy, poorly lit, overcrowded factories to earn as little as four shillings per week."- Tuttle, 2001

       The Heros who changed the world:

        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephine_Butler
       </a>
       "While investigating the effect of the Acts, Josephine had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a slave trade of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian Police des Mœurs, and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Josephine fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of the Pall Mall Gazette, William Thomas Stead, who purchased a 13-year-old girl from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the British Raj. 2.Catherine Booth

      </p>

       "1876, Stead joined a campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Act, befriending the feminist Josephine Butler.[11] The law was repealed in 1886.[11]" (

       )
      </p>
      <p>
       "William Thomas Stead (5 July 1849 – 15 April 1912) was an English newspaper editor who, as a pioneer of investigative journalism, became a controversial figure of theVictorian era.[1][2] Stead published a series of hugely influential campaigns whilst editor of The Pall Mall Gazette, and he is best known for his 1885 series of articles, The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon, written in support of a bill to raise the age of consent from 13 to 16, dubbed the "Stead Act. Stead's 'new journalism' paved the way for the modern tabloid in Great Britain. -Eliza Armstrong Case / Maiden tribute of Modern Babylonn order to demonstrate the truth of his revelations, he arranged the "purchase" of Eliza Armstrong, the 13-year-old daughter of a chimney sweep.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conclusions: -It took at least 24 years for the activists to raise the age of consent. Let that sink in, from the first law on the books dated 1861, to the law which finally raised the age of consent to 16, it took 24 years of diligent work. We need a long game. History is repeating itself and history has left us a game plan to stop it. So where does the pizzagate movement go in the long run? How do we stay relevant and effective? What lessons can we learn from the purity movement? What can we learn from the Franklin Credit Union Scandal?
      </p>
      <p>
       My next post will concentrate on the strategies and tactics employed by the purity movement against the pedo elite.Otherwise this post will be endless! I am sorry if the post is too long. I have mounds of links and I have put together a timeline. Four years ago this topic was MUCH easier to research. Much has been scrubbed from the internet since.
      </p>
      <p>
       It is my wish that this post can spread some hope that Pizzagate is NOT a lost cause. We can change the world. Our predecessors did it and so could we! It is my hope that this post inspires fresh ideas and new tactics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Some interesting conspiracy oddities: 
William t stead was the most famous victim of the titanic.
The elite families that enriched themselves on the exploitation of children have monument and portraits hanging in our national museums. 
Much of this information seems to be systematically scrubbed from the internet.

       This is a terrific post and I look forward to the next. It isn't too long at all. Pizzagate gets knocked down so often by comparing it to "satanic panic". It is so important for people to understand that PG is nothing new and people have always been capable of and willing to engage in this kind of evil.

       Excellent post. We'll need new?strategy that doesn't rely on singular individuals (however inspiring), since the System has evolved to better take down individuals (assassination, whether character- or corporeal-).

       Years ago I was friends with someone that was working on a journalistic level on the JonBenet case and she shared some photos with me that she "came across" by the wayside of the tunnels in that case. We are talking Xerox copies, so I can't tell you how authentic they were.

       Satanic Panic was used as a scapegoat and was rhetorically weaponized so people would dismiss the actual abuses occuring. Especially those that do not do it under satanic labels. Makes it that much easier to instantly dismiss any claims of ongoing crime by the elites.

       There is lots of evidence to make up the theories that suggest there might be though - hence the whole
       <em>

       <em>

      <p>
       It hasn't been debunked, and some of the evidence is so convincing.

       But you've already made your mind up, so not sure why I'm bothering.
      </p>
      <p>
       Try arguing actual aspects of the theory and why it's impossible for it to be true. Otherwise you're just being an asshole with no substance to your argument other than "YOU DON'T HAVE SOLID EVIDENCE" (if we did, it wouldn't be a theory).

       A single piece on it's own isn't worrying - it's the sheer amount of coincidences that kept on cropping up. For example, the instagram stuff there is so much sketchy looking stuff there, one of those posts on it's own may have raised an eyebrow - but there is a recurring pattern of creepy connections.

       is an example of something that on it's own might raise an eyebrow as a bit weird but nothing serious.

       However pedo references just kept on cropping up everywhere - then people started making connections to actual convicted paedophiles. That's why the theory is so popular.

       Because I seem to remember Epstein, Hastert, Kloman, Terry Bean and like a dozen others of all being in the same political social circle while also all having the dishonor of being convicted pedophiles. So... it's not like there aren't any victims or convictions, because there are a bunch.

       The important change between this and modern times is that now, we have the ability to correlate and control these black markets in a way that was never possible before, capable of increasing the proliferation of these behaviors and products. Meaning, we can create the demand using basic, text book psychological principles, then adjust the supply accordingly to make the maximum amount of profit.
      </p>
      <p>
       The only reason a lot of things are illegal is because their black market status increases the profitability.

       Internet Astroturfing is a multibillion dollar enterprise, but it cannot compete with a massive turnout, as with the election. Sure, Trump probably had some astroturfing help, but not nearly on the levels the DNC employed and either way it was a drop in the bucket because people really, really want to see Hillary in jail.
      </p>
      <p>
       The other thing you can do is send letters to police, IRS, the FBI, etc, to report what you've found and your ideas. After a while, with enough people, it would literally be more work to ignore than it would to do something about it. Generally, that means drive it deeper underground, but that is still a net positive result.
      </p>

       Twitter is a really useful tool, and taking advantage of places that foster free speech, so that the conversation can evolve in a reasonable manner without being derailed.

       Ultimately, there are two issues, in general, that people can push hard on that can be bipartisan... be vocally anti-war and vocally pro-transparency. Secrecy is primarily used to conceal corruption.

       I've always accepted the fact that "History repeats itself," and that we travel through time and space  doing the same things over and over again, but this brings it home in a very real, painful way. Time and time again, some among us have used their power and influence to deprive children of a childhood; to abuse and take advantage of the innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know the facts of the so called Pizzagate scandal. I have no proof. But the fact that similar scandals have happened before helps prove that the same thing is going on now, same as it always has.

       Luckily we can beat these scum bags back into the shadows except we can build upon the success of the purity movement. This time maybe lifetime sentences for child rape. Let's reform and eliminate foster care, do I know the solutions not yet, but it is on us to solve this. It was done before and it will be done again. Together we can make the world safer for children and the abusers need to locked up!

       That's Robert Peel, he invented the idea of a modern police force and was the prime minister for queen Victoria as well as Home Secretary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Everything you are attributing to the purity movement was done by him- cleaning up the work houses, fighting child labor, stamping out prostitution- all this guy over his very long career at the head of Britain 🇬🇧
      </p>
      <p>
       Cops in Britain are called Bobbies after him(his friends called him Bob instead of Robert)
      </p>
      <p>
       The man directly responsible for all the things you are talking about was a famous nobleman and is lauded as an incredible leader- it was a top down solution.

       For space considerations I limited the "heros" that I listed. there is no way to include everyone on a Reddit post. I think you should make a separate post And include your research. 
No one individual can change an entire culture on his own. This was a movement that included doctors, religious leader, social workers, abolitionists, suffragettes, labor unions, lawyers,and even reporters above all it grew out of the middle classes horror at the abuse the children were suffering. 
the police were exposed as complicit, especially because of the horrific contagious acts that police were charged with enforcing. Queen Victoria's husband is quoted as saying the child labor work force is necessary for England's production capacity and his personal wealth. 
It is shameful that of all the aritocracy only one man did the right thing. it says a lot about who the aristocracy and elite families that enriched themselves off of child slave labor and sexual exploitation.

       You started a conversation about the criminal justice reforms that led to the end of child labor and prostitution in Victoria England with out talking about Robert Peel! That's absolutely insane!
      </p>
      <p>
       That's so ignorant of the history of law, policing, and the U.K. that it's hard for me to have a way to express it.
      </p>
      <p>
       Robert Peel literally invented the police force! It simply did not exist before him as we know it- the idea of an independent police funded by the government to protect the citizens from crime and solve crimes! The highest honor a a met policeman can get is in his name.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't think you have the knowledge of the British government at the time to speak about what they thought about anything.  I mean you talked about this issue completely backwards.

      <p>
       Tons of famous elites where angry about the conditions of children and the poor, they even had a genre in Victorian writing called slum fiction that was just stories about people in those conditions and it featured two of history's greatest writers EVER!

       I think you're missing the point- the point is specifically about pedophilia and the parallels with the pedophilia we see in people in Positions of power today. It doesn't matter exactly who did what, what matters is that there is a historical precedent for this kind of thing, which helps when battling to get the truth out, and it also provides hope and inspiration that something can be done about the depravity of powerful and wealthy people. Obviously not all such people are depraved, and getting the help of the good ones is important. These days these crimes are used as blackmail for control and I suspect it's much more complex and there are much more sophisticated methods of control. What mainstream newspaper editor today would dare call out the global 'elite' pedo network, even though I'm sure many journalists must know it goes on.

       Talking about who does what and why is called facts.
      </p>
      <p>
       The facts about why Victorian era children where being raped is because they where poor and it was legal. Eventually thanks to reforms like inventing the police! And creating a welfare system that was not based on literally killing poor people through starvation and slave labor issues like child prostitution became solved
      </p>
      <p>
       Comparing the mass poverty of Victorian England to the assertion that children are used today as sexual blackmail are not related- they have no cross over except that there was children and sex
      </p>
      <p>
       Queen Victoria did not blackmail Robert Peel with child sex or vice versa, he was the Duke of Marlborough, the most powerful noble in England aside from the royal family, he was opposed to the crime in the streets because crime is bad!
      </p>
      <p>
       Seriously you guys can be as invested in pizza and sex black mail as you want, but absolutely do I believe an editor would write a story about a powerful person fucking kids- they just did it to Donald Trump!

       I am not a historian in fact I am just a nobody, I came upon this part of history by accident, coincidence or maybe it was providence, but MY conscience moved me to share this. I am not an expert and there are many people who should have been included. I would have included many more Catherine Booth, Charles dickens, Dr. barnardo and many, many, more.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have a question:  The individual you speak of  owned textile mills; The satanic mills that Charles dickens spoke of. What laws did he change or how did he instill reforms, I am genuinely interested can you share?
      </p>
      <p>
       Which sections support your claims or can you cut and paste the text in your reply. That would be helpful. What reforms is he credited with, was he involved with contagious acts, or raising the age of consent? I truly never came across him in my research, but this topic is not so easy to research compared to 4 years ago. Many things have been scrubbed. This individuals contribution may have been scrubbed as well.

      </p>
      <p>
       Once the first rural textile mills were built (1769) and child apprentices were hired as primary workers, the connotation of “child labor” began to change. Charles Dickens called these places of work the “dark satanic mills” and E. P. Thompson described them as “places of sexual license, foul language, cruelty, violent accidents, and alien manners” (1966, 307). Although long hours had been the custom for agricultural and domestic workers for generations, the factory system was criticized for strict discipline, harsh punishment, unhealthy working conditions, low wages, and inflexible work hours.
      </p>
      <p>
       children worked under deplorable conditions and were being exploited by the industrialists. A picture was painted of the “dark satanic mill” where children as young as five and six years old worked for twelve to sixteen hours a day, six days a week without recess for meals in hot, stuffy, poorly lit, overcrowded factories to earn as little as four shillings per week. Reformers called for child labor laws and after considerable debate, Parliament took action and set up a Royal Commission of Inquiry into children’s employment.

       Peel had Two major achievements related to the issues you are talking about
      </p>
      <p>
       1- he created the metropolitan police
      </p>
      <p>
       Peel entered the Cabinet for the first time as Home Secretary (1822–1827), where he reformed and liberalised the criminal law and created the modern police force, leading to a new type of officer known in tribute to him as "bobbies" and "peelers"
      </p>
      <p>
       2- he abolished the the

        https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Act
       </a>
      </p>
      <p>
       The test act made it legal to not let Catholics(particularly Irish) hold jobs or public office-a lot of the little children you see as sex workers was related to being Irish and catholic
      </p>
      <p>
       Those where gigantic things at the time- Catholics had virtually no rights before that repeal and the police force helped give recourse to the people for the first time ever.
      </p>
      <p>
       Take a look through his wiki
      </p>
      <p>
       He was not a progressive by our modern standards, but creating free trade and reducing legalized slavery was a huge deal- he also founded the Tory party that exists today.

       I actually started a conversation about the historical precedence for child abuse and sexual exploitation on an institutional level by elites and drew parallels between pizzagate and the purity movement. My topic is how activism changed our cultural values and raised the age of consent laws. Criminal reform is not directly related because it was completely legal to sexually exploit and abuse a child. It was not a crime. That is not to say that this individual did not contribute as you say, however please explain how. I am curious.

       I understand you wanted a general conversation about shadowy elites and pizza gate, but I don't think there is any comparison to this topic- the issue here was very much poverty and the need to reform the entire system
      </p>
      <p>
       As I posted in my other post he abolished the legal slavery of Catholics and created the police! The met and Scotland Yard! That was directly from him.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those two acts where enormous! Catholics had virtually no rights in England till this point and as you said, it was totally legal to do anything to them. He repealed that law.
      </p>
      <p>
       Also I don't think you appreciate the significance of the creation of his police force-it changed the entire world. Organized policing became defacto in virtually every civilized country after that point.
      </p>
      <p>
       To get even more specific-it was under his changes that children even had recourse for being attacked since its was Peels act that created the first paid system of child wardens and child care workers

       These humanitarian crimes happened directly under his watch. The police and the contagious acts were directly under his authority to be enforced. In adddition he never disavows and he directly enriched himself through child labor. His family owned the textile mills. 
The reality is that the police force of that time was complicit just as many have uncovered the foster care system abuses and victimized children. I would not call him a hero for children. Maybe for Catholics maybe he was the elites answer to a watered down compromise. So they could play lip service to the public all the while continueing to profiteer. You seem to have political motives. Yet this issue crises political boundaries and will unite social justice warriors and conservatives. It united the abolitionists, labor unions, suffragettes, poor, middle class, doctors, lawyers, education leaders and the public outrage grew until parliament was marched upon with women carrying broomsticks demanding the right to keep their maidenhood or in otherwords virginity. I would say been the pro choice crowd can get behind a  female child's right to choose when she loses her virginity. This was a grassroots movement that exposed the aristocracy, judicial system, parliament, and the police that you seem so proud of. So please post facts, a timeline and contribute to this discussion because we can all agree that no one has the right to exploit a vulnerable class. And children are more vulnerable than minorities, more vulnerable than a woman, more vulnerable then the disabled, and yet to this day there is not one constitutional amendment affording them any protection from the exploitation and abuse that continues to happen in holl wood, music industry, foster care system, and so what are you so angry about ? What does this have to do with your personal political vendetta? take it up with the elites they are the ones that continue to enrich themselves elves and enable this sadistic cruelty.

       I am mad because this is a ridiculous recount of history

       Peel INVENTED the police and and ended catholic slavery and created the torys!

       There was no police before then- nothing! We had private detectives. There was no recourse for your raped kids!

       No, because if you read this account, the olive were actually involved in prostituting children and the trafficking, so it can't have been Peel who solved this particular problem.

       All of it was about the workhouse system which was utterly broken. Peel was the first leader to directly address the issue by creating reforms and a police force.
      </p>
      <p>
       Talking about the child trafficking with out talking about the workhouses that was causing the problem is only half the story
      </p>
      <p>
       The situation in England was so 180 degrees from what pizza gate people are suggesting! Poor people had virtually no rights in England at this time and the only welfare give was the workhouse system, which was horrible.
      </p>
      <p>
       The health of British people compared to Americans at the exact same time was horrible, Americans where almost average a foot taller because of malnutrition- you can learn more about it in the book jack London wrote, which is great or just by comparing the crimes of h.h.homes to Jack the Ripper- both serial killers at the exact same time in two city's that where terrible but in Chicago where homes did his crimes people where very close to today's heights while the victims of Jack the Ripper where 4 feet tall!

       I highly suggest you make your own post. You have a lot to say that has nothing to do with the purity movement. In addition all your exclamation points and emotional intensity? This happened during the industrial revolution, what is all the drama? Lol. What is your point? I did not post anything without sources. If you don't like Wikipedia complain to them. If you don't like educational references sites complain to them. You really need to redirect your passion to something positive instead of being so negative and divisive.

       My issue is that, while we know sexual abusive of children still happens today, much of the Pizzagate "scandal" is based upon heresay and out and out fake news (and a hatred of Hillary Clinton). All it does is undermine real efforts to find people involved with child prostitution and pedophilia rings.

       I should have us d the phrase pedogate. This is about institutionalize abuse and sexual exploitatio. The purity movement exposed that children were legally getting sold and trafficked by law enforcements, that members of parliament were complicit, that among the wealthy class pedofilia was a cultural norm. They expose those issue and forced parliament making these things illegial, they also changed how society viewed child rapists. It was viewed as someone who uncontrollable and indecent urges. Someone who was weak and had no self discipline. 
They were responsible for the idea of a childhood, that children were entitled to an education, play, stories were written specifically for children. If not for their activism today it might still be legal to sell a child's virginity as a cure for syphlis.

       I've been on this topic of NWO for 15+ years. This is the first time I have witnessed them fail and open up a wound for infection to grasp hold. We are the infection and we will cause multiple amputations. There is no going back to normal for them after this. We are people and people are fucking sick to death of this shit.

       Just take a quick look at their sub, I imagine this would linked with a title such as "Astute Top Mind comes to the conclusion Jesus would have been an anti-Hillary Pizzagater if he were alive today." or something equally strawman-like.

       Just so we're clear, those guys are all Jesters. And we haven't even gotten to the parts where they had sex with underage girls (pictures of Jesters "fishing" with the girls in the article).

       Well, first of all, we don't call ourselves a secret society. We call ourselves a society with Secrets, sure. But I almost guarantee you that things like Google and the Susan G Komen Foundation have more secrets than Freemasonry does.

       Well, that's a convenient way to word things.  Google provides multiple services and the Komen Foundation is a scam, so good try at misdirection.  They arose out of completely different circumstances.  There are other ways to show "fraternity" besides enlisting in a society.

       Yes, I could also show fraternity by living alone with a group of people for a while. I guess. I could join the military to grow fraternity. But, in my case, I chose to become a Mason. All masonry has taught me is that I need to be a better person than what I was. If you argue with that aspect, I sincerely believe you will probably argue against a rock being a rock.

       You can accuse me of word games all day long, but I'm not attempting to misdirect anything. We can talk about masonry until you're blue in the face. I don't have anything to hide, so go ahead and ask.

       Legitimately, I don't know what you want me to tell you. Help me out. I don't think that I have an esoteric knowledge that you are requiring. Although, that eagle fucker that keeps messaging me I'm pretty sure is trying to pry information out of my head with a crowbar. It's kind of funny because I have no idea what he's talking about. So, I'm having a little bit of fun with him. Go on, read my other posts if you don't know what I'm talking about.

       Short answer: I've been drinking.
      </p>
      <p>
       I really am a Mason but I am only a third degree Mason. That doesn't mean that I have the knowledge that apparently multiple people on this sub think that I have. Yes, I went through the initiations that every Mason goes through. That does not mean that I apparently know what the meaning of life is or the genealogy of Christ is or anything other than the fact that masonry has been doing philanthropic work for years.

       There ya go...you have no interest in conspiracy, you have interest in complete deflection, and appealing to emotion.  Go ask your "brothers" to answer questions for you.  Do you know how daft it sounds to say you're a member of something but supposedly be clueless as to their beliefs?  And the Salvation Army?  How about instead of philanthropy, with the HUGE number of cops and law enforcement agents in the Masons, they instead focus on eliminating societal root issues at the top, instead of taking my old coat and handing it to someone else for me?  No, because the Salvation Army makes them look good...which is why they have the "newsroom" section on their website to show off how much good they do.  But people who really want to do good don't go around trumpeting their work, or talk highly of an organization they know nothing about.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, if the Masons are making you a better man, they sure haven't made you a better reader, or more wise to the world.

       I think it's mostly symbolic. Solomon was supposed to be a great teacher. So, Solomon's Temple is supposed to be symbolic of an area of knowledge. An area of light, as it were.

       It doesn't matter if you've seen it or not. Masons raped children during an official trip. They had prostitutes brought to the national convention.

      <p>
       Not a single one of them brought up on charges of unmasonic conduct. Case closed, Freemasonry doesn't care about child rape.

       You cannot be a good person and be a mason, any more than you can be a good Catholic if the priest is raping kids and no one stops it.

       Well there is exactly why you are wrong. I am proof that you can be amazing and at least a decent person. I don't rape children. I advocated gainst it. I don't launder money, attack people, do drugs or anything of the like. I'm not a criminal. And I'm also a mason. So, I'm sorry that you feel that way about masonry as a whole but I promise you that most Masons, as most people, are not bad. Once again, I agree with you that some probably are, but it must be such a low statistic that I can't possibly believe your belief.

       You are NOT a decent person. You pay money to an organization that has admitted pedophiles as members who faced no discipline when they were caught.

       How can you be a "brother" sworn to help another brother, when those brothers are raping kids? You have to demit, or you're a bad person, it's that simple.

       The only good masons are the ones who don't know about this stuff. If you know, and you keep paying dues and claiming to have "brotherhood" with pedophiles, you're a bad person. It's that simple.

       You are thinking about this in such an All or Nothing sort of way. You think that just because there happened to be some pedophiles in the organization, allegedly (I haven't taken the time to look into your Source because I've been too busy arguing with you), then every single member happens to be a pedophile. That's simply not true and you are wrong. As far as your second quoting of me, you took that out of context and what I meant was that some members probably are bad people. And, just because I feel like this needs to be clarified for you, a "bad person" and a pedophile can actually be mutually exclusive. You can be a drug dealer but also not a pedophile, for example.

       Yes. That is how I think of unrepentant pedophiles being part of any organization I belong to. Either you expel pedophiles, or I won't be a member anymore.

       They took an official trip, as a group, to engage in pedophilia! And the national meeting had prostitutes brought in, and multiple convictions occurred as a result!

       I honestly feel like you are on a modern-day witch-hunt. You are trying to find evil people where there may not necessarily be any. Also, are you saying that you are also a mason? Is that why you are saying that you won't be a member anymore? And also, you keep using words like "they" and associating it with the entirety of what is Masonry. If multiple people were convicted of pedophilia then great! That doesn't mean every Mason is a pedophile. I don't know how many times I have to tell you this. Not every cop is corrupt. Not every school teacher Is a pedophile. Not every politician is... Wait... Okay, that one's true. But you get my point. I think? Hopefully? Jesus Christ, if you don't get it at this point then I don't know what to tell you other than you're probably psychotic and you need to take your meds.

       I don't care about their good works. I have one question for you how many criminal free masons have you exposed. You know why free masons have such a bad reputation? Because of the bad apples, so who are the bad apples expose them publicly disassociate from them. However that is not what freemasons do right? The oaths require you to look the other way.

       I'm just going to go out on a limb here and say that, due to the lack of proper punctuation, I have to guess on a lot of what you just sent me. I will, however, attempt to answer your questions the best way I know how, based off of what I think you meant.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you don't care about Masonry's good work, then you very clearly have some selective attention span. Freemasons do a lot of philanthropic work that does a lot of good for the world. If you can't see that, it's clearly because you are blind.
      </p>
      <p>
       Next, I don't feel any need to expose a Mason that has no criminal activity? Honestly, I think that's what you were asking but I really don't know. If I knew that a Mason was performing and illegal act, I would alert the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       You, for some reason, believe that Masons have a bad reputation among the general populace. That's not true. You know how I know that that is not true? Because Mason's are allowed to have Masonic temples, which the taxes are paid for those buildings. The symbols are posted on the buildings. And the buildings are not firebombed on a regular basis. There is no overwhelming bad reputation and you're full of shit.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lastly, before I take too much of my night, I just want to say that yes, I did swear an oath, but that oath did not require me to conceal or hide in any way illegal activity performed by another Mason. Once again, just to spell this out for you one more time, if I see anyone or have any knowledge of someone committing an illegal act, me, as an American citizen and decent human being, will alert the authorities and see that justice has been performed. I will never condone illegal activities.

       I deleted the reply, because you are right it was not intelligible. I am on mobile and autocorrect made a mess. 
You sound like you have a sense of right and wrong, however the masons have a bad reputation simply because like you said one bad apple spoils the bunch. The problem is compounded because rather than exposing and disassociating from the criminals, freemasons look the other way. Simply put they must publicly denounce their own bad apples otherwise the whole bunch will look bad. their contributions to society will not erase the bad apples deeds, nor will it restore their reputation. I hope this makes better sense and you do seem to mean well.

       I don't have much to add other than to say that if I find a bad apple, I will publicly denounce that person. I don't have time for criminals. And the profession that I have chosen has made me very much the spies criminals. In any capacity. All I know is that I will continue to do the works that I personally believe in. I believe that the fight against human trafficking and child exploitation is a just and honorable endeavor. I don't do it because of the fame or the good feeling. I do it because it needs to be done.

       I 100% agree that the children need the help. I've spent too much of my time researching child trafficking to not know is that it is an actual concern and rampant in the world. That's why I joined O.U.R.  I hate pedophiles. I hate them. I hate anyone that exploits other people. So, at the end of the day, I feel like as long as I am spreading the word of the organization that I belong to, then I am making a difference. Fighting child exploitation is not a partisan matter. I don't care who is left or right when we are both fighting against the same enemy

       Thank you for an excellent post. The concern/question I have is that in your historical examples, laws were changed and people were arrested – but I don't think it went to the very top, just like now. We're seeing pedo-rings busted up in various places, but they're all low-level scum, maybe some local/state politicians thrown in there.
      </p>
      <p>
       The US State Dept. is intact; Dyncorp is OK; it's business as usual at the CIA; the British monarchy is untouched; The Vatican took a pretty big hit, but its growing public irrelevancy and media protection made it just a blip in the news.
      </p>
      <p>
       What the post-Victorian laws you mention seemed to do was clean up the public face of it; make the factories, police, etc. fall in line a bit, sent a few people to jail – but it all kept happening because, like today, it was all practiced and protected from the top. So it just kept on, perhaps with a diminished circle of players, but extralegally and more in secret. They cleaned up the child prostitutes on the street but couldn't touch the ones in mansion parlors.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's why history repeats itself.
      </p>
      <p>
       To really stop this means also to change absolutely everything. The money and controllers of money, the governments, the judicial systems.... the vast majority of those with any power would have to bring
       <em>
        themselves
       </em>
       to justice for this to truly end and be a sad chapter in our future history books. If we want this to end, we have to use tactics that are willing to change the entire political/monetary system from the ground up. We're not going to vote them out.

       They changed major cultural biases that existed. The concept of a childhood exists because they decided that children deserved an education, a warm bed and a chance to play. That concept did not exist like it does today. Unwanted children were burdens. 
Yes it did not go to the top. This time I think it will. The purity movement forced the hand of congress and parliament to make it illegial to rape a child. Pizzagate movement can build upon that foundation. I agree we need to expose judges that are soft on pedos, and demand life sentences or even the death penalty. We need to expose and reform the foster care system. it is an abusive and destructive system that lets abusers and traffickers target unwanted children. We need to raise awareness on child rape and how well organized and networked they are, to make it harder for them to target children. we cannot minimize the purity movements accomplishments, this was a middle class outcry that arose because innocent children were being exploited by the rich. Because of those fanatics today it is illegial to sell a child's virginity as a cure to syphilis. This was legal until 1861 in England. That is not too long ago.

       It is definitely systemic and it seems especially imbedded among the wealthy elites. I did not think you were minimizing, I meant they accomplished a lot and we have the potential to build upon it. What they did was not enough. They only got the age of consent raised to 16, they demanded 18. Regardless they changed the course of history.

       We desperately need an honest media. Too many people are still willing to be told what their reality is by these giant corporations. It boggles my mind how people will close down when you present them with the evidence- even someone they know and trust, presenting them with evidence cannot compete with mass media arming themselves with ridicule or fake 'disgust' at the supposed lunatics who apparently fabricate these horrors just for kicks. Until we work out how to unwash the brains of mainstream journalists it will be a big struggle I think.

       The movement needs to continue to grow. Dr Phil exposed the victims, Ben swan did one expose, breitbart seems to be exposing the satanic infiltration in politics. However I think the movement is too focused on left and right politics. At this point if we are to learn the lessons of the purity movement we need to team up with like minded reformers, mothers against drunk driving maybe, john Walsh, prolife movement, victim of rape advocates, domestic violence advocates, veterans? There are many groups out there that want to see the exploitation of children end. They want to get the sadists off the street and out of our politics.

       My concern and focus is for victims who are abused. I cannot pretend to understand a predators  motives. In fact I honestly could care less. I only care about the children that are violently raped and abused. Children don't hurt anyone and therefore deserve freedom and safety in society. Pedos on the other hand are predatory told a large and vulnerable segment of the population. They do not deserve access and the benefits of free society. What do you think is it fair to house the wolf with the sheep? .

       I think pedophiles just want to be happy like everyone else, and they cannot do that without hurting people.  I find that tragic.  My sympathy is for everyone who has to live on this shitty planet as one of these shitty creature called humans.  Everyone is a victim.  Pedophiles did not invent the fundamental flaws with this universe. 
 They were already here, and we are all a product of them.

       Children victimize no one. Worry about them and you won't go wrong. Predators are like trees that grow wrong, you can't help them it's too late. However as a society we have an obligation to protect the most vulnerable from predators, from pimps, sadists. There is right and there is wrong as surely as  there is light and darkness. Pedofiles were once victims that are repeating the abuse on a defenseless victim. That means a pedo is a predator. So who needs the help more? The defenseless child or the predate. You can't house a sheep with the wolves and call that compassion, that is cruel and inhumane to the sheep. What kind of farmer would do that? A sadist.

       You do not have to "house the sheep with the wolves".  I am glad that child sexual abuse is a matter of public awareness and concern today relative to times past.  But, as people are wont to do, they have gone too far, and have developed an idea of pedophiles similar to that which the Nazis held in regards to the Jews.  By all means, do everything in your power to protect children, but if someone preaches hatred and violence and rejects empathy, no matter for whom, the seeds he plants will undo any and all good that he accomplishes in time.  I'm not saying that you in particular have done anything like that, but it's the prevailing dialogue. That kind of rhetoric permeates the internet and all facets of media, and teenagers who are discovering right now that their primary attraction is to children are listening intently and developing a very frightened and hostile perspective of the world that will embolden them to offend against twice as many victims as you save.  Everyone hates pedophiles, but nobody ever expresses how lucky they feel not to be one.  People are very quick to forget that other people are people too, and the modern cultural idea of "pedophile" is perhaps one of the most striking examples of this that I'm aware of right now.

       You are someone who thinks deeply about things. i can see that. You think pedos are victims too. I understand that. Along with using emotion to guide this discussion let's talk logically. While a pedo was once a victim as well as a predator, what is a child? A victim. Is a child a predator? Of course not. That is silly. So what do you do? Who do you defend? Who do you protect. People hate pedos and sadists and people who practice beastility because it involves getting pleasure by inflicting pain on a very vulnerable and blameless person or animal. The society disapproval is for good reason, their takes an especially heartless and sadistic person to violently rape a child or an animal. A society that does not protect their animals or children is inhumane and cruel. I hope that helps. You seem genuinely torn about the issue. I hope you find some clarity.

       I'm not torn at all.  It is entirely possible to enact any necessary utilitarian solutions without malice.  When I engage in this general line of thought on any topic, a common reaction is "so, what?  We just let dangerous criminals run free and never punish anyone?"  But I do not think that is a good idea anymore than anyone else does.  Think about the following scenario: a starving bear has your children cornered in your yard.  Thinking quickly, you grab a rifle and shoot the animal, killing it and eliminating the danger.  In this situation, are you
       <em>
        punishing
       </em>
       the bear?  Do you
       <em>
        hate
       </em>
       the bear
       <em>
        ?  Do you think the bear was *evil
       </em>
       and
       <em>
        deserved to die
       </em>
       ?  Probably not.  Your actions would be
       <em>
        utilitarian
       </em>
       .   They were necessary to protect yourself and your family.  To this one would say that people are not animals, and know right from wrong.  I think that is incorrect.  People are absolutely animals, and they do not agree on matters of morality.  Nobody "knows" right from wrong, they merely have their own opinion about what these terms mean.  You believe that child sexual abuse is a critically serious social ill that must be addressed, even if that means improsoning offenders or taking other action against them.  A pedophile, on the other hand, likely believes that sexual relations with children are necessary for him to feel complete and to tolerate his life, and also that society is mistaken about the impact of these relationships, with any harm coming from from society itself indoctrinating children with toxic ideas about sex.  That is something that I've heard many pedophiles say, and I believe there is a grain of truth in that, though I certainly don't agree with their conclusion that they should rape children.  Either way, just like the bear, you cannot assume that another person
       <em>
        knows
       </em>
       right from wrong, because another person perceives reality differently than you do.  In his mind, he has done nothing wrong.  In a perfect world, we would never have to harm eachother, but in this world, the best we can do is to simply avoid harming each other as much as possible, and resist the temptation to demonize other people just because we cannot comprehend them and are blinded by the damage that they do.  I would be the first one to shoot a pedophile to protect a child, but only if there was no better option, and I would not feel like justice was being done, but rather that life is very awful sometimes, nothing more.

       You sound like a pedophile apologist. There are people out there who are evil in every sense of the word. They love the burst of chemicals and endorphins that their brain shoots out when they molest a child/do something heinous. It is not some sad tragic struggle like they make it out to be. The duality of this world is there on purpose. You can argue semantics on what good and evil is, but do you really want the evolution of humans to move towards traumatizing our children for jollies? There is literally something wrong in their brain that makes them want to
       <em>
        rape
       </em>
       children. Children are pure innocence and sick fucks get off on destroying that innocence.
      </p>
      <p>
       You have to experience the sadistic and evil nature of these people to truly understand it. People can be so cruel and evil, and enjoy the fuck out of it! That's why they do it! You seem like a kind person, that is why you cannot fathom someone being evil and enjoying every minute of it. Bathing in the depravity and just having literal orgasms just thinking about how depraved they can get and what levels of indecency they can reach. And of course, humans get bored and must seek worse and worse acts to stave off their addiction to immorality.
      </p>
      <p>
       Society is far from mistaken about the impacts of having children engage in sex at a very young age. Why would a 4 year old ever need to know what sex is? There is no grain of truth in saying that the world just misunderstands them. They deserve to be hung by the neck until lifeless as they are literally committing a crime against humanity! Our children are our future, lets not try to apologize for people who enjoy perverting and destroying children for another burst of endorphins.

       Hardly, sex is a freeing and amazing way to connect with another person on a deep almost spiritual level. However, a child is incapable of providing consent or understanding why people even crave such a thing. A pre-teen at least has gone through puberty and has urges, but a lot of pedophiles seek children below the age of 12. Even infants are not sacred to them. When you hear about a 2 year old being molested it is hard to believe they did it out of care and love for the child. And usually, the molestation is violent and involves threatening the child with death or the death of their family.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean no disrespect. I understand your viewpoint on this. I do believe there are some pedophiles who wish to just control their urges and not harm a child ever. That is a very small percentage though. There are also pedophiles who will actively molest other kids while their own kids are "off limits". So at some level they know it is traumatizing and hurts the child. Ones that try to slowly groom and make a child "fall in love" with them do not realize even actions like that traumatize a child for life, and usually have the victim grow up to do the same acts. Perhaps not as gentle either.

       Why do you believe that?  Child sexual abuse is a serious crime and a violation of deeply entrenched social norms.  I would imagine that the majority of people who are sexually attracted to children probably suppress that nature and live in denial, perhaps just collecting legal modelling photos of children and stealing hugs and kisses from them when the opportunity presents itself at worst.  Most people do not blatantly act on urges to do things that are illegal and harmful, and I don't see any reason why pedophiles would be any different.

       You know what else is traumatising?  Hearing the message your whole life that child sexual abuse is always a violent, predatory act, remembering your own experiences with a rather benign, trusted, friendly adult who did strange things with you, and subsequently feeling that you must be some kind of perverted deviant and were complicit in the aberrant sex acts because they didn't conform to the popular narrative that such incidents are supposed to be acts of horrendous rape.  When victims develop guilt complexes, this is largely why.  Sex offenders are not the only ones who traumatize children, everyone does.

       Right, so lets just try to normalize pedophilia because hearing about the act is sooo traumatizing to victims. /s Honestly, I may be misunderstanding you and I hope I am. But because people have cognitive dissonance and deny allegations does not make it any less heinous what was done to that child.  I argue that threats create guilt complexes far more often than people all agreeing that it is a horrible act. The child should understand that it is a horrible act and tell someone. That is why we tell children how horrible of an act it is! So that they do not feel afraid to come forward. Are you trying to argue that the children on some level enjoy it and would feel ashamed? I fucking hope not.

       You said that you believe a small minority of pedophiles are non-offending.  I believe it is probably the majority.  What you said seems the same as saying that the majority of financially struggling people are thieves, or the majority of romantically challenged men are rapists.  I don't believe it.  A person needs mental issues far more serious than an attraction to children to actually perpetrate a crime like child sexual abuse.

       Do you think that high-profile media circuses accurately represent the most common incidents of child sexual abuse?  People seem to have this notion that all pedophiles are simultaneously psychopaths who would do things like threaten to murder a child's family.  That's absurd.  There is no evidence supporting that.  My own opinion stems from that; not a source that I can show you (in part because publishing research that challenges social norms is a good way to get fired and commit social suicide) but rather from the lack of sources supporting the myth that the sadistic-type pedophile is the norm rather than the outlier.  In the vast majority of firsthand accounts from people who were sexually abused as children that I have heard or read, the primary tactic used by the abuser was to gain the trust and admiration of the victim, and then gradually escalate subtle physical boundary crossing, kind of like how anyone has sex with anyone else.

I have to restrict the definition of "violence" to "an act perpetrated with the intention and result of causing physical harm", otherwise the word just completely ceases to be useful.  A sex act performed on a child does not need to be violent in order to have serious consequences.  Misusing language will only make it more difficult to understand complicated issues like child sexual abuse.

       Again, "predatory" must also connote a conscious intention to harm someone else for personal gain.  The majority of pedophiles I've seen interviewed appear to

       believe that they did not do anything wrong, and feel that they love their victims.  I cannot call that predatory, no matter what the consequences of their actions are.  They are dangerously confused.  That's a more appropriate term.

       That is your mind playing tricks on you.

       Because humans are a social species.  Your mental landscape is primarily learned, with the teachers being everyone that you've rubbed shoulders with throughout your life, especially your parents.  Cultural ideas can directly cause psychological harm all by themselves.  I went through a period of intense depression many years ago due to shame over an addiction to pornography.  I became an alcoholic, and also suicidal.  Yet at the same time, many other people of the same age enjoyed porn regularly with no issues.  What was the difference?  The difference was that I was raised as a Jehovah's witness, and was indoctrinated with a very different idea about pornography and it's consequences than other people were.  Pornography did not hurt me, Jehovah's Witnesses did.  Similar phenomenon can be seen in any phenomenon in life, including child sexual abuse.  Society always shares a portion of the blame when one of it's members suffers from mental illness, whether it was triggered by sexual abuse or anything wide.

       They sometimes do.  That's not even really controversial.  You just said yourself that they are not mature enough to understand what is happening to them.  Oftentimes, while the abuse is occurring, the child feels like she is just involved in some silly game, or they feel that the abuser cares deeply about them.  They may even miss the abuser if he moves away.  They may not feel differently about it until years later.  That's very common.  Nobody wants to publish data like that, but you can find countless anecdotal reports detailing experiences like that, and the book I mentioned earlier written by a Harvard psychiatrist covers that issue.  Even cases like this can result in serious problems developing normally, but the idea that child sexual abuse is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       terrifying and directly traumatic in the same way that being violently assaulted is traumatic is simply rubbish.

       Except that shooting a bear for fun is cruel and sadistic. Pedofiles rape children for fun, it gives them sexual gratification except, that it child rape is violent and painful for a child. The size difference between a full grown adult and a child is enough explanation. Add to that the blood and tearing it causes while a child cries from the pain and horror. No shooting a bear sonhe does not is survival. In the same way stopping pedofiles from harming children is survival for the children. Letting a bear eat children's because that is his preference or letting a pedofile impose his preferences on children because that is his preference is cruel and inhumane to the child victims. A mother bear would die defending her young, it's time our society gets their priorities in order and start defending their young a mother bears knows the difference between right and wrong. As humans it is basic instinct to protect our young.  Pedofiles are sadistic predators. Violence towards a child turns them on.

       <p>
        Pedofiles rape children for fun, it gives them sexual gratification
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I believe they generally seek out sexual experiences with children for the same reasons that anyone seeks out sexual experiences with anyone else.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        child rape is violent and painful for a child, it causes permanent damage emotional as well as physical.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is very frequently far from the truth.  Many incidents of child sexual abuse do not involve any violence.  Your description of "blood and tearing" describes only a specific type of rapist and scenario.  The sexual sadist types may get caught more frequently because of the shocking nature of their crimes, but not all pedophiles are sexual sadists, probably a minority of them in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       A perpetrator may gradually increase physical contact over time, causing the child to feel that it is almost normal when they begin to do things that are overtly sexual, and not cause any injuries at all.  I believe that, statistically, the majority of child sexual abuse is limited to fondling and oral sex, with no penetration. The child may return to laughing and playing for years and not develop any negative feelings about the abuse or demonstrate any psychological symptoms until much later when they reevaluate their experiences in light of everything that society has indoctrinated them with regarding sex.  "The Trauma Myth" by Susan Clancy sheds some light on this.  Child sexual abuse is a heinous crime, but a couple difficult truths to accept are that it's effects are greatly exaggerated in public thought, and are also exacerbated by society itself.  It seems to me that the idea that you hold in your mind about what child sexual abuse is is only accurate regarding sociopathic, sadistic predatory rapists who derive some pleasure for harming other people.  The common abuser is just someone who craves intimacy, believes he can only feel that with a child, and would never allow himself to physically harm a child in any way.  They are very subtle, and their victims often do understand what happened to them for years.  Often, the abuser seems like an upstanding citizen because he actually would be if he did not struggle with such confusion and unfortunate sexual impulses.  He's not a wolf hiding in sheep's clothing, he's a human being with a problem.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Letting a bear eat children's because that is his preference or letting a pedophile impose his preferences on children because that is his preference is cruel and inhumane to the child victims.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I never suggested anything like that.  I'm wondering if you really grapes my analogy.  People who sexually abuse children should absolutely be prevented from doing so, with prison time if need be.

       I will be sincere, I am disturbed by your comments. You seem to be playing both sides of the fence. Trying to blur the lines of the issue. Pedofiles sexually exploit children. They are predatory and sadistic in nature. They force their needs on the most vulnerable and take pleasure in scarring children. Many victims would have a problem with what you are saying. You can't be a victim advocate and an advocate for abuse. You cannot play both sides of the fence here. Pedos are sadistic and creep healthy people out, a moter bear does not bother to understand a predator. If you want to stop them from creating more predators you have to keep them out of society permanently. You seem to sympathize with predators and I cannot abide that. If this was a racial issue a mod would probably delete your post. But because children are not a protected class you can argue to protect their abusers. As opposed to,  if you were arguing to protect the needs of nazis to lynch blacks. Racism and pedofilia are both predatory, unnatural, exploitive and have no place in modern society. Thank you, you have taught me a lot about pedofiles and their sympathizers. This information will help cure the disease of pedofilia from society.

       As long as people believe that there is a "fence", they will remain divided and will continue to despise, exploit, and harm each other.  In order for child sexual abuse to end, abusers must be obviously be involved in bringing that about.  They are the ones doing it, after all.  If they are socially unacceptable merely by virtue of what they are, how they were born or molded by their own histories of abuse, how can you reasonably expect them to stop?  If they are not considered human by others, then they can adopt the same attitude in return.  As of right now, society incentives pedophiles to mentally deteriorate and become as dangerous and likely to offend as possible by fostering a climate of vitriolic hatred and fear.  Can the people who perpetuate this status quo really claim to be less of a threat to children than the abusers themselves?  I personally do not think so.

       History proves you wrong though. This is about a vulnerable class getting exploited. It used to be legal for a male boss to demand sexual favors from a female employee. This attitude became vilified and the moral outrage of a powerful group exploiting a vulnerable class is what led to change. The same can be said of the exploitation of minorities, it is now illegial. When you consider the exploitation of child actors in Hollywood or the music industry it is shamefu. That children are not afforded the same protected class legally as minorities is long over due. Politicians such as denis hastery should spend at minimum a life time in prison, his assets seized and redistributed to victims. By impoverishing and eliminating the criminal exploitive faction out of society our most vulnerable will at least have the right of pursuit of happiness. And believe me no child wants a creep like hastert touching them. It is not ok to use your status to exploit a vulnerable class of people. That includes children, lgbtq, minorities and the disabled, it includes conservative and liberals, it even includes our undocumented. Exploitation by the wealthy classes has been going on throughout history. Pedos are sadistic predators, as bad as lynch mobs and we don't try to understand a lynch mobs motives and accommodate them do we? Do we try to understand why a man takes advantage of his assistants need to pay her bills and uses that to his advantage? No we villify it. Same thing goes for pedos. They exploit children for their own pleasure.

       I essentially agree with everything you've said.  Nonetheless, I would say that history proves me right, insofar as people who are socially demonized, ostracized, and persecuted often lash out destructively against society.  It is a very weighty thing to demand that someone, like a pedophile, give up his pursuit of happiness, which is so freely granted to others, for the entirety of his natural life because of your own perception that it is a threat to others.  Can you imagine what that must be like?  If you make that sacrifice needlessly hostile and humiliating, do you expect cooperation?  When I describe the importance of empathy, I'm not only highlighting compassion as a value, but also the recognition of how stubborn and dangerous humans can be.
      </p>
      <p>
       Institutionalized sexual harassment in the workplace, while perhaps substantially reduced, is not a thing of the past.  Likewise, Victorian efforts to combat child sexual abuse have clearly only severed one head of the Hydra.  Wouldn't you agree?  I believe that all energy finds an outlet.  Men who would carelessly express their sexuality in harmful ways in times past when a blind eye was turned to such things, what do you think they are doing now?  What is very interesting to me is the sexual repression rampant in terrorist groups, and the trend whereby American mass murderers will overwhelmingly be found to have frequented forums centered around expressing hostility towards women and society for reasons that essentially boil down to sexual frustration.  I do not believe that is a coincidence.  Maybe it is also not a coincidence that certain people in positions of political and financial power who abuse that power to exploit others are often implicated in child sex abuse scandals and conspiracies.

If there are illegal activities afoot, we are going to expose them. It's as simple as that. And no one thinks that Freemasonry is the mafia. Lol.

       Am I missing something? One minute you're saying thanks for the work they're doing and the next they're a Freemason? Is it one of those fake save the kids organisations that actually uses the trust they gain to procure kids for trafficking and abuse?  Also most lower level Freemasons don't seem to have a clue about the organisations deep involvement in this stuff and covering it up, particularly in the police force. So maybe they're genuine but just don't know? Anyway the conversation between you is very confusing!

       It was washed from history. The families such as the rockerfellers enriched themselves off of the exploitation of children. It is a crime against humanity, yet they are paraded around in museums and statues of them in parks as if they are our American benefactors.

       There were many more heros that were left unnamed because of space considerations. 
Butler and stead did not find crimes. It was legal to abuse and exploit children. In fact it was done on an institutional level. 
Butler and stead raised a public outcry and helped to change laws and societies opinion of pedofilia. Because of them today pedofilia is a crime, and it is socially the most depraved and unacceptable practice. Worse than beastiality. That is their contribution.

       They changed the age of consent laws making it illegial to rape a child. They also are responsible for the concept of a child hood. That children are entitled to an education and play tim, and basic needs such as food and a home. The problems in Victorian age were so much worse than today. Child abuse and exploitation was an industry. Today at least they try to hide it and use "artwork" instead of photos. Pedos still must network in secret and act outside of societies norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       We are having a hard time today because judges are not enforcing the laws on the books. Because law enforcement does not follow up on these crimes. As an example, The police chief of D.C. Has a terrible reputation on how he handles child rape. He is also very well connected politically. The two seem to go hand in hand. 
Pedogate can become a real movement and demand real changes to protect children from predators. It's already got tremendous grass roots momentum.

       This is also very true and very sad. Child labor was similar to how industry exploits undocumented people. I would bet this is the real reason for open borders, not only so industry has access to unlimited cheap / slave labor. But also so they can traffick children for exhale exploitation. Unfortunately maybe we need to lobby law enforcement to track these statistics because from what I hear they do not track these rates.

       Luckily we can beat these scum bags back into the shadows except we can build upon the success of the purity movement. This time maybe lifetime sentences for child rape. Let's reform and eliminate foster care, do I know the solutions not yet, but it is on us to solve this. It was done before and it will be done again. Together we can make the world safer for children and the abusers need to locked up!

       It doesn't matter if you've seen it or not. Masons raped children during an official trip. They had prostitutes brought to the national convention.

       Not a single one of them brought up on charges of unmasonic conduct. Case closed, Freemasonry doesn't care about child rape.

       I don't care about their good works. I have one question for you how many criminal free masons have you exposed. You know why free masons have such a bad reputation? Because of the bad apples, so who are the bad apples expose them publicly disassociate from them. However that is not what freemasons do right? The oaths require you to look the other way.

       I believe they generally seek out sexual experiences with children for the same reasons that anyone seeks out sexual experiences with anyone else.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        child rape is violent and painful for a child, it causes permanent damage emotional as well as physical.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That is very frequently far from the truth.  Many incidents of child sexual abuse do not involve any violence.  Your description of "blood and tearing" describes only a specific type of rapist and scenario.  The sexual sadist types may get caught more frequently because of the shocking nature of their crimes, but not all pedophiles are sexual sadists, probably a minority of them in fact.
      </p>
      <p>
       A perpetrator may gradually increase physical contact over time, causing the child to feel that it is almost normal when they begin to do things that are overtly sexual, and not cause any injuries at all.  I believe that, statistically, the majority of child sexual abuse is limited to fondling and oral sex, with no penetration. The child may return to laughing and playing for years and not develop any negative feelings about the abuse or demonstrate any psychological symptoms until much later when they reevaluate their experiences in light of everything that society has indoctrinated them with regarding sex.  "The Trauma Myth" by Susan Clancy sheds some light on this.  Child sexual abuse is a heinous crime, but a couple difficult truths to accept are that it's effects are greatly exaggerated in public thought, and are also exacerbated by society itself.  It seems to me that the idea that you hold in your mind about what child sexual abuse is is only accurate regarding sociopathic, sadistic predatory rapists who derive some pleasure for harming other people.  The common abuser is just someone who craves intimacy, believes he can only feel that with a child, and would never allow himself to physically harm a child in any way.  They are very subtle, and their victims often do understand what happened to them for years.  Often, the abuser seems like an upstanding citizen because he actually would be if he did not struggle with such confusion and unfortunate sexual impulses.  He's not a wolf hiding in sheep's clothing, he's a human being with a problem.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Letting a bear eat children's because that is his preference or letting a pedophile impose his preferences on children because that is his preference is cruel and inhumane to the child victims.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I never suggested anything like that.  I'm wondering if you really grapes my analogy.  People who sexually abuse children should absolutely be prevented from doing so, with prison time if need be.

       I disagree with that.  Certainly some abusers do restore to tactics like that, but my study of this topic suggests that the majority of child molesters do not employ any kind of physical force, cause injury, or use threats.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       Why do you believe that?  Child sexual abuse is a serious crime and a violation of deeply entrenched social norms.  I would imagine that the majority of people who are sexually attracted to children probably suppress that nature and live in denial, perhaps just collecting legal modelling photos of children and stealing hugs and kisses from them when the opportunity presents itself at worst.  Most people do not blatantly act on urges to do things that are illegal and harmful, and I don't see any reason why pedophiles would be any different.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>

      <p>
       You know what else is traumatising?  Hearing the message your whole life that child sexual abuse is always a violent, predatory act, remembering your own experiences with a rather benign, trusted, friendly adult who did strange things with you, and subsequently feeling that you must be some kind of perverted deviant and were complicit in the aberrant sex acts because they didn't conform to the popular narrative that such incidents are supposed to be acts of horrendous rape.  When victims develop guilt complexes, this is largely why.  Sex offenders are not the only ones who traumatize children, everyone does.

      <p>
       You said that you believe a small minority of pedophiles are non-offending.  I believe it is probably the majority.  What you said seems the same as saying that the majority of financially struggling people are thieves, or the majority of romantically challenged men are rapists.  I don't believe it.  A person needs mental issues far more serious than an attraction to children to actually perpetrate a crime like child sexual abuse.

      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Source on your study of the topic? I am genuinely interested. Threats are a huge part of the victim staying quiet and having a guilt complex! They fear their family will be murdered. Have you ever studied Franklin Files, Jimmy Saville, and other proven large scale instances of child abuse being covered up? Your logic fails the sniff test.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Do you think that high-profile media circuses accurately represent the most common incidents of child sexual abuse?  People seem to have this notion that all pedophiles are simultaneously psychopaths who would do things like threaten to murder a child's family.  That's absurd.  There is no evidence supporting that.  My own opinion stems from that; not a source that I can show you (in part because publishing research that challenges social norms is a good way to get fired and commit social suicide) but rather from the lack of sources supporting the myth that the sadistic-type pedophile is the norm rather than the outlier.  In the vast majority of firsthand accounts from people who were sexually abused as children that I have heard or read, the primary tactic used by the abuser was to gain the trust and admiration of the victim, and then gradually escalate subtle physical boundary crossing, kind of like how anyone has sex with anyone else.

        The vast majority

       of incidents of child sexual abuse do result in any injury.  I have to restrict the definition of "violence" to "an act perpetrated with the intention and result of causing physical harm", otherwise the word just completely ceases to be useful.  A sex act performed on a child does not need to be violent in order to have serious consequences.  Misusing language will only make it more difficult to understand complicated issues like child sexual abuse.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        However, it is always a predatory act. Your denial of this is amazing. Tricking a kid into having sex does not mean they are off the hook of it being considered violent. Ask rape victims how they felt afterwards, even if they went along with the rape to avoid the offender getting violent. Are they suddenly less traumatized because he was gentle?
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       Again, "predatory" must also connote a conscious intention to harm someone else for personal gain.  The majority of pedophiles I've seen interviewed appear to
       <em>
        sincerely
       </em>
       believe that they did not do anything wrong, and feel that they love their victims.  I cannot call that predatory, no matter what the consequences of their actions are.  They are dangerously confused.  That's a more appropriate term.

       That is your mind playing tricks on you.  This is an entirely charged issue that occupies the deepest throne of social norms, so any statement that challenges the prevailing perception automatically sounds like some kind of devious attempt to smuggle evil into society unless you are listening very carefully and approaching the subject with an open mind.

      <p>
       Because humans are a social species.  Your mental landscape is primarily learned, with the teachers being everyone that you've rubbed shoulders with throughout your life, especially your parents.  Cultural ideas can directly cause psychological harm all by themselves.  I went through a period of intense depression many years ago due to shame over an addiction to pornography.  I became an alcoholic, and also suicidal.  Yet at the same time, many other people of the same age enjoyed porn regularly with no issues.  What was the difference?  The difference was that I was raised as a Jehovah's witness, and was indoctrinated with a very different idea about pornography and it's consequences than other people were.  Pornography did not hurt me, Jehovah's Witnesses did.  Similar phenomenon can be seen in any phenomenon in life, including child sexual abuse.  Society always shares a portion of the blame when one of it's members suffers from mental illness, whether it was triggered by sexual abuse or anything wide.

      <blockquote>

      <p>
       I never said they could consent.

      <blockquote>
       <p>

      </blockquote>
      <p>
       They sometimes do.  That's not even really controversial.  You just said yourself that they are not mature enough to understand what is happening to them.  Oftentimes, while the abuse is occurring, the child feels like she is just involved in some silly game, or they feel that the abuser cares deeply about them.  They may even miss the abuser if he moves away.  They may not feel differently about it until years later.  That's very common.  Nobody wants to publish data like that, but you can find countless anecdotal reports detailing experiences like that, and the book I mentioned earlier written by a Harvard psychiatrist covers that issue.  Even cases like this can result in serious problems developing normally, but the idea that child sexual abuse is
       <em>
        always
       </em>
       terrifying and directly traumatic in the same way that being violently assaulted is traumatic is simply rubbish.
