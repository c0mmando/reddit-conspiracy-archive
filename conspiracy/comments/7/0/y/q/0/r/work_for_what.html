       Im seeing alot of sentiment in this sub lately as how most of the world workforce is enslaved, enslaved by the necessity to work to afford existing. This condition of having to justify ones existence is unfair and slavery in disguise as some have described it here. And thus the system enslaves and leeches the vital force of its workers only to enrich and add to the leisure of the priviliged. This perspective is shortsighted and a trap. Its a trap because it furthers the mentality of us and them, the mentality of helplessness. If we are enslaved then there must be a slave driver whipping us all along, even if its the system that enslaves and not the elites.  And because of the proposed solutions which are like ubi universal basic income or welfare program are tragic patches that only end up fucking up the situation farther.

       I think Alaska is one of the few places you can 'legally' live off the grid, a lot of states have laws about houses not being hooked up to at least electricity. Really enjoy those shows though.

       there is a reason the internet is not available in rural areas. Farmers and Ranchers have been  taking hard punches, increasingly, for decades. Now even small properties are becoming victims of the Notgooders. Also, the former President declare vast wilderness areas National Monuments, immediately allowing military practice. The echo of military helicopters in the mountains is terrifying.

       You don't need to live off the grid to own a farm with a hospital near by, cable company utilities and electrical.  There's plenty of farms that are connected to the grid, all you need is enough land or buy a house with plenty of acres and all modern conveniences hooked up.

       How are you paying for that hospital visit, phone, cable, utilities?  Also, you'll need money for property taxes yearly.  Car registration, fertilizer for your farm, feed for any animals.

       You said save your money up - but that money is going to have to be in the millions if you want to be off the grid forever.

       lol, everything you need is on the farm.  You don't need to buy fertilizer, you can compost scrap food, leaves, grass, paper, wood to create a living soil.
      </p>
      <p>
       Fruit and nut trees can be used to grow food long term with minimal care.
      </p>
      <p>
       Cows can eat the grass and their poo can be used a fertilizer and put into the compost pile.  Chickens can roam range freely eating all the delicious bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       A person can sell crops, beef, and eggs for money, the money earned can pay for phone, cable, hospital visits/ buy insurance and you'll be able to pay for your property taxes and car registration with the money earned from selling food.
      </p>
      <p>
       Please believe that owning a farm can be very profitable, but you have to have the right mindset to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't know why people associate having a farm with living off the grid, you can own a farm and still live on the grid.  Plus you don't need millions of dollars to own a profitable farm, you just have to be a hardworker and love the outdoors and care for your animals.  Grow plenty of fruit and nut trees and you won't have to worry much about taking care of it, they water themselves, all you have to do is prune the trees and you can sell the nuts online if you like on ebay or have a website.
      </p>
      <p>
       Basically running a farm depends on a person knowledge about nature, their work ethic, and whether they're business savvy.

       Also, I didn't associate owning a farm with living off the grid.  You're the one who brought it up.

Save your money up, buy a few acres of land and build a farm to grow your own food and you'll no longer be slave to the system.

       If a loved one gets cancer, you do as everybody else does, go to the hospital.
If your child and other half can't work the field with you anymore, then that means you have to work hard to get the work done, it's all about your personal work ethic, plus it wouldn't hurt to make a tree orchard that will provide bounties of food for plenty of years without having to replant seeds or water it.

       Plus having a farm is a good way to have food just in case the market crash and the price of food sky rocket, look at what happened in Venezuela, plenty of fertile land, but very few farms, very few people who know anything about farming.  I bet Venezuelan farmers aren't going hungry.

       Until some big man comes and buys a majority of the land around one, and concocts a phantom hoa that requires all to drill a well, hook onto the local water, and electricity. The code enforcement officers that come knocking might be brainwashed to hate people wanting to live off the grid, by labeling them Hippy losers, or bizarre loners that stole land from Mexico or Native Americans.

       I think a concept some people need go understand is not everyone is going to accomplish great things in life.  Not everyone is destined for greatness.

       While that doesn't mean you have to be a wage slave, there is a bit of a reality check some people need to make.

       face it, the rothchilds have controlled the world since the times of old through the banks. now the banks own the oil companies and the military industrial complex. Enforced by the might of the US military you either serve the rothschilds banks or you don't pay taxes and live a different life than most. The state of israel is the capitol of the rothschilds empire. it is nearly impossible to exist without serving them in some manner. it is that simple, but all media is directed to convolute the opinions of the masses. we have a king but you dare not speak his name.

       I agree, we should not limit ourselves to thinking about slavery in material terms, but also we should think about slavery in spiritual terms.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you meditate, you can perceive that you are an energetic body, independent of your physical chariot. You existed before 'birth' and will continue to exist after 'death'.
      </p>
      <p>
       But while we are in this physical body, we forget about our spiritual nature, and becomes slaves to money, sex, alcohol, ego, romantic attachment, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our true nature is peace, love, and joy, and does not require any sensory stimulation for happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
       Our material slavery can be looked upon as a metaphor for our spiritual slavery. Ultimately we will be free when we leave our body, but if we cannot act with love and forgiveness in this life we may have to keep coming back until we learn how.

       As long as business is allowed tax breaks, and the ability to pay less than minimum wage, to hire felons and retards, our World will continue to become more unfair. That neato big box thrift store is a great model.
