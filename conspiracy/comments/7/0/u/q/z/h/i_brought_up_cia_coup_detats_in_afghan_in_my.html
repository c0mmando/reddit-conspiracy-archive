        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>It was actually amazing to see how more and more people woke up and spoke out against how our government is blatantly walking into other countries to push &quot;democracy&quot; by overthrowing the current government. At first I thought this class was BS because the professor constantly talked about how good the CIA and the FBI was, but when we started talking about Afghanistan, it was the perfect time to bring up the CIA attempt to overthrow the government twice. When I said it aloud, I was scared people were gonna think that I was some tin-foil hat wearing lunatic, but they agreed with me and even defended me! Maybe not every college student is a brainwashed government cocksucker after all /s</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You really just agreed with him. Since college and uni are where you would traditionally go to become more &quot;educated&quot;, that has almost become the meaning of the word itself while somehow retaining the original meaning as well in the minds of the public.</p>

<p>One can gain education from any walk of life if open to the lessons. One only becomes indoctrinated by having others tell them what they should learn and believe. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yeah, and I agree about the inflated % but the gist is the same. Majority of profs express their indoctrinated worldviews to students who have already been taught to accept these appeal to authority arguments and statements. Some are there to test their own knowledge and learn alongside their students, but we can easily identify those as the minority. All the rest who are only there for a paycheck or to shove their flawed understandings and ideologies down their students throats would be a majority. </p>

<p>I could argue that as one becomes more educated, they should also find themselves closer to center than left or right. It is the only really intelligent stance to take in ones own best interest and that of their community but that&#39;s not what we see in reality. It boils down to who is doing the teaching and what has been chosen to be taught. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Have you been to college? I&#39;ve gone to three different universities and didn&#39;t have a single experience like that. I think its frankly a caricature pushed for political reasons. Most university classes don&#39;t discuss anything politically related even a single time. Its simply not relevant to the class or the curriculum. Go to a random college degree plan and see how little classes there are that have any political relevance. They don&#39;t. Now it is true that at any university there will be profs that go rogue and get political and push their views on their students. This happens with any person put in charge of pretty much anything. Ever have a boss? But this notion that all or most professors at all or most colleges is just politics, not reality. Most profs teach their class topic and go home for the day, just like everyone else at work.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I wasted a lot of time in college and ended up going back to work in fields that I had started in during highschool. Comparing with my peers, I can say that I made the right choice. </p>

<p>I had a prof who was a republican state senator. I had another that was so extremely liberal that they espoused comedy shows as the best source of political information. Most would be in the spectrum but lean heavily left if prompted. I like to challenge ideas so it&#39;s possible that I might have created situations that led to conversations in which political leanings were more obvious. Being politically middle really opens up the jimmie rustling market.</p>

<p>Being center of the road is the logical conclusion imo because there is no party that will perfectly represent you, ever. There is no person but you who can represent you. Personally, I find myself more fiscally conservative and ethically liberal but both are interchangable depending on topic. The more of a hardliner one becomes, the more concessions must be made in order to maintain that hard line. The further one leans to one side, the more extreme and radical they become. I think we all know how dangerous extremism can be with so many examples throughout history. Hardliners tend to close themselves off from opposition and make excuses for poor decisions in their parties favor. Picking a side that doesn&#39;t represent you wouldn&#39;t be advisable in any other forum, so why politics?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think that&#39;s fair. I suppose learning more about mainstream economics has made me more centrist in that regard. I also think ideology is bullshit. It&#39;s a story made up to fit a bias. None of them that aren&#39;t willing to pick and choose make much sense to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was only a problem in the government&#39;s eyes, the protests came to be viewed as necessary to try and get the military out of Nam and end a useless war that wasn&#39;t achieving anything but killing and maiming a whole lot of people and putting the country so deep in debt it was getting beyond any ability to ever pay it back.</p>

<p>In the end the war didn&#39;t end because of the years of protesting and huge numbers refusing to be drafted and fleeing the country but from simply running out of the money needed to keep it going. </p>

<p>A situation that Forced Nixon to pull out and take the US off the gold standard that for anyone who understood the significance of it was an admission that the US was broke and unable to make good on international debts it had always paid in whatever was preferred, gold or dollars but had used up so much gold and printed so many extra dollars not actually backed by it to finance the war itself that it simply couldn&#39;t continue.</p>

<p>Nixon saw the young people with their long hair and eccentric clothing as something akin the original American revolutionaries getting ready to tackle his government despite how absurd that actually was and why the cops and national guard got so aggressive and brutal towards them because that was the &quot;official view&quot; they were ordered to respond in accordance with.</p>

<p>They weren&#39;t any ordinary generation of young people either. They&#39;d been formally educated to a high standard, finished high school and were entering the universities in huge numbers unlike most of their parents who had no more than a public school education and had been worn down and pretty much worn out by the Depression and WWII. Their children, however, were well read, well informed, and well able to organise and speak-up and out for themselves far better than most of their critics.</p>

<p>They brought a lot of unflattering attention to the government and stoked an ever growing public pressure and opinion against it and the war. Something that had never been anticipated and the government and big business who were also highly criticised and rejected by that generation were both determined to undermine and change that educational system before their numbers grew any larger, which is precisely what they did and are still continuing to do.</p>

If some of their membership has done something wrong in the past, I&#39;m certain they were isolated, and I can say with certainty that those involved would have been expelled from the fraternity. You have bad apples in every group. Freemasonry tries to make sure that it has none, but at the end of the day, we&#39;re a cross-section of society.</p>

<p>And in regard to Pike&#39;s writings, I&#39;m certain you&#39;re missing context. It&#39;s very likely that you&#39;re taking a line or two out of context and not looking at the full scope of what he&#39;s saying.

<p>It&#39;s true. We aren&#39;t <em>obligated</em> to tell the truth to non-Masons. We are not <em>obligated</em> to lie on the behalf of the fraternity or other Masons, either. </p>

<p>We are <em>charged</em>, however, with meeting you on square, so to speak. All of our dealings are to be honest and fair. This is one of the last things communicated to people who go through the Entered Apprentice Degree, in fact.</p>

<p>The obligations largely exist, in my view, to instruct Freemasons in how they should deal with other Freemasons and to maintain a certain level of secrecy where modes of recognition and the specifics of degree work are concerned.</p>

<p>The charges are probably more important, but they&#39;re easier to overlook; there&#39;s nothing particularly exciting about them. They exist, mostly, to call us to action in self-improvement and in how we should strive to work within society. These aren&#39;t secretive, either.</p>

<p>The Royal Order of Jesters are a sub-group of the Shriner&#39;s, and they have been caught having sex with children, with prostitutes, and they have been caught doing drugs.

<p>The founder of Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses did the same and added masonic symbols. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 1909, Charles Taze Russell gave a speech to an audience of Freemasons where declared &quot;I am a Freemason.&quot; But, ex-Jehovah&#39;s witnesses who have thoroughly researched Russell have claimed that Russell was not a Freemason. He just made the claim because many of his followers were former Freemasons.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never heard of these people, but why would it matter? Freemasonry doesn&#39;t tell you which god you&#39;re to believe in or pray to. It asserts that religious belief is a personal matter and leaves that up to the person. If anyone in my Lodge wanted to go off and start their own church and share their personal view with others, I wouldn&#39;t object -- as Lodge no as they keep it outside of the lodge room.</p>

<p>The reason we don&#39;t discuss politics or religion in the Lodge is because the can be divisive. If I&#39;m a Christian that leans hard to the right, and if you&#39;re a Muslim who leans to the left, those types of discussions could very easily lead to heated arguments and flared tempers. None of that is conducive to what you&#39;re supposed to get out of a Lodge meeting.</p>

<p>Masonic Lodges are places where men from all walks of life can set their differences aside, come together, and work on bettering themselves. That&#39;s basically it. Charity and such are natural outpourings of those practices. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll not trust mason &quot;facts&quot;.</p>

<p>Every darn town in America has a 100 year old mason hall.  The British Empire was built upon freemasonry among the middle classes of colonial populations.  Entire states were founded as masonic projects.  Yet, my history classes never even mentioned the craft.</p>

<p>And neither the British Empire, the United States, the French Revolution, nor any other country or event you&#39;ll list sprang forth because of Freemasonry.

    <div class="md"><p>Obelisks are not prevalent within Freemasonry.</p>

<p>My tone has changed, because you all consider nothing that I&#39;m telling you -- all of which is true. You&#39;re simply waiting for me to post so that you can brush what I&#39;m saying off, and then you proceed to continue spouting off misinformation. Truth be told, it&#39;s exhausting -- like trying to have a conversation with a brick wall.</p>

<p>We absolutely can be truthful with those who aren&#39;t members. If you ask me a question and I&#39;m unable to answer it, I will simply let you know. There is very little in Freemasonry that is secret -- the modes of recognition and exactly how Degrees are conducted, really. Outside of that, we can talk. And things that are &quot;secret&quot; are widely available through any number of exposes, for the most part. </p>

<p>The secrets you believe the fraternity has are likely not real things. We don&#39;t have mystical powers. We don&#39;t change how governments move or conduct their business. We don&#39;t have anything remotely like that. If you were to join in an effort to seek them out, I believe that you would walk away dissatisfied. In my view, the real secrets are personal improvement, which are really no secret at all.</p>

<p>The issue is that I&#39;m going to post this, and your response (and everyone else&#39;s around here) will be, &quot;yeah right.&quot; And that&#39;ll be that. In many instances, truth is stranger than fiction. I assure you that this is not one of those.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Those pictures look just as bizarre to me as they do to you.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t recall ever seeing an obelisk in any Degree I&#39;ve ever been a part of. It&#39;s possible that they exist, to some extent, within Degrees that were retired in the past, but I didn&#39;t encounter any or their symbolism during the the first three Degrees or within the Scottish Rite. I&#39;m not a York Mason, but based on what I know of their Degrees, I would say they probably don&#39;t exist within their structure at all.</p>

<p>We use pillars and columns as symbols, but I&#39;ve never seen any that have sprouted hands. And for the record, that looks like a pyramid in the center to me.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It really <em>is</em> a fictional concept. Most Masons will tell you that the 3rd Degree is the highest you really ever go -- that anything above the Third is really more of a lateral &quot;move.&quot; I would agree with that. Everything you might learn in a &quot;higher&quot; Degree is already contained within the first three Degrees. Conversely, there&#39;s a considerable amount of overlap between the lessons you&#39;re to learn in the first three Degrees, too.</p>

<p>So, why have &quot;higher&quot; Degrees, then?</p>

<p>There are a few different reasons for that. </p>

<p>[<em>] It allows you to meet up, spend time, and converse with others who you might not see regularly in your &quot;low level&quot; Lodge.
[</em>] The Degrees or ceremonies might be teaching you the same lessons, but they do so differently. Think of it as looking at a light source through a prism. You&#39;re looking at the same thing, but the presentation is different. Different presentations will resonate differently with different people, if that makes sense.
[*] Some people simply like to collect honorific titles, I guess.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not necessarily that information is being withheld from the initiate; there&#39;s no lesson you&#39;ll learn through Freemasonry that you don&#39;t already know. It&#39;s that it&#39;s an initiatic process. It can work well if you study the Degrees in a particular order. The issue is that we (read that as &quot;society&quot;) place a very low value on virtue and things of that nature. Freemasonry aims to pull those things to the forefront and encourages you to make them important in your day-to-day life.</p>

Here i was thinking they had set up a systematic system of nepotism to rule the world and treat lesser races as cattle as stated in the talmud, but it turns out, they are just misunderstood, by people who are just jealous like myself, obviously. </p>

<p>I assume when you say &quot;Talmud&quot; you mean the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemara">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemara</a></p>

<p>The Talmud is two books, the other is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah</a>
- that book is just the Old Testament and the associated cannon</p>

<p>The Gemara is the one with rabbi&#39;s writing about &quot;goyim&quot; which I am guessing you think means Christian or race because you don&#39;t know anything- fun fact! It means &quot;idol worshippers&quot;
This guy explains that about 1500 years ago
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi</a></p>

<p>Later this guy wrote 13 simple principles on being Jewish

You can read them, none say making the other religions into cattle- I think you have us confused with Jesus </p>

<p>Luke 19, verse 27- pretty clear on killing the non-followers, I am guessing that&#39;s where Mohamed got it from </p>

They picked drugs, and that is how we went from having no international drug trade at all following WW2, to active, productive, burgeoning, violent worldwide drug cartels in less than a decade.  (Plus everything since.)</p>

<p>Except that there&#39;s no way to amend, limit, or let alone cut the CIA&#39;s budget. A lot of what they do is never disclosed. Ever. </p>

<p>It is absolutely ridiculous! Agree with that. But it&#39;s not like, as taxpayers, we (nor Congress, really) can opt-out let alone ask them to disclose what our money is going towards... </p>

<p>Never read it, probably should have by now since it is an interest of mine, so thanks, I just bought it on Amazon, for anyone reading</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since its creation in 1947, the CIA has been a byword for everything that is sinister and ruthless about America&#39;s projection of power during the Cold War and with the &#39;war on terror&#39;. There have been few major political events around the world in which the hidden hand of the Agency has not been seen. In countless movies and books, the CIA has been shown as decisive, brilliant and in control of its own secret world: the image of omnipotence.But this is an illusion. In reality, the CIA has been incompetent, naive, chaotic, and a danger to American interests for sixty years.LEGACY OF ASHES is both a horrifying and a richly enjoyable book. Tim Weiner&#39;s immense research reveals a startlingly consistent level of failure. The general dismay at the CIA&#39;s failure to see the fall of the Soviet Union, the end of the Cold War, the invasion of Kuwait, the events of 9/11, its wholly false assessment of Saddam&#39;s WMD and its role in the &#39;rendition&#39; of innocent suspects implies that it has fallen from some bygone golden age. LEGACY OF ASHES makes clear that the CIA has always been a blundering, ruinously incapable organization, with each decade providing its own low points. LEGACY OF ASHES is as gripping and powerful a narrative as its fictional movie counterparts, but the story it has to tell is a lot less comforting.</p>

<p>I had several lively debates with professors, including on the corporatization of the university itself. There, they just named the stadium after a bank, and they also had one &quot;JP Morgan Faculty&quot; position, if you can believe it. I also asked why one class (that was worth roughly $200) was given over to a Wall Street Journal salesman who spent the whole period pitching to the class. I was so incensed by that.

    <div class="md"><p>The problem when you talk about this stuff is that it&#39;s easy to think that America is super evil because the sources you get your info from only tell one side.  What you lose is the context that America did this stuff in and what other countries &amp; people have also done.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like saying America is evil for bombing an entire German city in 1944 -- until you look at the context that we bombed Dresden in.</p>

<p>Yes, we&#39;ve done coups in places, overthrown governments, funded rebel groups, done arms deals, etc. but in what contexts?  </p>

<p>Excusing all of this as 100% the work of god makes you a right wing American idiot.  Thinking that it&#39;s all the work of Satan makes you a left wing nutbag.  The truth is somewhere in the middle and, usually, more on the side that makes America a force of good over evil.</p>

<p>Good on you for doing so without knowing what would happen beforehand, but even if people would have called you those things, you still should absolutely stand your ground.</p>

<p>Stand in your truth regardless of who disagrees.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Just be careful not to ostracize yourself in school or work. Those are places you have to show up everyday and I personally struggle with social anxiety, so if i felt like someone was mad at me then it would motivate me to skip class or even quit my job. </p>

<p>That being said the biggest problem is that people are scared to actually reveal how they feel and challenge the status quo. The official narratives have an insidious effect which silences people and scares them into keeping quiet. This is how immigration got to where it did in the EU because no one wants to associated with racism although there are perfectly rational reasons why someone may not want to have mass immigration. </p>

<p>Calling people racists or paranoid conspiracy theorists is a form of bigotry but one that is accepted and it&#39;s just so fucking insidious and that&#39;s why it works. There are even threads on r/politics sometimes which reccomend splitting up with friends who may have libertarian or conservative views. And they try to convince people that things like states rights are only supported by racists for racial reasons. Its honestly horrible and almost like the way police are afraid to confront corruption. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good job man.  It&#39;s up to people like you to stick your neck out there.  A lot of people think shit and keep quiet.  </p>

<p>Think how many people in the 60s had their secret doubts that blacks are subhumans.  But they were afraid to speak up.  Think about how many people in the middle ages that had doubts that snakes can talk.  Think about how many people that think now that maybe Satan was actually a plumed serpent (a talking snake).   </p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying no matter what the official narrative is question it!  </p>

<p>The masses are always wrong!    </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m neither a Jester nor a Shriner. If some of their membership has done something wrong in the past, I&#39;m certain they were isolated, and I can say with certainty that those involved would have been expelled from the fraternity. You have bad apples in every group. Freemasonry tries to make sure that it has none, but at the end of the day, we&#39;re a cross-section of society.</p>

<p>And in regard to Pike&#39;s writings, I&#39;m certain you&#39;re missing context. It&#39;s very likely that you&#39;re taking a line or two out of context and not looking at the full scope of what he&#39;s saying. Generally, that&#39;s what those who try and put Freemasonry down do, though. I&#39;m not at all surprised.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I wasted a lot of time in college and ended up going back to work in fields that I had started in during highschool. Comparing with my peers, I can say that I made the right choice. </p>

<p>I had a prof who was a republican state senator. I had another that was so extremely liberal that they espoused comedy shows as the best source of political information. Most would be in the spectrum but lean heavily left if prompted. I like to challenge ideas so it&#39;s possible that I might have created situations that led to conversations in which political leanings were more obvious. Being politically middle really opens up the jimmie rustling market.</p>

<p>Being center of the road is the logical conclusion imo because there is no party that will perfectly represent you, ever. There is no person but you who can represent you. Personally, I find myself more fiscally conservative and ethically liberal but both are interchangable depending on topic. The more of a hardliner one becomes, the more concessions must be made in order to maintain that hard line. The further one leans to one side, the more extreme and radical they become. I think we all know how dangerous extremism can be with so many examples throughout history. Hardliners tend to close themselves off from opposition and make excuses for poor decisions in their parties favor. Picking a side that doesn&#39;t represent you wouldn&#39;t be advisable in any other forum, so why politics?</p>
