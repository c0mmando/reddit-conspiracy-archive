<p>For hours no one had any idea who did these attacks, and as soon as the media released <a href="https://i.imgur.com/48uiLyb.jpg">this</a> picture, <strong>EVERYONE</strong> immediately just bought it and said &quot;yep those are the guys! GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY!&quot; I remember being mass downvoted for even daring to question it.</p>

<p>It was on a now deleted account, but I remember I posted something along the lines of: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>For hours we had no idea who did this, now the media puts out this picture that literally just shows two brown men standing there with their faces circled, and we&#39;re just supposed to believe it was them? Why!?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I was downvoted to hell within minutes with comments calling me a conspiracy nut, tinfoil-hat, etc.</p>

<p>I still think those two men are innocent. But for some reason the public just believes whatever CNN and FOX tells them.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t get it.</p>

<p>Your memory is incorrect. The first pictures of the Tsarnaevs that were released were <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/boston/press-releases/2013/remarks-of-special-agent-in-charge-richard-deslauriers-at-press-conference-on-bombing-investigation-1">these</a> and that happened three days after the bombing.</p>

<p>Then the Tsarnaevs shot a policeman at MIT, carjacked someone, got in a shootout with police, and the surviving one hid in a boat in a driveway for many hours while a manhunt was underway.</p>

<p>At his trial, the prosecutors showed a video of him walking up to the location of one of the bombings with a backpack, then walking away without the backpack seconds before the bomb exploded.</p>

<p>Belittling the legitimate claims by stating they&#39;re all unreasonable. Check.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do we need to just systematically call every single tragedy that happens a false flag operation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Claiming that people call &quot;every single tragedy&quot; a false flag. Check.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I am on board with always being skeptical</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Try to give the appearance of being neutral and open-minded. Check.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>shitty things do still happen without government involvement</p>

<p>This shitty argument that is obviously true, but in no way applies in this instance. Check.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>that seems sadly delusional to me and disrespectful to people who got hurt or killed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;Disrespectful to the families!&quot;. Check.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re legitimately asking me for a &quot;reasonable alternate explanation&quot; for the BMB, then I&#39;ll be more than happy to point you in the right direction for information about the event. But based on your initial reply, I&#39;m gonna go ahead and assume that you aren&#39;t. (But if I&#39;m, wrong, I apologize, and would love to have an actual discussion regarding the official story vs the conspiracy theory.)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Sunil was only a &quot;suspect&quot; because reddit &quot;investigators&quot; thought he looked like the suspect in the FBI&#39;s picture. If you compare the many pictures we have now, it&#39;s clear that the suspect in the FBI picture is <em>not</em> Sunil. Particularly noteworthy was a mole on Sunil&#39;s cheek that is completely absent on the picture (but even without the mole, he doesn&#39;t really look like the suspect in the picture, while Tsarnaev matches him perfectly).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just found this article talking about how it was NBC&#39;s Pete Williams who finally reported the &quot;correct&quot; names of the suspects which helped to quell the confusion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s also not what the article says. You should read it more carefully. It actually says the opposite (that he <em>didn&#39;t</em> report the &quot;correct&quot; names until much later). They were identified by authorities early Friday morning (Thursday night) after one of the brothers was killed. The article just says he learned the names, but didn&#39;t report them. While other news outlets jumped at the chance to report names, Williams (according to the article) &quot;withheld revealing them.&quot;</p>

<p>The article even pins the time that Williams found out at 6:43am. By 6:48am Business insider had already published <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-2013-4">this</a> (somewhat lengthy) article identifying the suspects (and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if every news outlet found out at roughly the same time). It&#39;s pretty obvious Williams did not break the story with the &quot;correct&quot; names and his reporting of the events don&#39;t reveal some kind &quot;connection&quot; you seem to be trying to draw.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your entire first paragraph is completely irrelevant considering I never called him a &quot;suspect&quot; at all.</p>

<p>And as for reading the article &quot;more carefully&quot;, I can only assume that you must not have read any of it at all, as what I wrote is literally what the article is about.</p>

<p>What&#39;s amazing to me, is that you took all this time to write a lengthy response, all the while, side-stepping the main point of my entire post. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wait, <em>I&#39;m</em> muddying the waters?</p>

<p><a href="/u/jonp5065">/u/jonp5065</a> brought up reddit wrongly fingering suspects. You&#39;re clearly implying that the guy brought up was a suspect by saying that his circumstances are &quot;suspicious&quot; and that you wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he was involved. Or is that not what your implication here is?</p>

<p>I pointed out that the <em>only</em> connection he has to the bombing is online &quot;investigators&quot; thinking he looked like one of the FBI suspects. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s the only connection. Or do you have <em>anything</em> at all that ties him to the bombing?</p>

<p>So, is your point that he&#39;s a suspect or not? If not, what <em>is</em> your point? Why don&#39;t you help me out here and clear up the waters and just make your point clear instead of claiming that an irrelevant (to the bombing) event is &quot;suspicious&quot;?</p>

<p>So he&#39;s commended for being accurate and cautious. Is there a point to bringing this up, or are you just trying to muddy the waters?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There was a whole uproar on reddit because of the damage caused to that kid by the Reddit investigation squad. It was a big deal and was reported in the media a Reddit&#39;s irresponsibly pseudo-journalism.  That took a day or two before the photos pinpointing Tsarnaev&#39;s came out.       Now the FBI/Merc guys standing around the site with the walkie talkies who the FBI guy comes to first after the incident...that&#39;s who I&#39;m interesting in hearing more about but have not ever heard anything after Alex Jones got hold of the conspiracy and managed to discredit it by touting it in the way he does.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I feel the same, but it is nice to see this upvoted to the top of the thread on this sub. While so many others seem to be losing their head over &#39;shills&#39; and claiming the end is nigh for this sub, I actually see it improving. Not long ago, Boston Bombing threads and even Moon Landing hoax threads would be instantly downvoted. Seems to me like improvement is happening.</p>
