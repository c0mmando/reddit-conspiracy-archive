       I remember a few hours after the bombing happened, every media outlet started releasing a picture that featured two men standing in a large crowd. Their faces were circled.
      </p>
      <p>
       For hours no one had any idea who did these attacks, and as soon as the media released
       <a href="https://i.imgur.com/48uiLyb.jpg">
        this
       </a>
       picture,
       <strong>
        EVERYONE
       </strong>
       immediately just bought it and said "yep those are the guys! GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY!" I remember being mass downvoted for even daring to question it.
      </p>
      <p>
       It was on a now deleted account, but I remember I posted something along the lines of:
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        For hours we had no idea who did this, now the media puts out this picture that literally just shows two brown men standing there with their faces circled, and we're just supposed to believe it was them? Why!?"
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       I was downvoted to hell within minutes with comments calling me a conspiracy nut, tinfoil-hat, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       I still think those two men are innocent. But for some reason the public just believes whatever CNN and FOX tells them.
      </p>
      <p>
       I don't get it.

       Really eye opening, granted I skipped around but I got the jist of it. I knew something was off about that when it happened. This confirms it all, I wonder if the people behind these false flags watch these videos to learn their mistakes for next time. Can't really trust anything shown on TV it seems, glad I stopped watching it a long time ago.

       Your memory is incorrect. The first pictures of the Tsarnaevs that were released were
       <a href="https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/boston/press-releases/2013/remarks-of-special-agent-in-charge-richard-deslauriers-at-press-conference-on-bombing-investigation-1">
        these
       </a>
       and that happened three days after the bombing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the Tsarnaevs shot a policeman at MIT, carjacked someone, got in a shootout with police, and the surviving one hid in a boat in a driveway for many hours while a manhunt was underway.
      </p>
      <p>
       At his trial, the prosecutors showed a video of him walking up to the location of one of the bombings with a backpack, then walking away without the backpack seconds before the bomb exploded.

       "mainstream narrative" does not mean it's automatically incorrect, and the conspiracy narrative does not mean it's automatically correct.
      </p>
      <p>
       Maybe if you'd gave as much scrutiny to a conspiracy theory that you give to what you hear in the news, this place wouldn't be the walking definition of confirmation bias.

       Ive never heard any reasonable alternate explanations. Do we need to just systematically call every single tragedy that happens a false flag operation? I am on board with always being skeptical, but come on, shitty things do still happen without government involvement. Some people are making claims the whole thing never happened and it was all actors and media manipulation...that seems sadly delusional to me and disrespectful to people who got hurt or killed

       If you're legitimately asking me for a "reasonable alternate explanation" for the BMB, then I'll be more than happy to point you in the right direction for information about the event. But based on your initial reply, I'm gonna go ahead and assume that you aren't. (But if I'm, wrong, I apologize, and would love to have an actual discussion regarding the official story vs the conspiracy theory.)

       Sunil was only a "suspect" because reddit "investigators" thought he looked like the suspect in the FBI's picture. If you compare the many pictures we have now, it's clear that the suspect in the FBI picture is
       <em>
        not
       </em>
       Sunil. Particularly noteworthy was a mole on Sunil's cheek that is completely absent on the picture (but even without the mole, he doesn't really look like the suspect in the picture, while Tsarnaev matches him perfectly).
      </p>
      <blockquote>
       <p>
        Just found this article talking about how it was NBC's Pete Williams who finally reported the "correct" names of the suspects which helped to quell the confusion.
       </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
       That's also not what the article says. You should read it more carefully. It actually says the opposite (that he
       <em>
        didn't
       </em>
       report the "correct" names until much later). They were identified by authorities early Friday morning (Thursday night) after one of the brothers was killed. The article just says he learned the names, but didn't report them. While other news outlets jumped at the chance to report names, Williams (according to the article) "withheld revealing them."
      </p>
      <p>
       The article even pins the time that Williams found out at 6:43am. By 6:48am Business insider had already published
       <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/dzhokhar-tsarnaev-2013-4">
        this
       </a>
       (somewhat lengthy) article identifying the suspects (and I wouldn't be surprised if every news outlet found out at roughly the same time). It's pretty obvious Williams did not break the story with the "correct" names and his reporting of the events don't reveal some kind "connection" you seem to be trying to draw.

       brought up reddit wrongly fingering suspects. You're clearly implying that the guy brought up was a suspect by saying that his circumstances are "suspicious" and that you wouldn't be surprised if he was involved. Or is that not what your implication here is?
      </p>
      <p>
       I pointed out that the
       <em>
        only
       </em>
       connection he has to the bombing is online "investigators" thinking he looked like one of the FBI suspects. That's it. That's the only connection. Or do you have
       <em>
        anything
       </em>
       at all that ties him to the bombing?
      </p>
      <p>
       So, is your point that he's a suspect or not? If not, what
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       your point? Why don't you help me out here and clear up the waters and just make your point clear instead of claiming that an irrelevant (to the bombing) event is "suspicious"?

       I truly believe the MSM in this country are direct extensions of the deep state government, look back at the history, always banging the war drum and being favorable for laws that go against the common man and woman, the "Patriot" Act for instance.

       I don't have any doubt that there are elements within the MSM that are 100% deep state and actively push those agendas. They are likely in high places. Jeff Zucker at CNN comes to mind.

       I tell people this stuff all the time and they look at me like I'm a nut. I tell them to watch the senate hearings where they admit to having infiltrated print media and cannot discuss TV media in an open session. They never do. They rather be controlled and manipulated. It's incredibly frustrating.

       I feel the same, but it is nice to see this upvoted to the top of the thread on this sub. While so many others seem to be losing their head over 'shills' and claiming the end is nigh for this sub, I actually see it improving. Not long ago, Boston Bombing threads and even Moon Landing hoax threads would be instantly downvoted. Seems to me like improvement is happening.

       There was a whole uproar on reddit because of the damage caused to that kid by the Reddit investigation squad. It was a big deal and was reported in the media a Reddit's irresponsibly pseudo-journalism.  That took a day or two before the photos pinpointing Tsarnaev's came out.       Now the FBI/Merc guys standing around the site with the walkie talkies who the FBI guy comes to first after the incident...that's who I'm interesting in hearing more about but have not ever heard anything after Alex Jones got hold of the conspiracy and managed to discredit it by touting it in the way he does.

       because that was what was reported, dude only took one photo in Boston.
      </p>
      <p>
       examine the picture with some zoom.
      </p>
      <p>
       this is the larger version of the cropped no backpack picture used in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       the back pack has been photoshopped out, but the picture is still large.

       the boston hoax really opened up a lot of eyes to the way the news is fabricated. but of course TPTB can't hep themselves and continue doing what has always worked in the past, and each time they do, more people are able to observe and dissect these operations and expose them
      </p>
      <p>
       even the Charlottesville hoax has been exposed. and peoples are willing to accept that something is a hoax more and more easily. people are getting more skeptical

       The trauma shown in the photos is fake! Crop any picture of leg boy and show to a nurse or doctor without context... They will say "is this from a movie?" because it does not look real.

       Only in the context of "what everyone else believes" does it look real.

       Ummm I can name the scenario.  It was a giant hoax and the lady in the pink vest was splashing water on each fake injury site to activate the fake blood powder.  She also would reach into her purse and drop fake blood packets to each fake injured person

       When the television doesn't immediately know what happened and who did it, something unplanned just happened.  When they do "know" what happened right away, it is a dead give away that everything is going as planned.

       I could tell they were lying about 9/11 immediately by the way they presented the story. I said it would be used as a pretext for war and a creeping police state. I think you're right about how if they hammer home a story with a villain right away it's fishy.

       Its like the coverage for Sandy Hook. I clearly remember that as the situation was "unfolding" the media reported that there was a shooter in the school and a man in army military camo outside the school with a rifle. After about #) minutes it was just the kid in the school and no more mention of the man outside. Sounds like a handler to me.

       Has anyone every tried to piece together the "baseball hat" part of these false flags? Why would these two even wear white and black hats? It makes no sense at all unless it's to help the operations managers keep track of them on CCTV etc.
      </p>
      <p>
       And why the big "B" logo? Bridgestone? Just get a couple black/dark hats with no logos if you're trying to hide your face and get away with this.

       There was a whole uproar on reddit because of the damage caused to that kid by the Reddit investigation squad. It was a big deal and was reported in the media a Reddit's irresponsibly pseudo-journalism.  That took a day or two before the photos pinpointing Tsarnaev's came out.       Now the FBI/Merc guys standing around the site with the walkie talkies who the FBI guy comes to first after the incident...that's who I'm interesting in hearing more about but have not ever heard anything after Alex Jones got hold of the conspiracy and managed to discredit it by touting it in the way he does.

       So is 4 the "canned response" to 2+2? Paste a link to the best source/evidence and I will clear my mind and attempt to take a look objectively

       I feel the same, but it is nice to see this upvoted to the top of the thread on this sub. While so many others seem to be losing their head over 'shills' and claiming the end is nigh for this sub, I actually see it improving. Not long ago, Boston Bombing threads and even Moon Landing hoax threads would be instantly downvoted. Seems to me like improvement is happening.
