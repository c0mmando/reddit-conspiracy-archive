        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Not trying to incite a debate, but I had this thought. If (nano)thermite was supposedly placed within the towers to ensure their collapse, why has their never been testimony by any one of the workers who would&#39;ve participated in doing this? (not even one person out of remorse for how many people were killed?) </p>

<p>I understand these people are in the position where they could be easily suicided if they threatened to release enough damning evidence that they participated in wiring the buildings with thermite. But I also doubt these kinds of &#39;workers&#39; are still being paid enough to shut up (if that&#39;s the case) or are still being watched closely by whatever government agency (assuming the CIA had a hand in 9/11). Also, how do you live with yourself for this long knowing you participated in killing literally thousands of people by being a paid CIA stooge? Do these people work under some normal cover but do trades-type work for the CIA? How many people could&#39;ve possibly been involved in wiring up the building/posing as construction types? </p>

<p>Sorry for asking so many questions, but genuinely interested in seeing what others have to say about this. Please point me in the direction of there being testimony by such people if it exists, I haven&#39;t been able to find anything.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>mossad has its own detractors and whistleblowers just like any other government agency. short of the secrecy that was managed during the development of the manhattan project, there will always be people connected on some level to these types of things (9/11) when they happen. how many people would it take to wire up all of those buildings with thermite? my point being, if they were all mossad, you don&#39;t think at least 1 or 2 might&#39;ve tried to come forward with their story?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>To speculate on motivations is not helpful unless there is data that implicates someone.  Now there are several mechanism in place that work in conjunction to minimize the chance of leaking.  </p>

<p>The first is that the actual work could have been subcontracted out to a foreign entity.   That would subtract from this kind of patriotic remorse angle. </p>

<p>The second is of course money.  This alone would keep a significant portion of people quit.</p>

<p>The third would be Non Disclosure Agreements, which if violated would result in legal action</p>

<p>The fourth would be different varieties of states secrets privilege. Which again if violated would result in severe legal action.  The threat of legal action alone is enough to ensure that a good size of people don&#39;t speak. </p>

<p>The fifth is compartmentalization, in the sense that many that might have worked on the project did not know what the project was that they were working on. </p>

<p>The sixth is the threat on one&#39;s life.  These organizations are not above extrajudicial killings and assassinations.   The treat alone is  enough to keep a good portion of the people silent. </p>

<p>The last obstacle is that even if someone did come forward, would you believe them?   Not only is it necessary to come forward, but it is also necessary to be taken seriously by the audience and the media.  We have a lot of example of how this goes... characters get assassinated,  skeptics employ all sorts of sophistry to discredit, etc.  So even if one managed the courage to come out, it is no guarantee that it would accomplish anything.    I mean look at the CDC whistle-blower concerning the autism data manipulation, or the scientists accusing Merck of falsifying data in a lawsuit, not so much as a peep through the media channels. </p>

<p>Now when you take all these factors together, their cumulative effect is almost a guarantee that no one will step forward. </p>

<p>Cause it never happened.

    <div class="md"><p>You havent even wrapped your head around the controlled demo&#39;s in 911? That is like basic conspiracy arithmetic you learn day 1. Thankfully it is official science now because of Dr. Hulsey.</p>

<p>Check out the study done by the University of Alaska Fairbanks and Dr. Hulsey. The first indepedent scientific analysis done on the collapse of WTC 7 since the day because NIST cant be bothered to release their analysis for peer review after 16 whole years. </p>

<p>The demolition of WTC 7 is official Science now (technically not until their study is published and peer reviewed but it will be soon unlike NIST) and will be corroberated. </p>

<p>Thankfully you dont need to blindly speculate anymore. Fire did NOT and COULD not cause the collapse of WTC 7. Conclusion: your first paragraph is closer to the truth.</p>

<p>Wtf are you talking about man.</p>

<p>I linked a scientific analysis conducted by the head of civil and environmental engineering at UofAlaska Fairbanks that will shortly be published in a scientific journal, peer reviewed, and corroborated which NIST hasn&#39;t done in 16 years.</p>

<p>He is giving the presentation to a room full of Engineering and architecture experts as well. I don&#39;t WANT to believe fuck all, in fact I WANT to believe that my government and intelligence services would never harm or lie to me but unfortunately that would require unconscionable amounts of cognitive dissonance.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve linked <strong>nothing</strong>.</p>

<p>The NIST report has been debunking the theory since 2008. It&#39;s dumb to still be on this and to believe that:</p>

<p>A) The government is SO powerful and competent that they could easily get away with this.</p>

<p>B) No one involved <strong>IN ANY WAY</strong> would spill the beans.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>So you linked Wikipedia and the same NIST report I referenced......</p>

<p>The same report they NEVER released for peer review or published in a Scientific journal. The same report that was peer reviewed in the link I provided you for the first time ever. Just because they are NIST doesn&#39;t mean their word is Science. It is not shit until it is published and reviewed and when it finally was (by my link) it was disproven. </p>

<p>Effectively the study by the UofAlaska Fairbanks IS a peer review of the NIST report and it says that their report is false and fires could not have caused the collapse of WTC 7.</p>

<p>It does not say nor prove, nor attempt to prove that demolitions were used it simply refutes the claim by NIST that fires caused the collapse. The demolition aspect is STRONGLY inferred by any credible mind</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You point me to pizzagate emails, whose interpretations are mostly rhetoric, and sure, while some of those emails sound weirdly phrased and awkward, making one inclined to believe they represent some sort of code, there is still no real convincing evidence that those emails represent some child trafficking group out of DC let alone some massive worldwide group you seem to believe in.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve followed pizzagate, and I too wanted to believe there was something there. James Alefantis is a strange guy. But I just don&#39;t see it.</p>

<p>Out of curiousity, how could you watch separate survivor testimonies, learn about pizzagate, then be convinced that &#39;12-15% of Americans are in the subculture&#39; ? You strung all of that together by what reasoning?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You talk about a &#39;cult&#39;. Cults are organized groups. What I see in those articles, and I&#39;ve spent much time reading about those same stories, are cases that do not seem to overlap much with each other with regards to the perpetrators, actual or not depending on the case. At best, maybe some people shared a board seat together on a company or were included to the same exclusive political event. No evidence linking all of them to some singular cult! I&#39;m not saying that neither of these cases have any validity to them, some seem to be more real than others, but still, no evidence of an internationally organized network.</p>

<p>One argument you could make would be taking a stretch to link together some of the same handful of deplorables in the CIA linked to known black projects, who would seem to appear in some way related to those cases you linked. But even still, no immediate involvement by these people (I won&#39;t name them by name, read those same articles you posted and figure it out; especiall the ISGP ones)</p>
