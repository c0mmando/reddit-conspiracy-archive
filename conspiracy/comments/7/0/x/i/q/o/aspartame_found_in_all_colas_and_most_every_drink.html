       This is one of the most dangerous substances next to white sugar which is probably worst. These corporations are knowingly poisoning us with addictive poisons like aspartame because they seek to keep us addicted for higher profits.
      </p>
      <p>
       I could tell some of the diet teas at local stores tasted unhealthy in comparison to preservative free diet tea which is pretty much the only healthy drink left other than water. I checked the back and saw it had aspartame. This unhealthy drug along with white sugar are prime suspects in the diabetics and obesity epidemic in America and most people have no idea that this is a problem.

       Literally everything seems to cause depression. From cell phone radiation, to wifi radiation, to fluoride, to pesticides, to everything we drink...

       Good thing there's a pill for that!

       But yeah, aspartame is deadly. I remember there was buried research in order to get it legalized. The research showed that it literally put holes in rats brains.

       This is the end. They ruined the richest country on earth. Systems break down when they are built on weak ideas like the federal reserve or endless fake wars.

       On the bright side, there is a lot of talk on disclosure and mass arrest happening this year. I hope it ls true.

       My cousins father in law was recently diagnosed with plasma cancer. Seriously, blood cancer attributed to drinking 7-10 diet pops a day. That seems like a high amount sure, but now he's dying due to drinking this stuff. Worse off is I myself am diabetic (type 1) and I use to drink a lot of diet pop because it was free of carbs. Turns out it's probably worse than normal pop. I drink water mainly now, with pop being like a treat.

       Same boat here. I live up in NY but I have to come down here a day or two a week to take care of my sick mother.  She's had cancer on-and-off for 15 years now.  She'll change everything about her diet except an addiction to this Gold Peak diet candy water that she must drink a gallon of a day.  Maybe more.  And she mewls like "but I neeed it" in this childlike way so we just let her have it.  I probably should just dump it all down the drain and say straight tea or water from now on.  But she's one of these "I don't like the taste of water" adult babies that needs everything to be candy and pleasure.  It's just so sad.  "I prefer my soda..."  What a life.

       came here to talk about gum.  99% of gum is "sugar-free" now, which means it contains aspartame.  Who is really worried about how much sugar they will ingest from a single stick of gum?

       Oh so diabetics are getting all of their nutrition from gum now? They eat 40 - 50 sticks of gum per day? Even if what you're saying is true, the gum industry supplied the demand for sugar free gum, why is it almost impossible to get regular sugar gum nowadays? I've seriously tried and only found Hubba Bubba.

       Also a laxative.  But better than aspartame/NutraSweet in every way.

       P.S.  there is an 80x stronger version of NutraSweet called NeoTame.  The FDA ruled that since NeoTame requires so little with it being so ridiculously strong it need not be included in ingredients lists or labeling, and can even be added to "organic" milk.

       I used to drink a type of instant powdered coffee as a teen which was full of it. Drank several cups a day for about 5-7  years and ended up with gallbladder problems in my mid 20s and needed it removed. I've never been a very big soda drinker and I ate relatively healthy as a teen, so it's a bit suspicious to me.

       7-11 is the most commonly known convenient store. When I say 7-11, I'm hoping the reader understands this goes for all convenient stores. I'm not targeting 7-11. I'm targeting apartame and white sugar.

       Here's something you don't know my picky health conscious friends: every sushi bar's pickled ginger is loaded with aspartame. Go to an asian market, read the bottles. It's beyond belief how they slip poison to you. Another: Dr. Paul Ehrlich wrote in the 70's of a central American herb the native women used to abort and prevent pregnancies. Know what it ended up being sold as? Stevia.

       It disrupts hormones needed for reproduction. One would think this would be front page news in medical journals concerned with infertility. Imagine if you were a fertility specialist and your patient was handing over
       <em>
        thousands of dollars for a cure
       </em>
       at the same time as she was sweetening her tea with stevia? It could go on forever! Sweet lucre, vacations, caviar dreams!

       Probably not. The water should be reverse osmosis or distilled. Teas? Nope, one of the earliest discoveries by the British was that Tea has an affinity to fluoride rich soils: the cheaper teas have more fluoride. At the time they noted how sedate and accommodating, and
       <em>
        dumber
       </em>
       the population became. The Brits taught it to the Krauts who saw fit to pump it into the camp's water supply, Auschwitz etc..

       These fuckers are slow killing us, but not until maximal income can be made off them, easy when bad choices made by poisoned and sick people lead to more opportunities to fleece the chumps. Example: booze and the attendant health issues..."but I was just trying to relax...."

       Go for the large bottles of Coke Zero, double or triple consumption, the "problem" will take care of itself. And when you awake on the heart/lung machine connected to a taxi meter, ching ching ching

       Sorry to rain on your parade, but carbonation leads to calcium leaching in your bones. Best to start making your own tea or kombucha. It was easy, but I don't drink alcohol, so I had to quit, cuz I was catching a buzz when check on fermentation.

       It must also negatively effect the overall human energy field. 8 years ago I drank it exclusively for a one month period. Everything bad started happening to me from health issues and relationships, to problems with my car, house and belongings. These all corrected immediately after ending consumption of Aspartame.

       I apologize for the essay post I'm about to write. I just have a lot to say about this subject because it's something I personally went through. I didn't pull this off youtube videos or anything.
      </p>
      <p>
       Let me start off by saying I know there's a lot of bad *hit in this existence. Maybe I was naive to have the small glimmer of hope that I had involving dangerous things not going to market. Needless to say I've grown wiser and it's something I don't believe anymore. Show enough money and it'll pass through.
      </p>
      <p>
       So Aspartame. Ah, my own little "Flowers in the Attic" poisoning scenario. Still blows my mind what that mess could do. I'll flat out admit that I've suffered from depression and all the bad crap that comes with it since I was a kid. I think this stuff amped me up to another level. The things that were happening to me due to aspartame and other sweeteners* I'll list for everybody.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was very jumpy. The smallest noise would practically make me jump out of my skin. Looking at how I was acting, you'd probably think I had came back from a war zone and had PTSD or I was on hardcore drugs.
      </p>
      <p>
       Eyelid was swollen a couple of times.
      </p>
      <p>
       I got a rash on my skin that wouldn't go away no matter what kind of lotion I put on there.
      </p>
      <p>
       I noticed if I put on a certain type of lip gloss that contained sweetener, my hands would shake. It was a very noticeable shaking. Threw the rest of the container away.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the risk of being tmi, I'm a woman in my early 30s that still has a menstrual cycle. My periods were worse on the bleeding and cramping factor.
      </p>
      <p>
       Mouth bleeding. I had a cough and used some grape cough syrup and the sweetener in that caused such a horrifying reaction that I'll never touch cough syrup again. I'm not talking a little bit of blood that only happened once. I'm talking about enough blood that it looked like I'd been punched in the mouth. This would happen multiple times a day and lasted about a week until the *hit was out of my system.
      </p>
      <p>
       I rarely have headaches. I had the worst headache after I started coming off Aspartame and eaten a carrot salad prepared with sweetener.
      </p>
      <p>
       I want to mention that when I cut that shit out completely, a lot of things I'm talking about went away. I don't jump out of my skin at the smallest noise anymore, my eyelid hasn't been swollen, the rash went away, etc.

       I hate seeing this being brought up. It hits really close to home for me. The wife drinks this shit(diet coke) like it's water. While drinks water as well I can't help but feel that she's affected by it.
      </p>
      <p>
       She works out 3X week and eats totally clean otherwise. Consistently depressed, with the odd panic/anxiety attack once a month, sometimes more. She's taking anti-depressents, that aren't doing a damn thing.

       She refuses to believe me on this "conspiracy." So frustrating.

       Question all you like, but trying to undermine the credibility of the source is the oldest trick in the book. I mean you could bring up studies that suggest the opposite, that aspartame is safe. But no you are quoting shit about HIV and AIDS which has little to no relevance to the discussion.

       Sure, but quoting stuff about HIV is reaching a bit in your attempts to discredit this guy, so no one bothers to read what he actually says. That's generally the point in attacking the source. X was wrong about one thing, therefore no one should listen to him on any other subject. It's much more productive to actually a challenge the source on the chosen topic.

         There's a difference between being wrong about who won last night's football game and being wrong about medically accepted facts. The fact that he believes discredited research while also pushing other medical beliefs is why I being his credibility into question.

       Medically accepted facts. Who decides what are the facts? Did medicine get the lipid hypothesis correct? Was the conclusion reached by the official organizations at parity with the majority of the published research? The answer is probably no. Health has become extremely politicized. Just because this guy has opinions that do not align with these organizations does not mean he is correct or incorrect. It also doesn't invalidate his conclusions about aspartame. If you want to actually debate the subject, you should debate the subject, and not try and discredit the source based upon unrelated claims. If you can't address the argument at hand, you probably have no argument at all.

       The war on sugar is a joke.  There's nothing wrong with eating it unless you have too much.  Artificial sweeteners like Aspartame are infinitely more harmful.  Newsflash - if you want to lose weight, exercise regularly  and reduce carb intake.  There's no other way.

       There was a tv show I watched on BBC where a pair of identical twin brothers each went on a diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       One diet was a junk diet of whatever he wanted to eat, the other brother had a strict zero sugar diet.
      </p>
      <p>
       At the end of the test period it was the guy who had ate no sugar at all that was at high risk of diabetes. You need some sugar, just as you say not excessive amounts. A bit of fruit everyday will do the trick.

       It is worth reiterating that the post title is misleading and erroneous. While aspartame is indeed a poison, it is neither found in all colas nor in most every drink stocked at convenience stores. It is common in diet sodas and other "diet" products, but not in full-sugar or high fructose corn syrup beverages. However; take a close look at ingredient labels on some "natural" or cheap sweet drinks, and you will discover that sucralose (Splenda) has been slipped in without any special branding to indicate its use. Last time I looked at the ingredients in Monster, sucralose was present. Also the case with Peace Tea (all natural?), Faygo, Shasta, etc. Read your product labels because no company is going to tell you the truth about a product's wholesomeness in their large print.

       For reals, avoid:
Aspertame
Sucralose
Stevia
High fructose or any corn syrup
Xylitol
"Natural" flavors 
And limit your cane/sugar.  Even commercial grade honey now has a lot of corn syrup added. Buy real maple syrup and raw/organic honey/sugar.

       I break out in bad hives all over my neck if I have aspartame.  Gum is fine I guess because its a small amount, but if I actually drink a diet soda, my scalp and neck get incredibly itchy and I end up scratching my neck until its bleeding.  I've been served gin and tonics more than once that were made with diet tonic water.  Apparently this is common because many people think the diet tonic tastes better.

       It's been in my experience that there's actually three kinds of artificial sweeteners: tastes like metal, pounding migraine, and explosive diarrhea. Which is why I'll just deal with the sugars and take my chances with diabetes.
      </p>
      <p>
       From what it sounds like here, I'm guessing this is the pounding migraine one?

       1) Don't buy anything with the word 'Diet' in it.
      </p>
      <p>
       2) The difference between white sugar and brown sugar is simply that you don't get the good minerals from the brown sugar. White sugar is not bad for you as such. Only too much sugar in general is bad (and seriously addictive)

       Sorry but I think you are mistaken. White sugar is a very addictive substance that is only good in very small quantities per day. Anything more than a tiny bit can lead to obesity, diabetes, addiction, anxiety, and other stuff. I personally stay away from it all the time but then realized Aspartame is just as bad.

       Brown sugar is white sugar + molasses, which does have natural occuring minerals. Raw sugar is cane sugar, less refined, it is the "better", but pure maple syrup or raw honey is the healthiest sweetner choice.

       There was a guy I used to work with, he'd drink about 4-5 coke cans, smoke ~5 fags a day, for lunch he'd have either dominos, burger and chips or subway. He knew he was overweight and understood why, but could not figure out why he had headaches, sweats, fatigue, cramps, IBS and muscle pain all the time. He'd spend every fucking day moaning about something causing him pain while we're all stood there watching him drink poison. (yes we told him many many times) but no it has to be an underlying medical issue doesn't it, fatty?!

         There's a difference between being wrong about who won last night's football game and being wrong about medically accepted facts. The fact that he believes discredited research while also pushing other medical beliefs is why I being his credibility into question. If this were political in nature you would not see anything wrong with my questioning.
