       James Fields was the white whale the MSM was desperately searching for to boost the narrative that Islam has nothing to do with terror.  White men are just as bad and we finally have it on video with a dead girl. It was a perfect setup for the media to expose his entire history of life thus incriminating every connection, potential influence he had.  Where were the lengthy segments on  Fields listening to Hannity/Rush, the toxic masculinity of his FPS video games, his school records?  Anything they could find to use him as a bludgeoning tool to berate conservative America should have been there.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the attacks on Trump took center stage, Fields became a ghost.  Who was he? The next Timothy McVeigh? Or was he simply a prop in a psy-op that fizzled out too quickly?

       CNN still would have found time for a 15 minute expose' knowing their recent behavior.  There is still a decent gap of time post Charlottesville pre-Harvey.  I used to work in the media, far from clueless.

       The concerted focus on Fields seems to fade on or after August 16th.  Wall to wall Coverage on Harvey starts August 24th.  8 days is a lifetime in media cycles.  The media went after Trump hard post Charlottesville.  Fields could have been a useful thread to connect to White Supremacy/Trump narrative that was dominant.  I think the media wasn't getting what they wanted by digging into Fields past.

       The media would absolutely have had no qualms about doxxing.  It should have been a gold rush for every journalist to hit the internet to find smoking guns. Pro -Trump posts, pro Alex Jones postings, even a Pepe meme would have been considered a huge score inside left wing media circles

       This is still a pretty fresh story and I'm sure that there will still be a trial. Now, if he died when he crashed his car we might see all of those things but since he is still awaiting trial and sentencing, I bet his background info will come out more slowly.

       Good points.  The most obvious conspiracies are the lone assassins, shooters that die before a trial, where a defense lawyer has the process of discovery on behalf of his client.  For whatever reason I get the sense the media faded on the guy because something in the background wasn't a slam dunk for their narrative.  That's the softest touch on the subject I can present, before we go full down the rabbit hole.

       No I totally get where you're coming from, and that's a responsible way to look at it. The less info we get, the more concerning it is. Hopefully it will all be fleshed out and we'll find out more about him soon.

       Lots of Leftist "masquerading as the Other Side" nonsense. It's right in Saul Alinski's "Rules for Radicals". He straight up says, "Do not argue with your opponent (he might win). Instead, dress up in a KKK outfit and show up at one of his speeches, pretending to be a supporter".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's a classic leftist tactic.

       I personally know a young college student who participated. Her name is Sarah Woody. And, yes: She talked.

       She was paid.

       Here's a video with he Craiglist ad, seeking actors for the Charlottesville event. And you're right: I erred. It wasn't $50/hour, but $25:

       And what could constitute proof to you?
      </p>
      <p>
       If I videotaped her telling you what she told me, you'd simply say she was lying.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I got a sworn affidavit, you'd simply say I made it up.
      </p>
      <p>
       If I gave you a paper trail (like the one where Soros front companies were paying actors $25/hour to masquerade as white nationalists) you'd claim that it was fraudulent.
      </p>
      <p>
       That's the thing with you: I can give you direct quotes from Saul Alinski's
       <em>
        Rules for Radicals
       </em>
       about discrediting opponents by dressing up as Klansmen. I can provide you with photos of Antifa dressing up in fake white nationalist outfits. I can give you the Craigslist ad where they were hiring actors before the event.
      </p>
      <p>
       And it will never be enough for you to admit that your narrative is debunked.
      </p>
      <p>
       You don't even believe in proof or evidence. Logic is part of the "white patriarchy," right?
      </p>
      <p>
       Your side is emotion-based.
      </p>
      <p>
       Emotion-based people don't accept logic, reason or evidence.

       There seems to be a huge drop off in coverage on him 5 days after the event.  His usefulness to the media wouldn't expire that fast, unless we are in a new age when the window is that much tighter to get any stories out.

       Honestly, I think its not in response to, but more of a preventative measure.  They want complete control of the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       "It recently revised a “Press Release and Public Information Policy” that provides guidance for police officers regarding how, what, and when information should be given to the press and public. The revisions came in July, and local journalists aren’t happy.
“The policy leaves it up to individual state troopers to determine what is news and what isn’t,” Michael Donoghue, the executive director of the Vermont Press Association, tells CJR. “Crimes, including sexual assaults, armed robberies, arsons, burglaries, embezzlements, drugs, and more are not required to be disclosed. Vermonters want to know if they are safe in their homes and out on the streets.”
      </p>
      <p>
       The new policy [PDF] prefers ambiguity to clarity and transparency. Worse, it allows officers and police officials to make subjective calls on newsworthiness, which is obviously going to make policing the police that much more difficult. This part is particularly problematic, as it restricts dissemination of information to that which is subjectively defined as "significant public interest."

       I was at a fairly lefty event that night, big screens showing results trickling in. I had to skeedaddle when the likelihood became apparent, before my friends who surely voted for HRC could grab me to cry on my shoulder; I knew I'd've sucked at faking sympathy for their real (&amp;entirely misguided) pain.

       They were probably so confident.  I was 65% sure Trump would win.  I lived right outside of Wilkes-Barre/Scranton PA.  Older Legacy Dems were moving en masse to Trump.  Having a Hillary sign meant public shame in my rural area. Luzerme county pa had a 25 point swing to Trump from Romney.

       I know there are homeless Americans.  I can walk and chew gum at the same time.  And so can the media.  The NYT will run 18 stories on Harvey at landfall, but on a daily basis they run 300 pieces via the web or the physical paper itself.

       Maybe, just maybe, the MSM could cover more than one storyline in a 24 hour period. 
Local news seems to pull it off every evening, but they have a lesser agenda.

       The concerted focus on Fields seems to fade on or after August 16th.  Wall to wall Coverage on Harvey starts August 24th.  8 days is a lifetime in media cycles.  The media went after Trump hard post Charlottesville.  Fields could have been a useful thread to connect to White Supremacy/Trump narrative that was dominant.  I think the media wasn't getting what they wanted by digging into Fields past.
