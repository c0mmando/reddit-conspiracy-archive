    <div class="md"><p>I missed that thread...looks like it&#39;s because it was an archive.org post instead of the original article.</p>

<p>That being said, I just read through the comments in that thread, and many of them are shitting on OP and the source instead of discussing the actual content, which is very typical of the dramatic rise of forum sliding we&#39;ve been experiencing lately.</p>

<p>Hopefully this thread won&#39;t suffer the same fate, but your complaining comment (which you posted within minutes of me submitting this) certainly doesn&#39;t bode well.</p>

<p>I miss the old <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> when we actually had discussions instead of folks like you complaining incessantly.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You clearly haven&#39;t been a longtime lurker here. You clearly are just as brainwashed as anyone if you think this sub is pro-trump in any way. I have seen plenty of posts against Trump here. </p>

<p>You newcomers want so badly for this sub to be an anti-president sub. Well guess what? It always has been. And guess what? Trump is no worse than any president we&#39;ve had for the last 70 years. Why would this sub mercilessly bash Trump when every major news network does it for us? If you want to get off on how terrible the president is, just turn on your god damn TV or radio.</p>

<p>But most importantly, it does NOT matter who the president is. Anyone who is a real truth seeker knows this to be fact. Politics is all a charade to keep us dividing and bickering. So while you&#39;re so concerned about Trump and the dem vs. rep battle, the rest of us keep getting fucked. Time to WISE UP.</p>

Questioning everything is good but if you don&#39;t do it with some semblance of reason then it&#39;s worth it.

And with the conspiracies going on with him, with Russia, with internet opinion manipulation through misinformation, it makes me curious and a little frustrated. I know that because he&#39;s our president, it&#39;s bound to get political but I&#39;ll try to make sure my intentions are more clear and less political in the future.</p>

<p><em>&quot;But guys!!! Hillary is so much woooooorse.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Most of us know that she is as bad or worse than Trump in many ways...but when you still need to continuously make that assertion by posting bullshit anonymously sourced articles that might as well be 4chan LARP posts...you aren&#39;t helping your cause. </p>

<p>For example, I posted several articles on the recent alleged sonic weapon attacks in Cuba, and they were buried and not even addressed.</p>

<p>Now <em>that&#39;s</em> a real conspiracy and worthy of a genuine discussion on this sub.</p>

<p>But no, the tactic of late seems to be to purposefully bury real conspiracies while simultaneously complaining that <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> doesn&#39;t talk about conspiracies.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It was almost a year ago and I&#39;m going off of memory. I don&#39;t recall this report before true pundit&#39;s. </p>

<p>It came to nothing because the contents of the laptop are in the hands of the FBI. Since the FBI took jurisdiction/custody of it, the NYPD that saw it would be breaking federal law if they spoke about what they saw. They were also threatened with losing federal funding. If you remember, Comey said it took them a couple days to go through the hundreds of thousands of emails but now they say they need years before they can release anything of what&#39;s on it. Not even the metadata.</p>

<p>Huma or the Awans had his laptop setup to sync with Hillary&#39;s server and had a copy of her emails(possibly more than Hillary&#39;s), even the classified ones and maybe the deleted ones. It&#39;s a similar situation with the Awan brothers. The laptop the Capital Police found was setup to sync with all of Congress members they were spying on. What they were doing with all this info is what I want to know.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a huge laundry list of crime there including some very specific allegations, and True Pundit were told all about this by multiple anonymous sources in different areas; so why has no other publication got hold of any of part of this?</p>

<p>Why aren&#39;t there any NYPD of FBI investigations into any of it? Take note that the article cites FBI and NYPD sources talking about investigating and subpoenaing records with the laptop having been in FBI hands for a whole month all ready; what happened there then?</p>

<p>There is every reason not to trust the Washington Post, CNN, NBC News, Fox, etc.  Haven&#39;t you ever read the classic article by Investigative Reporter Carl Bernstein (of &quot;Woodward and Bernstein&quot; fame)?  Bernstein used to work for the Washington Post in the 1970s.  </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a link to Bernstein&#39;s classic article in which he reveals how intricately involved the CIA is in mainstream media news outlets, which really should be called CIAstream media:</p>

<p>Carl Bernstein&#39;s title for his long-respected article is &quot;The CIA and the Media&quot;: </p>
