        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Masonry means building or constructing. Freemasonry is about constructing elements in society intended for control. Masons build mind control programs involving religion, politics, philosophy, and entertainment. A Masonic program is called a temple and many temples house idols like religious leaders, teachers, politicians, and entertainers. These temples are constructed through geometric vibrations. This is similar to the concept of cymatics. Words and sounds generate vibrations and vibrations have mathematical properties. A person that follows a Masonic program is absorbing these vibrations into their minds. The temple in anatomy refers to the sides of the temporal lobe. When a person dreams or uses their imaginations the thoughts get densified into visuals in their temporal lobes. When normal people communicate, learn, and absorb information there is little natural architecture to clog, block, or trance the mind. Masonic temples are built on deceit. Freemasons specialize in giving their deceptions structural integrity. If they can design a lie with mathematical precision then they consider that lie to be the truth. Most people in society that have influence at high levels in politics, media, education, entertainment, and religion are trained in a form of masonry or work with Freemasons that assist them in their architecturally designed deceptions.</p>

<p>Freemasonry has ancient origins and various forms were used in all the ancient civilizations and empires. Modernized Freemasonry was developed off of various groups including the Roman Catholic Church, Order of Malta, Knights Templar, Royal Knighthoods and Stonemason Guilds. Various secret societies use the same knowledge and techniques as Freemasonry does. The Order of Malta is a masonic organization that uses a Grand Master and degrees of initiations just like Freemasonry. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta is the oldest knighthood on the planet originating on the island of Malta and was authorized by the Pope of Rome. The Library of Alexandria was developed by the Greco-Egyptian Ptolemaic Dynasty and was used to collect and monopolize all knowledge and scripts in the ancient world. They used force and pay offs to gather all written knowledge and then Julius Caesar moved the scripts to Rome and the island of Malta before intentionally burning down the library. This was a strategic plot carried out by the imperial bloodlines to covertly monopolize knowledge. During the Crusades the Knights Templar discovered some of this left over masonic knowledge through the Order of Al-Hashashin also called the Assassins. Rome shut down the Knights Templar to try and shut down their competitors before they got too big. The Knights Templar were later reformatted into the English Order of the Garter and Spanish Order of Montesa. Eventually they created dumbed down civilian divisions through what is modern Freemasonry.</p>

<p>The knowledge of Freemasonry is about deception and mind control. Groups like the Rosicrucian Order and Hermetic Order are similar but emphasize more on chemical manipulation of the human psyche and physiology. There are various Masonic divisions and groups and it is all intermixed today. Kabbalah is also a form of masonry and sorcery and it too is generally a dumbed down version compared to the occult knowledge that the royal and noble families possess. Grand Masters have the most knowledge and grant teachings through initiations or degrees. To the non sociopathic members initiations are mostly ceremonial however those who prove their criminality and psychopathy similar to gang initiations are granted the real knowledge. The purpose of Freemasonry is mind control and deception. Scottish Rite Freemasonry is the head of all Freemasonic orders which does not include Masonic type organizations like the Order of Malta, Order of the Holy Sepulchre, Order of the Garter, or Order of the Golden Fleece. The Scottish Peers specialize in Freemasonry with Prince Charles of Wales as the Duke of Rothesay Scotland as the head. Prince Filippo Rospigliosi the Earl of Newburgh Scotland is a top Scottish Rite Freemason better trained than Prince Charles and is an and agent of Rome. Scottish Rite Freemasonry controls the Grand Orient of Italy headquartered in Rome with Stefano Bisi as a mediator between Freemasonry and the Vatican which work together.

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not claiming that the Earth is flat, but your argument for why it has to be round is unsound.</p>

<p>Assuming our world looked <a href="https://images.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fthemillenniumreport.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F01%2Fflat-earth-map-big.jpg&amp;amp;f=1">something like this</a>, you could still travel East along the &quot;equator&quot; and arrive right back where you started. Assuming you started in South America, you&#39;d cross the Atlantic, then Africa, then the Indian Ocean, South East Asia, the Pacific, and eventually you&#39;d get back to South America. Through your entire journey, you would have followed your compass&#39;s Eastern direction. Every few kilometers you would have to make a tiny adjustment to the left, I guess, or to the right had you gone West, but I doubt they would even be noticeable among all the other course corrections you&#39;d have to make due to winds, currents or obstacles.</p>

<p>So even on a planar Earth, you could travel around the world using a compass and never be the wiser.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>But how in the hell would you go from the north pole, through the south pole, and back to the north pole on the other side? Also if you traveled along the &quot;equator&quot; in a straight line, you would fall off the map. Doesn&#39;t make a bit of sense and I hope you&#39;re trolling.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a different scenario. I didn&#39;t claim it was possible to go from North Pole to Southpole to North Pole in a straight line on a theoretical flat earth. I&#39;m not currently aware of anyone attempting such a journey.</p>

<p>If someone has done that trip, it would be great evidence to disprove Flat Earth and you should use that in the future. If nobody has done that trip yet, we should be asking why not.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Also if you traveled along the &quot;equator&quot; in a straight line, you would fall off the map.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How do you figure that? in the map, it clearly denotes the equator as a circle underneath the mean position of the sun&#39;s theoretical flat Earth orbit. Your compass&#39;s east and west position would point along the path of that circle wherever on it you stood, because True north would always be pointing at the center of the disc.</p>

<p>Again, I don&#39;t believe that Flat Earth is real one bit, but it irks me when people act all high and mighty over Flat Earthers all the while using non-sensical or circular arguments to &quot;disprove Flat Earth&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Compasses aside, if you took any form of aircraft and set it on a <em>directly straight</em> course, it would not follow the equator line in the image you provided. That&#39;s why when planes follow the equator, they aren&#39;t constantly listing slightly to the left or right depending on whether they are moving approximately east or west.</p>

<p>Any line tangent to a circle is not a part of that circle, and you can&#39;t justify using magnetic navigation as a proof to flat earth theory when withholding said tools causes the theory to crumble.</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>that is true, but as I briefly mentioned earlier, it also wouldn&#39;t do that on our globe Earth, due to winds coming more from one side than the other. Constant re-adjustment is already necessary. If that readjustment had an additional bias because of the slightly curved trajectory, I&#39;d imagine it to be small enough not to be noticed in either manual flight or auto-flight by even the most nimble navigators. But that&#39;s conjecture, of course.</p>

<p>All I&#39;m advocating for is a debate at eye level, no matter the topic or how sure we are that the other side is wrong. Not because it&#39;s politically correct or anything, but because it&#39;s the only worthwhile form of discussion, in my opinion. There are many ways to prove the Earth is round, but only so many ways we can determine that one way or the other using simple experiments of observations. The typical experiment with the shadows of identical pillars at different latitudes is probably the most popular experiment that &quot;proves the Earth is round&quot;, but it really doesn&#39;t prove that. It&#39;s like those formulas that leave you with two possible but different solutions. One is the accepted heliocentric model, the other is the model that has a flat planar earth with a small sun and small moon circling the North pole in their respective periods at a height of some 25-50 km or so. As a globe-Earth believer, such a proposition sounds intrinsically mad, but if viewed with a layer of detachment, it seems that both models satisfy the observation of the ancient Greek geometers.</p>

<p>Again, that&#39;s not meant to prove the Earth is flat, but illustrate that it&#39;s not entirely mad to entertain the idea.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more difficult to explain in the Flat Earth model is why we can&#39;t seem to see the Northern Sky from the &quot;outer hemidisc&quot; and why the sky would seem to rotate in one way in Europe and the opposite direction in Australia, while looking North in both cases.</p>

<p>Or how it would be possible to have sunlight shine along the underside of clouds during certain conditions before sunrise and after sunset. That seems to work only with a distant sun and a curved/spherical Earth.</p>

<p>I&#39;d welcome any FE-believer to chime in at this point, though, should those objections have a valid explanation in the FE model. If there are, I&#39;ll have to go rummage for better arguments.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Thank you, I do try. I guess I took Chapelle&#39;s words to heart when he said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dij1ghWMcKw">&quot;the worst thing you can call somebody is &#39;crazy&#39;, it&#39;s dismissive.&quot;</a> So I try to refrain from doing that to those I disagree with, as well as occasionally defending those who are called crazy if I see aspects of their viewpoints that aren&#39;t as crazy as the accusers pretend they are. People would be amazed at what kind of quality discussions we could all have if everyone just spoke their minds freely and politely, without fear of prosecution or ridicule, no matter if we agree or disagree in the end. My most insightful moments on here were with people I didn&#39;t understand or believe at first.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>As I said, I&#39;ll have to look into the White Dragon Society, as I&#39;ve only heard of it in passing. </p>

<p>I&#39;m curious where you got the information from that members of Three are literally knighted, as that is new to me. It&#39;s certainly gnostic in its interpretation of the Bible, but to say they consider themselves Freemasons doesn&#39;t sit right with me. It&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve read the material, but I remember them explaining that they consider themselves on-par with Freemasons, but with wildly different and largely opposed goals. </p>

<p>It may have been a stretch by me to claim that Three is opposed to Freemasonry, though, as it would be more accurate to say they oppose many of the ideas that are popular within Freemasonry.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You can Google &quot;pontifex maximus&quot; and the definition that shows are both the ancient Roman preisthood title and a title of the Pope. If you get sucked into the rabbit hole, you will connect all the dots as to how the pagan occult socieites of Rome absorbed the Catholic Church and planted their beliefs and views. </p>

<p>For example: Christian holidays such as Easter and Christmas were ancient Roman and Mesopotamian ritual holidays. Easter was for the goddess Ishtar (goddess of fertility, thus the eggs) and Christmas takes place during the festival of Saturnalia. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have all my notes readily available and my memory is shit, but the Catholic Church and occult societies of today have an entwined history that makes it incredibly hard not to make a correlation between the two.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Geometry, rather than their mythology, was far more the religion of the ancient Greeks of the classical period to whom we owe so much. The gods they deemed to rule over them and the stories they told about them are all peppered with the same kind of faults, foibles, and petty jealousies that are only too common among humans and so it was  a way for ordinary people to look at them from arm&#39;s length and better understand their own.</p>

<p>Plato&#39;s Academy of Philosophy not any Maths or mathematics was said to have a sign over the door that said &quot;Let no one enter here who doesn&#39;t know Geometry.&quot; Although Pythagoras is best know for his contributions to Geometry, few are aware that he was a genuine mystic and a had a flourishing school of his own that Geometry played an important and special role in. In order to know what that role was and join his inner circle a person had to give-up all of their worldly possessions and dedicate their lives solely to the higher levels of thought that would introduce them to.</p>

<p>Those peculiar facts seem to indicate that there is a power and higher understanding buried in the practice of Geometry and that the proponents of what is called &quot;Sacred Geometry&quot; are on the right road to knowing what that is even if they haven&#39;t quite gotten there yet.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Opinions vary, so the OP isn&#39;t wrong.  That the US is a Freemason-founded state is no secret, and that many of the founding fathers were Masons.  In that way, I suppose yes, they were the original patriots.</p>

<p>Whether you think that is good or bad is different.  Whether one thinks George Washington was an evil Freemason or one of the good members who belong to the Three is opinion.</p>

<p>In theory there is a faction within Freemasonry striving to remove the chains of bondage from humanity (the Three, who claim George Washington and Jesus among their former members), but these folks would be rebels within the society.</p>

<p>Whether the US was set-up as a vassal state of the Euro nobility or an attempt to break-away from said nobility is the crux here.  I&#39;m personally undecided on George Washington/Three but pretty sure the Euro nobility wanted the US as a vassal state.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>In my understanding, the Freemasons believe that they are descended from the builders of the pyramids, who were supposedly enslaved at the time of building.</p>

<p>But in modern practical terms, a secret society such as this is used as a way to aggregate power into the hands of the few. It creates a powerful network of &#39;insiders&#39; who view themselves as an elite. And once a group views itself as an &#39;elite&#39; it is easier to get said group to act negatively towards others whom they see as &#39;below&#39; them. </p>

<p>But like any large organization, the true, larger, motive is known to only a few at the top of the pyramid (so to speak).</p>

<p>As to the Rosicrucians, I believe that they were (or are) a positively oriented group who were largely active in the 19th century, sometimes spreading esoteric knowledge through popular novels (H.G. Wells, Edward Bulwer-Lytton).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You&#39;re not exposing Freemasonry. You&#39;re making wild assumptions and accusations, and any individual with common knowledge of Freemasonry can clearly see you have no idea what you&#39;re talking about. There&#39;s millions of active Freemasons in the world. If we wanted to take it over, we&#39;re doing a piss poor job. Ill informed people like yourself are always looking for a boogeyman, and unfortunately often find it in pillars of your community. You then use a couple &quot;bad apple&quot; examples over the last (at least) hundreds of years of fraternity as evidence of evil throughout the entire organization, and its appendant bodies. No one is perfect and there will be wrong doers in any organization this size, unfortunate as it is. </p>
