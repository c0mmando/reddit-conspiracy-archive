        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>Therapist: Why did you not want to come here?</p>

<p>Rick: Because I don’t respect therapy. Because I’m a scientist, I invent, transform, create, destroy for a living, and when I don’t like something about the world, I change it. And I don’t think going to a rented office in a strip mall to some agent of averageness explain which words mean which feeling has ever helped anyone do anything. I think it’s helped a lot of people get comfortable and stop panicking which is a state of mind we value in the animals we eat, but not something I want for myself. I’m not a cow. I’m a pickle, when I feel like it. So, you asked.</p>

<p>Therapist: Rick, the only connection between your unquestionable intelligence and the sickness destroying your family is that everyone in your family, you included, use intelligence to justify sickness. You seem to alternate between viewing your own mind as an unstoppable force and as an inescapable curse and I think it’s because the only true unapproachable concept for you is that it’s your mind within your control. You chose to come here, you chose to talk, to belittle my vocation, just as you chose to become a pickle. You are the master of your universe, and yet you are dripping with rat blood and feces. Your enormous mind literally vegetating by your own hand. I have no doubt that you would be bored senseless with therapy. The same way I’m bored when I brush my teeth and wipe my ass. Because the thing about repairing, maintaining and cleaning is, it’s not an adventure. There’s no way to do it so wrong you might die, it’s just work, and the bottom line some people are OK going to work and some people…well some people would rather die. Each of us gets to choose. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The message gets lost in the format.  The message is cheapened by the format.  Are you surrendering to the intentional dumbing down of society willingly? or are you a victim of it.  This is akin to pinning a 7yr olds crayon recreation of the constitution to the refrigerator and hoping that granny claps and gives you a hug and a werthers original when she sees it.   low effort.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There is a lot of negativity and this thread and that is distracting from the message so I have something to say to try and balance it.</p>

<p>I feel a change coming. Maybe its just me and my path, or maybe others are feeling it too. I&#39;m inclined to lean towards the latter. I think their is a change in humanity&#39;s consciousness and that we are all being given a choice on how to proceed. We can continue as is through life and keep paying attention to the noise. We can let the noise drain our energy and feed into the negativity.</p>

<p>Or we can opt to change. To challenge oneself. We can be force for good and positivity and strive to reconnect with our fellow man. We have lost touch with what truly matters. Everything is about quick little jokes or references. We so rarely have genuine conversations anymore and we rarely focus solely on one singular task. </p>

<p>I challenge everyone here to become more open minded. Try something new. I took up yoga. My friends in real life will ridicule me for this when they find out but that would be there loss. Its life changing. Its allowed me to be more mindful and my body feels stronger for it. Be more mindful. Be more in the present. Respect your fellow man even if they dont deserve it and if you cant get through this comment.....</p>

<p>TLDR: Love conquers all</p>

<p>I&#39;m not willing to die for poor people in poor countries to have a better life.  I&#39;m not even willing to die to improve domestic problems.  Life is too good for me know to put it all on the line.  People in power understand this and exploit it as much as possible.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I mean that&#39;s kind of bad thinking, your decisions will lead you, 40hrs a week or more or much less is based on how hard you work with what your given as well as the location of your work. I hate the saying love what you do for a living, that&#39;s BS, but at least be interested and have something that mentally stimulates you and you won&#39;t hate it per se. I&#39;ve hated working at CVS and a Kroger, but I&#39;ve loved being an irrigation mechanic, nuclear mechanic and a PE in construction. I knew i needed schooling so I joined the military, finished without debt and moved into a field I know is changing/challenging and is not deathly repetitive. That&#39;s the key, I could more easily bounced around to low paying shit jobs from my teens to my 30s as well and complained about my life, but I would have only myself to blame. You&#39;re capable of a lot, I promise </p>

Not to mention correctly saving and investing long term and living within your means will allow you to probably retire faster than 40 yeas if you plan correctly.</p>
