       "For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence -- on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed."

       This speech is taken out of context 99% of the time. It's at the White House correspondence dinner and he's pleading with the media to basically censor themselves because that's how a lot of information was leaked to other govt. Intelligence.

       You can say that but it's speculative, just like my interpretation is. I think the language clearly implies a graver warning to the press though.

       The problem is your quote taken out of context seems to be saying something it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
       When taken in context it is quite clear he is talking about communism.
      </p>
      <p>
       The thing is what he is saying is still talking about conspiracy.  Its a good example about how people that claim not to believe in conspiracies are full of shit.

       Your sarcasm isn't appreciated. Say that JFK was referring to communism. Has the thought ever crossed your mind that he was talking about worldwide communism, or a communist world government in other words?
      </p>
      <p>
       It's seems to me that the USSR wasn't exactly
       <em>
        secretive
       </em>
       about their admiration and belief in communism as a form of government. So what secret society would JFK have been referring to then?

       I'm not trolling. I just know you are wrong. And this is not the first time I've seen you trying to debunk one of the most important speeches ever delivered. So I felt the need to put you in your place.

       You are trivializing it, and also trying to convince people that it was merely a speech about soviet Russia, which is completely incorrect. You are belittling this speech and trying to prevent people from listening to it by writing it off as a normal speech. I just don't want anyone to be mislead by you.

       My perception of the speech made a 180 after reading the full speech and learning the context.  JFK goes from a good guy waring us of a secret government to a humiliated president blaming the press for spoiling his Bay of Pigs invasion.  Context is everything.

       Most people here don't want to do any research to learn the truth.

       They want a quick, easy, confirmation of their belief that everything is an evil conspiracy.

       There are many real conspiracies going on, but the majority of "conspiracy theorists" are in it to get their quick, effortless internet thrills, which gives the powers that be fodder to smear all "conspiracy theorists" as tinfoil idiot nutjobs.

       Yup.  At its best conspiracy theory is someone with an open mind that researches both sides of a story and uses their intellect, independent of social pressures, to come to a conclusion.
      </p>
      <p>
       At its worst conspiracy theory is just believing any old bullshit.
      </p>
      <p>
       I used to think conspiracy theorists as a group were better at independent thinking than the public at large, but its just not true.  They are just as susceptible to bizarre, irrational, unfounded beliefs as everyone else.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean, I truly believe there are conspiracy theorists that believe the Earth is flat, global warming is an international fabrication, or that there were no planes on 9/11.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also believe all those things started as disinformation campaigns to make CTs look bad.  But, now I think that a good disinformation campaign is one that will get some people believing in it.

       You're missing the fact that at the time he was getting grilled because there was leaks in his administration, and so he was basically invoking communism (people routinely talked about it as a "looming threat" and in other various dramatic terms) as a justification for suppressing govt leaks.
      </p>
      <p>
       I mean it's not really a judgement of the man, communism was the singular world threat back then as it used socialism propaganda to agitate revolutions in countries that would then be subservient to the motherland.

       I read the speech several times, doubtful that he would mean communism. I think this is the key part: "It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match."

       Now, have you ever seen the movie A Beautiful Mind about John Nash? Know he was "crazy" for thinking there were soviet spies and stuff all throughout the US government? Well, it turns out he was right as we found out after declassification of the Venona Project. Nash was a skilled cryptologist / code breaker, early member of the NSA, and helped uncover this stuff that he was called "crazy" for talking about.

       You can see from these two things that the "deep state" isn't just about the CIA but is more like a transnational complex that has fake / orchestrated conflicts between nations. The "deep state" is more like a supra-state that controls multiple states, not just one."

       Exactly what someone would write that was a part of this thing JFK described. Almost like a scripted response of confirmation to the existence of such a thing. What he is describing does not line up with a segment size of the media. Goes much larger than that, and if he had intended this comment to be directed at the media, why go so far over and above in scope?

       I definitely believe that he was primarily addressing the issue of the Soviet Union here, however it is clear that JFK's basis for his allegations against the Soviet Union was on their ruthless methodology which sought to opperate outside of public knowledge and in the shadows. JFK points out that the people have every right to know the world they live in but there are those who dismantle that right by creating a world in which the true nature of the world cannot be known.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you read more deeply into history you will find that all of these things JFK complains about in regards to the Soviet Union are the same issues he ran into with the CIA which is exactly why he eventually fired the sitting CIA director within his tenure as President.
      </p>
      <p>
       He wasn't just reminding the media who the Soviet Union was, he was readjusting their focus to realize that wars are not fought the same way anymore, and information was the new weapon. It was a new world, with new rules. It wasn't just about fighting countries and borders, it was fighting against a mindset.
      </p>
