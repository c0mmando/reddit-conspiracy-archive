        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>&quot;For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence -- on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. Its preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Your sarcasm isn&#39;t appreciated. Say that JFK was referring to communism. Has the thought ever crossed your mind that he was talking about worldwide communism, or a communist world government in other words?</p>

<p>It&#39;s seems to me that the USSR wasn&#39;t exactly <em>secretive</em> about their admiration and belief in communism as a form of government. So what secret society would JFK have been referring to then?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yup.  At its best conspiracy theory is someone with an open mind that researches both sides of a story and uses their intellect, independent of social pressures, to come to a conclusion.  </p>

<p>At its worst conspiracy theory is just believing any old bullshit.   </p>

<p>I used to think conspiracy theorists as a group were better at independent thinking than the public at large, but its just not true.  They are just as susceptible to bizarre, irrational, unfounded beliefs as everyone else.  </p>

<p>I mean, I truly believe there are conspiracy theorists that believe the Earth is flat, global warming is an international fabrication, or that there were no planes on 9/11.       </p>

<p>I also believe all those things started as disinformation campaigns to make CTs look bad.  But, now I think that a good disinformation campaign is one that will get some people believing in it.  </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>He never explicitly refers to communism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read the speech several times, doubtful that he would mean communism. I think this is the key part: &quot;It conducts the Cold War, in short, with a war-time discipline no democracy would ever hope or wish to match.&quot; </p>

<p>Who conducts the Cold War?</p>

<p>u/ClosedSociety404 <a href="https://np.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ypmqi/trump_adviser_admits_to_private_communication/derz8hd/">wrote</a>:</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever heard of the Cambridge Five? TL;DR There was a spy ring passing information back and forth through the USA/UK/USSR and playing all sides to perpetuate the Cold War. Gets the military industrial complex richer and all that - easy enough to comprehend the motivations.</p>

<p>Now, have you ever seen the movie A Beautiful Mind about John Nash? Know he was &quot;crazy&quot; for thinking there were soviet spies and stuff all throughout the US government? Well, it turns out he was right as we found out after declassification of the Venona Project. Nash was a skilled cryptologist / code breaker, early member of the NSA, and helped uncover this stuff that he was called &quot;crazy&quot; for talking about.</p>

<p>You can see from these two things that the &quot;deep state&quot; isn&#39;t just about the CIA but is more like a transnational complex that has fake / orchestrated conflicts between nations. The &quot;deep state&quot; is more like a supra-state that controls multiple states, not just one.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I definitely believe that he was primarily addressing the issue of the Soviet Union here, however it is clear that JFK&#39;s basis for his allegations against the Soviet Union was on their ruthless methodology which sought to opperate outside of public knowledge and in the shadows. JFK points out that the people have every right to know the world they live in but there are those who dismantle that right by creating a world in which the true nature of the world cannot be known. </p>

<p>If you read more deeply into history you will find that all of these things JFK complains about in regards to the Soviet Union are the same issues he ran into with the CIA which is exactly why he eventually fired the sitting CIA director within his tenure as President. </p>

<p>He wasn&#39;t just reminding the media who the Soviet Union was, he was readjusting their focus to realize that wars are not fought the same way anymore, and information was the new weapon. It was a new world, with new rules. It wasn&#39;t just about fighting countries and borders, it was fighting against a mindset.</p>

<p>So while it&#39;s still a speech fueled by current events of 1961 it is also, in true JFK form, a reflection on the human condition and a prophetic warning on what awaits those who hide in the darkness.</p>
