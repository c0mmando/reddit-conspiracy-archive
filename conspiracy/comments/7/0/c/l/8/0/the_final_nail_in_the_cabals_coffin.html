        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>People really better start paying attention to the macroeconomic shift happening in the world. It&#39;s been taking place for several years now, and it&#39;s probably the most important thing going on right now. It ties in everything. It has nothing to do with Trump, Hillary, (in the sense of partisanship) or all this other mid level bickering that was meant to distract us day to day. </p>

<p>The entire world is about to drop the US petrodollar. It&#39;s been fraudulent since it&#39;s inception in 1971, on top of an already fraudulent Federal Reserve System created in 1913. Most every modern war has been fought to protect this petrodollar system, which in truth isn&#39;t even controlled by the USA. It&#39;s controlled by a small handful of globalists, none who have any sort of allegiance to any nations or anyone but themselves.</p>

<p>The good news is the sane people of the world have grown sick of it, want free bilateral trade, want a commodity backed macroeconomic system, and want transparency in their economic dealings. They weren&#39;t getting it, so they created their own system. BRICS, as well as institutions like the AIIB and SPIMEX to counterpoint the corrupt institutions like the Federal Reserve, Bank of International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. And who wouldn&#39;t want to join a multi polar commodity backed system as opposed to the unipolar fiat currency that has been wreaking havoc for the last 100 years? </p>

<p>China is dropping the petrodollar, creating a gold/petrol exchange. Venezuela just dropped it. Most of the G77 is about to drop it and join BRICS. The new reserve currency will be the Chinese Yuan. </p>

<p>America has the constitutional right to create its own currency. But we&#39;ve never had it. We&#39;ve basically been in the pocket of the Bank of England since our inception. Lincoln tried to create our own currency, the Greenback. Kennedy tried to create our own currency, the silver certificate. </p>

<p>If we are going to survive the economic shift that is currently happening, we have no choice but to bring back the philosophy of Kennedy and Lincoln and create our own gold backed currency system. The petrodollar system has financially enslaved us as much as everyone else. The difference is, everyone else is taking action to do something about it.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking forward to a biography coming out on McKinley soon. I think he was assassinated for the gold standard act which that son of a bitch TDR repealed in the thirties I believe. Fuck fractional reserve banking, fuck globalists, and fuck Keynesian economics. </p>

<p>Keynes says &quot;just spend money, and the economy will grow&quot; which is wrong.</p>

<p>American school says &quot;build infrastructure, and the economy will grow.&quot; Categorically different, because <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/otps/060320a/forum.cfm">infrastructure</a> is one of the few areas where the government can build a project that has a higher return on capital than the private market.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It pretty much declared Hamilton in that wiki as the founder and he was a globalist piece of shit who sold out america. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hamilton created the economic plan that got America going in the first place. He was also murdered by the traitor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burr_conspiracy">Aaron Burr</a>. Jefferson spread a lot of lies also, like Hamilton wanting a monarchy</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then it references the Whigs which were the globalist funded pieces of shit who literally only came to creation to dismantle all of Andrew jacksons progress. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Andrew Jackson destroyed the public credit system, which removed all of the currency. This was replaced by rampant currency speculation by the very globalist bankers you&#39;re concerned about, because there was no other source of money.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Keynes/American schools of economics are like steroids.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They are radically different theories of economics that should not be lumped together like this. Economics is not a spectrum of &quot;more government or less government.&quot; </p>

<p>There is a great deal of nuance in these things, like the proper scope of government, or the availability of government projects which will grow the capital stock faster than private investment.</p>

<p>The Austrians are right to point out the ineptitude of government, deadweight loss of taxation, harm caused by regulations, etc.</p>

<p>However, government does do a few things well. The study I linked shows that infrastructure projects grow the economy at over twice the rate of private capital.</p>

<p>In other words, if you &quot;tax and spend&quot; to build the National Road, your citizens will have more wealth at the end of the process.</p>

<p>Mises and co. are correct that most things the government does are stupid. But not everything. Government does build <a href="https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policy/otps/060320a/forum.cfm">infrastructure</a> efficiently. It is also the only entity capable of providing police and military without running the risk of subversion by the private providers of these services (imagine if Blackwater ran the whole US military?)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I agree private military is not in the best interest of the people. We agree there</p>

<p>Police however is different. The culture created with an Austrian approach preaches personal responsibility on every aspect of one&#39;s life. Admitting the opposite is only giving up freedoms and building what we have now, a granny state pampering entitled children. When people realize their lives are at risk, they take action. Without police people would be carrying guns. If half of the United States carried concealed carry pistols, we would not live in fear of random robberies and shootings. Anything larger than those can almost never be stopped, so to debate subjects such as bombings and crashing planes and what not is irrelevant. I think only sheriff&#39;s should exist and at the county level. Maybe state troopers. </p>

<p>Infrastructure I&#39;ll admit can be done by government better than private. But only because it builds equally, I feel private would be hell bent on keeping some areas nice and others terrible. However, not the shit they talk about nowadays. They are thinking about a 1 trillion dollars infrastructure stimulus. First off, most politicians are only interested because Keynes economic rules allow government spending to count towards GDP which fucks up the party system even more. Basically has both sides fight for more debt to make growth look better while in office. Secondly, stimulus packages don&#39;t work. DJT hasn&#39;t said &quot;stimulus package&quot; outright, nor has the GOP but this is pretty much what they are thinking. More debt is not the answer, we are enslaving ourselves. </p>

<p>The idea of Keynes is literally to spend yourself out of debt. This has not worked, obviously. Like I said before, believing that government inneficiency cures the economy is like believing war helps an economy.  It doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>I think infrastructure should move away from govenrment somewhat. California trans is the least efficient highway construction crews in the world. Ask anyone from California, they have never seen a cal trans worker do one thing other than sit around and talk on the side of the freeways</p>

<p>The question was whether infrastructure investments grow the capital stock faster than not. The study I linked shows they do, therefore Austrians are wrong that &quot;government is always inept.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Again, it depends on the quality of the investment. We could completely solve our debt with a <a href="https://newfederalistpapers.joomla.com/11-orbitalring">space elevator</a>. I&#39;d say that makes it a pretty good investment.</p>

<p>Have you noticed China&#39;s economy has been growing at ~10% for a generation? Did you notice that coincided with building lots of infrastructure, and not muh freedom as pure Austrians claim?</p>

<p>Explain China under your paradigm of economic growth is only a function of freedom (hint: you can&#39;t). </p>

<p>Assumes that my defense of infrastructure is a defense of all government spending. This is Keynesianism, which I&#39;m not defending.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The government is sometimes the only option, I&#39;ll agree. </p>

<p>Infrastructure is one case where the government is the most efficient, because competition would require redundant capital investments. Two sets of roads giving no more utility than one=malinvestment. </p>

<p>This is why ancaps are literally laughed at and not taken seriously by any policymakers. Their arguments are comically unsound.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>An entrepreneur can do more with a million than any agency could do with a billion bud. </p>

<p>No granularity. &quot;Government vs. non-government&quot; is not the scope of the argument. It&#39;s infrastructure, not muh government stimulus.</p>

<p>a space elevator could never be accomplished by a government.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what they said about the National Road, Transcontinental Railroad, Interstate Highway, and putting a man on the moon. America can.</p>

<p>I&#39;d trust that in the hands of private Enterprise as well.</p>

<p>The international banking cartels always create Machiavelli&#39;s &quot;balance of power&quot; model, where they fund two sides in a conflict, and then gain control of them both by getting them into debt. The traditional method of triggering debt is getting them into wars. They did this all throughout 18th and 19th Century Europe. All those &quot;100 Years&#39; Wars&quot; and &quot;Napoleonic wars,&quot; etc. They were ginned up by the bankers to ensnare the target countries into debt.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what all these million little neocon wars have been about for America: To change it from a creditor nation to a debtor nation. They pulled this switcheroo with surprising rapidity.</p>

<p>But back to the balance of power....</p>

<p>The bank will fund two sides in a war (like how the Rothschilds funded both the British and Hitler). Or how they funded both Communism and the Capitalist nations of the West. (Read historian Antony Sutton&#39;s work on documenting how banks out of the West bankrolled the Russians from start to finish. Without them, the revolution would have never been able to happen.)</p>

<p>So they fund BOTH sides in disputes. </p>

<p>Then they call in the debts of only one of the sides. Then then tell the other side, &quot;If you attack my enemy now, I&#39;ll relieve you of some of the money you owe me.&quot;</p>

<p>Basically, the U.S. is being set up now, with China as the bankers&#39; &quot;second sock-puppet&quot;. </p>

<p>We&#39;ve been played according to set pattern. With all the globalist moles in senate and all the corrupt Presidents voting to raise the debt ceiling and create vast new social programs to eat money and generate debt.</p>

<p>It&#39;s called the Cloward-Piven strategy. Create social programs not to help people, per se, but with the specific intent of bankrupting a nation and collapsing it from within.</p>

<p>Obamacare was NOT about providing national healthcare. It was about generating massive new debt.</p>

<p>Importing the entire Third World into America and giving them all welfare wasn&#39;t humanitarianism, but an expression of the Cloward-Piven strategy.</p>

<p>America&#39;s head is in the gallows. And you&#39;re right: This was set up well before the last election. The Establishment may be expressing panic now, because a counter-coup is taking place with people trying to reverse the damage and save the nation.</p>

<p>But the globalists don&#39;t want that. So Trump&#39;s media coverage is 93% negative. We&#39;re to hate him at all costs.</p>

<p>We&#39;re to equate nationalism with racism and denounce it. And we&#39;re to see national sovereignty as an archaic throwback to the caveman days and see banker-rule as some wonderful new advance.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The bankers have experience and they know what works. They stick with what has been shown to be effective in the past. Of course, they are always willing to bet a few million on any new con that comes to light to see if it works well or not. </p>

<p>The other thing is that they do not have to plan out every detail of every little conflict that comes along. The Kurds want their own nation becuase they are tired of being ruled over by other groups that do not treat them well? Fine. How can we use that to attack Iraq or Syria or Turkey to increase defense spending in these nations while we use the Kurds to export the oil in their area. They make use of organic conflicts as well as planning out the ones that they feel are important enough to plan like WW2: Germany vs. USSR. </p>

<p>I think that the desire for national healthcare was real enough, but there isn&#39;t the money to fund it any more. Once the wealth of the nation was destroyed in Cold War, there isn&#39;t really any engine left to support healthcare or development of any kind. TVs and cars are no longer made in the US any longer. Even if it has a US brand, the content will be Asian. The TV industry was given to Japan in exchange for support in the Vietnam war. It has since been lost by the Japanese to the Koreans. The next step is China and if they can improve their quality, which they will, we will have lost all productive industries, leaving us exporting pork products to the Chinese cities of industry. Our main industry will be Facebook, which is just an ad and surveillance tool. </p>

<p>Importing immigrants might have been logical 100 years ago, but the immigrants today do not have any desire to work or skills needed in the workplace. They are just a burden on society.</p>

<p>The people are trying to fight back, but I think that they do not understand the size and complexity of the forces aligned against them. If the bankers decide to trash the dollar and move to the Yuan, that will mean that the dollar will drop and foreigners will buy up the US lock stock and barrel. You can already see this happening as the Chinese buy up real estate in Vancouver and California. The locals cannot afford homes.</p>

<p>Trump was our last great hope, but he has not proved to be very strong. I think that his heart is in the right place, but he and his family is not big and strong enough to fight the entire system. The Republican Party does not seem to be united behind him. They seem like they are waiting for the chance to throw him to the wolves.</p>

<p>The reality is that language is big barrier between peoples. The other problem is systems like law and education are not equal either. Cultural practices are a big problem too. </p>

<p>Anyway, we are slaves to a system that cares nothing about us. The international bankers are going to play the US like a child and it will be the end of the experiment.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>The problem with a gold (or other resource) system is that the people who created the fiat system used it to buy those resources. The U.S. has no gold with which to back anything at all. The value of gold/silver/platinum/oil/diamonds is just as contrived as the fiat currencies, and, objectively, the values of these resources are defined by the same fucking currencies, e.g., gold is worth $800/ounce.</p>

<p>Excellent post, though. Upvoted.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, and then this begs the question if anything really will change at all. If the cabal used a hundred year fiat currency plan, only to horde everything then pull it out as a global gold backed plan, then the shit is even deeper, and then the possibility of the east/paradigm being as fake as the false left/right paradigm becomes real.</p>

<p>We change reserve currencies on average every hundred or so years anyway. What guarantee do we truly have that this couldn&#39;t turn into a frying pan into the fire scenario?</p>

<p>Ultimately it depends on many things. Good will, transparency, severe oversight with high penalties for fraud. But I think its also imperative we start releasing any sequestered tech we have to the public, and also move into a more open source philosophy with out technology. It did wonders for software, revolutionized the world. An open source infrastructure and tech world may do a ton to really move the economy for the world as a whole, while we simultaneously aim for sovereignty to be respected. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Agreed, wholeheartedly, except that those in charge of oversight and in a position to administer penalties for fraud are also rewarded by the same system. The existence of currency have compromised both justice and law.</p>

<p>The &quot;East&quot; (+ BRICS) paradigm looks good on the surface, as a counter to the Western currencies, but there are still Western banker involvements with the Yuan and other Asian currencies, plus all the central bankers&#39; mitts in the land and resources globally, including distribution.</p>

<p>I think <a href="https://www.pdf-archive.com/2017/06/22/readme2/preview/page/1/">this</a> should be our &quot;reserve currency.&quot; Get out your laser printer.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The petrodollar won&#39;t be dropped anytime soon. China, Russia, and US are more intertwined than you think despite MSM rhetoric. They partake in the same interests on UN and IMF counsels. They also are heavily dependent upon one another in trade. Also, China is just as guilty as the US in terms of intentionally running up government debt and monetary supply to fuel artificial economic growth (arguably more so than the US). </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Original Poster, brilliantly put!</p>

<p>If I could make one small point, though: The dollar has a re-set roughly every 40 years. First we had the traditional gold standard. Then, forty years later, came the Bretton-Woods standard. Next was the Petro-dollar standard. Basically, the dollar should have crashed and had a re-set in 2008.</p>

<p>But the Powers That Be kept it artificially on life-support through massive stimulus programs (called &quot;Quantitative Easing&quot; where trillions of new dollars were printed up).</p>

<p>There&#39;s no question that (historically speaking) the dollar is set to expire soon. </p>

<p>The question is whether there will be a new re-set, or if the banking cartels have determined the true dollar is finished as the world reserve currency.</p>

<p>The world is sick of the manipulated (and grossly devalued dollar). Essentially, the U.S. has been able to &quot;outsource its inflation&quot; to other countries via the Petro-dollar system. No other nation on Earth can do this. And they&#39;re fed up with the con.</p>

<p>99% of the world&#39;s countries want a gold-backed currency, and China is rushing to provide one. </p>

<p>Everyone wants its stability. (It&#39;s why the dollar originally became the world&#39;s preferred currency in the first place. The European powers, who bankrupted themselves on war, switched to fiat currencies and the world rushed to the gold-backed dollar.)</p>

<p>What it looks like to me is that the globalists are hellbent on going to China. They admire its technocratic dictatorship model. Its censored internet is now being imported to the West (with algorithm manipulation). The globalists believe in its one-child policies and centralized power model. They also quietly admire China&#39;s ruthless crushing of dissent and its sky-high murder rate (which dwarfs Hitler&#39;s). &quot;China,&quot; according to the globalists, &quot;knows how to keep its citizens in line. With no Western traditions of freedom or questioning authority, ruling over such a populace is a snap.&quot;</p>

<p>President Xi of China has publicly stated that he wouldn&#39;t mind if China became the new home of the New World Order.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re already seeing power centers shifting from America to China. The International Monetary Fund has already said that they&#39;re moving their offices from New York to China.</p>

<p>So you have one faction content with the collapse of the dollar (and the West), while another faction wants to dip into crypto-currencies to avoid total disaster.</p>

<p>It&#39;s no coincidence that crypto-currencies have been allowed to rise up at this particular point. </p>

<p>In both cases, the groups are content to let the dollar die.</p>

<p>None of the really powerful players seem to be signaling a desire to do another &quot;re-set&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Yes, I have always wondered just how deep the rabbit hole is on this one. Is BRICS the savior, or is BRICS a bigger noose around the neck of the world. All your points I&#39;ve considered  before. Is the illusion being created the East wants to defeat the cabal, and are they in cahoots? Or are there enough white hats to guide a new system into the world with good intention and responsibility? Time will tell. However, this circus act we have now needs to change, and real solutions are needed or we all go down.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I live in china and your description of the Chinese is reductive </p>

<p>I despise the Han majority and consider them to be soulless sacks of flesh that resemble human form, but they are only in power because Mao was Han</p>

<p>Before the cultural revolution China as a nation did not even exist- it was Tibet, Manchuria, Mongolia, and China. All of these regions have completely different languages and religions and still do today. These ethnic groups do not like each other.</p>

<p>I work in finance and everyone in china knows what will be the doom of the Chinese economy- privatization of land ownership. Currently all properties are owned by the state and while most Chinese do not like this the poverty of even as recently as the 90&#39;s has made descent against the state just not an issue.</p>

<p>But everyone knows, in 20 years, 30 at most, if the economy of china holds together, or as you say becomes the center of the world- people at the head of the state will come up with the bright idea to allow speculation in the real estate market.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t believe me? </p>

<p>Personal loans and credit cards where illegal in china until only 2 years ago, already it is creating a debt economy the likes of which no one thought was possible! Debtors prison is legal in china. And people are going to jail for missing payments.</p>

<p>Well, eventually we will see a mortgage industry open here. And it will be the apocalypse. Enormous loans that can&#39;t be regulated will be borrowed against by lenders without insurance leading to a systemic collapse.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t be zombies in the streets, but it will be an economic death that will destroy the world. And if china is the world currency holder it will be a very bad time for global spending.</p>

<p>I of course don&#39;t give a shit, I am rich and how a variety of assets in many countries and have a ton of money in many currencies. And there is always just retirement to an emerging economy- I enjoy wintering in Ethiopia, the coffee is great !</p>
