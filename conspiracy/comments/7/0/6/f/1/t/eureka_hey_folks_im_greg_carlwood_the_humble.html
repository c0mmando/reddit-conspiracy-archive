       As for the AMA,  I pretty much sat here for 4 hours, trying to keep up. I think I got them all. I actually have to get my notes together. I have a show to record in the morning!

       A good way for me to get a measure of a legit "conspiracy theorist" is to ask a somewhat difficult question. Do you believe these mass shootings like sandy hook, Newtown, etc. are legitimate, or a government Psy op.? Please explain why you believe that way.

       I reject the notion that if an alternative thinker comes to a different conclusion on a complex situation that both of us are only able to digest through screens, then they aren't "legit."
      </p>
      <p>
       What's important is that these cases you mentioned are heavily controlled and manipulated. They are definitely not as presented. If a person agrres in that much, I consider us on the dame side. If you're going to love me or hate me based on my educated guess if anyone died or not, I'd say listen to the show.

       I listen to the show all the time. I know you have had a couple of guests stating a hoax. I was just wanting your opinion. The above mentioned are complete hoaxes. Thanks for commenting back, but if you research enough you too will find them elaborate government hoaxes.

       I've asked you this before Greg (on Twitter), but have you ever tried to contact Dr. Norman Bergrun, author of Ringmakers of Saturn? His interview with Kerry Cassidy is my #1 "conspiracy" video of all time (and I generally don't believe in aliens, and don't think much of KC, for that matter).

       Norm is brilliant.

       I worry about the old man. He must be well in his 90s by now. Such an amazing guy. I've read the pdf of RoS, but would love to get hold of "Tomorrow's Technology Today", his earlier book about the same subject.

       Hi Greg! I'm a big fan of your show from Iran, my question is more of a request concerning targeted individuals. ATM I only remember the show with Robert Guffey who spoke about secret tech and gangstalking, I'm sure other TIs would really appreciate it if you did more shows about this phenomenon because I hope you can understand why it's so important for me and other TIs to get the word out about this covert international torture program that also uses community harassment to oppress innocent people (sometimes I call it MK-Ultra for the masses). Would you consider doing a show with whistleblowers like William Binney, Kirk Wiebe or Karen Stewart or anyone that's credible enough so people will listen? Thanks.

       Hi Greg!
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you for doing a AMAZING, AWESOME show! I LOVE IT!!!  Weather I agree with the topic or not it's always thought provoking!
      </p>
      <p>
       I have more of a request than a question, if you don't mind.
      </p>
      <p>
       With that said, I am a Christian and believe in Christ return. What I have found though, through the research of my for my own curiosity, and any "rabbit hole " I may go down, is that it always leads to the "turf war" , good vs bad , black vs white, Jesus vs Satan ...
      </p>
      <p>
       I am hoping one day that you could visit that subject on your show. Not the church or the corruption with in it or how weak the church has become. I get that.. that's all mans doing. But ... the actual return of Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. From the books of Daniel ,Revolutions, Mathew and so on ... Nothing "preachy"  like , "your going to hell if..."  but what I'm saying is this ... A lot of what is being described in the Bible seems to be lining up.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not outside the realm of possibility.  I listen to your show a lot, the subjects , the guests , the wide verity of... I just think that it would be a interestingly different perspective to touch on every once and a while.
      </p>
      <p>
       I have heard your opinion about God and how you feel about and understand if you don't.
      </p>
      <p>
       Thank you, Greg for taking the time to read this and respond (maybe  😊)
      </p>
      <p>
       So! I guess in closing, to the inspiring Mr.Greg Carlwood "you fucking move"

       Love you Greg but "overstepping a lot right now"? You're watching the endgame of their plans since the 50s at least. Look what's happening with google right now. Orwellian is an understatement. The left is
       <em>
        insane
       </em>
       right now.

       I can see how as a former leftist you have a hard time not seeing Trump as anything but an exploitative asshole, but I'm only going to give you the asshole part. He may have spent a career exploiting opportunities, but who else has stood and took the arrows like he's doing now. The only "personal profit" argument you can logically make at all is one wherein he felt he had to act if there was to be any world to leave to his kids where they could even enjoy the wealth he's built.

       I don't mean educate them yourself in what you think - that
       <em>
        is
       </em>
       draconian. I'm saying use a place where you'll have total access to the course material and what is taught, even if you don't agree with it. Don't take a crap shoot imo. Public schools can be a meat grinder for brains. Try something like Freedom Project Academy. They're partially Christian I think, but I don't predict your kids getting brainwashed by religions!

       I worry about the old man. He must be well in his 90s by now. Such an amazing guy. I've read the pdf of RoS, but would love to get hold of "Tomorrow's Technology Today", his earlier book about the same subject.

       I find your lack of faith disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
       Perhaps you really should remove the Masonic imagery on your car? It appears, the dominating black magic of the elite, still has your mind and body in shackles.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Empire has always been on top. We need revolution just to keep from being completely rolled over by the wheel of constantly encroaching tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
       Remember, We are in the darkage2.0; where we have the 99% lords enslaving 1% peasant serfs. All of our institutions, have not only failed us but actively work to deceive us and push us further into servitude to the elite class.
      </p>
      <p>
       Don’t allow the failure of ows to bring your spirit down. Use your platform to empower people to push back against vile tyranny as a united front and not as democrats and republicans.
      </p>
      <p>
       I hope you regain your optimism and charge up that fighting spirit. We will need it in the future ahead. Godspeed good sir! May the Almighty bless you with wisdom and courage and may your voice ease the 10,000 year old hex placed upon humanity.
