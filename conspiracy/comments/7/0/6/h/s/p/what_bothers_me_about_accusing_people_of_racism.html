       So you see this a lot, people saying something race-related and getting called "racist". Or someone says "That's racist".
      </p>
      <p>
       I wasn't quite sure what bothered me about it, because technically I do think it's a good guideline to treat people well, so why would I protest for my right to be an asshole? Now, I think the right to be an asshole is also an important thing, but there's another issue I just became aware of.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's that people policing you regarding racism, when you really listen into what they are saying between the lines, aren't really concerned with you doing something wrong. Rather, they are concerned with you doing something that's forbidden.
      </p>
      <p>
       And that's where they are plain dishonest. They don't really give a crap whether you were actually doing some action that actually harmed someone (spoken words are actions too, of course). They just have a register in their brain of "forbidden words/thoughts" and when you trigger one of these registers, they go apeshit on you. They more or less blindly associate certain words/thoughts with some kind of negative emotion which they then project onto you, as they have been taught in school.
      </p>
      <p>
       You could be hanging out with your 10 black friends, making some joke, and all your black friends would wholeheartedly laugh - but these people would still call you a racist if that joke happened to trigger one of their "racist" registers.
      </p>
      <p>
       And now that I think of it, that's kind of a thing in all matters of daily life. People often don't seem to really look at a situation with open eyes and evaluate it for what it is - rather they just let their conditioning take over and categorize/classify the situation based on a few superficial criteria (like certain words). This is obviously not a good approach, considering that body language/tonality/etc. can completely define and change the meaning of something that was said, and if the observer doesn't take that into account, he is missing the real message that is being said. He may mistake a friendly joke for an attack. But he won't be able to recognize that, because he immediately categorizes the situation as "bad" based on some simple trigger.
      </p>
      <p>
       What does this really say?
      </p>
      <p>
       I think it says something about a fundamental truth of our way of existing. In that it is a much lesser crime to actually hurt someone or disrespect someone - than it is to disrespect or fail to acknowledge the "law" or "rules" or "social norms".
      </p>
      <p>
       It's not hard to reconcile with daily observation imo. Some things immediately paint you as an "evil person", no matter whether you were actually hurting anyone, simply because a part of your individual expression triggered some register/had some "forbidden" trait. Other times, you can actually be hurting people a lot, yet avoiding all the "forbidden" words/actions/triggers and nobody will bat an eye.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, when someone calls you a racist, they are superficially saying that you shouldn't disrespect black people. But between the lines, they aren't saying that at all. Between the lines, they are saying that you should not disrespect your rulers/lords/owners and their rules/commands/orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       This disconnect between spoken word and actual meaning between the lines is what bothers me, in a scary/eerie way, like I'm speaking with a zombie that doesn't even realize what he is really communicating: It's not really about black people. It's about obedience. They could just exchange "racism" for some other form of thought crime tomorrow and it would be just the same, and people would just as readily claim that you did something evil and that they hate you for doing that very thing in particular - but in reality they just hate you because you were being disobedient and that disobedience triggered them.
      </p>
      <p>
       If it was really about you treating people badly, then they wouldn't even need the whole "racism" ideology and they wouldn't need to call you "racist". They would plainly see that you treated someone badly and they might try to do something about it. Not because it's against the law/social norms, but because your actual action would directly bother them on some ... I dunno ... human level or whatever.

       What I am saying is that there is a clear cut difference between white and black.
      </p>
      <p>
       It's open rebuke from a
       <strong>
        Black
       </strong>
       icon, I don't see the harm. If anything, it makes even more people want to wake up.
      </p>
      <p>
       However, you would not get this reaction if a person of another race said these things.

       there is no minority. we are all red and pink inside. we all breath the same air. we all have similar problems. the groups you listed are few of many tribes of humans that are all looking for the same thing as the rest of us. unity. labels for these tribes might bring about certain feelings from other tribes that cause division. stop doing that. stop dividing us. stop categorizing us. I love you brother. help me to wake up the rest of the family.

       Ah, I hear what you're saying. I'm not a person that has strong political or religious beliefs. My observations about how people can get along involve going to the local market, or tavern. Food and drink makes people happy.
      </p>
      <p>
       One strong belief I have is that Racism, Sexism, Antithisandthat, Torture, and all Warfare, is manufactured to divide peoples, and rob them of natural, creative, encouraged, fair, just, spiritual, and innovative abilities and opportunities.
