        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>911 and 923. September 11th was one of the key elements to my awakening and understanding of the veils of propaganda and culture became visible. But it wasn’t until June of 2015 that I started experiencing the 9-23 synchronicities and the odd predictive programing that pervades all forms of media. What does it mean, is it a “Revelation of the method” or is it collective consciousness offering clues to the nature of reality.</p>

<p>The levels of “coincidence” at play in the whole of creation was brought to my awareness after researching the 911/923 synchronicities and experiencing personal syncs that prompted more paths of research.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful things I learned about was the occult numerological elements encoded in just about every event. Whether these links were intentional put there or just a product of the collective consciousness leaking out clues.</p>

<p>First let’s look at the absolute basics. 9-11-2001 is at its basic 923 when broken down. </p>

<p><a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/vm5074a5f9.jpg">http://files.abovetopsecret.com/files/img/vm5074a5f9.jpg</a></p>

<p>Time is a key element to numerology As it is a representation of the movement of the biggest bodies in the solar system. 
When a clock hits 9-11 this is the first point that places the min hand between the 2 and 3 at 9-10 this is not shown.
So time came up on the day of 9-11. The ABC broadcast that showed the second plane hit </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KYE4zViAAg&amp;t=603s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7KYE4zViAAg&amp;t=603s</a></p>

<p>Start the video at 10:50 you will see a flash as the time hits 11:01</p>

<p>11:38 is the start of the camera that witnessed the 2nd plane</p>

<p>11:48 has a beep that you can hear</p>

<p>11:58 is the entrance of the plane into the shot</p>

<p>22 seconds before the 2nd plane hits the Camera was adjusted to have a center shot of the towers. Just before this the camera angle had been a zoomed in shot on the smoke coming from the first building.
12:01 contact and RIGHT at the exact moment the clock went from 9:02 to 9:03 923……</p>

<p>At 9:37 AM another plane hit the pentagon starting at 51:20 in video</p>

<p>1:08:14 is when the first tower starts too fall. Camera pans out at the exact rate of fall.  56mins 13 seconds after contact</p>

<p>(Completely visible here as the camera pans out you can see the Millennium Monolith. Which is based on the monolith from 2001 a space odyssey. As a very odd coincidental aside is that 2001 the movie was directed by Stanley Kubrick. )</p>

<p>Stanley dies 666 days before the dawn of the 21st century!</p>

<p><a href="https://calcifiedlies.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/the-skeleton-key-911-the-millenium-monolith/">https://calcifiedlies.wordpress.com/2014/03/03/the-skeleton-key-911-the-millenium-monolith/</a></p>

<p>at 1:37:48 the second tower begins to fall 29mins 33 seconds after 1st tower falls.</p>

<p>Coincidences keep piling up and it all seems so odd the timing and elements at play. </p>

<p>ABC its as easy as 123 Conspiracy=123. </p>

<p>So about the pentagon…. The corner stone and construction began on 9-11-1941</p>

<p>From the wiki*</p>

<p>“The Pentagon was designed by American architect George Bergstrom (1876–1955), and built by general contractor John McShain of Philadelphia. Ground was broken for construction on September 11, 1941”</p>

<p>Built 77 feet tall and hit by flight 77.</p>

<p>WIKI 23-9-11-9 911923. Hmmm Isn’t it weird how these things build on each other. Wiki is where we most of seekers look for these dates and clues. As if This whole process is an initiation and only those with “Eyes to see” I’s too see….. 9s too C……..  923…. Hehe that’s a fun little one. Letters and numbers and language all play a role in this.</p>

<p>Heres an odd picture I stumbled across yesterday. So the word has it that the K9 unit bomb sniffing dogs were removed from the towers the day before the attacks. There was a heightened security that ended 9-10-01. So there weren’t a lot of k9 units in the area. </p>

<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/dogwithblog.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sirius-Bill-clinton.jpg">https://i2.wp.com/dogwithblog.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/sirius-Bill-clinton.jpg</a></p>

<p>I have to say jokingly ARE YOU SIRIUS! But in all seriousness This dog was the only k9 k=119 unit to die on 9-11 (in the attack rescue efforts.)</p>

<p>So firstly we have a picture of Bill Clinton with the only k9 to die on 9-11-01. But wait what does that date say at the bottom? 9-11-00</p>

<p>Well that’s crazy bill Clinton met with this dog and his owner David Lim (777 in Jewish gematria) on one year before the passing of Sirius. Time is important to the elites Just as time was imminently important to the Ancient Egyptians/Mayans/Aztecs. So ritualistically we have Clinton touching the dog Sirius before he dies in the greatest tragedy to happen on American soil. You have to think that the energy coming out of the attacks was quite potent. More people in the world were watching the second plane hit live than I think has ever happened on television. Human attention and emotion could have energetic results on the universe. This is made more peculiar by Hilary Clinton passing out at the 9-11-16 memorial service.</p>

<p>In addition the number on the truck next to Bill is 56261 56=11 261=9 119. Which is K=11 9</p>

<p>As another aside 911 became the emergency number on the same year the towers were opened</p>

<p>In March 1973, the White House&#39;s Office of Telecommunications issued a national policy statement which recognized the benefits of 9-1-1, encouraged the nationwide adoption of 9-1-1, and provided for the establishment of a Federal Information Center to assist units of government in planning and implementation.</p>

<p>The towers opened 4-4-1973. So a month before they opened the WTC 911 was declared a nationwide emergency number. It became synonymous with danger,fear,tradgedy. This Encoding of this number into our psyche as Bad news and tragedy was amplified on 9-11.</p>

<p><a href="https://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/connection-between-sirius-and-human-history/">https://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/connection-between-sirius-and-human-history/</a></p>

<p>Sirius has had a prominent role in human history and appears to be a key element in the esoteric traditions. The Dogon tribe of Mali Africa had an oral historical tradition that told of beings from Sirius. They knew things that would be later verified by science and witnessed with our technologies at later times. They knew that the star was part of a binary system and they knew the densities and orbital rates of both stars. 1 of the stars is not even visible with the naked eye and until telescopes no one should have been able to know that.</p>

<p>Sirius is serious and I think these clues dropped on 9-11 with Sirius dieing and bill meeting with Clinton exactly one year before hand. The great pyramid, The pyramids of Mexico and stone henge all focus on Sirius as a main focal point.</p>

<p>I was reminded of The Truman Show and the moment when his reality became suspect. It was when the light that represented the Star Sirius falls from the sky and crashes into the street. I looked up the video and was startled to find something in the same vein as what im showing here. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcDOSgNFCZw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcDOSgNFCZw</a></p>

<p>You could say there is a bit of reaching but the metaphors presented are startling. You have Truman unable to reach for his goals of going to Fiji and breaking out of the prison because he is crippled by fear. A fear that was created by the designer of the show Christos (Siriusly though). Jim Carrey is a interesting character. He has been in some compelling red pilling roles and a lot of movies that seem to reveal a bit about what’s behind the curtain. And the irony of me going on about numbers like he does in “The Number 23”. He goes crazy in this movie seeing numbers and patterns everywhere that relate to him. He begins to feel like the universe is speaking to him as if the entire world was made with him as the focus. Kinda of like the Truman show right? Hmm something to think about.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JmNKGfFj7w&amp;t=10s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JmNKGfFj7w&amp;t=10s</a></p>

<p>Its quite an interesting story. The story being told not only in the movies played by the actors but the story being told throughout all of their movies. The story continues into their personal lives to the point where Jim Carrey the archetype is all that exists. That the I within Jim Carrey can’t exist while being in his current role.
Got a little in depth there. So the 9-11/ 9-23 connection is mentioned in this same movie. At 4:11 of the clip Truman boards a bus and there is the backwards 923.</p>

<p>Before 911 there was a glut of coincidences and synchronicity’s in television and movies.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDMmm0cJ988">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDMmm0cJ988</a></p>

<p>I swear I find a good 3 or 4 new things about 9-11 every day. This is an example of the multitude of clues in EVERY form of media. It’s unreal the amount of connections. And yes some are jumps and some are leaps, but a fair bit have no skewing or dancing around the facts.</p>

<p>There are over 60 instances of this oddity in just this video
Some of them that are incredible.</p>

<p>8:14 The WWF event World Powers: Twin Towers. Just that name alone geez. </p>

<p>14:24 (Phillips home cinema) is one I have never seen before but again the metaphors are startling. First frame is a pillar of sky, no tower is visible. And the curtain pulls open a bit. The curtain was a door apparently and the towers are right in front of you. Then you hear a voice “Pictures so real you won’t believe your eyes.” Hmm and people were watching live at home a picture that their eyes saw but their minds didn’t want to believe. The end of the Ad says “Lets make things better” Which reminds me what hulk and randy savage were talking about “Love with supercharge the superpowers and tear down the twin towers”</p>

<p>28:40 A news segment on the Crazy conspiracy theories regarding 911 and anti-Semitism.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNurHaPYHwA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNurHaPYHwA</a></p>

<p>This is predictive programming about September 23rd. with some interesting correlations with the Revelation sign of the heavens. 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_rQ4apYdGs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p_rQ4apYdGs</a>
Some odd odd links to 923 and trains. The philladelphia amtrack train went off the track</p>

<p>At 4:30 you can see a 923 on the sleeve of a policeman. But the time 3:15 is overlapping it. 3:15 on a clock is 33 as both hands are pointing at 3’s There is an almost imperceptible pan adjustment made so that the 923 would be visible and then as she mentions a train 923 guy moves off camera.</p>

<p>If you still don’t think predictive programing is a thing here is a western show from 1958 called Trackdown.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs6UcgiDwg0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gs6UcgiDwg0</a></p>

<p>In it a conman named Trump tries to convince a town to purchase his protection in the form of a Wall. The episode is titled The End Of the World. The episode prior was titled the deal Trump wrote a book called The art of the Deal followed by The Mistake.</p>

<p>What I do a simple search of 9-11 9-23 I got The blood of Christ Hebrews 9-11 9-23</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+9</a>
Hebrews 9:23</p>

<p>“It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.”</p>

<p>“Patterns of things in the heavens”…… hmmmmm</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jYgoX4NL7g">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jYgoX4NL7g</a></p>

<p>The revelation 12:1-2 describe the “Patterns of things in the heavens” and it looks as if this arrangement described in the bible is going to be taking place 9-23-17. </p>

<p>TLDR: I feel like I went all the place and this isn’t easily digested data, its easy for someone’s cognitive dissonance to kick in and affect the intake and analysis of data. I really don’t know what happened on 9-11 but it IS the biggest event of our time. It is one event that if it had NOT happened then the world would be a much different place. Perhaps when something like this happens it ripples out backwards and forwards through time, and maybe the things humans create are not entirely our own creations. What if there are subtle energies acting on the see-saw of your decision making faculty. I guess this could be Fate in a way. 9-11 and 9-23 have too many synchronicities at every level of looking at it. 
I can’t imagine that ALL of these clues are being dropped intentionally, I think there are some that are trying to push a reality upon the earth, and this may be a way for the elite to manifest the biblical apocalypse. Using our minds and imagination to guide us into the reality they want. </p>

<p>These points of data separated from the whole appear like a coincidence. So it is easy to stop reading when you get to a point you disagree with our can’t handle the imagined implications. The implication that the universe we live in is such intricately ordered on a fractal scale becomes apparent when you dive deep into any facet of research. “As above so below” what I view around me is a facet of myself and all existence is screaming to wake up to the Sync.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/6kx926/just_the_facts_maam_a_series_of_data_points_that/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyII/comments/6kx926/just_the_facts_maam_a_series_of_data_points_that/</a></p>

<p>Here is a previous Corpus of data points I collected and posted about that goes along with this information. 
In this I discuss the significance of 7’s in the day’s events. Hebrew year 5777 ends 9-20-17 3 days before 9-23-17</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXQ512JgDbw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXQ512JgDbw</a></p>

<p>Ill end this talk with Mathew 7:7 I’ve been quoting it all this time and only recently noticed its verse number.</p>

<p>&quot;Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you.”</p>

<p>So if this statement is true then the inverse statement is true.</p>

<p>Ask and it will be given/ don’t ask and you won’t get</p>

<p>Seek and you will find/ don’t seek and you will not find</p>

<p>Knock and the door will be opened/ No knock No entrance.</p>

<p>In order to ask we have to know what is being given, if we don’t know there is anything there to find then we won’t know too look, We have to even recognize there is a door before we knock, and we have to have faith that the knock  isn’t in vain that someone’s on the other side.</p>

<p>Keep Asking, Keep seeking, and keep on knock, knock, knockin on heaven’s door. And thank you for reading............Justin.</p>
