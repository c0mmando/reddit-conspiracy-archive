<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>He was angry. He told me to get into the truck. I knew what was going to happen. </p>

<p>He drove for miles as he sipped from a flask filled with vodka. I was crying. I remember one time I saw a sheep about to be butchered, and it was shaking uncontrollably. It knew. And I knew, too.</p>

<p>He pulled over in the middle of nowhere. Dirt roads and desert skies surrounded us. He told me to get out of the truck and lay on the ground. He took a stick out of his truck (not even sure what it was). </p>

<p>He beat me until I stopped screaming. I didn’t know if I was going to die, but I finally acquiesced. I let him beat me because there was nothing more I could do.</p>

<p>Luckily, I escaped that relationship, and I did not die. Of course, I suffer from permanent scars, and for years after, I questioned how I even ended up in a relationship like that. </p>

<p>When I started searching for the truth, I asked the simple question, “Why does evil exist?” To this day, many do not believe my story, but I know what happened to me. My life has been filled with abuse, and every day I question of the evil that exists in this world. Over and over again, on Reddit, I see this stance that there is no true evil. There is this stance that all things are inherently good. I do not agree. I remember what that beating felt like. Moral relativism is supreme today.</p>

<p>Further, I browse a lot of Christian-related subreddits, and there are always questions, like “Why are Christians so obsessed with the end times?”</p>

<p>I never understood “Christian Happiness.” To me, if you are a Christian, you see the world as it is. It doesn’t mean you sit there in a constant state of negativity, but you know something is just not as it seems.</p>

<p>If you are reading this and you are not Christian, that is completely fine! I still feel you will find this post interesting and valuable even if you do not agree with all the tenets of Christianity.</p>

<p>Personally, when I started studying the evil of the world, the answers led me to the Christian doctrine. Again, I am not saying anybody should dwell in negativity, and I am certainly not saying you have to be Christian to understand the world. I am saying that there might be more truth in the bible than people realize. Finally, I’m not trying to convert you. I just want you to know that conspiracy theorists and Christians really are not mutually exclusive concepts.</p>

<p>So, today, if Jesus was here, he would be the ultimately conspiracy theorist. And, here’s why.</p>

<p><strong>Equality</strong></p>

<p>We hear that word a lot today, don&#39;t we?</p>

<p>I see tons of racist “Christians” and I see tons of bigoted “Christians.” In reality, Christ is the great equalizer. Before you spew the crap about women not being equal in the church, for the time, Christianity was revolutionary. Women were definitely downtrodden in society, and the initial churches accepted them as equal (or mostly equal) to men. Anyway, I’ll argue that point in the comments if anybody wants to (give me some patience if you do - it takes me time!)</p>

<p>Anyway, here is a great bible verse that explains what I am getting at:</p>

<p>Galatians 3:28 states, “There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”</p>

<p>That’s it. This verse clearly shows that anyone come to Christ, no matter what race, religion, or gender, or whatever they are. </p>

<p>However, the freemasons state that only a select group of people (wealthy men) can be “enlightened” or find the truth. If you are interested in this, I wrote a post about the freemasons here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5w5gfw/there_is_a_lot_of_speculation_about_freemasonry/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/5w5gfw/there_is_a_lot_of_speculation_about_freemasonry/</a></p>

<p>Many seem to believe that only a specific group of people can seek the truth, but Jesus said anybody can come to the truth, and the truth will be known eventually. Jesus would not agree with the divide and conquer techniques that exist today (race, for example)</p>

<p><strong>Jesus Spoke Out</strong></p>

<p>Jesus spoke out against the elite of the time. Here is an interesting article about why Jesus was <em>really</em> killed:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/04/jesus-money-changers-modern-banks.html">http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2014/04/jesus-money-changers-modern-banks.html</a></p>

<p>From that post,</p>

<p>“The big banks have engaged in systemic, continuous ongoing criminal fraud.</p>

<p>Allowing the banks to commit crime with impunity is not what Jesus would do. What would Jesus do? Turn over the tables of the money-changers. (economists agree.)</p>

<p>Moreover, the giant banks manipulate currency through the use of schemes such as manipulating interest rates (gaming interest rates in different regions – Libor, Eurobor, etc. – can in turn drive their currencies up or down), high frequency trading and artificially suppressing gold prices (which artificially inflates the value of fiat money) .</p>

<p>As Ron Paul notes, the Bible forbids altering the quality of money (which, at the time and place, was entirely in the form of coins):
Even the Bible is clear that altering the quality of money is an immoral act. We are instructed to follow the rules of “just weights and measures.” “You shall do no injustice in judgment, in measurement of length, weight, or volume. You shall have just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin” (Leviticus 19:35-36). “Diverse weights are an abomination to the LORD, and a false balance is not good” (Proverbs 20:23). The general principle can be summed as “You shall not steal.”</p>

<p>Proverbs 11:1 also provides:</p>

<p>Dishonest scales are an abomination to the LORD, but a just weight is His delight.</p>

<p>So to the extent that the giant banks have engaged in any dishonest acts or the manipulation of currencies, they are violating scripture.”</p>

<p>In John 2:15 it states, “So he made a whip out of cords, and drove all from the temple courts, both sheep and cattle; he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables.”</p>

<p>Jesus would have spoken out about the gross inequality today – the vast gap between the rich and poor.</p>

<p>He also explained that immense wealth would not really save or benefit anyone:</p>

<p>Matthew 19:24 states, “Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.”</p>

<p><strong>Jesus Cared for the Downtrodden</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s also not forget that Jesus cared for the downtrodden of society. </p>

<p>*Jesus helped the lepers:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_cleansing_a_leper">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_cleansing_a_leper</a></p>

<p>*Jesus was anointed by a sinful woman:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%207%3A36-50">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke%207%3A36-50</a>   </p>

<p>*Jesus advocated for helping the poor. In Mark 10:21-22 it states,
“Jesus, looking at him, loved him and said, ‘You lack one thing; go, sell what you own, and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; then come, follow me.’ When he heard this, he was shocked and went away grieving, for he had many possessions.”</p>

<p>More here if interested:</p>

<p>*Jesus eats with the sinners:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202:13-17">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%202:13-17</a></p>

<p>*Jesus helped and healed the sick:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+8&amp;amp;version=NCV">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+8&amp;amp;version=NCV</a></p>

<p>Jesus never overlooked the downtrodden. He reached out to them, as we should do. Of course, there is so much more he did, and I cannot mention it all here.</p>

<p><strong>Hypocrisy</strong></p>

<p>Jesus spoke out against hypocrisy. Here he is speaking out against the Pharisees:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+23</a></p>

<p>It is funny because so many people say, “How can you be Christian? Look at how shitty Christians are!”</p>

<p>They are right. I grew up in a rich, wealthy community with “Christian” hypocrites. They claimed to be Christian, but they ultimately seemed to be evil people. </p>

<p>Do not let these fake Christians taint the message of Christ. To better explain:</p>

<p>“Before pronouncing the woes, Jesus told His listeners to respect the scribes and Pharisees due to their position of authority but not to emulate them, “for they do not practice what they preach. They tie up heavy, cumbersome loads and put them on other people’s shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them. Everything they do is done for people to see” (Matthew 23:3–5). The scribes and Pharisees were supposed to know God and help others know Him and follow His ways. Instead, the religious leaders added to God’s Law, making it a cumbersome and onerous burden. And they did not follow God with a pure heart. Their religion was not true worship of God; rather, it was rooted in a prideful heart. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount emphasizes the true intent of the Law over the letter of the Law. The scribes and Pharisees emphasized the letter, completely missing its spirit.”</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gotquestions.org/scribes-and-Pharisees.html">https://www.gotquestions.org/scribes-and-Pharisees.html</a></p>

<p>Jesus would have spoken out against the rich &quot;Christian&quot; hypocrites that exist today.</p>

<p><strong>The Law of the Prophets</strong></p>

<p>Aleister Crowley said that you should “do what thou wilt” and that shall be the whole of the law:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelema</a></p>

<p>Jesus disagrees. </p>

<p>He says in Matthew 22:36-40:</p>

<p>36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”
37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’[a] 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’[b] 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”</p>

<p>Jesus simply explained that we should treat others the way we want to be treated.</p>

<p>New age religions and beliefs promote selfishness. Jesus promotes selflessness.</p>

<p>This world is full of pure selfishness at times, so being selfless is now a revolutionary act. </p>

<p><strong>Synagogue of Satan</strong></p>

<p>Even if you disregard the entire bible, the Book of Revelation (and other books!) undoubtedly makes me question everything. First of all, it states that people would be lovers of themselves:</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm">http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm</a></p>

<p>And aren’t they? In an age of selfies, self-promotion, and selfishness, this verse often gives me comfort.</p>

<p>The bible also explains that people would have a form of godliness, but they would deny it:</p>

<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm">http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm</a></p>

<p>Isn’t that more true than ever? Scientists are the new high priests of society. People worship facts, logic, and “science”, but they deny their spiritual selves. By the way, science and scientism are not the same thing:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/science-versus-scientism">http://www.intellectualtakeout.org/blog/science-versus-scientism</a></p>

<p>Further, Jesus spoke about the synagogue of Satan! In revelation 2:9 is states,</p>

<p>“I know your afflictions and your poverty--yet you are rich! I know about the slander of those who say they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.”</p>

<p>Who rules the world? By the way, this is not saying we should hate Jews or anything like this. Notice that the verse says they are “fake” Jews. </p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_hypothesis_of_Ashkenazi_ancestry">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khazar_hypothesis_of_Ashkenazi_ancestry</a></p>

<p>Remember that Christ said all could find the truth, no matter what background. Anti-Semitism is not Christian. </p>

<p>However, Christ may have been an anti-Zionist. There are even Jews who are anti-Zionists:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Jewish_anti-Zionism">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Jewish_anti-Zionism</a></p>

<p>Finally, if you believe there is a New World Order, and there are globalists conspiring for a one-world system of government, don’t forget that the bible said that this would happen:</p>

<p><a href="https://bible.org/seriespage/19-beast-and-false-prophet-rev-131-18">https://bible.org/seriespage/19-beast-and-false-prophet-rev-131-18</a></p>

<p>Also, don’t you find it creepy that the Pope constantly advocates for a one-world religion?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/in-first-video-message-pope-francis-stresses-unity-we-are-all-children-of-god-39381/">http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/in-first-video-message-pope-francis-stresses-unity-we-are-all-children-of-god-39381/</a></p>

<p>He believes all paths lead to God.</p>

<p>Of course, there is so much I could cover here, but this post is more meant to explore the fundamentals.</p>

<p>As always, it takes me time to write these! :D By the way, either Christ was a lunatic, or he was real (there really is no in between!):</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis%27s_trilemma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis%27s_trilemma</a>]</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimers</strong></p>

<p>1) I&#39;m not trying to convert you.
2) I used to be anti-theist/atheist/Buddhist. I didn&#39;t come to Christ over night.
3) I know there are tons of conspiracy theories connected to the bible itself. Yes, I believe the bible is the word of God.
4) Please do not attack me if you disagree
5) I&#39;m willing to listen to all viewpoints</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Jesus Christ would have been a conspiracy theorist today. By the way, let’s not forget who killed Jesus Christ:
<a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-16.htm">http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-16.htm</a></p>

<p>This post is NOT meant to push anybody toward Christianity. Rather, it is meant to make people re-examine Christianity.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not here to argue if Christ existed or not. I’m not here to convince you of anything. I’m here to show you what the bible says.</p>

<p>To me, even if Christ was not real, living by his standards leads to a good life. If I am wrong, then so what, I lived a good life. If I am right, well then great! Ever hear of pascal’s wager?</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_Wager</a></p>

<p>This post will probably be controversial. PLEASE DO NOT ATTACK ME. Let’s discuss and come to different conclusions!</p>

<p>As always, it takes me time to write these! :D By the way, either Christ was a lunatic, or he was real (there really is no in between!):</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis%27s_trilemma">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lewis%27s_trilemma</a></p>

<p>By the way!! In the end times, people will be scoffers and deny the flood story:</p>

<p>You&#39;re applying a modern day concept to someone who didn&#39;t live in this time.</p>

<p>1000 years to humans is like 1 day to God, if you believe as God tell us.  If one believes this (and I know you don&#39;t), it is a very short timeframe from Jesus&#39; life to now, in the greater context of eternity.  Therefore Jesus&#39; teachings, and His Father&#39;s teachings, still apply today, as according to His Word, it was 2 days ago to God-the-Father, and thus, God-the-Son:</p>

<p>Holy Bible, 2 Peter 3:4-8
4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
5 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
6 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
7 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
8 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was interested in your post, until you started a diatribe on god. You need an imaginary friend, many people don&#39;t and completely reject the instruments of control dressed up as a religion. <em>Faith</em> is the biggest conspiracy of all, and the proponents of it claim moral and &quot;spiritual&quot; superiority because of a book written in an age where illiteracy and superstitions were massive drivers of society.</p>

<p>The moral superiority is a self-supporting delusion that allows the followers to feel they have been chosen to be better than all the people who are not &quot;following&quot; the teachings of the central character of the second book in a trilogy. It is an illusion that is frequently unmasked by the selective use of rules they follow, and a generally poor knowledge of the development of the bible. If followers were to actually follow the teachings, the mechanisms of church would be dismantled, the enormous wealth of the institutions of religion would be put into the charitable sector, the poor and needy would be aided and the millionaire televangelists would be stripped of their wealth. What we actually see is a consolidation of wealth at the top of the organisations, we see the pious regularly arrested for sexual crimes and a disgusting hypocritical inability to follow the teachings without cherry picking. A lot of this is because of the contradictory positions that the religious texts contain.</p>

<p>Religion is the single biggest conspiracy hidden in plain sight. </p>

<p>The aspect of the psychopomp is still valid, and this model of belief is still held by the congregants to a greater or lesser degree. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>That makes it less of a control mechanism and more of a shared illusion, or a group psychology session. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That would be true if the organisations that represent the major faiths didn&#39;t have vast swathes of money collected from their congregants invested in the stock market, whilst also sidestepping around the tax systems of the countries where they operate. </p>

<p>They directly dictate the behaviour of their followers with the concepts of sin and post mortem rewards and punishments. The church dictates who can be regarded as a valid person and what people do with their genitals. The texts where they take their instruction are directly written, edited, amended and dispersed by men with an eye to control the populations of the places where their churches/religions are based. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Religions aren&#39;t lobbying to takeover your brain, people walk in the door unmolested. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>When governments take their cues and make their policies based on the scriptures, there is no doubt that the religions have a direct effect on the people <em>whether they follow the religion or not</em></p>

<p>Take the situation in Northern Ireland - there, because the political parties are deeply divided by sectarianism and they are vehement about the existence of their imaginary friend, legislation exists that outlaws the practice of abortion <em>under any circumstances</em>. Raped by your father? Gotta have the baby. Baby&#39;s got a fatal birth defect? Gotta have the baby. Giving birth will kill you? Gotta have the baby. </p>

<p>Fallen in love with someone of the same gender? You&#39;re an abomination and torture for eternity is the punishment. You&#39;re a priest who can&#39;t help but rape children? Then that&#39;s a weakness that can be forgiven by god. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wow, that&#39;s a great write up, again.  Your writing is good enough to get paid for it, btw.</p>

<p>I&#39;m so sorry you&#39;ve had to bear the darkness of this world, like so many others.  Reckoning is coming soon.</p>

<p>Followers of Jesus can be conspiracists, and like you said, are probably the ultimate conspiracist.  Because, if I&#39;m not mistaken, we believe all of the human conspiracies are contained within a larger conspiracy, one out of the hands of humans - the conspiracies of fallen angels to control humans, ever since Adam, and without the knowledge of their existence to the uninitiated except for faith/belief in God and Jesus.  As some say, &quot;the greatest trick the devil ever pulled, was convincing the world he doesn&#39;t exist&quot;.</p>

<p>You are 100% correct Jesus is for selflessness, not selfishness.</p>

<p>As for the rich, Jesus was against being rich in this world now.  He Himself was homeless  - Matthew 8:20 &quot;And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.&quot;.  </p>

<p>He stated that a beggar would enter the Kingdom of Heaven before a rich man - Luke 16:20-26 &quot;20 And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,
21 And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man&#39;s table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.
22 And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham&#39;s bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;
23 And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.
24 And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.
25 But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.
26 And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.&quot;.</p>

<p>God bless.</p>

<p>Also, in regards to Zion, I believe Jesus is a Zionist, in fact the rightful owner of Zion.  Although, probably not how the commonly-used term &quot;Zionist&quot; is meant, nor their methods.  Zechariah 8:3 &quot;Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy mountain.&quot;</p>

<p>Also, Psalm 48:2 &quot;Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.&quot;</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree with you completely.  That&#39;s why I put the word &quot;Zionist&quot; in quotes, as I don&#39;t believe Jesus would agree with &quot;their methods&quot; (meaning, the &quot;Zionist&#39;s&quot; as known today, methods).</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Some interesting thoughts. I believe the conspiracy is that religion is used for control and mostly BS. I&#39;m not religious. I do have a strong faith.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe the Bible is the literal Word of God, because it was written by men.</p>

<p>I think many things in the Old Testament are actually very wrong. In fact I think that is why God (I Am, The Creator, whatever you want to call Him) sent Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus taught everything about how to live, by example. A few of my favorites:</p>

<p>Judas told Christ he was wrong to associate with a prostitute. Jesus said, look at you! Knowing Judas would betray Him. The lesson was not to judge others and those that do, should look at themselves.</p>

<p>The Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus converted a Roman soldier by healing him, when He knew they were coming to take him to His crucifixion. By doing so, the soldier came to follow Christ. He scolded His Disciples who attempted to defend Him. &quot;Put away your swords!&quot; Turn the other cheek. It&#39;s the only way that can actually work.</p>

<p>Looking down from The Cross, and asking God to forgive His Crucifiers. All can be forgiven.</p>

<p>The money changers in the Temple, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the poor. All of these, He taught by example. He literally, walked the walk. As you said, whether you believe or not, you can&#39;t argue with the message.</p>

<p>In the movie &quot;Contact&quot;, Jodie Foster as the scientist who didn&#39;t believe in God, because proof and Matthew McConaughey as the religious man who did believe, because faith.</p>

<p>McConaughey: &quot;Did you love your father?&quot;</p>

<p>Foster: &quot;You know I did!&quot;</p>

<p>McConaughey: &quot;Prove it.&quot;</p>

<p>I think, God is Love explains most of what you need to know. The two words are actually interchangeable. If it&#39;s not Love, it&#39;s not God. If it&#39;s not of God, it&#39;s not Love. I also believe Love/God is the only thing that&#39;s really real. Everything else is an illusion, a hallucination, created in our heads. Satan is the absence of God, which is a hallucination because it&#39;s impossible for God to be absent. I Am.</p>

<p>Remember, just because you don&#39;t believe something, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not real. Everyone is saved, because everyone is created in His image. You don&#39;t even have to believe to be saved. You&#39;re saved because God loves you so much He sent Jesus to take away your sins. It&#39;s not because of anything you did, or didn&#39;t do, it&#39;s because of who He is.</p>

<p>It’s not God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit or any high level spiritual being who judges us. We judge ourselves. If what we do makes us feel good deeply within, then that’s our choice to continue. If what we do does not make us feel good deep within, then it’s our choice to change our behavior or not. Humans judge humans, and we judge ourselves, but I’d suggest leaving Jesus out of it because He simply loves you for what you are. That’s who He is.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

<p>Looking down from The Cross, and asking God to forgive His Crucifiers. All can be forgiven.</p>

<p>The money changers in the Temple, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the poor. All of these, He taught by example. He literally, walked the walk. As you said, whether you believe or not, you can&#39;t argue with the message.</p>

<p>In the movie &quot;Contact&quot;, Jodie Foster as the scientist who didn&#39;t believe in God, because proof and Matthew McConaughey as the religious man who did believe, because faith.</p>

<p>McConaughey: &quot;Did you love your father?&quot;</p>

<p>Foster: &quot;You know I did!&quot;</p>

<p>McConaughey: &quot;Prove it.&quot;</p>

<p>Cool examples! :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think, God is Love explains most of what you need to know. The two words are actually interchangeable. If it&#39;s not Love, it&#39;s not God. If it&#39;s not of God, it&#39;s not Love. I also believe Love/God is the only thing that&#39;s really real. Everything else is an illusion, a hallucination, created in our heads. Satan is the absence of God, which is a hallucination because it&#39;s impossible for God to be absent. I Am.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree here</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember, just because you don&#39;t believe something, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not real. Everyone is saved, because everyone is created in His image. You don&#39;t even have to believe to be saved. You&#39;re saved because God loves you so much He sent Jesus to take away your sins. It&#39;s not because of anything you did, or didn&#39;t do, it&#39;s because of who He is.</p>

<p>Disagree here. When we die, we will go where our consciousness is. If we don&#39;t understand the true word of God, we may not be able to be saved.</p>

<p>It’s not God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit or any high level spiritual being who judges us. We judge ourselves. If what we do makes us feel good deeply within, then that’s our choice to continue. If what we do does not make us feel good deep within, then it’s our choice to change our behavior or not. Humans judge humans, and we judge ourselves, but I’d suggest leaving Jesus out of it because He simply loves you for what you are. That’s who He is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think God judges us ultimately.</p>

<p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

<p>Thanks! I appreciate your thoughts.</p>

<p>Extraterrestrials that are billions of years ahead of human civilization define Infinity as Unity, ultimately everything is part of All there is/Infinity and thus everything can&#39;t help but be the Creator/Universe experiencing itself.</p>

<p>Nature of reality/existence is of Oneness. Everything is Divine, there is only truly Freewill. Law of One also talks about the creation story of &quot;God&quot;/existence as well in session 13

<p>Here are some favorite Law of One quotes from Q&#39;uo:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The heart of your journey is to seek the Creator that is within you, the Creator that you are, the Creator that is all things. There can be no other way of looking upon an infinite creation of unity. The Creator took pleasure in making this, what you call creation, in order that it might know itself through the free will of each of its entities that it has created. From the Logos of every star within your skies, to the planet upon which you dwell, to each of your entities that you share the illusion with, each of you has free will to exercise however you wish. Each exercise of free will teaches the Creator more of itself, and fulfills the purpose of the illusion. Each of your actions reveals more to you of yourself, and if you are conscious of the seeking process, of the Creator itself, it is a journey of lovers, the creator loving you with unending love, you seeking and loving the Creator with a growing love. At some point, you will find the Creator, there is no other outcome for the end of this journey. At some point, the creator will know all that you know and will thank you for all that you have taught it of itself. At some point every entity within this great one infinite creation will coalesce again into unity, bringing home to the Creator the fruits of this journey through the octave of densities in which you now travel. Q&#39;uo transcripts September 4, 2016</p>
</blockquote>

<p>as well as </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Let us look first at the first choice and that was the choice of the Creator to know Itself. In choosing to know Itself the Creator flung from Itself innumerable and infinite sparks of love which coalesced into each awareness that dwells within the infinite awareness. Each of those sparks of awareness is the Creator, and yet, because the Creator chose free will in the manifesting of sparks of self, each spark is unique and has been unique since before time began. Each of you is eternal and in many ways immutable, a citizen of infinite nature, worth and value. Each one a holograph of the Creator and yet each one different.
Thus, the choice that birthed each of you was a choice to know the truth, to know the self, and as the Creator is love, so is each entity love. This is the central truth. This is that which does not change. Yet this is that which is ever wrapped in mystery. Each within this circle has come through many planes of existence, has learned a great deal, and each within this circle chose not only this incarnation now being experienced but also that cast of characters with whom each entity interacts in the family, in the close associations of friends, and all those who have significant connections with the self. There were agreements made before incarnation, most notably with the parents and those within the bonds of kinship of blood and of commonality of interest. Each difficulty, each crux that leaves one in a position of being forced to discover the self has been placed not with a hand that desires to punish but with a hand of loving self that wishes to serve ever more deeply, ever more purely. -Q&#39;uo @the_law_of_one (May 18, 1997)</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The only conspiracy here is that an apparent &quot;critical thinker&quot; somehow believes the flood story from the Bible and doesn&#39;t see religion as ultimately a tool to control the ignorant.</p>

<p>Looking at the Pew Research Study it does make start to make sense:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/">http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/</a></p>

<p>Here we can see Christ-based churches being a tool used to control those less educated, which is the real conspiracy here.  These kinds of rambling Gish Gallops must also be appealing to those groups as they are so packed with apparent &quot;information&quot; that they seem somehow authoritative.</p>

<p>Thankfully we are seeing that people in the United States are moving away from these controlled irrational beliefs:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/belief-in-god/">http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/belief-in-god/</a></p>

<p>We can only hope that eventually America will be on par with the progressive and informed countries which also have much higher standards of living as they have for decades been moving away from all religions.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why can&#39;t God/angels be a highly evolved species that genetically engineered us and gave us a set of commandments in order for us to prove we are good enough and not hostile so that we may (as a species) reach Heaven/space? </p>

<p>Religion is a tool used by man to control mans mind and place it within a box (imo). However truth is usually hidden within lies. </p>

<p>Let&#39;s keep in mind the bible was written in a day where language was very limited. 
Chariots of fire and horses have one thing in common: they are both forms of transport to people back in those days. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a few examples:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>2 kings 2:11 - 
And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UFO taking Elijah? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ezekiel 1:4-28 - 
 I was watching a big storm come in from the north. It was a big cloud with a strong wind, and there was fire flashing from it. Light was shining out all around it. It looked like hot metal[a] glowing in a fire. 5 Inside the cloud, there were four living beings that looked like people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>UFO? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Exodus 33:9: - 
And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood {at} the door of the tabernacle, and {the Lord} talked with Moses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Spaceship taking off? </p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s just 3 examples. Read the Bible with that angle and it makes a lot of sense. </p>

<p>&lt; Genesis 1:26
God said, &quot;Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.&quot;</p>

<p>Genetically engineered from ape to man? </p>

<p>I don&#39;t interpret scripture. That&#39;s the job of sophists and liars. It is written, there is no scripture open to private interpretation. Scripture speaks for itself. </p>

<p>Matthew 24 is fairly direct. The Messiah didn&#39;t need to go over the prophesies. They are clear up to the establishment of the modern State of Israel. John in the last book of the gospels makes some further more detailed prophesies. But there are also prophesies beyond the 1967 fulfillment. </p>

<p>Your problem is, you went to bible school(indoctrination) you learned (indoctrinated) what they wanted you to learn. That&#39;s where your ignorance arises from. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>here, look. The words of Jesus, direct quote</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?” And Jesus answered them, “See that no one leads you astray. For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. All these are but the beginning of the birth pains.</p>

<p>Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name&#39;s sake. And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.</p>

<p>So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. Then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or ‘There he is!’ do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. So, if they say to you, ‘Look, he is in the wilderness,’ do not go out. If they say, ‘Look, he is in the inner rooms,’ do not believe it. For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather.</p>

<p>Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>you&#39;re really simplifying the literal vs. figurative issue. All four Gospels, Jesus describes with specificity that the end times are a real thing. The majority of books in the New Testament reinforce with specificity that they are a real thing. Prophecies in the Old Testament, same story, talking about a thing that is clearly meant to be regarded as real, many times cited directly by Jesus and the various New Testament authors. These are the only records we have on the subject, and if their authenticity can&#39;t be relied on up to a certain point, it means the God of Scripture is incapable of communicating a message of highest importance, and the whole thing is therefore worthless. So it really doesn&#39;t even withstand logical analysis to say Scripture doesn&#39;t mean what it explicitly says. Either it means what it says or the whole thing is out the window and we&#39;re just left to our own devices making stories up.</p>

<p>End times are an extremely vague and debatable part of Christianity. Jesus never addressed it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;end times&quot; are extremely addressed in the New Testament.  There are many scriptural writings about prophecies (future events) in the books of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, as well as in Peter, off the top of my head.</p>

<p>In addition, the whole Book of Revelation is a prophecy regarding the &quot;end times&quot; by Jesus Christ via John the Revelator in AD 95.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It had nothing to do with his central message. I think its frankly a distraction from what he said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The &quot;end times&quot; writings have everything to do with His teachings:  He came to set the way to eternal life while He was on Earth.  In His absence, those who adhered to His teachings will be brought into eternal life.  Jesus&#39; prophecy regarding the &quot;end times&quot; in the Book of Revelation is about the permanent removal of those here on Earth who do not follow Him and His Father; removal of those who do not adhere to His way and their systems/methods.  Then the book of Revelation specifically states the beginning of His kingdom here on Earth.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>You are the one who stated &quot;End times are an extremely vague and debatable part of Christianity. Jesus never addressed it.&quot;.  My response of scripture references was regarding your statement.</p>

<p>In fact, my last response states knowing about Jesus birth, life, death, and resurrection, as well as eternal life via belief in Him, and how to live one&#39;s life.  This is evident with my statement &quot;Jesus birth, life, and death, and resurrection, here on Earth around 2000 years ago, set the way to live life, and then when one dies, to be brought into eternal life in Heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>Therefore, I am not only focused on the &quot;end times&quot;, as you suggest, however, it is a part of the teachings of Jesus, which the scriptural references I listed point to.</p>

<p>Luke 21:36 (Jesus words) &quot;Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.&quot;</p>

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not vague, it&#39;s very specific, the proof is the amount of scriptural references, and the details they discuss.  </p>

<p>Additionally, the Book of Revelation, is 17 pages of details completing Jesus&#39; work.  17 pages on the &quot;end times&quot; is clear, definite, and certain (opposite of the definition of vague).  If you choose to not believe the authenticity of the prophecies, that&#39;s a different argument; to the argument of vague, 17 pages worth of details on 1 subject is not unclear, indefinite, nor uncertain.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like, let&#39;s go through each one to discuss.</p>

<p>If you think scripture is &quot;poetry&quot; and not instructions, that&#39;s your choice to believe or not, and to accept the consequences of that choice.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I very much have, actually.  I believe God-the-Father is the ultimate poet, as well as scientist and musician, and they are all linked together.  This is not commonly thought of however as &quot;poetry&quot; is usually linked to a human expression and not God&#39;s expression, as evidenced by your use of Joseph Cambell as evidence.  True?</p>

<p>Where do you find the notion that &quot;poetry isn&#39;t much literal&quot;, because that statement admits that poetry can be literal if it isn&#39;t &quot;much literal&quot;.</p>

<p>The imagination of God-the-Father is reality, or literal (as it is called &quot;The Word&quot;), to everyone, in my belief.  If you want to say that &quot;human&quot; writers&#39; work of poetry is all imagination, I&#39;m ok with that, but that&#39;s comparing humans to God, and God created reality (which is literally &quot;The Word&quot;), and to me, they aren&#39;t comparable from that view (since humans can&#39;t create reality; they are reality).</p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>That would be correct. There was no &quot;J&quot; in the Hebrew language. So for sure that pronunciation is absolutely wrong. It&#39;s also wrong on other factors as well. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yahweh maybe is more likely. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s wrong as well but closer. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>But we&#39;d never even know for sure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not true. The key is in those two biblical phrases and in the name of his people who are still called by his name as well as using parts of his name in their common Hebrew names. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t the correct pronunciation be important?</p>

<p>Sure it is. It&#39;s also revealing his nature and purpose toward humans. </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Absolutely. If humans don&#39;t like it, then why would the Messiah appreciate having his name mangled and all meaning destroyed? He wouldn&#39;t and doesn&#39;t. </p>

<p>In turn, I tend to ruffle feathers, calling out all the wolves, that preach another Gospel other than the one Jesus gave us amen</p>

<p>My calling, to use the power God gave us to reach as many people as I can, the internet.. I take no $$, God provides my ever need, as He said He would amen.</p>

<p>I speak with snark and at times parabolically just as our Father did. The problem with both, just as in the time of Christ many don&#39;t get parables and react negatively to snark.</p>

<p>I am very disabled, so as I said before anyone ask, my Church is here, the net, on any given day I can reach 100k+ from my chair, were most ministers rarely reach 100 a week.</p>

<p>My thought are radical (no easy believe here, or rapture before tribulations) but I only preach what God tells me, his words not mine amen</p>

<p>I had to stop reading at this point.  If you really believe that the philosophical position of moral relativism asserts that &quot;all things are inherently good&quot;, then I&#39;m not interested in your rationale for returning to the vomit of Christianity.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a hurricane of fallacies.  You do not understand even the most elementary things of philosophy.  To be fair though, your writing is decent.</p>

Much like the Dalai Lama today, Jesus spoke only of social ills that are obvious to everyone, and pandered to populist notions regarding the eternal class struggle.

Jesus wants us to worship a baby-drowning warlord who incinerates political dissidents without hesitation.  Entire libraries have been written by Christian apologists just to rationalize away this one issue.  I think Yahweh is pretty radical as is, without all the fan fiction.</p>

<p>So, what if I don&#39;t agree with God?  Why is he right?  Isn&#39;t his opinion on the matter just as subjective as anyone else&#39;s?  If he smites me and sends me to Hell, does that prove him right?  What if living by his standards brings boundless happiness and serenity?  Would that prove him right?  What if I think that&#39;s lame; what then?  What if I&#39;m the only unhappy man and nobody believes me?</p>

<p>Not hardly.  Many religions explicitly condone genocide, rape and child sexual abuse, cruel and unusual punishment, racism, and other things that I&#39;m sure you would disapprove of.  One of the only things that all religions have in common is that they cannot support any of their claims with evidence.  Another thing they have in common is that they all teach that there is <em>something wrong</em> with the world.  Even the mythology of the indigenous Khoisan people of southern Africa teaches that philosophy.  Look up the Khoisan story of the eland if you have a moment.  Very interesting.  Humans seem to intuitively know that something is amiss around here, but they cannot agree on exactly what that is.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Can you answer me this?  Why does God play hideous games with people?</p>

<p>When my boss at work wants something from me, he sends me either a text or an email.  There is never any doubt in my mind who sent the message, and I&#39;m rarely, if ever, confused by it&#39;s contents or what he expects from me.  The communication is effective, yet we are talking about a mere mortal who failed the ASVAB.  If I don&#39;t understand something he said and make a mistake, he just apologizes for his terrible diction and doesn&#39;t hold it against me.</p>

<p>However, when <em>God</em> wants something from me, he sends out thousands of radically different messages through countless channels all containing irreconcilably conflicting information, and I&#39;m told that I will suffer for eternity if I don&#39;t understand what he expects from me.  I&#39;m referring of course to the state of organized religion in the modern world.</p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m under the impression that God is supposed to be pretty smart, right?  He allegedly invented all of the complex living things  we see on the Earth after all.  That being said, I cannot simultaneously believe that his abysmal and ludicrous failure to communicate effectively with mankind is accidental.  Even my boss can accomplish that, and he&#39;s not exactly a paragon of cognitive prowess.  The only remaining alternative explanation that I can see is that God has made salvation to be a kind of maddening puzzle <em>deliberately</em>.  In other words, he&#39;s playing a game with us, and the losers will roast in torment forever.</p>

<p>I wonder why he would institute such an arrangement.  I&#39;ve never heard a satisfying answer to this, least of all from a Christian.  My two theories are that God is either a sadistic psychopath who is very bored and is doing this for kicks, or else he does not exist.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ah, &quot;free will&quot;.  Every Christian&#39;s favorite superstitious copout.  That&#39;s one of my favorite topics actually, despite the fact that the term literally does not mean anything.</p>

<p>No matter what, you&#39;ll always be worshiping Lucifer.  It does not matter what religion you adhere to or what philosophies you adopt, what you believe or don&#39;t believe, how you live your life, how faithful or wicked you are, you&#39;ll always be <em>doin&#39; it wrong</em>, never good enough for God, and scheduled for an eternity in Hell whilst the crowd insists, to your bewilderment, that you chose your fate.  Lucifer is all there is.  How do I know these things?  Because I&#39;ve spent decades studying religion trying to get &quot;saved&quot;, and it just spins around and around like a merry-go-round right out of Hell where we are all going, and I still have to listen to people like you not only assert authoritatively that your beliefs are correct and that everyone who does not agree with them is evil and doomed, but do so in a smug, self-righteous manner as though you think everyone else is just deliberately choosing to be damned and deserves such a fate, and that you are so noble for not doing so.  As though it were a simple as that.  I will have to listen to you for the rest of my life.  Not you specifically, just... <em>you</em>.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>It does have a meaning.  It means something, it exists.  It&#39;s meaning is not &quot;nothing&quot;.  The ability to choose when not divinely overridden.</p>

<p>I&#39;m curious, how was I being &quot;smug&quot;?  When did I say I was self-righteous or better than anyone?  That&#39;s the point of Christianity - knowing you&#39;re not better than everyone else, knowing that I didn&#39;t/couldn&#39;t save myself (so thus not self-righteous), but acknowledging and accepting salvation from God-the-Son as stated by God-the-Father, which means I didn&#39;t do anything on my own, in fact it was Jesus Christ who saved me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>No matter what though, you&#39;ll always be worshiping Lucifer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you will be, not me, as I&#39;ve already stated I worship God-the-Father and God-the-Son, but I did state Lucifer will ensure you worship him if you don&#39;t worship God-the-Father.  Thus is free will in reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It does not matter what religion you adhere to or what philosophies you adopt, what you believe or don&#39;t believe, how you live your life, how faithful or wicked you are, you&#39;ll always be doin&#39; it wrong, never good enough for God, and scheduled for an eternity in Hell whilst the crowd insists, to your bewilderment, that you chose your fate.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I admit, I&#39;m not good enough for God-the-Father, no human or angel is comparable to Him.  None are except Jesus, the Son.  Which is why Jesus is the savior for me, and reconciles my sinful being to Him, which then &quot;makes me good enough&quot; for Him.  And for that I worship Him and His Son, and none other.</p>

<p>How do I know this?  Because Jesus Christ and God-the-Father say this, in their own words in the Holy Bible.</p>

<p>Once saved, always saved, according to Jesus.  You aren&#39;t destined for Hell/Sheol/Hades and the Lake of Fire if you are saved once by Jesus.    If you understood this, you wouldn&#39;t need to look any further, to other religions or beings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>where we are all going, and I still have to listen to people like you not only assert authoritatively that your beliefs are correct and that everyone who does not agree with them is evil and doomed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, not all of us are going to Hell, as you seem to want to.  I&#39;m not, as I&#39;m saved by Jesus, as are others who are saved by Jesus.</p>

<p>And I&#39;m not asserting authoritatively, I&#39;m merely the messenger of the authority.  And while yes, I believe this, I&#39;m not the originator of this, therefore I choose to relate what I&#39;ve learned of the authority.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but do so in a smug, self-righteous manner as though you think everyone else is just deliberately choosing to be damned and deserves such a fate, and that you are so noble for not doing so</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You just said yourself that you are scheduled for Hell, yet you say you&#39;re not deliberately choosing such a fate?</p>

<p>And when did I say I was so noble.  In fact, when I worship God-the-Father and God-the-Son, I put aside any belief in &quot;nobility&quot; and subject myself to them.  But where did I state I was noble?  Please point that out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As though it were a simple as that.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is that simple, to me.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I will have to listen to you for the rest of my life. Not you specifically, just... you</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not me, thankfully.  Apparently Lucifer will be in your ears for, ever....</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in Hell.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not me, but thanks anyway.  You are sounding very much like that what you complained about - &quot;assert authoritatively that your beliefs are correct&quot;</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t choose Jesus Christ, you are making a choice, correct or not?  The consequence is known.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s just cause-and-effect.  Determinism.  Dominoes.  There is no responsibility to be had for a choice the universe made for you with physics.  To choose in the absence of cause-and-effect, to choose neither randomly nor due to external causes, this is not coherent.  The definition of &quot;free will&quot; in that sense is <em>undefined</em>, because we are not describing anything coherent.  If you asked me what &quot;glergenschfoopel&quot; was, and I told you that it referred to the operation for dividing a number by zero, then the word is absolutely meaningless.  Glergenschfoopel cannot be said to exist or fail to exist, because it does not refer to anything coherent.  &quot;Free will&quot; is likewise meaningless because it either attempts to construct an idea that is not coherent, or simply refers to deterministic choices that a person cannot be held responsible for, and thus fails to accomplish the goal that the term was invented for, which is to make excuses to plug the holes in Christian mythology regarding how God could possibly be justified in punishing people for sins that he clearly designed them to commit.  It is meaningless to say that free will exists and that people have it, and it is also meaningless to say that it does not exist and people do not have it, because there is no &quot;it&quot; to begin with.  &quot;Dragon&quot; is a word that refers to something that could exist, or not exist.  &quot;Free will&quot; does not refer to anything.  It has no meaning or definition, and when it does, it is just referring to deterministic choices that are not &quot;free&quot; in any sense.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You assume that everyone who is not a Christian is choosing to go to Hell.  Every Christian uses that same language that you do, eg <em>&quot;who you choose to worship (you&#39;ll worship God-the-Father or Lucifer, then answer to that being, no matter one&#39;s belief).</em>  You never have logical evidence for your beliefs, you just try to make it seem like the other person must know deep down that they are rebelling against God by not being a Christian.  In that way, your beliefs system is based on the preexisting assumption that it is true.  You reject any possibility that some people are 100% sincerely just not convinced that anything taught by Christianity is true, because that would imply that God didn&#39;t reach out to them and give them a fair chance of understanding the truth, which would be an obvious injustice on his part.  You cannot believe that God would make an oversight like that, so instead, you assume that anyone who does not agree with your beliefs is lying and is intentionally rejecting God.  The plain fact is that plenty of people do not worship or even believe in your deity nor Satan, and maybe never, have but you jut cannot accept that because that contradicts the implications of your own belief system in which God must surely have given everyone the chance to believe in him and be saved.  When you say that everyone worships &quot;God the father or Lucifer&quot;, that is completely false.  That is just something you are compelled to keep telling yourself for psychological reasons.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>No.  You still have the wrong religion and are not saved.  One day you will wake up in a panicked sweat and realize this.  You will never have the right religion.  You will always be wrong.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You just said yourself that you are scheduled for Hell, yet you say you&#39;re not deliberately choosing such a fate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No matter what I believe or do, billions of people will say that I&#39;m wrong and am going to Hell or will suffer some similarly awful fate.  Everyone is positive that they are right.  Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, everyone.  They all think everyone besides them is wrong and will unlock the bad ending.  They all think that they are so obviously right, that anyone who disagrees with them must be just pretending to disbelieve them and are actually choosing the bad ending on purpose.  You are part of that noise.  In your mind, there is no such thing as an honest man who does not believe in God or Satan or worship anyone.  Everyone is either right or wrong.  Nobody is allowed to search for the truth, unless that search immediately culminates in agreeing with you.  You have the maximum amount of arrogance that a human being can possibly possess, just like the majority of religious people across all faiths.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t choose to live my life in slavery to <strong>ancient myths that are riddled with errors and historical and scientific inaccuracies.</strong>  That is my choice.  I do not reject Jesus, God, heaven, nor any such thing.  I reject beliefs systems that are based on unsound reasoning and bad evidence.  That is the only thing that I choose in this regard.  Nothing more.  As I explained above however, you are psychologically incapable of understanding this, so you have to reinterpret me through your own mental filter as somehow worshiping &quot;Lucifer&quot;, even though <em>I do not worship Lucifer</em>.  I&#39;ve never worshiped Lucifer in my life.  I don&#39;t worship anyone or anything.  You will keep saying that I do because you have to for the reasons I&#39;ve explained, but it is not true.</p>

<p>You did not read what I wrote about free will very carefully, but to be fair, I obviously did not grasp the nuances of what you were trying to tell me either.  When free will is defined the way that you tried to define it, it becomes completely irrelevant to the context in which it is used.  When an attempt is made to redefine it in a way that will serve the needs of the argument predicated upon it, it becomes <em>undefined</em>.  It has no meaning in the context of philosophy that it is used in, particularly religious philosophy.  You could use the term to refer to &quot;the ability to choose when not divinely overridden&quot;, but you could also define it to be a kind of potato salad, and that would have equal relevance in discussions about topics such as &quot;the problem of evil&quot;, etc.  The word fails to hone in on any coherent idea that accomplishes what it is intended to, and ends up referring to nothing at all.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t believe I said differently.  Maybe you are saved by Jesus Christ.  I could be wrong about my beliefs regarding him and Christianity.  I never hear Christians admit the possibility that they are fallible and that their beliefs may be wrong though.  They usually seem completely consumed with arrogance.  Maybe I&#39;ve mischaracterized you, but you still have that general, taunting, malicious &quot;you gonna die if you don&#39;t convert mwa ha ha!&quot; kind of tone that all Christians have.  They usually seem profoundly disturbed to me, the rare ones who actually take their belief seriously that is.  The worst are Calvinists.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But I did say you and everyone else will worship God-the-Father or Lucifer. See the distinction there? I didn&#39;t say what is occurring presently, but I did say what will occur in the future...do you get it yet?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ah, I see.  You have your own idiosyncratic religious beliefs, not the ones that most other Christians have and shove down everyone&#39;s throat, and can dismiss everything I said by moving the issue into the future, at which time apparently you think people will worship Satan for whatever reason.  My apologies.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As I said before a couple times now, you have your beliefs, and I have mine; the consequences of our beliefs will be reality, for both of us.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yup, so, if God wants me to have a certain belief, he need only provide me with the appropriate evidence and/or alter how my mind works.  It&#39;s completely up to him.  I can only believe whatever seems reasonable to me.  I do not have the option to believe anything else.  If someone pointed a gun at me and told me to believe that the Earth is flat or else he will kill me, I could <em>pretend</em> to believe that, but I could not <em>actually</em> believe that.  Humans do not possess any psychological mechanism for controlling beliefs.  Beliefs are like one&#39;s heartbeat; they are an automatic, involuntary process forged by innate intelligence, childhood upbringing, life experiences, available evidence, factors of that nature.  God can therefore not rightfully punish someone on the basis of belief or lack thereof.  He also cannot rightfully punish anyone on any other basis because human actions are a product of physics in a chain reaction of deterministic cause-and-effect stretching back to the beginning of time, so everyone is literally doomed to do whatever it is they end up doing, and it is not their responsibility.  It&#39;s not even God&#39;s responsibility.  &quot;Free will&quot; does not magically become a coherent concept just by throwing &quot;God&quot; in the picture. </p>

<p>If God wants to save people, he should just do it, and not make a sadistic, anxiety-inducing game out of it where one has to search in vain for years only to be forced, literally forced by his own mind, to realize that all religions are bullshit and nothing can really be known about this universe or what, if anything, happens when you die, all the while being surrounded by smug assholes trying to send him to the mental hospital by permeating all of society and culture with the message that he will suffer for eternity if he doesn&#39;t somehow believe in a pile of patently false myths from millenniums ago.  I don&#39;t understand why he would operate that way.  If God is real, all of the evidence points to him be a sadist, nothing more.  There was probably never a Heaven, and he is just going to send every single soul straight to Hell no matter what.</p>

<p>This ignores the other possibility that Jesus Christ is a fictional character who was mythologized close to 100 years after his purported death.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I believe there is truth to the bible the same way there is truth to any ancient written book. Considering the context and the time they were written. The people who wrote the bible thought they were writing the absolute truth. But it was only the absolute truth from their perspective. </p>

<p>One example is in 1 Kings 7:23-26. Where they are building a round object 10 cubits diameter, 30 cubits circumference. Of course we know that is not a really round object because pi is ~3.14, so it would have to be about 31 cubits diameter to make it more mathematically round. Of course for the time it was as round as it could be made. </p>

<p>Ezequiel is another great example. it is very obvious to a neutral skeptic reader that he was visited by an extraterrestrial humanoid being in his spaceship. But he thought it was an angel of god coming to tell him what will happen to the people of Israel. The truth we can discern from it is similarly attractive. Extraterrestrial being that look very similar to humans have been manipulating our destinies. </p>

<p>Maybe what Moises wrote in the bible is true and they even created us. Many different disconnected sources, some older than the bible itself, talk about the universal flood myth. So of it is most probable something like that happened. People should not be so quick to disregard what is written in the bible. </p>

<p>But</p>

<p>One must be specially aware when reading the bible, it has been edited greatly through time. The red-sea scrolls are evidence of such editing. We know may books have been erased from it. We know almost nothing about the life jesus led from when he was a kid until he was over 30 years old. </p>

<p>When searching for truth one must never reach a conclusion and stick to it, closing oneself to everything else, such as one may do when choosing to integrate a specific religion or group. One must always be challenging, always be open to new ideas. Always use logic and reason, specially when learning something new that challenges our old believes. </p>

    <div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Some interesting thoughts. I believe the conspiracy is that religion is used for control and mostly BS. I&#39;m not religious. I do have a strong faith.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Religion is used for control. Christ never advocated for a specific church.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I don&#39;t believe the Bible is the literal Word of God, because it was written by men.</p>

<p>Inspired by God.</p>

<p>I think many things in the Old Testament are actually very wrong. In fact I think that is why God (I Am, The Creator, whatever you want to call Him) sent Jesus.</p>

<p>My post is about the new covenant and Jesus.</p>

<p>Jesus taught everything about how to live, by example. A few of my favorites:</p>

<p>Judas told Christ he was wrong to associate with a prostitute. Jesus said, look at you! Knowing Judas would betray Him. The lesson was not to judge others and those that do, should look at themselves.</p>

<p>The Garden of Gethsemane. Jesus converted a Roman soldier by healing him, when He knew they were coming to take him to His crucifixion. By doing so, the soldier came to follow Christ. He scolded His Disciples who attempted to defend Him. &quot;Put away your swords!&quot; Turn the other cheek. It&#39;s the only way that can actually work.</p>

<p>Looking down from The Cross, and asking God to forgive His Crucifiers. All can be forgiven.</p>

<p>The money changers in the Temple, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the poor. All of these, He taught by example. He literally, walked the walk. As you said, whether you believe or not, you can&#39;t argue with the message.</p>

<p>In the movie &quot;Contact&quot;, Jodie Foster as the scientist who didn&#39;t believe in God, because proof and Matthew McConaughey as the religious man who did believe, because faith.</p>

<p>McConaughey: &quot;Did you love your father?&quot;</p>

<p>Foster: &quot;You know I did!&quot;</p>

<p>McConaughey: &quot;Prove it.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Cool examples! :)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think, God is Love explains most of what you need to know. The two words are actually interchangeable. If it&#39;s not Love, it&#39;s not God. If it&#39;s not of God, it&#39;s not Love. I also believe Love/God is the only thing that&#39;s really real. Everything else is an illusion, a hallucination, created in our heads. Satan is the absence of God, which is a hallucination because it&#39;s impossible for God to be absent. I Am.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I agree here</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Remember, just because you don&#39;t believe something, doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not real. Everyone is saved, because everyone is created in His image. You don&#39;t even have to believe to be saved. You&#39;re saved because God loves you so much He sent Jesus to take away your sins. It&#39;s not because of anything you did, or didn&#39;t do, it&#39;s because of who He is.</p>

<p>Disagree here. When we die, we will go where our consciousness is. If we don&#39;t understand the true word of God, we may not be able to be saved.</p>

<p>It’s not God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit or any high level spiritual being who judges us. We judge ourselves. If what we do makes us feel good deeply within, then that’s our choice to continue. If what we do does not make us feel good deep within, then it’s our choice to change our behavior or not. Humans judge humans, and we judge ourselves, but I’d suggest leaving Jesus out of it because He simply loves you for what you are. That’s who He is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think God judges us ultimately.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks! I appreciate your thoughts.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s interesting.  I think that&#39;s a very basic mind-control technique.  Inducing a complex in someone whereby they fear for the integrity of their of their own thinking powers by suggesting that persuasive, competing teachers and philosophies, potentially of supernatural origin, are a grave threat to them is highly effective, especially on children.  Paul of Tarsus was a smart man.  He&#39;s convinced billions of people down to this day to arbitrarily believe in his ideas rather than those arrived at via reason.

    <div class="md"><p>It&#39;s sad how religion has tainted spirituality</p>

<p>I do think there is an objective right and wrong, and that standard is set by God.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s just say I even argue there is truth in every religion. God has set a standard in every single religion/culture that exists...and most of those standards are pretty similar.</p>

<p>I think that Jesus came to serve as a model for how we should live. We can never be quite like God, but we can be like Jesus (God in human form)</p>
