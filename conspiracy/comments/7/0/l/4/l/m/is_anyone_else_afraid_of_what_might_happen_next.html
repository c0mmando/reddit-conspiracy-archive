<p>Anyone have a positive spin on all this they can share for those of us feeling a little paranoid? Given what our government allowed on 9/11, I don&#39;t underestimate what they or their cronies can do to a brainwashed population. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I know exactly how you feel. Though it was on a smaller scale, I was really scared about the whole April 26th event earlier this year, when people feared there would be some sort of alien attack, near extinction event, false flag attack, etc. The whole thing had a big snowball effect, where people would just grab as much &#39;evidence&#39; as possible and relate it to April 26th in any way they could. I believe in free thinking and conspiracies, but I also believe in the evils of fear mongering, and I think sometimes when a bunch of people talk and link evidence, it has the chance to foster unneeded paranoia. I spent the entire day in the worst anxiety I&#39;d ever experienced, just waiting for some sort of emergency alert or breaking news. It never happened. I&#39;ve learned to take these things with more than a grain of salt at this point. I pay attention and keep them in the back of my mind, but most of the time there is 99.9% chance that nothing will happen. People always look at evidence that support their claims, but few actually look at rational counter arguments to foster a reasonable outlook. Just stay calm and live this week like any other, if you need to, just cut off from media, or don&#39;t look at any September 23rd posts. A lot of the paranoia surrounding the day is religious, and if that stresses you out, look up a list of all of the religious conspiracies that got people scared, but never actually happened, the list is enormous, and definitely puts everything into perspective.  Since I was a kid I&#39;ve always been afraid of some large scale planetary collision since I had a nightmare about it one night, it&#39;s been a fear of mine for a long long time, and it was something I never thought I would get over. Surprisingly, one of the best remedies for this fear was watching the film Melancholia, which is about some sort of &#39;Planet X&#39; colliding with Earth, and one of the main characters does exactly what I used to do. She researched it on the internet, read fear mongering articles, purchased sleeping pills to commit suicide if it ever came to fruition. In the end, the planets did collide. I thought it would be horrifying, but really, it was just the beautiful sight of a huge, blue planet, filling up the sky, something that I was sure would fill me with dread and send me on some sort of paranoid binge of google searches. I didn&#39;t, I just thought it was cool, and it showed me that I have no control over what happens on that scale, so I should just live my life and enjoy myself in every way I could. I haven&#39;t familiarized myself with every detail of the September 23rd events, but I don&#39;t need to, because I don&#39;t want it to takeover. If something happens, it happens, but I don&#39;t think it will haha. Just be careful with what you look up, because a lot of websites and articles will only try to scare you to get you to read them. Be safe, and if you need to talk more, this is a great community, and there are always people to contact.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think it will just be horrific and painful and bad and include starvation and burning alive and choking to death on nuclear waste and watching loved ones die and/or just never hear from them again and possibly being torture or forced to submit by whatever organization survives</p>

<p>But, if we end up safely distant and are able to kinda watch things fall apart spectacularly, then just evaporate in a nuke or get raptured up to heaven, or something like that, then I&#39;m with you and will get my popcorn </p>
