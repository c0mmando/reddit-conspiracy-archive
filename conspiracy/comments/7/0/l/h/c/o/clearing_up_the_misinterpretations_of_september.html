<p>Revelation 12 1-17</p>

<p>The Woman and the Dragon</p>

<p>1)And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: 2)And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.</p>

<p>3)And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. 4)And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.</p>

<p>5)And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. 6)And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.</p>

<p>The War in Heaven</p>

<p>7)And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, 8)And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. 9)And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. 10)And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. 11)And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. 12)Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.</p>

<p>The Dragon Persecutes the Woman</p>

<p>13)And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. 14)And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. 15)And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. 16)And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. 17)And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>This 9/23 is already incredibly significant even if you we didn&#39;t know about the Revelation 12 sign (which has never happened before).  The more powerful signs of this day are the exact Jewish Feast Days (which are highly important to God), the 70 years since Israel became a nation (1947).  The Jewish new year, etc - this is a year like no other and I can&#39;t even begin to describe how significant this is.  Many people have spent years researching and studying the significance of September 23, 2017 - even before it started to be revealed last year by Scott Clark that there was this exact start alignment with the Virgo.  </p>

<p>If you are really searching for truth, and refuse to believe a cheap attempt to discredit this highly significant date, then I suggest you start here:</p>

<p>Even if nothing happens (nibiru), the signs are bad looking for the world. With the aggressive behavior of the eastern religion only, nasty things are going to happen in Europe. If you even connect the countries quitting de central banks... allot of people are loosing power and they will not go down without a fight.</p>

<p>Buckle up guys... a though ride awaits us..</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No,your long post is saying a specific date when it will occur,why else would you put all those words in a sentence?
When this date comes and goes,and it&#39;s a day like any other,what then?
Post another date?
It&#39;s not like anyone can sue you for posting an incorrect date right?
Imagine if the rapture were to occur and it hit you in the head like a bag of batteries,and you didn&#39;t have it listed among your other days that it were to occur.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>There are many things pointing to significance of this time period, I don&#39;t think the multitude of the many different things lining up is a coincidence, but if anything it will mark a beginning of events possibly, the events leading up to Armageddon are step by step and grow exponentially like birth paings until the actual war. Either way I don&#39;t place hope in a date since God can direct or delay anything he needs to until he&#39;s ready to begin.</p>

<p>Also, I do not think OP understands the meaning of the word &quot;knowledge&quot; because everything posted above is the exact opposite of that. This post might as well be about the impending Godzilla attack on Reno and why the predicted date of November 3rd may have been &quot;misinterpreted&quot;.</p>
