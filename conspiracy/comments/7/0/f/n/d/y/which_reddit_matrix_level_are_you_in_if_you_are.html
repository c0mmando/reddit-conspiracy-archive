      <p>
       So, the idea is that Reddit has layers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you do something a certain way, like the nature of your comments - you are detected and shifted to a different layer.
      </p>
      <p>
       Where you are in the layer determines who and how they interact with you.
      </p>
      <p>
       The default initial layer is the largest group, and is the testing group.
      </p>
      <p>
       The default layer contains all the smaller groups ( or layers ) - but the smaller groups do not contain the larger groups.  Think of an onion - the default layer would be the outside shell.  Each layer progressing towards the core becomes more focused and smaller.
      </p>
      <p>
       The default layer is askreddit-level interaction.  A general feeling-out and application of your future programming and interactive experience.
      </p>
      <p>
       Like a choose-your-own-adventure book - the choices you make direct you to different paths, and layers.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you are subversive to the narrative, then you are moved to one of the security layers.  It is a smaller layer in the onion because not everyone is on this layer.  What happens when you are here is that you are subject to fierce opposition in everything you do: censorship, and users who combat you and go against you in everything.
      </p>
      <p>
       There are several security layers, and the more severe the security layer you have progressed to - increases by correlation the amount of downvotes, post deletions, gangstalking and gaslighting you receive.
      </p>
      <p>
       Conversely, if you are a mindless drone - you are moved to one of the safer outer layers.  At first, it is subtle - but when you progress in the layers of this path - and the data control mechanism has enough information in your history to determine you are an agent of the narrative, then you are eventually moved the the core - which is where all of the admins, powermods, and narrative controllers reside.  The heart of the reddit matrix.  Other layers for this will present you with a user experience where you are suddenly experiencing more visibility, *and a pleasant experience in all facets, as you are promoting the narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you have passed through a certain layer, it is not possible to progress to certain other layers.  You must, like a failed game - start over.  The machine never forgets, nor does it forgive.
      </p>
      <p>
       But - this doesn't make sense because I can interact with anyone at any time all the same - I hear you ask.  The answer to this is that the users ( do you really think reddit itself doesn't reddit, they are the main players ) who you interact with - like a computer program, will interact with you differently based upon what layer you are currently in.  It's the design.
      </p>
      <p>
       So, it's not that certain things don't exist all the time - because of course it all does always - but that there is a programmed artificial web-matrix which is also contributed to and run by reddit themselves.  Your identity is tagged, and you are automatically with algorithms and key-word searches moved to different layers of the onion - this also happens manually with reddit themselves.  Reddit itself, defined as the very algorithms it runs and the reddit employees and their agents - then give you an experience based on your current and also projected future layer, as well as your past layers.
      </p>
      <p>
       Ever notice how some things change - one minute everything is fine, you are getting upvotes and it seems like reddit is filled with people, only for that to change to where it seems like a ghost-town, no activity - and you are only experiencing an interaction with a relatively select few people whose tenor is totally different - critical, or suddenly short comments as opposed to long comments, etc?  The reason is because you have moved layers - you have been matrix-shifted.
      </p>
      <p>
       The root of this onion, is AI - Artificial Intelligence.  This is the machine and behavioral algorithm "brain" tool for those in the core.
      </p>
      <p>
       This is possible because the vast majority of reddit is artificial, either artificial in terms of those very human users not being everyday joe-shmoe's that you would talk to at the bar - and artificial at the core of the onion via the gatekeepers in and to that layer - as well as the artificial AI and it's systematic identificaiton, sorting and learning mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
       I am Entertaining discussion on this fantastical idea, because why not - I know what layer I in am - do you?  And, do you see any truth in what I have said here?

       Here is an example of how you can become aware of shifting into a security layer:  Your comments are ghost-edited to include typographical and/or syntax errors.
      </p>
      <p>
       I specifically wrote "I know what layer I am in - do you?" which was changed to: "I know what layer I in am - do you?"
      </p>
      <p>
       This is a special tactic used against those in a specific security layer, effective because it frustrates specifically those who it is used against ( known antagonist ) - and is essentially unprovable, while it works to distract and discredit from what the user has written.
      </p>
      <p>
       When the user notices it - they are presented with a catch-22.  If they point it out - or if they don't - it's a lose/lose situation.

       I once had a comment of mine deleted with no trace - it simply disappeared. I know for a fact I had made it, and was somewhat happy of it because it destroyed mainstream historical belief in a concise and compelling way. I had come back days later to see if it had generated a discussion, only to find out it had vanished. I am 100% sure and positive of this, I know for sure which thread, and I parsed recent comment history to make sure.
      </p>
      <p>
       I also hypothesize the downvoting bots don't downvote into oblivion when the comment is reasonable and clear (but goes against mainstream dogma). They will "stabilize" it at 1, 0, or something slightly negative; indeed most people haven't activated the special option to see whenever a comment was "upvoted and downvoted by a large number of people" (a little cross appears next to the score).
      </p>
      <p>
       Quick question: how many people didn't know of this option?

       I am and have been aware of this.  Ironically, that merely adds evidence to my idea.  Checkmate TMOR layer.
      </p>
      <p>
       The post started to be downvoted immediately after it was linked.  I have been watching.  The thing is - I am teaching the AI - beating it at it's own game, and modifying it permanently in a way they can't uncode - even without being in core.  Ghost-editing is a two-way street.  I upvoted their post.  The more their layer sees it, the more they lose.
      </p>
      <p>
       Those who are actual humans in the vote, merely upvoted the top comment of "People are interesting".  Even the post title was relatively considerate and accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
       Then the artificial deep layers below TMOR became involved, in response to the threat which the TMOR post itself generated against itself.  Multi-threat security alert.  Once this was observed by the AI - then you see the creation of the artificial-agency of hateful comments and largely quoted sections filled with manual-core level attempts at an increased severity of defense-through-offense threat response.
      </p>
      <p>
       It won't work - what TMOR layer as a layer-agent of core is doing here.  Even with providing this very comment for them to work with - which is normally an increase for the TMOR layer.  In this unique case it works against them.  The only thing the AI can do is cut it's losses of exposure and retreat.  It realized that people found the post interesting - and that was having unintended consequences with narrative losses - which the primary function of AI is to maintain and increase the narrative.  The AI won't quit on this - because that is not how it is programmed, and it has no valid instructions to consider it's own strategum as something that is working against itself.  Programmer's arrogance.
      </p>
      <p>
       So even though the AI itself is now acting against it's primary function by enforcing it's primary function - the attack loop will only increase in severity.  This comment is informing core that this is the case - the AI will now receive another manual update in order to prevent self-destruction. This programming instruction set will have core maintenance busy for a long while - to try to code for that logic while retaining integrity of purpose in itself - no simple instruction but will require massive baseboard level recode.  The final product will be a weaker AI.  Their only other choice is a broken AI.  Catch-22 received and given back in kind.  A win for the humans.

       What do you think of these to comment replies I received the other day? The user deleted them and his account immediately after I noted all of his errors. This came after a long exchange where he was making sense, then suddenly he couldn't make proper sentences:
      </p>
      <blockquote>

        Go fuck around on a 9/11 thread and make yourself useful and spot spazzing on everytime Hillary Clinton opens your mouth because it discredits whatever actual point you need to make.

       <blockquote>
        <p>
         (Me)Maybe you should reread that before telling others they are having trouble making their point, lol. You seem a bit flustered.
        </p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>
        Lol you seem telling clowns to stop jerking themselves off over stupid shit isnt constructive? Obviously it is. This community is broken. Youre not actually doing anything use. I am because Im advocating you actually DO do something.

       So if we're both non-AI, doesn't this post mean we're in the same level since we can discuss this?

       If so, hi fellow leveler!  How much deeper can we go?

       I'm not convinced about the "reddit is A.I. system" part. Much more realistic would be the idea of entire office buildings of desperate city dwellers hired to shill for various causes.
