        <div class="card bg-dark mb-3"><div class="card-body md"><p>So, the idea is that Reddit has layers.  </p>

<p>If you do something a certain way, like the nature of your comments - you are detected and shifted to a different layer.</p>

<p>Where you are in the layer determines who and how they interact with you.</p>

<p>The default initial layer is the largest group, and is the testing group.</p>

<p>The default layer contains all the smaller groups ( or layers ) - but the smaller groups do not contain the larger groups.  Think of an onion - the default layer would be the outside shell.  Each layer progressing towards the core becomes more focused and smaller.</p>

<p>The default layer is askreddit-level interaction.  A general feeling-out and application of your future programming and interactive experience.</p>

<p>Like a choose-your-own-adventure book - the choices you make direct you to different paths, and layers.  </p>

<p>If you are subversive to the narrative, then you are moved to one of the security layers.  It is a smaller layer in the onion because not everyone is on this layer.  What happens when you are here is that you are subject to fierce opposition in everything you do: censorship, and users who combat you and go against you in everything.  </p>

<p>There are several security layers, and the more severe the security layer you have progressed to - increases by correlation the amount of downvotes, post deletions, gangstalking and gaslighting you receive.  </p>

<p>Conversely, if you are a mindless drone - you are moved to one of the safer outer layers.  At first, it is subtle - but when you progress in the layers of this path - and the data control mechanism has enough information in your history to determine you are an agent of the narrative, then you are eventually moved the the core - which is where all of the admins, powermods, and narrative controllers reside.  The heart of the reddit matrix.  Other layers for this will present you with a user experience where you are suddenly experiencing more visibility, *and a pleasant experience in all facets, as you are promoting the narrative.</p>

<p>If you have passed through a certain layer, it is not possible to progress to certain other layers.  You must, like a failed game - start over.  The machine never forgets, nor does it forgive.</p>

<p>But - this doesn&#39;t make sense because I can interact with anyone at any time all the same - I hear you ask.  The answer to this is that the users ( do you really think reddit itself doesn&#39;t reddit, they are the main players ) who you interact with - like a computer program, will interact with you differently based upon what layer you are currently in.  It&#39;s the design.  </p>

<p>So, it&#39;s not that certain things don&#39;t exist all the time - because of course it all does always - but that there is a programmed artificial web-matrix which is also contributed to and run by reddit themselves.  Your identity is tagged, and you are automatically with algorithms and key-word searches moved to different layers of the onion - this also happens manually with reddit themselves.  Reddit itself, defined as the very algorithms it runs and the reddit employees and their agents - then give you an experience based on your current and also projected future layer, as well as your past layers.  </p>

<p>Ever notice how some things change - one minute everything is fine, you are getting upvotes and it seems like reddit is filled with people, only for that to change to where it seems like a ghost-town, no activity - and you are only experiencing an interaction with a relatively select few people whose tenor is totally different - critical, or suddenly short comments as opposed to long comments, etc?  The reason is because you have moved layers - you have been matrix-shifted.</p>

<p>The root of this onion, is AI - Artificial Intelligence.  This is the machine and behavioral algorithm &quot;brain&quot; tool for those in the core.</p>

<p>This is possible because the vast majority of reddit is artificial, either artificial in terms of those very human users not being everyday joe-shmoe&#39;s that you would talk to at the bar - and artificial at the core of the onion via the gatekeepers in and to that layer - as well as the artificial AI and it&#39;s systematic identificaiton, sorting and learning mechanisms.</p>

<p>I am Entertaining discussion on this fantastical idea, because why not - I know what layer I in am - do you?  And, do you see any truth in what I have said here?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Here is an example of how you can become aware of shifting into a security layer:  Your comments are ghost-edited to include typographical and/or syntax errors.  </p>

<p>I specifically wrote &quot;I know what layer I am in - do you?&quot; which was changed to: &quot;I know what layer I in am - do you?&quot;</p>

<p>This is a special tactic used against those in a specific security layer, effective because it frustrates specifically those who it is used against ( known antagonist ) - and is essentially unprovable, while it works to distract and discredit from what the user has written.  </p>

<p>When the user notices it - they are presented with a catch-22.  If they point it out - or if they don&#39;t - it&#39;s a lose/lose situation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I once had a comment of mine deleted with no trace - it simply disappeared. I know for a fact I had made it, and was somewhat happy of it because it destroyed mainstream historical belief in a concise and compelling way. I had come back days later to see if it had generated a discussion, only to find out it had vanished. I am 100% sure and positive of this, I know for sure which thread, and I parsed recent comment history to make sure.</p>

<p>I also hypothesize the downvoting bots don&#39;t downvote into oblivion when the comment is reasonable and clear (but goes against mainstream dogma). They will &quot;stabilize&quot; it at 1, 0, or something slightly negative; indeed most people haven&#39;t activated the special option to see whenever a comment was &quot;upvoted and downvoted by a large number of people&quot; (a little cross appears next to the score).</p>

<p>Quick question: how many people didn&#39;t know of this option?</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I am and have been aware of this.  Ironically, that merely adds evidence to my idea.  Checkmate TMOR layer.  </p>

<p>The post started to be downvoted immediately after it was linked.  I have been watching.  The thing is - I am teaching the AI - beating it at it&#39;s own game, and modifying it permanently in a way they can&#39;t uncode - even without being in core.  Ghost-editing is a two-way street.  I upvoted their post.  The more their layer sees it, the more they lose. </p>

<p>Those who are actual humans in the vote, merely upvoted the top comment of &quot;People are interesting&quot;.  Even the post title was relatively considerate and accurate. </p>

<p>Then the artificial deep layers below TMOR became involved, in response to the threat which the TMOR post itself generated against itself.  Multi-threat security alert.  Once this was observed by the AI - then you see the creation of the artificial-agency of hateful comments and largely quoted sections filled with manual-core level attempts at an increased severity of defense-through-offense threat response.</p>

<p>It won&#39;t work - what TMOR layer as a layer-agent of core is doing here.  Even with providing this very comment for them to work with - which is normally an increase for the TMOR layer.  In this unique case it works against them.  The only thing the AI can do is cut it&#39;s losses of exposure and retreat.  It realized that people found the post interesting - and that was having unintended consequences with narrative losses - which the primary function of AI is to maintain and increase the narrative.  The AI won&#39;t quit on this - because that is not how it is programmed, and it has no valid instructions to consider it&#39;s own strategum as something that is working against itself.  Programmer&#39;s arrogance.  </p>

<p>So even though the AI itself is now acting against it&#39;s primary function by enforcing it&#39;s primary function - the attack loop will only increase in severity.  This comment is informing core that this is the case - the AI will now receive another manual update in order to prevent self-destruction. This programming instruction set will have core maintenance busy for a long while - to try to code for that logic while retaining integrity of purpose in itself - no simple instruction but will require massive baseboard level recode.  The final product will be a weaker AI.  Their only other choice is a broken AI.  Catch-22 received and given back in kind.  A win for the humans.  </p>
