<p>1) Many are claiming this post is too simple. I agree it is, but the reason I wrote it is for the discussion it could create. Not everything is super complex. Also this is only part 1. I definitely could not fit all thoughts in.</p>

<p>2) Many are annoyed I related this to spiritual concepts. You don&#39;t have to agree with my thoughts. Just disagree respectfully. Also, this is a conspiracy forum!</p>

<p>3) I wrote this last night when I was tired, and there is so much more to explore. I definitely missed much!!</p>

<p>Edit 2: This post was linked to tmor.</p>

<p><strong>The Conspiracy of Music</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>When I first heard Nirvana in 8th grade, my life changed forever. Finally, I felt as though somebody could relate to what I was feeling. Later, I felt the same when I heard “Paranoid Android” by Radiohead. I didn’t know music could break out of the typical formula.</p>

<p>Music has greatly influenced my life, as I’m sure it has influenced yours. Further, I would not be surprised if many “conspiracy theorists” are musicians because of their tendency to “think out of the box.” I’m sure they are left-handed, too 😊</p>

<p>I admit that I always enjoyed the more depressing spectrum of music, with a grunge/indie mix. Today, I was taking my normal walk, and I formed an interesting connection. In Nirvana’s “Lithium” he says, “I’m so lonely – that’s ok I shaved my head.” It reminded me of Britney Spears, and when she shaved her heard. Here is my “hair and spirituality” post if interested: </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6r1zv2/hair_and_spirituality_is_there_a_connection_this/?utm_term=aed95214-f8eb-43b0-af12-01c051f10848&amp;amp;utm_medium=search&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy&amp;amp;utm_content=2">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/6r1zv2/hair_and_spirituality_is_there_a_connection_this/?utm_term=aed95214-f8eb-43b0-af12-01c051f10848&amp;amp;utm_medium=search&amp;amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_name=conspiracy&amp;amp;utm_content=2</a></p>

<p>At that point, I realized that I had never really written about music, but it has such a profound effect on people.  I mean, I&#39;ve written about celebrities, hair, and movies, but never music. </p>

<p>I love music, and I even view music as a form of Godliness at times (to me, it comes from God), so this post is not a criticism of music. Rather, it is a deeper look into how music can possibly control and influence us, and moreover, I have to always ask, is there something deeper? Further, this post is more about popular music that is promoted, not necessarily other forms of music that do not always fall into the popular spectrum. </p>

<p><strong>Modes of Music</strong></p>

<p>There are many directions this post can go (like people selling their souls to the devil and stuff). Rather, I want to talk about something that captivated me a few weeks ago. I saw this video on the different “modes” of music:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=415LVvnQ6yM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=415LVvnQ6yM</a></p>

<p>Each mode creates a different feeling. </p>

<p>The Greek modes were:</p>

<p>• Ionian
• Dorian and Hypodorian
• Phrygian and Hypophrygian
• Lydian, Hypolydian
• Mixolydian
• Aeolian
• Locrian</p>

<p>“Plato believed that playing music in a particular mode would incline one towards specific behavior associated with that mode, and suggested that soldiers should listen to music in Dorian or Phrygian modes to help make them stronger, but avoid music in Lydian, Mixed Lydian or Ionian modes, for fear of being softened. Plato believed that a change in the musical modes of the state would cause a wide-scale social revolution.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Musical_mode">http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Musical_mode</a></p>

<p>Pythagoras said, “There is geometry in the humming of the strings.”</p>

<p>The point is that each mode of music creates a different effect on the specific audience. I am going to summarize from the video:</p>

<p>*Lydian Mode (Major Key): It is associated with the morning. It is very upbeat. Examples include:</p>

<pre><code>“Dreams”  by Fleetwood Mac
“Here Comes My Girl” by  Tom Petty
“Tonight, Tonight”  by Smashing Pumpkins
</code></pre>

<p>*Ionian Mode (Major Key – C Scale): It is associated with harmony and daylight. Examples include:</p>

<pre><code>“Ode to Joy” by Beethoven
“Let It Be” by the Beatles
“Brown Eyed Girl” by Van Morrison
“Beast of Burden&quot; by the Rolling Stones
</code></pre>

<p>Interestingly, counter-culture revived other modes. Why were these modes brought out at a particular time?</p>

<p>*Mixolydian Mode (Dionysus…God of wine…Mode – Major Key): Produces ecstasy in listeners. Examples include:</p>

<pre><code>“LA Woman” by the Doors
“Norwegian Wood” by the Beatles
Jerry Garcia’s Signature Mode (Dark Star)
“Here Comes Your Man” by the Pixies”
“No Rain” by Blind Melon
</code></pre>

<p>*Dorian Mode (Minor Key) – Haunting, Associated with evening and Saturn. Examples include:</p>

<pre><code>“The End” by the Doors
“Another Brick in the Wall” by Pink Floyd
“Wicked Game” by Chris Isaac
“Mad World” by Gary Jules 
</code></pre>

<p>*Aeolian Mode – Soothing. Associated with Midnight and Moon. Examples include:</p>

<pre><code>“Stairway to Heaven” by Led Zeppelin
“Losing my Religion&quot; by REM
“Nothing Else Matters” by Metallica
</code></pre>

<p>*Phrygian Mode – The darkest mode. It is sensual, sad, lamenting. It raises passion and sexual energy. Examples include:</p>

<pre><code>*Pyramid Song” by Radiohead
“Surfer Girl” by Beach Boys
“Hoodoo” by Muse
</code></pre>

<p>*Locrian Mode – Dissonant. This is very rarely used in an entire piece. It is associated with twilight. This is thought to be “of the devil” and “said to be used to create portals.” This is the devil’s mode, so to speak: Examples include:</p>

<pre><code>“Enter Sandman” by Metallica
</code></pre>

<p>It is important to note that the major scales of music are almost always used in churches, and the other modes of music were discouraged or considered “devilish.”  So, why did they see a resurgence in the 1900s? Also, did you see the progression from of music from lighter to darker?</p>

<p>Much of my information was taken from that video listed earlier, and I am in no way qualified to comment on everything about music. However, I feel these basic points lead us to some interesting conclusions, which I will get to later.</p>

<p><strong>Genres of Music</strong></p>

<p>The modes are interesting enough, but I wanted to look more closely at genres, and I wanted to focus on pop genres and what they promote.</p>

<p>Pop music in general is kind of a joke. First of all, pop music really does sound all the same:</p>

<p><a href="https://mic.com/articles/107896/scientists-finally-prove-why-pop-music-all-sounds-the-same">https://mic.com/articles/107896/scientists-finally-prove-why-pop-music-all-sounds-the-same</a></p>

<p>And yes, it’s all about sex:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/92-top-ten-billboard-songs-are-about-sex/337242/">https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2011/09/92-top-ten-billboard-songs-are-about-sex/337242/</a></p>

<p>But, I’m going to go beyond just basic pop music. What about the other modes of popular music that “feel” different?</p>

<p>*Grunge: Grunge is probably my favorite type of pop music, but unfortunately, it seems to be all about nihilism. Though grunge seems to have some essence of truth, most songs are about the fact that nothing really matters. Not to mention, most grunge music is associated with drugs of some sort. Since I was such a big grunge fan, I want to focus on Nirvana. While Kurt Cobain says, “I’m not like them,” he seems to proclaim that drugs are the solution. His heart is broke, but he has some glue:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peclQi67KS8&amp;amp;list=PLF1D793B61571DD4A&amp;amp;index=17">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peclQi67KS8&amp;amp;list=PLF1D793B61571DD4A&amp;amp;index=17</a></p>

<p>In other words, nihilism is solved by drugs if you’re a grunge lover. 😊 Let’s not forgive there is an entire other conspiracy about how he was murdered…(maybe another post later).</p>

<p>*Rap/HipHop: It seems that rap had its origins in social/political change, but I do not think that is the purpose anymore. In fact, there is a whole conspiracy about this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hiphopisread.com/2012/04/secret-meeting-that-changed-rap-music.html">http://www.hiphopisread.com/2012/04/secret-meeting-that-changed-rap-music.html</a></p>

<p>Believe what you will, but rap changed from “let’s change the world” to “drugs, sex, and gangs” within 10-20 years or so. By the way, I’m sure you have heard the conspiracies about Kayne West, right? Anyway, this video is strange enough:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7FCgw_GlWc&amp;amp;has_verified=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p7FCgw_GlWc&amp;amp;has_verified=1</a></p>

<p>The point is that rap/hiphop was originally something much different than it is today. What happened to music that promoted “change”?  You do not see artists like Tupac anymore. My students always like this one:</p>

<p>“Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature&#39;s laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but, by keepin its dreams
it, learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
when no one else even cared
No one else even cared..
The rose that grew from concrete”</p>

<p>*Folk Music: Believe it or not, folk music has kind of made a comeback, and it seems to be promoting aliens:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDthllX0BPI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDthllX0BPI</a></p>

<p>I really do like that song though. By the way, I can make a whole other post about this…</p>

<p>*Rock (in general) will always be popular, and interestingly, grunge is making a comeback. “Little One” also tells you nothing really matters:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRa0WPn7y8I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRa0WPn7y8I</a></p>

<p>Lyrics include:</p>

<p>“It&#39;s raining, it&#39;s sunny
It doesn&#39;t make a difference
I don&#39;t care about anything at all
It&#39;s raining, it&#39;s sunny
It doesn&#39;t make a difference
I don&#39;t care about anything at all.”</p>

<p>By the way, I’ve written much about the recent promotion of nihilism, if interested.</p>

<p>*Country  is kind of a joke these days, and nothing like Hank Williams probably would have liked, and this one is hard for me. Country today is just like pop with a little bit of twang. I guess Taylor Swift is country?:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw&amp;amp;list=PLv30jT9MW5cCWW0Vi5OhPGfs6YxHHAhqg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuNIsY6JdUw&amp;amp;list=PLv30jT9MW5cCWW0Vi5OhPGfs6YxHHAhqg</a></p>

<p>I really just do not have much more to say about it. </p>

<p>*Pop in General is just atrocious. I cannot tell you how many songs I have found that are scary. </p>

<p>*“BB Talk” by Miley Cyrus is scary as hell:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfwJA0f0UTg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfwJA0f0UTg</a></p>

<p>*Don’t forget you should die young:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOubzHCUt48">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOubzHCUt48</a></p>

<p>*And Tayor Swift’s new song is also weird as hell:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmd-ClpJxA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmd-ClpJxA</a></p>

<p>The point is that the messages in these song are strange. None of these songs are ever promoting anything spiritual or Godly. Rather, they promote nihilism, self, sex, violence, and many &quot;ungodly&quot; things. When anything can sell, and I mean anything, why is what is promoted is always more degrading than ever?</p>

<p>I clearly cannot include every pop artist in here, but think Eminem, Rihanna, or Beyonce. They all seem to have a very specific agenda…</p>

<p><strong>Does Music <em>Really</em> Influence Us?</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, many will say that it does not really matter. I mean, it’s just music, right? I used to think the same way, but now I feel quite differently.</p>

<p>Music does influence our emotions:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-listening-to-music-lifts-or-reinforces-mood-051713">http://www.healthline.com/health-news/mental-listening-to-music-lifts-or-reinforces-mood-051713</a></p>

<p>Music can alter your child’s brain:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=music+influences+children+stuides&amp;amp;oq=music+influences+children+stuides&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...1449.2175.0.2250.8.8.0.0.0.0.176.563.1j3.4.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..4.0.0.SYN6B8E9a_U">https://www.google.com/search?q=music+influences+children+stuides&amp;amp;oq=music+influences+children+stuides&amp;amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...1449.2175.0.2250.8.8.0.0.0.0.176.563.1j3.4.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..4.0.0.SYN6B8E9a_U</a></p>

<p>Music and advertising work together:</p>

<p><a href="https://musicbusinessresearch.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ijmbr_april_2012_pinie_wang2.pdf">https://musicbusinessresearch.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/ijmbr_april_2012_pinie_wang2.pdf</a></p>

<p>There is no doubt that music has a great influence on us and our emotions, but could there be a larger conspiracy? Could <em>they</em> really be using music to affect us on a different level?</p>

<p>Well, I mean if you want to ignore the cultural impact of music in general, there are many studies on how music can impact depression:</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.frontiersin.org/2017/05/30/frontiers-in-psychology-how-listening-to-music-in-a-group-influences-depression/">https://blog.frontiersin.org/2017/05/30/frontiers-in-psychology-how-listening-to-music-in-a-group-influences-depression/</a></p>

<p>I mean, I am not sure this is even an argument. Music influences us, and I believe, “they” can make it influence in certain ways.</p>

<p>Do you remember when Eminem came out and it was so controversial? At the time, I would have never believed that music could have such an impact on me. Now, I think differently. These popular songs may send messages into our minds that come out years later.</p>

<p><strong>Pop Music is Controlled</strong></p>

<p>Even if you disregard most of this post, there is no denying that pop music is completely controlled, and you have to ask yourself <em>why</em>?!</p>

<p>Creative expression is no longer allowed in popular music. Many artists have sued over creative freedom, and unfortunately they usually lose.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that <em>they</em> control what is popular, and they control what messages are being sent to our youth.</p>

<p>Is it no surprise that we can literally be mind-controlled by rhythmic sound?</p>

<p><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-power-of-music-mind-control-by-rhythmic-sound/">https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-power-of-music-mind-control-by-rhythmic-sound/</a></p>

<p>This article states, “This finding extends the well-known power of music to tap into brain circuits controlling emotion and movement, to actually control the brain circuitry of sensory perception. This discovery helps explain how drums unite tribes in ceremony, why armies march to bugle and drum into battle, why worship and ceremonies are infused by song, why speech is rhythmic, punctuated by rhythms of emphasis on particular syllables and words, and perhaps why we dance.”</p>

<p>Music is powerful.</p>

<p><strong>The Deeper Conspiracy</strong></p>

<p>This is a conspiracy forum, so do not get annoyed if I bring up Satan and God. Prior to his fall, Satan (Lucifer) was a musician (and I suppose he still is):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.compellingtruth.org/Satan-music.html">https://www.compellingtruth.org/Satan-music.html</a></p>

<p>This article states, &quot;Now, when Satan fell in rebellion against God, he did not lose the natural abilities that God had given him. Therefore, he kept the tabrets and the pipes. But now, he did not use them to bring glory to the Lord but to turn God&#39;s creatures against their Creator. His expertise is seen in the powerful influence he welds today in music. He knows his music and he hates the Lord. This is a dangerous combination.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.learnthebible.org/satan-the-musician.html">http://www.learnthebible.org/satan-the-musician.html</a></p>

<p>Of course, you don’t have to believe it!</p>

<p>What if Lucifer is the ultimate musician and he is influencing you?</p>

<p>After all, Bob Dylan admits he sold his soul (not kidding):</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YiqZvM1Pyo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YiqZvM1Pyo</a></p>

<p>Any many, many musicians have said the same thing.</p>

<p>Are they all just messing with us, or is there something more powerful here?</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>We laugh at those from the 50s or so who said that modern music was of the devil, but were their views too far-fetched?</p>

<p>As Bob Marley said, “One good thing about music, when it hits you, you feel no pain.” Perhaps that is the point of it all?</p>

<p>Perhaps music takes us into another world, temporarily, away from the pain we may feel, but that does not mean it heals it.</p>

<p>Anyway, music does have the power to heal, but I feel that lately, that music is used to do something much more sinister. It is used to keep us at a spiritually lower level.</p>

<p>Before you laugh or mock this post, look at pop music today. Is it doing anything to make this world a better place, or ultimately, is it used to lower our youth?</p>

<p>I don’t even think I need proof of this at this point.</p>

<p>As always, it takes me a while to write these posts, so instead of downvoting, let&#39;s discuss.</p>

<p>Also, it would be impossible to include all conspiracies about music here. This is just beginning post. Part 1. Part 2 coming soon.</p>

<p>Edit: Seriously there is so much I didn&#39;t cover. Just know I will go into more later!!</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Awesome write-up.  Thanks.  Science and music is inherently linked.</p>

<p>Check out this book for a great read on the subject: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Your_Brain_on_Music">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_Your_Brain_on_Music</a></p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>He is a master musician, as created by God-The-Father; gotta give credit where it&#39;s due. That being said, not as great as God-the-Father, who created music - the frequencies of existence prove that God-the-Father is the ultimate musician/scientist.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you haven&#39;t, check out EDM (electronic dance music).  Not the mainstream EDM out there, which isn&#39;t bad per se, but the underground music is where it&#39;s at.  Check out this remix of &quot;My love is your love&quot; (13 minutes long!): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZgyVPV04e8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZgyVPV04e8</a></p>

<p>Check out: Jonathan Peters, Paul Van Dyk, Carl Cox, Paul Oakenfold, Pete Tong, Timo Maas.  </p>

<p>Just remember to attribute the sounds to God-The-Father.</p>

<p>God bless.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I certainly agree that religions are almost entirely corrupted to serve as a structure of control.</p>

<p>Why do you think there is no proof of God? I mean, it used to be obvious to me that God was just a fairy tale, but that idea itself is part of the counter-conspiracy in my view. Ever since... waking up (for lack of a better word), I can&#39;t help but feel the profound delusion in that statement, as the proof of God is literally in every single thing in existence in and around us.</p>

<p>I quite like the way around greatest scientists viewed God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with senses, reason and intellect has intended us to forego their use and by some other means to give us knowledge which we can attain by them. He would not require us to deny sense and reason in physical matters which are set before our eyes and minds by direct experience or necessary demonstrations.” – Galileo Galilei</em></p>

<p><em>“Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual.” –Carl Sagan</em></p>

<p><em>&quot;I believe in Spinoza&#39;s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings.&quot; – Albert Einstein</em></p>

<p><em>“The first gulp from the glass of natural sciences will turn you into an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.” – Werner Heisenberg</em></p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s ridiculous. Quotes mean many things. They&#39;re subjective, sure, but they can still express valid viewpoints. Disagree with them, that&#39;s fine, but they&#39;re not bullshit just because you don&#39;t follow their meaning.</p>

<p>The first question you should be asking is what is God. It obviously isn&#39;t a bearded man in the clouds judging our sexual proclivities. So what&#39;s left, if we remove the religious dogma from the idea. To my mind, God is the ultimate creative force we see throughout the Universe. God is the metaphysical set of rules that allows everything from the stars to us to exist. There&#39;s a trajectory or path that is aligned with God, meaning someone who walks that path contributes actively to &quot;his&quot; creation, or rather just creation should the personification of a set of metaphysical rules not sit right with you.</p>

<p>It would obviously require writing a book or a thousand to satisfy such a question, but if you do wanna get a better explanation of where I&#39;m coming from, I&#39;d recommend watching some of Jordan Peterson&#39;s lectures. He explains my beliefs better than I ever could, including how and why God is a real aspect of life, and believing in God (Goodness, Karma in a sense) can reveal surprising benefits in mental health and in life in general.</p>

<p>Obviously none of that will be proof to you, as it&#39;s a truth that, by its very nature, cannot be taught, but can be experienced. Meditate for long enough or use the right psychedelics and you can even talk to &quot;the man&quot;.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I suppose it depends what you mean by religion. Organized religion is retarded 99% of the time, sure. But I consider myself religious in that I like reading the parables wise people have written during humanity&#39;s time on earth because it makes me a happier and more effective person.</p>

<p>I used to be pretty atheistic, but also quite depressed honestly. Nowadays I&#39;ve realized, without the original force that spawned all other forces I am nothing. There are laws on this planet of ours that we can&#39;t ever change or avoid but only hope to use to our advantage. That&#39;s what religion and metaphysics seeks to describe, and I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with that, albeit any dogmatism.</p>

<p>We must take the time to understand these laws, temporarily avoiding instant-gratifications, to advance our living conditions in the long-term. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why does it surprise you that almost all underground/punk bands lean left? It makes total sense from a sociocultural/socioeconomic perspective: </p>

<p>Mainstream capitalistic markets legitimize cultural output on a basis of economic success, while producers within the domain of artistic creation valuate their output based on symbolic capital from other members of the community, often as a direct systematic inversion of the values of mainstream economic hierarchies, i.e., works created in the restricted field of cultural production become authenticated through recognition of peers, rather than profit - &quot;the producers produce for other producers&quot; while works produced for mass markets are &quot;symbolically excluded and discredited&quot; (I&#39;m quoting Bourdieu) </p>

<p>The dominant economic market is capitalist in nature, therefore, the underground subcultures that emerge will predominantly do so as a reaction to and in opposition to what they feel is a restrictive method of production and avenue towards distribution, dependent on external, institutionally consecrated structures rather than self-determination. As a result, they will inherently be opposed to the dominant field of power, which is the capitalist market, and therefore be on the left side of the political spectrum. This is opposed to far-right &quot;underground&quot; bands which are only underground because of the taboo of their rhetoric, e.g., racism, white supremacy, etc.</p>

<p>That pizzagate shit can fuck right off though, you trying to act like you used to listen to punk but never been to a diy venue? Art people are weird fucks but they aren&#39;t all global pedophile ringleaders... Jesus Christ, I stopped entertaining that shit when you idiots started harassing Low Life on youtube, take the blinders off </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Well thought out and written. I have seen this as well, the degradation of musical talent has been sad to watch, there have been bands I&#39;ve watched go from &quot;free your mind&quot; to that typical pop recipe B.S. Both instrumentally and lyrically. It seems if you sing about anything worth singing about - chances are you&#39;re not that popular. It&#39;s like a self feeding loop. Well known/popular -&gt; more listeners -&gt; more popularity -&gt; more listeners due to self image or associating the type of music with an identity. If there&#39;s any message at all at this point, it&#39;s lost. </p>

<p>Music should be about expression of a souls experience, whether through the instrument or through the lyrics (but both is best :) ) not formulaic garbage. It helps people understand, especially if you have experience to share, solutions, love, etc. While in itself, it has no essence. They&#39;re just sounds and rhythms that stimulate us a certain way. It&#39;s what you do with it that matters. </p>

He sits upon his ebon throne,
Within his halls of darkness,

Are the foundations of all the worlds,
Ever calculating in sound the structure of space and time,
Were his flute ever to suddenly fall silent,
All the spheres would shatter into one another,
And the myriads of worlds,

The flute of the blind idiot,
Both makes and unmakes the worlds in ceaseless combinations,
Spinning on the woven carpet of time...

<p>There&#39;s some metal bands that explicitly promote a satanic vibe with their music, but they don&#39;t represent all bands or subgenres in metal. In my opinion, there are many bands out there who&#39;s works seem to convey this &quot;reaching for light from darkness&quot; feeling, and urgent, solemn reminders that we have fallen lower than our purpose as humans.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll be on the lookout for the metal post. This subject is close to my heart.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Good post.  But no mention of Bach?  His baroque music is proven to induce and increase alpha brainwaves, which has many beneficial physiological effects.  Some on that <a href="http://www.anxaid.com/baroque_music.html">here</a>, section 3.  Bach will always be the best classical composer - superior even to Mozart, due to the baroque nature and the feeling it creates in the listener.  </p>

<p>I am sure you can search out Bach on your own or are already well aware of Bach.  So here is something, not baroque, you might not have heard from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnossiennes">Gnossiennes</a> which is also unique and worthy of inclusion.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>That&#39;s cool, now I have Bach&#39;s birthday memorized, March 21st, and know that he is an Aries.  </p>

<p>For some Bach trivia - most people don&#39;t know that the piano was not invented yet when Bach composed.  Yet many play his pieces on the piano because it sounds nice.  The Harpsichord is such a uniquely beautiful instrument.</p>

<p>Since we are on the subject, have you ever listened to Holst?  In particular, the planets?  One song for each of the planets the knew of at the time - Mars, Venus, etc - and reflects their unique characterstics. <a href="https://youtu.be/Isic2Z2e2xs">Holst</a>.  Also, of course one might need to be in a certain place of mind to listen to what I am about to link, but I think it is one of my favourite pieces of all time, masterpiece: <a href="https://youtu.be/WA-tUfeaAgU">The Hymn of Jesus</a> - also Choral pieces like The Cloud Messenger.</p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/SgXlUxDGFvU">Here</a> is something totally different, for variety in your musical palette.  Strong female lead, can growl with the best of them.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Wonderful post. While unrelated to modes and genres yet still a conspiracy, there was a standardization of pitch shift from A being at 432hz to what it is today at 440hz. The standardization occurred in the 1930s and 40s and while I&#39;m not really sure where I stand on the subject as there are reasons why the shift was reasonable for orchestra tuning, it&#39;s something that I question. Some say it was meant to detune music overall to subdue the masses and cause anxiety at a subconscious level. The problem I have with this idea is that music can sound beautiful in the current tuning we are used to. Like I said I&#39;m not really sure where I stand on the subject but it&#39;s interesting to look into.</p>

<p>By something becoming &quot;pop&quot; you mean becoming mainstream? </p>

<p>I&#39;d even say the vast majority of metal bands aren&#39;t &quot;satanic&quot; at all. Sure, death and destruction can be a common theme in metal but I don&#39;t think that inherently makes it satanic. </p>

<p>Even the music made for Metalocalypse is pretty middle of the road, relatively mainstream when it comes to metal. </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Great Great Post.  I&#39;m always thinking about this sort of stuff and the information about the modes of music was solid.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve always been a music lover and a conspiracy theorist.   </p>

<p>Fresh out of high school I took a radio &amp; television course, looking at some software the radio DJ&#39;s use ...  everything of course is on computer, the music, the commercials..  the music had a Beats Per Minute (BPM) number beside every track.  I asked the instructor why, and he replied quite vaguely that those numbers are used to help program the music,. When asked how and why a BPM number factors into programming songs he couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t answer.  He was a former program director at a local station.<br/>
We had learned how the music is &#39;randomly&#39; chosen by software.. songs are placed in various categories by a program director (a: new releases, B: hit records, c: classics,  whatever is chosen) and then it&#39;s decided that maybe the station wants to play its music like ... 3 a&#39;s - 2 b&#39;s and 1 c category song every hour-  then the software will auto fill these slots while making sure the same songs or bands are not played to close together..  easy-  but learning that BPM was involved on a deep level made me think of hypnosis for some reason.  </p>

<p>Another great angle to consider is The Laurel Canyon scene of the 60s.<br/>
Did the government create the hippie counter culture movement?  Is it odd that pretty much all of the artists involved had high level military career families?  Did Jim Morrison&#39;s father help start the Vietnam War?  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>I have just finished university for music production and this kind of research has been playing on my brain for a while.</p>

<p>After a while I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that a wide bracket of musicians are connected to the spiritual world and this is because music is measured on a frequency the same as every single living thing. The way people talk about UFO&#39;s and their propulsion methods is where you see the term frequency thrown around a lot.</p>

<p>Pharrell Williams on the Future song Move That Dope:</p>

<p>&quot;Frequency high, like a space ship&quot;</p>

<p>Pharrell literally has a song called Happy where the chorus is:</p>

<p>&quot;Come along if you feel like a room without a roof, come along if you feel like happiness is a truth&quot; </p>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/39RgDu4Yph0">Pharrell and Kirk talk about religion</a> </p>

<p>This is also a great video boot Pharrell saying if everyone read the bible and replaced God with Universe everyone would understand the bible a lot more.</p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna do a full post on what I&#39;ve found but between Pharrell, Tom Delonge, Tyler the Creator, The Carpenters, John Lennon, George Harrison, Lemmy, ELO, Robbie Williams there is enough information to keep you busy for a long time.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Another excellent thread. I rarely post, but just wanted to let you know that I always look forward to your contributions. And, like you, my life changed when I first heard Nirvana. I was in the ninth grade. Cobain remains a hero, I have 150+ Nirvana concerts recorded, and I&#39;ve done extensive research into his murder (for radio show appearances and a book). So I love Nirvana and Cobain and everything about Grunge and early 90s music. </p>

<p>But... even I have to admit it was a manufactured movement for precisely the points you made: to push nihilism and that nothing mattered, basically convincing a generation to lose faith. There&#39;s a reason Nirvana broke through. There&#39;s a reason they were signed and pushed by Geffen. And there&#39;s a reason why Cobain died when he pulled out of Lollapalooza and wanted to go his own way. </p>

<p>Anyway, thanks again for your effort. Much appreciated.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I was wondering if there were people like me who started seeing the truth though music - not realizing it wasn&#39;t the extent of the truth.</p>

<p>Cobain was right on many levels. Life is somewhat meaningless. But he wasn&#39;t completely right.</p>

<p>Yes there is an emptiness and meaninglessness....but it isn&#39;t the ultimate truth.</p>

<p>Btw favorite nirvana song? I like drain you and where did you sleep last night...and so many more</p>

    <div class="md"><p>If you need any proof about the music conspiracy, read up on what our government did to John Lennon. Notice there are no politically active music stars since Lennon. They nipped that in the bud. Or consider Kanye West. The moment he went off script and started speaking truth and challenging power, he got locked away and reprogrammed. And to understand the true scope of societal engineering, research Theodor Adorno, the Tavistock Institute, and the Beatles. All roads lead to Tavistock. </p>

<p>But I don&#39;t want to make it sound like Cobain and Nirvana were some engineered, manufactured pop act like Katy Perry or Miley Cyrus. Cobain was 100 percent genuine and authentic in who he was, and he represented a generation of lost, disillusioned teenagers. He was legit. But the Powers That Be have a way of taking those genuine movements and manipulating them for their gain. </p>

<p>And keep in mind, Cobain was just 27 when he died. He was still finding his way. He grew up without a dad and got into drugs due to chronic stomach pain. Being in pain every day can affect one&#39;s perspective. However, if you listen to the concerts, he was a new man during the In Utero tour. Very happy, positive, optimistic. Talking to the audience, joking between songs. The stomach condition was finally diagnosed correctly as a pinched nerve in his spine. He loved his daughter. He was divorcing Courtney. He was in a good place. And we know what happened next. Had he lived, I think you would have seen his music express his new outlook on life. And he intended to quit the band and do solo stuff.</p>

<p>My favorite Nirvana song tends to change often, but I usually go with &quot;Lounge Act,&quot; &quot;Verse Chorus Verse,&quot; or &quot;You Know You&#39;re Right&quot; (which is about divorcing Courtney). </p>

<p>I also love &quot;Drain You,&quot; and my favorite performance of it was from that French TV show in 94. Kurt broke his guitar strings and just sang the rest of the way. But he lets out the best scream of his career...</p>

<p>Same idea. Religious zealots all over the world have followed the idea that music (and especially social music) somehow misleads man from the path of god and/or is some jewish tradition.

<p>First of all I&#39;m mostly talking about pop music. Music in general is amazing. Music can be exploited. Even if it isn&#39;t spiritually related, I have no doubt pop music is used to exploit youth...or else why would 90% of it be about sex?</p>

<p>There are studies that even the color of the room can influence us. I mean I think that many people dismiss the fact that there are many many things our brains process unconsciously. It&#39;s just good to be aware. It doesn&#39;t mean if you listen to one song that demons will enter your body or something. It&#39;s just good to be aware.</p>

<p>Or maybe because pubescent teenagers usually think mostly about sex? AND (coming back to my counterrevolution idea) because political topics, idealism and emancipation got really unpopular with todays youth.</p>

<p>50 years back the youth pushed against a reactionary and nationalistic society - A youth which reached many of their goals but lost their idealsm on the way. This movement had their folk songs, had their protest. The occupy movement for example had to rely for half a century old protest songs before at least a few songs came out. </p>

<p>If anything the spirit and idealism of the 60ties was ground down by half a century of real-politic and no reason to fight. </p>

<p>My point is that you can hardly control what affects you ;) 
We humans in general (and <a href="/r/conspiracy">/r/conspiracy</a> so much more) deal really badly with the idea that no one is in control. That we can&#39;t even control how we feel. </p>

<p>Yeah, there are heaps of studies and tricks on how to influence people - we see it in advertisments, we see it in shops, we see it in daily behavior. We might catch some of it, and if it happens on a greater scale we can be pretty aware of it but we are never unbiased. We are always influenced.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Modern musicianship is in a sad sad state.. It&#39;s more just music.. assembly, not creation. I have so many friends who say they&#39;re musicians and produce like dubstep/techno, which can be great, don&#39;t get me wrong, but there&#39;s this type of person who collects other people&#39;s ideas that are similar and then just smash them together like &quot;I made this&quot;. lol Songs take people on a journey, they have a beginning middle and end, and a story to tell. So much of music these days is just &quot;that sounds neat&quot; with little variation, no depth, and 0 meaning.. And, the gems are out there still, but they never &quot;make it&quot; like a Miley Cyrus does. It made me <em>so happy</em> to hear Julia Michaels &quot;Issues&quot;, because she is one of the gem crafters behind Miley and Selena Gomez and the other (I assume) MK ultra victims. </p>

<p>Modes are where it&#39;s at, but it&#39;s so hard to understand them in a way that&#39;s not just &quot;it&#39;s like you play a regular scale, but you start on a different note&quot;. Pythagoras was a genius, man. Did you know that the ratios of the intervals in the major scale match up weirdly with the orbital resonance of a few planets and their moons? It&#39;s as if the Ionian were encoded into the universe itself. C Dorian is by far my favorite mode to play in, so I dunno what that says about me, but I just like the sorrowful feels. You love Mad World, so I think you get it. </p>

<p>I honestly think that the world is too frantic, connected, and judgmental to produce musicians like we used to, not to mention that it&#39;s left out of curriculums entirely in many places. My own dad was a band director, but all I ever learned was to play a single line of music as a part of a group, never really touching on the theory of composition, and when I learned it on my own, I realized that wtf my dad didn&#39;t even know much about it... He was a music historian and saxophonist primarily, so I guess it just wasn&#39;t that important, but it&#39;s just sad that all this amazing stuff you&#39;re talking about, the Music of the Spheres itself, is kind of fluffed over. </p>

<p>I also imagine how it would have effected me to have posted my early stuff online (am 29 and learned to play my first polyphonic instrument at about 14, so self-publishing was a thing back then, but not like it is today where there is a seeming need to document everything and make it public), what people would have said to have heard it, and.. I think I&#39;d have given up. I look at the nasty things that people say to beginning songwriters online, and I couldn&#39;t have kept going, but the shit is, some of those kids have potential, they just need to believe in themselves. That&#39;s why I tell some of my students to play in old folks&#39; homes. Everyone needs a grandma to hear them for their potential, not a society judging them by all the greats at once.</p>

<p>And, I completely agree that music is controlled and used to damage society. Most musicians I know want to write of beauty and love, not nihilism and defeat</p>

<p>To end this ramble, I think we have very similar tastes in music, so here are gifts!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-DP5ohD0Nw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-DP5ohD0Nw</a> &lt;--- Jp Cooper. Super deep heart, amazing vocals, heartfelt lyrics that aren&#39;t messed up. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyYQQR_RGr8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nyYQQR_RGr8</a> &lt;--- Keaton Henson. So sorrowful. He and I share a soul, I swear. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG5P0U0_3-8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jG5P0U0_3-8</a> &lt;--- Alexandra Savior. Kind of edgy and mean, because she&#39;s not (((the one))) writing her songs, but her voice and self are still pure af.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg5AZIk0BAs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dg5AZIk0BAs</a> &lt;--- Just a couple of good girls doing covers from love. That one is like a Euro-Gypsy interpretation of Tom Waits&#39; Green Grass.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3z8_ARyc_Y">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3z8_ARyc_Y</a> &lt;---- Koprualti. Amazing group, if you like feely slow jazz. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8AWFf7EAc4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8AWFf7EAc4</a> &lt;---- Jeff Buckley&#39;s cover of Hallelujah before he killed himself. Was too good for this world. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsL0QQaSP4&amp;amp;list=RDGMEM6ijAnFTG9nX1G-kbWBUCJAVMb2DpkkCeSCE&amp;amp;index=16">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqsL0QQaSP4&amp;amp;list=RDGMEM6ijAnFTG9nX1G-kbWBUCJAVMb2DpkkCeSCE&amp;amp;index=16</a> &lt;---- SeaFret. Also bonus music vid with Mayse Williams. </p>

<p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-715319141/good-one">https://soundcloud.com/user-715319141/good-one</a>   and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-715319141/voice0021">https://soundcloud.com/user-715319141/voice0021</a> &lt;--- That&#39;s me! They&#39;re just the core ideas, not full songs (I only play my real music live for pals), but those are a couple of things I&#39;m working on now. If anyone likes the themes, feel free to incorporate it in your own stuffs! </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Assembly is a form of creation and always has been. &quot;Originality&quot; has been put as a pedestal not because anything is actually original, but because it makes gatekeeping easier. We can call Led Zeppelin original, but they could be seen as just an amalgamation of ideas that they tweaked just enough for people to consider them original. Embrace assembly, sampling, adaptation (like the Cohen cover you posted) and don&#39;t perpetuate the myth of originality.</p>

<p>Your analogy is poorly thought-out, though. You&#39;re conflating assemblage with mass-production and you&#39;re pretending there isn&#39;t a difference in intent between cookie-cutter real estate and artists who re-contextualize existing works. In fact, most art is assemblage. It&#39;s all building on techniques and history of the art form and possibly others, in order to create a new interpretation.  </p>

    <div class="md"><p>Ayyy conflating is a great word, right? No pretense here, my friend, and I absolutely assure you that I have taken the time to consider my argument to it&#39;s conclusions. It is entirely consistent with my principles. I would say again that you are conflating originality and uniqueness. Further, have you ever considered the origin of the word <em>music</em>?

    <div class="md"><p>If you want true originality look towards the rare artists who actually challenge traditional conceptions of what music is. Graham Lambkin&#39;s solo work immediately comes to mind (as does much of what he puts out on his own Kye Records imprint) and in a way vastly different from, say, the Noise scene. His work is intellectually challenging on a conceptual level where you might find yourself asking &quot;is what I&#39;m listening to actually the product of a musician?&quot; The answer is yes but you need to have a broad understanding of what &quot;music&quot; can be... so maybe getting into Noise first would be easier, now that I think about it :)</p>

<p>Hollywood and the music industry are using music to promote what they want and that&#39;s why it&#39;s shitty. There is an unlimited source of good underground music of all genres that have good musical qualities. So fuck off and stop listening to the radio.</p>

<p>Many many musicians have said they sold their soul? Ok what about actors, factory workers, pencil pushers, etc.. I sold my soul because I have to practice 6 hours a day :c</p>

Music has universal themes in the Natural World and indiginous tribes,  Love sex power death fear war mystical. This is why its normal and natural to give artistic value to negative or aggresive music.

    <div class="md"><p>Well since I&#39;m a guitar player, the example I would use is Yngwie Malmsteen. He is in the neoclassical guitar category. He uses harmonic minor almost exclusively. He also uses alot of diminished scales sprinkled in. Back when he burst onto the scene, there weren&#39;t really any rock guitar virtuosos. People were arguing over Eddie Van Halen vs Randy Rhoads.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example of his guitar mastery, using scales and modes rock guitar players weren&#39;t using yet :</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Hey it&#39;s me.  :)</p>

<p>It is interesting is that Hermeticism has a very similar creation story as the Bible:</p>

<p><a href="http://gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/TGH-v2/th202.html">http://gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/TGH-v2/th202.html</a></p>

<p>This text is thought to have been written within a few hundred years of the Bible.</p>

<p>Aleister Crowley founded the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn.  The Kybalion is a Hermetic text published at a Masonic lodge.  Hermes Trismegistus represents Thoth (Egypt), Hermes (Greek), and Mercury (Roman).  I believe that all three of those religions are different forms of the original mystery religion with Hermes Trismegistus connecting similar gods in each religion.</p>

<p>The Kybalion has a section on vibration and states that everything is a vibration:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/kyb/kyb11.htm">http://www.sacred-texts.com/eso/kyb/kyb11.htm</a></p>

<p>I believe that Hermeticism is part of the New Age movement with its connections to the Theosophical Society.</p>

<p>I just wanted you to be aware of this as these may well be beliefs of the Luciferians and not Christians.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I think someone may have mentioned it, but the Laurel Canyon conspiracy is fascinating. Dave Mcgowan&#39;s book about it made me lose some sleep, even though sometimes I feel like he&#39;s reaching a bit. </p>

<p>Aside from the idea of the all controlling powers that be, it&#39;s not too hard to draw a conclusion that our collective idea of the spectrum of mainstream musical possibilities is very limited. If all you ever hear is gangbanger jams blasted out at you, it doesn&#39;t even matter if there&#39;s amazing rap music; that&#39;s all you know and anything outside of that is foreign territory. </p>

<p>Also, as a musician who grew up playing in bands, music was what defined and divided us from everyone else. It was the cultural measuring stick. Jocks vs punks, rocknroll vs country. Parents vs children. Divide and conquer.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you drink any jungle medicine, you get sometimes resensitized to all your old musical choices. I along with a lot of people, was listening to dualistic,romantic love obsessed, nihilistic music for most of my life. Repition of lyrics reinforces the unwanted thought patterns. Remember that our brains are garbage in, garbage out. Change up your musical diet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely on board with you. I LOVE music. </p>

<p>Going from rock, to modern rap you can definitely tell a difference.. Rock talks about so many different things, ideas and ways of life, while rap and pop is all the same about getting money, and forcing you to be happy with the beat. </p>

<p>One artist you should definitely look up is Kind Geedorah and listen to Take Me To Your Leader. Very spiritual album, amazing skits, definitely makes me feel...calm. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Back in the 80s, the only really good places to hear EDM was at gay clubs. It wasn&#39;t called EDM. It wasn&#39;t even really called techno. It was just club music.</p>

<p>Raves started in the late 80s. Basically, after the clubs closed, people still wanted to party, so they&#39;d set up after hour parties. Originally, the parties were just for club fans. Lots of gay people, a fair amount of non gay people that hung out with gay people.</p>

<p>Raves started gaining popularity with non gay fans and eventually promoters just started making legal raves where they&#39;d get licenses and hire security and make it like a gig rather than just impromptu parties.</p>

<p>By making it mainstream, it drove out a lot of the originators who started it in the first place to have an escape from the bar hopping plebs.</p>

<p>After it went mainstream, the music evolved fairly quickly into all kinds of sub-genres but the crux is that the music was stolen from the gay friendly counterculture and just turned into another watered down commodity to be sold to 20 something suburban teens.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>I&#39;m at work and could only skim your post but I think I got the gist of it so let me bring up my main issues with what you&#39;re saying:</p>

<p>First, you focus on &quot;popular&quot; music, i.e., that which is part of the mainstream music industry. Mainstream, corporatized music will ALWAYS be a watered-down version of the true innovation that primarily occurs within underground circles. I view artistic/cultural production from a Bourdieusian perspective, i.e., that within the domain of cultural production (groups of musicians/artists/etc.) the primary method of peer-valuation, generally, is &quot;do these producers have autonomy from the dominant capitalist domain?&quot; Stated another way: can these creative individuals express themselves and attain recognition from peers in a subverted economy where being able to produce culture without accepting external/mainstream/corporate financing is viewed as the ideal for success, while giving in to those pressures means you lose legitimacy within the subculture. This is why &quot;selling out&quot; actually means something and matters to members of underground music circles.</p>

<p>However, because these groups of underground artists are able to operative relatively free from the capitalist pressures that exist within mainstream music (i.e., creativity is limited because bands signed to major labels MUST produce a certain number of hit singles per album/time-frame or will be intentionally destroyed/dismantled by their operators) this is where true musical innovation, and the freedom to create, actually exists. As a result of that, major label/mainstream controllers constantly watch what is going on in the underground, looking for 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-generation upstart bands who are not as embedded in the &quot;scene&quot; and would readily sell their watered-down version of underground style to the masses. </p>

<p>Case in point: Nirvana. </p>

<p>The &quot;grunge&quot; phenomenon of the 90s was merely the mainstream face of a burgeoning underground/DIY rock scene that had existed since the 60s yet grew so popular within that domain it ended up being co-opted by the mainstream market. This is why Kurt Cobain used every mainstream interview he had to try to tell other people that his band wasn&#39;t that great and people would be better off listening to the bands who influenced him such as namedropping The Raincoats, covering The Vaselines on the unplugged album, wearing the David Johnston shirt for photo shoots, etc... He was very aware of his band&#39;s position within this emerging mainstream awareness and assimilation of underground culture and used that fame as a platform to try to subvert it and expose the evil of the mainstream institutions that steer popular culture (which did not work, obviously, because people still think that popular &quot;alternative rock&quot; is an actual alternative).</p>

<p>As far as synesthetic/spiritual reactions to music, that is a personal thing, and it is best to understand that popular, corporate institutions are using it in its most banal form to manipulate how you feel and want you to be a passive, disengaged consumer of easily-digestible, watered-down content rather than an engaged and conscientious member of a realm of cultural production that does not rely on them or buying in to their platforms. There is a reason why most underground bands lean left and if I wasn&#39;t so hungover right now I&#39;m sure I would have done a better job explaining this stuff, hopefully this post is not completely incoherent though... </p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if your music is beamed into your brain from God or the Devil to major labels, they want robots with money, not humans with real emotions. That is the conspiracy.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Even if those reading disagree with the spiritual aspects of my post, there is no doubt that music is controlled and it&#39;s all about money.</p>

<p>But is that really even a conspiracy?</p>

<p>I led my post in the direction I did because I feel that&#39;s the conspiracy element of it.</p>

<p>Any idiot would agree music is manipulated, creativity is stifled, and it&#39;s about money.</p>

<p>But not everyone agrees that there is a deeper spiritual aspect to it all...which is why I wrote the post the way I did.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>The main point of the non-canonical Gospel According to Thomas (also the earliest written gospel) is that you do not need a church to form a spiritual relationship with God. This is why you will never read it in any bible. It is why Athanasius excluded it from his list of books to be added to the biblical canon: it removes the power of institutionalized religion which should not have existed in the first place. Church is anti-Christ.</p>

<li>MAJOR KEY
Each key feels different and we have varying degrees of consonance. That is, happy, content, la la la, and so on.</li>
</ol>

<p>Example: KEY OF C. It&#39;s based on a scale staring at C: C D E F G A B C (octave). These correspond to the white keys on keyboard. You start the song on the tonic or C or first tone of the key.</p>

<p>This major scale correspond to chords (groups of notes) made from the notes in the scale. In C we have Cmaj, Dm, Em, Fmaj, G7, Am, Bdim then Cmaj again. The rest of major keys have the same types of chords at that position on the scale. </p>

<p>Modes are based on the chord your playing belonging to that scale. If you don&#39;t know the basics modes won&#39;t make any sense.  </p>

<ol>
<li>MINOR KEY - associated with major scale but it&#39;s three steps down. Another words key of Cmaj = Am; Dmaj = Emin, Amaj = F#m. </li>
</ol>

<p>Each key feels differnet have varying degrees of disordance. Sad to angry, and so on. </p>

<p>Each chord of the minor scale has a mode attached to it. Same goes for major scale but you start the song on the minor tone. You start a song in Am on or a variation of Am. You have other scales, variations of the above scales that give you different emotional effects. </p>

<p>Most of the pop songs you hear today have same or similiar chord progressions. Once you determine the major or minor scale (mostly the tone what the song starts on) you can figure out the chords. These are not the only scales, but most of the time you&#39;ll get it.  </p>

<p>This says it all:

    <div class="md"><p>Interesting post.</p>

<p>I think OP is reading way more into it than necessary.</p>

<p>I saw Nirvana like 6 months before they released Nevermind and they weren&#39;t very good. My friends opened for them and there was maybe 50 people max at the show.</p>

<p>Grunge as a genre was never real until it went mainstream. Nirvana was just another punk band and part of the growing underground music scene.</p>

<p>Nirvana&#39;s success was due to them signing a major label contract with Geffen Records.</p>

<p>Geffen Records is now owned by Universal.</p>

<p>There&#39;s 3 major record labels. Universal, Sony, and Warner. Between these 3 labels, they own petty much everything that you hear on the radio or tv, movies, etc...</p>

<p>They have a massive amount of sway on the music industry and they did so by subverting the indie underground scene and turned it stupid.</p>

<p>Old punk was very socio-political. While the quality of the music wasn&#39;t always very good, the message in the music made up for it. Old punk was stoic, combative, positive, introspective, and a lot more.</p>

<p>Grunge was like punks whiny second cousin. It was slightly related but not really. What it did though was undermine the growing punk scene and watered it down by introducing the image to the masses and withholding the substance.</p>

<p>They were never that good. Nevermind was a decent album. The production on it was stellar and way better than what most punk labels could afford to do but that&#39;s because Geffen gave Nirvana a huge advantage by setting them up in a studio, giving them as much time as needed, and pro producers to clean it up.</p>

<p>Other bands like Nirvana didn&#39;t have that. If they went in the studio, it&#39;d be one or 2 days session because it&#39;s all they could afford and it&#39;d generally be mixed by a friend of the band.</p>

<p>Nirvana&#39;s success is due to Geffen giving them access that other bands couldn&#39;t get. Geffen spent a shitload of money promoting them, getting them mentioned in newspapers, rotation air time. Small bands can&#39;t compete with that.</p>

<p>I like Cobain but the band itself wasn&#39;t great. It&#39;s just that they were picked up by professional music selling businessmen who know how to make anyone famous.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Grunge at first was kind of fun. We&#39;d go to the top 40 bars because they&#39;d always give us free booze (club courtesy) and the locals would make fun of us. And then Nirvana came out and all the assholes who gave us shit were suddenly our best friends.</p>

<p>The shit part is that the clubs we were regulars at suddenly got insanely popular with all the people we hated. Jocks from school would show up in their &#39;grunge clothes&#39; and try and get us to get them in because we were mates with all the bouncers and staff and didn&#39;t have to wait in lines like dildos.</p>

<p>The only upside is that we made a lot of cash off those guys.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t forget Diabolus in Musica—the tritone interval once banned by the Church. It found its resurgence in Modern Classical and Metal, each labeled Satanic.</p>

<p>Music is a powerful tool of mind control so it&#39;s no wonder the CIA got involved in the &#39;60s rock scene during MK-ULTRA and most likely the same thing was already happening a generation earlier with the faux counterculture of Jazz music.</p>

<p>Is there anything inherently evil about musical modes and music itself or does it have more to do with the degenerate lyrics and rhythmic hypnosis?</p>

<p>One wonders why the Church has such boring music, while the Devil has the best tunes. But speaking of Grunge and Jesus, I always loved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTlZX6WxXzo">Sunny Day Real Estate</a>.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Why I love them? I&#39;m not sure. TBH I first heard Serotonin while high and fell in love with the space rock vibe. They can play some wicked music and don&#39;t get me started on Johnny&#39;s voice! They combine passion with nihilism and even put out a anti racism and Trump song called Viper Strike. I grew up on Fallout Boy so I like a bit of snark and sass in my music. The song you linked, Little One, the &#39;I don&#39;t care about anything at all&#39; comes from the fact he fucked up and his girl left. It&#39;s a break up song. (I am in no way saying that invalidates your post) </p>

<p>I got to see them in concert early this year, it was pretty amazing. </p>
