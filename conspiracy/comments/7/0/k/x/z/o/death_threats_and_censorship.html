       The only conclusion is that those running YouTube are in on these death threats and are acting as a liaison for the Italian Mafia and other criminal entities and I am going to respond accordingly.

       For exposing their plots including plots against other mafia factions that have caused internal conflicts and deaths. That is just one reason. Another reason being that I expose them in the public. While most talk about Freemasons, Illuminati, and Zionists I bring the mafia to peoples attention. The mafia demands omerta and that includes non members. I also just exposed one of their human trafficking networks.

       Or somebody in the admin technical support chain is working for [whomever]. Doesn't necessarily mean that all of YouTube and Google are compromised on a personnel level; just on a functional level. I wonder if people could track down who, within the organization, might have this sort of access? No doxing, of course, but a few well-placed PMs could be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
       Why do you suspect Italian Mafia in particular? I could see any number of groups being pissed at you. A badge of honor, sure, but also a target.

       Gianluigi Aponte is an Italian billionaire residing in Geneva Switzerland and owns Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) which is the second largest shipping company in the world. Gianluigi Aponte was born in Naples and is worth around 6 billion. His son Diego Aponte is the President and CEO of MSC. Gianluigi Aponte was awarded the Neapolitan Excellence in the World title in 2009 by the former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Silvio Berlusconi has been tied with La Cosa Nostra in various ways and was a member of the P2 Masonic Lodge in Italy known for being a "shadow government" involved with political corruption connected with media, banking, mafia, intelligence agencies, and the Vatican. Another member of P2 was Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV of Savoy who is the Prince of Naples just as Gianluigi Aponte was born in Naples. The House of Savoy also ruled over Geneva Switzerland and have a residence there today where Gianluigi Aponte lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       Prince Vittorio also has direct ties with organized crime as he has been charged with murder, exploitation of prostitution, and corruption involving a gambling racket with slot machines. Prince Vittorio got off on all these charges. Camorra is a large international crime syndicate with various clans like the Nuvoletta Mafia operating out of Naples and they are involved in smuggling and even human trafficking as well as other criminal activities. The Letta family with Enrico Letta and Gianni Letta are Italian politicians tied with Sivlio Berlusconi and appear to be connected with the Nuvoletta Camorra mafia clan. In recent years the Sicilian Mafia have been caught involved in trafficking Africans into Italy and Europe and then extorting them. The MSC is relevant because it is covertly working with some high level mafias and involved with drugs, weapons, and human trafficking. Recently in 2017 MSC purchased 49% of Ignazio Messina &amp; C. which is a Genova based shipping and container company. Pontus was a Greek name for bridge and also for sea and specifically the Mediterranean Sea. Through their control over ports they are able to bridge their criminal networks together.

       When I get top comments on YouTube videos they sometimes pay off the people that run the channels to delete the video. They did this on Infowars articles too where I had top comments. Then they just blocked my IP address. The House of Windsor are also very much involved in financing censorship.

       Pulling up in a nice car with the license plates removed from the car while putting on a ski mask were the first signs. The man had a military presence as well and nothing like the junkies or gang bangers that have attempted to rob me in the past.

       That's true. Tbh, I'm surprised nobody has called us out on it before. You're all harping about secret societies and lies and scandal, when all you had to do was ask at any Masonic lodge around the country - we would have walked you thorough our satanic plan for world domination. Im personally the one that hired that paramilitary hit man - but as one of the most powerful world organizations behind the curtains, we certainly accepted "he had a gun and I got scared" as reasoning for him not finishing the job. A highly paid mercenary with military training does that all the time. Also, pulling up outside the store and donning a ski mask is the preferred method of removing you pesky little youtube warriors. In fact, we have a whole division focussed on failing in assassination attempts.
      </p>
      <p>
       Personally, (and I'm no longer being sarcastic or rude here..) I think you may have a mental issue that needs to be worked out. I highly recommend finding a well respected psychiatrist to talk to.

       You are a conspiracy site which has many top posts about pizzagate, pedophiles, and satanic cults and you are specifically targeting me out of the hundreds on here because I am exposing the Italian mafia which traffic children. Just wanted to point that out and also bring up that you calling me crazy to defend the human trafficking Italian mafia that sell underage prostitutes to criminals and satanic cult members.

       Not at all. Im not defending anyone. Im simply stating that the facts are: either the mafia is singling you out for posting possibly true possibly false information on youtube, OR you have an undiagnosed mental illness that is making you see enemies in the woodwork and forcing you to come to the conclusion that you are important enough to some faceless someone somewhere to go to the lengths of hiring a "paramilitary assassin" to silence you, failing in his job and just deciding to leave you alone.
      </p>
      <p>
       I know which one I believe to be more likely. I was genuinely offering you my opinion, with the hopes that you would take it to heart and possibly improve your life. Paranoia is a terrible thing, there's lots of real things to be paranoid about. I'm not "singling you out" based on your theories about the mafia. That is not what I said. I'm stating that if someone that powerful wanted you dead to the point of sending an assassin after you, I find it highly doubtful that one failed attempt would push them to say "screw it, I'll leave him alone." with all the methods and money at their disposal if what you say about them is true, I find it extremely hard to believe that an up front attack at your place of work would be the end of their vendetta.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not once have I ever insulted you, called you a child molester or a pedophile. And I feel like throwing those accusations around to someone on an internet forum who doesn't buy your story to be a complete and total undermining of the real problem and the real people who are doing real harm in this world.
      </p>
      <p>
       Not believing your story =/= pedophile Mafioso.
