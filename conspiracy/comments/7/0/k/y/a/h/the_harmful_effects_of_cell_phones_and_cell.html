<p>Our predecessor <a href="/r/emfeffects">/r/emfeffects</a> was taken over in <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a>. Hence, I created <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a>. One and a half  years later, <a href="/r/electromagnetics">/r/electromagnetics</a> is still at risk. Three mods became inactive on Reddit this summer and were demoded. <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a> requires mods to post or comment anywhere on Reddit at least every 60 days. </p>

<p>The past several years, Top Minds of Reddit brigade has been systematically taking over holistic health subs. The brigade removes all posts. Examples are <a href="/r/moosearchives">/r/moosearchives</a> and <a href="/r/NaturalHealthGuide">/r/NaturalHealthGuide</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61mika/remember_umoose_his_archive_subreddit_was_taken/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/61mika/remember_umoose_his_archive_subreddit_was_taken/</a></p>

<p>Last year <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> was taken over by Top Minds of Reddit brigade. They removed posts on harmful effects of electromagnetic fields. The brigadier who took the sub over deleted his account this year. <a href="/r/neurology">/r/neurology</a> was again taken over in <a href="/r/redditrequest">/r/redditrequest</a>.</p>

<p>The brigade has also destroyed the subs they take over by making them private. For example, <a href="/r/naturopathy">/r/naturopathy</a>, <a href="/r/holistichealth">/r/holistichealth</a> and <a href="/r/health24">/r/health24</a>. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4dqzmk/rtopmindsofreddit_brigade_takes_over_4_health/">https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/4dqzmk/rtopmindsofreddit_brigade_takes_over_4_health/</a></p>

<p>Most recent take over was eleven months ago. <a href="/r/NaturalHealthGuide">/r/NaturalHealthGuide</a> was taken by <a href="/u/dtiftw">/u/dtiftw</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/57ais4/requesting_rnaturalhealthguide_no_mod_being_used/">https://www.reddit.com/r/redditrequest/comments/57ais4/requesting_rnaturalhealthguide_no_mod_being_used/</a></p>

<p>Submission history of <a href="/u/dtiftw">/u/dtiftw</a> contains several posts in <a href="/r/topmindsofreddit">/r/topmindsofreddit</a>. For example:</p>

<p>Conspiracy is celebrating Earth Day a little late by recycling creative writing masquerading as a shill confession.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/4gd5no/conspiracy_is_celebrating_earth_day_a_little_late">https://www.reddit.com/r/TopMindsOfReddit/comments/4gd5no/conspiracy_is_celebrating_earth_day_a_little_late</a></p>

<p>Top Mind falls for anti-corporate propaganda. The truth is unsurprisingly downvoted</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Understanding that non-ionizing microwaves have an effect on living organisms doesn&#39;t mean rejecting the technology altogether, or renouncing wireless communications.</p>

<p>Did you know X-Ray machines <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoe-fitting_fluoroscope">were used</a> in nearly every upscale shoe store for nearly fifty years? To make sure the shoes fitted properly. Growing awareness of radiation hazards meant they were phased out - that doesn&#39;t mean rejecting the usage of X-Rays altogether.</p>

<p>Switzerland enforces a legal limit of 4 V/m for GSM900 installations, 6 V/m for GSM1800 and UMTS. In the EU these values are 41,9 V/m and 58,1 V/m respectively (i.e. an order of magnitude higher). Yet mobile phones seem to work perfectly fine in Switzerland.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>No it&#39;s not, I wrote it especially for you.</p>

<p>This thread is about non-ionizing radiation, in case you didn&#39;t notice. </p>

<p>The inverse square law means distance plays a critical role (logarithmically so). It doesn&#39;t mean EM fields magically disappear or something. Your phone still needs to transmit powerfully enough to communicate with a distant cell tower (which may be as dozens of meters away). If anything the inverse square law should allow you to understand how much more EM power your brain is absorbing if you stick an emitter against it.</p>

<p>As a scientist I don&#39;t believe this question to be anti-scientific. Why are there limits and regulations if this doesn&#39;t matter? Why does the WHO even bother?</p>

<p>Frankly I think you just learned the word luddism and are trying it out. It&#39;s OK, you got the definition right, you have my authorization to use it in real life. Try it in another context though, it&#39;ll be less prone to ridicule.</p>

    <div class="md"><p>Directly from <a href="http://www.who.int/peh-emf/publications/facts/fs296/en/">the WHO conclusions on EHS:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Considerable heterogeneity exists in the criteria used by the researchers to identify IEI-EMF, due to explicit differences in their conceptual frameworks. Further work is required to produce consensus criteria not only for research purposes but also for use in clinical practice.
WHO has no reason to update it, the science behind non-ionising radiation&#39;s effect on the human body has been clear for decades.
Even a cursory understanding of the inverse-square law and wave propagation shows how absurd the theory that you could damage a person at a distance is. The amount of power a transmitter would require to produce a negative effect from afar is beyond the limits of practicality due to free space path loss (<a href="http://www.giangrandi.ch/electronics/anttool/tx-field.shtml">here is a good calculator to demonstrate for yourself</a>). Not to mention it would be the single loudest and most detectable thing on the airwaves, me and other SDR/HAM junkies would be able to detect such a high dB broadcast, likely worldwide.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is an unfortunate side effect of the power of the internet, it&#39;s a great platform to democratize information and make connections with the outside world, but it is also a means for delusional people to reinforce each other&#39;s delusions and not seek professional mental health treatment.
I mean what we are talking about is textbook paranoid schizophrenia, persecutory delusions that are usually accompanied by perceptual disturbances. You&#39;d hope having <a href="https://nyti.ms/1TYYfg0">journalists, as established as the New York Times, cover the issue</a> would inspire some of these folks to better themselves and enter treatment. You&#39;d also hope that it would wake up the people that aren&#39;t afflicted, but goad those that are, into ceasing negatively impacting the mental health of people entering into an echo-chamber of reinforced delusion.</p>
